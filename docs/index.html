<p>Background: A smartphone is a promising tool for daily cardiovascular
measurement and mental stress monitoring. A smartphone camera-based
PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and a low-cost thermal camera can be used to create
cheap, convenient and mobile monitoring systems. However, to ensure reliable
monitoring results, a person has to remain still for several minutes while a
measurement is being taken. This is very cumbersome and makes its use in
real-life mobile situations quite impractical.
</p>
<p>Objective: We propose a system which combines PPG and thermography with the
aim of improving cardiovascular signal quality and capturing stress responses
quickly.
</p>
<p>Methods: Using a smartphone camera with a low cost thermal camera added on,
we built a novel system which continuously and reliably measures two different
types of cardiovascular events: i) blood volume pulse and ii)
vasoconstriction/dilation-induced temperature changes of the nose tip. 17
healthy participants, involved in a series of stress-inducing mental workload
tasks, measured their physiological responses to stressors over a short window
of time (20 seconds) immediately after each task. Participants reported their
level of perceived mental stress using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). We
used normalized K-means clustering to reduce interpersonal differences in the
self-reported ratings. For the instant stress inference task, we built novel
low-level feature sets representing variability of cardiovascular patterns. We
then used the automatic feature learning capability of artificial Neural
Networks (NN) to improve the mapping between the extracted set of features and
the self-reported ratings. We compared our proposed method with existing
hand-engineered features-based machine learning methods.
</p>
<p>Results, Conclusions: ... due to limited space here, we refer to our
manuscript.

<p>Time irreversibility (temporal asymmetry) is one of fundamental properties
that characterize the nonlinearity of complex dynamical processes, and our
brain is a typical complex dynamical system manifested with nonlinearity. Two
subtraction-based parameters, Ys and X2, are employed to measure the
probabilistic differences of permutations instead of raw vectors for the
simplified quantification of time irreversibility, which is validated by
chaotic and reversible processes and the surrogate data. We show that it is
equivalent to quantify time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic
difference between the forward and its backward processes and between the
symmetric permutations. And we detect time irreversibility of two groups of
epileptic EEGs, from the Nanjing General Hospital (NJGH) and from the public
Bonn epileptic database. In our contribution, the manifestation of nonlinearity
of whether healthy or diseased brain electrical activities is highlighted, and
the highest time irreversibility of epileptic EEG during seizures is
demonstrated. NJGH epileptic EEGs during seizure-free intervals of have lower
time irreversibility than the control data while those of the Bonn data sets
have higher nonlinearity than the healthy brain electrical activities. For the
inconsistent results, we conduct multi-scale analysis and elucidate from the
circadian rhythms in epileptic nonlinearity, however, more targeted researches
are needed to verify our assumptions or to determine if there are other reasons
leading to the inconsistency.

<p>by Mehrdad Salmasi, Alex Loebel, Stefan Glasauer, Martin Stemmler</p>

The release of neurotransmitters from synapses obeys complex and stochastic dynamics. Depending on the recent history of synaptic activation, many synapses depress the probability of releasing more neurotransmitter, which is known as synaptic depression. Our understanding of how synaptic depression affects the information efficacy, however, is limited. Here we propose a mathematically tractable model of both synchronous spike-evoked release and asynchronous release that permits us to quantify the information conveyed by a synapse. The model transits between discrete states of a communication channel, with the present state depending on many past time steps, emulating the gradual depression and exponential recovery of the synapse. Asynchronous and spontaneous releases play a critical role in shaping the information efficacy of the synapse. We prove that depression can enhance both the information rate and the information rate per unit energy expended, provided that synchronous spike-evoked release depresses less (or recovers faster) than asynchronous release. Furthermore, we explore the theoretical implications of short-term synaptic depression adapting on longer time scales, as part of the phenomenon of metaplasticity. In particular, we show that a synapse can adjust its energy expenditure by changing the dynamics of short-term synaptic depression without affecting the net information conveyed by each successful release. Moreover, the optimal input spike rate is independent of the amplitude or time constant of synaptic depression. We analyze the information efficacy of three types of synapses for which the short-term dynamics of both synchronous and asynchronous release have been experimentally measured. In hippocampal autaptic synapses, the persistence of asynchronous release during depression cannot compensate for the reduction of synchronous release, so that the rate of information transmission declines with synaptic depression. In the calyx of Held, the information rate per release remains constant despite large variations in the measured asynchronous release rate. Lastly, we show that dopamine, by controlling asynchronous release in corticostriatal synapses, increases the synaptic information efficacy in nucleus accumbens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vhPcXTPWKXs" width="1" />

N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most abundant methylation, existing in &gt;25% of human mRNAs. Exciting recent discoveries indicate the close involvement of m<sup>6</sup>A in regulating many different aspects of mRNA metabolism and diseases like cancer. However, our current knowledge about how m<sup>6</sup>A levels are controlled and whether and how regulation of m<sup>6</sup>A levels of a specific gene can play a role in cancer and other diseases is mostly elusive. We propose in this paper a computational scheme for predicting m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated genes and m<sup>6</sup>A-associated disease, which includes Deep-m<sup>6</sup>A, the first model for detecting condition-specific m<sup>6</sup>A sites from MeRIP-Seq data with a single base resolution using deep learning and Hot-m<sup>6</sup>A, a new network-based pipeline that prioritizes functional significant m<sup>6</sup>A genes and its associated diseases using the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and gene-disease heterogeneous networks. We applied Deep-m<sup>6</sup>A and this pipeline to 75 MeRIP-seq human samples, which produced a compact set of 709 functionally significant m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated genes and nine functionally enriched subnetworks. The functional enrichment analysis of these genes and networks reveal that m<sup>6</sup>A targets key genes of many critical biological processes including transcription, cell organization and transport, and cell proliferation and cancer-related pathways such as Wnt pathway. The m<sup>6</sup>A-associated disease analysis prioritized five significantly associated diseases including leukemia and renal cell carcinoma. These results demonstrate the power of our proposed computational scheme and provide new leads for understanding m<sup>6</sup>A regulatory functions and its roles in diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tnIdvfV3wQE" width="1" />

A growing body of evidence highlights the importance of the cellular microenvironment as a regulator of phenotypic and functional cellular responses to perturbations. We have previously developed cell patterning techniques to control population context parameters, and here we demonstrate context-explorer (CE), a software tool to improve investigation cell fate acquisitions through community level analyses. We demonstrate the capabilities of CE in the analysis of human and mouse pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs, mPSCs) patterned in colonies of defined geometries in multi-well plates. CE employs a density-based clustering algorithm to identify cell colonies. Using this automatic colony classification methodology, we reach accuracies comparable to manual colony counts in a fraction of the time, both in micropatterned and unpatterned wells. Classifying cells according to their relative position within a colony enables statistical analysis of spatial organization in protein expression within colonies. When applied to colonies of hPSCs, our analysis reveals a radial gradient in the expression of the transcription factors SOX2 and OCT4. We extend these analyses to colonies of different sizes and shapes and demonstrate how the metrics derived by CE can be used to asses the patterning fidelity of micropatterned plates. We have incorporated a number of features to enhance the usability and utility of CE. To appeal to a broad scientific community, all of the software’s functionality is accessible from a graphical user interface, and convenience functions for several common data operations are included. CE is compatible with existing image analysis programs such as CellProfiler and extends the analytical capabilities already provided by these tools. Taken together, CE facilitates investigation of spatially heterogeneous cell populations for fundamental research and drug development validation programs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZCy9eTHmCXw" width="1" />

<p>The evolution of species-specific song patterns is a driving force in the speciation of acoustic communicating insects. It must be closely linked to adaptations of the neuronal network controlling the underlying singing motor activity. What are the cellular and network properties that allow generating different songs? In five cricket species, we analyzed the structure and activity of the identified abdominal ascending opener interneuron, a homologous key component of the singing central pattern generator. The structure of the interneuron, based on the position of the cell body, ascending axon, dendritic arborization pattern, and dye coupling, is highly similar across species. The neuron's spike activity shows a tight coupling to the singing motor activity. In all species, current injection into the interneuron drives artificial song patterns, highlighting the key functional role of this neuron. However, the pattern of the membrane depolarization during singing, the fine dendritic and axonal ramifications, and the number of dye-coupled neurons indicate species-specific adaptations of the neuronal network that might be closely linked to the evolution of species-specific singing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A fundamental question in evolutionary neuroscience is how species-specific behaviors arise in closely related species. We demonstrate behavioral, neurophysiological, and morphological evidence for homology of one key identified interneuron of the singing central pattern generator in five cricket species. Across-species differences of this interneuron are also observed, which might be important to the generation of the species-specific song patterns. This work offers a comprehensive and detailed comparative analysis addressing the neuronal basis of species-specific behavior.</p>

<p>The ability to detect moving objects is an ethologically salient function. Direction-selective neurons have been identified in the retina, thalamus, and cortex of many species, but their homology has remained unclear. For instance, it is unknown whether direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) exist in primates and, if so, whether they are the equivalent to mouse and rabbit DSGCs. Here, we used a molecular/circuit approach in both sexes to address these issues. In mice, we identify the transcription factor Satb2 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2) as a selective marker for three RGC types: On–Off DSGCs encoding motion in either the anterior or posterior direction, a newly identified type of Off-DSGC, and an Off-sustained RGC type. In rabbits, we find that expression of Satb2 is conserved in On–Off DSGCs; however, it has evolved to include On–Off DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion in addition to anterior and posterior motion. Next, we show that macaque RGCs express Satb2 most likely in a single type. We used rabies virus-based circuit-mapping tools to reveal the identity of macaque Satb2-RGCs and discovered that their dendritic arbors are relatively large and monostratified. Together, these data indicate Satb2-expressing On–Off DSGCs are likely not present in the primate retina. Moreover, if DSGCs are present in the primate retina, it is unlikely that they express Satb2.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to detect object motion is a fundamental feature of almost all visual systems. Here, we identify a novel marker for retinal ganglion cells encoding directional motion that is evolutionarily conserved in mice and rabbits, but not in primates. We show in macaque monkeys that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that express this marker comprise a single type and are morphologically distinct from mouse and rabbit direction-selective RGCs. Our findings indicate that On–Off direction-selective retinal neurons may have evolutionarily diverged in primates and more generally provide novel insight into the identity and organization of primate parallel visual pathways.</p>

<p>Sulfatides and gangliosides are raft-associated glycolipids essential for maintaining myelinated nerve integrity. Mice deficient in sulfatide (cerebroside sulfotransferase knock-out, <i>CST</i><sup>–/–</sup>) or complex gangliosides (β-1,4-<i>N</i>-acetylegalactosaminyltransferase1 knock-out, <i>GalNAc-T</i><sup>–/–</sup>) display prominent disorganization of proteins at the node of Ranvier (NoR) in early life and age-dependent neurodegeneration. Loss of neuronal rather than glial complex gangliosides underpins the <i>GalNAc-T</i><sup>–/–</sup> phenotype, as shown by neuron- or glial-specific rescue, whereas sulfatide is principally expressed and functional in glial membranes. The similarities in NoR phenotype of <i>CST</i><sup>–/–</sup>, <i>GalNAc-T</i><sup>–/–</sup>, and axo–glial protein-deficient mice suggests that these glycolipids stabilize membrane proteins including neurofascin155 (NF155) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) at axo–glial junctions. To assess the functional interactions between sulfatide and gangliosides, <i>CST</i><sup>–/–</sup> and <i>GalNAc-T</i><sup>–/–</sup> genotypes were interbred. <i>CST</i><sup>–/–</sup><font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> <i>GalNAc-T</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice develop normally to postnatal day 10 (P10), but all die between P20 and P25, coinciding with peak myelination. Ultrastructural, immunohistological, and biochemical analysis of either sex revealed widespread axonal degeneration and disruption to the axo–glial junction at the NoR. In addition to sulfatide-dependent loss of NF155, <i>CST</i><sup>–/–</sup> <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> <i>GalNAc-T</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibited a major reduction in MAG protein levels in CNS myelin compared with WT and single-lipid-deficient mice. The <i>CST</i><sup>–/–</sup> <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> <i>GalNAc-T</i><sup>–/–</sup> phenotype was fully restored to that of <i>CST</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice by neuron-specific expression of complex gangliosides, but not by their glial-specific expression nor by the global expression of <i>a</i>-series gangliosides. These data indicate that sulfatide and complex <i>b</i>-series gangliosides on the glial and neuronal membranes, respectively, act in concert to promote NF155 and MAG in maintaining the stable axo–glial interactions essential for normal nerve function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sulfatides and complex gangliosides are membrane glycolipids with important roles in maintaining nervous system integrity. Node of Ranvier maintenance in particular requires stable compartmentalization of multiple membrane proteins. The axo–glial adhesion molecules neurofascin155 (NF155) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) require membrane microdomains containing either sulfatides or complex gangliosides to localize and function effectively. The cooperative roles of these microdomains and associated proteins are unknown. Here, we show vital interdependent roles for sulfatides and complex gangliosides because double (but not single) deficiency causes a rapidly lethal phenotype at an early age. These findings suggest that sulfatides and complex gangliosides on opposing axo–glial membranes are responsible for essential tethering of the axo–glial junction proteins NF155 and MAG, which interact to maintain the nodal complex.</p>

<p>Control of neuronal precursor cell proliferation is essential for normal brain development, and deregulation of this fundamental developmental event contributes to brain diseases. Typically, neuronal precursor cell proliferation extends over long periods of time during brain development. However, how neuronal precursor proliferation is regulated in a temporally specific manner remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that conditional KO of the transcriptional regulator SnoN in cerebellar granule neuron precursors robustly inhibits the proliferation of these cells and promotes their cell cycle exit at later stages of cerebellar development in the postnatal male and female mouse brain. In laser capture microdissection followed by RNA-Seq, designed to profile gene expression specifically in the external granule layer of the cerebellum, we find that SnoN promotes the expression of cell proliferation genes and concomitantly represses differentiation genes in granule neuron precursors <i>in vivo</i>. Remarkably, bioinformatics analyses reveal that SnoN-regulated genes contain binding sites for the transcription factors N-myc and Pax6, which promote the proliferation and differentiation of granule neuron precursors, respectively. Accordingly, we uncover novel physical interactions of SnoN with N-myc and Pax6 in cells. In behavior analyses, conditional KO of SnoN impairs cerebellar-dependent learning in a delayed eye-blink conditioning paradigm, suggesting that SnoN-regulation of granule neuron precursor proliferation bears functional consequences at the organismal level. Our findings define a novel function and mechanism for the major transcriptional regulator SnoN in the control of granule neuron precursor proliferation in the mammalian brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study reports the discovery that the transcriptional regulator SnoN plays a crucial role in the proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors in the postnatal mouse brain. Conditional KO of SnoN in granule neuron precursors robustly inhibits the proliferation of these cells and promotes their cycle exit specifically at later stages of cerebellar development, with biological consequences of impaired cerebellar-dependent learning. Genomics and bioinformatics analyses reveal that SnoN promotes the expression of cell proliferation genes and concomitantly represses cell differentiation genes <i>in vivo</i>. Although SnoN has been implicated in distinct aspects of the development of postmitotic neurons, this study identifies a novel function for SnoN in neuronal precursors in the mammalian brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/3?rss=1">The Cognitive Thalamus as a Gateway to Mental Representations</a></h4>

<p>Historically, the thalamus has been viewed as little more than a relay, simply transferring information to key players of the cast, the cortex and hippocampus, without providing any unique functional contribution. In recent years, evidence from multiple laboratories researching different thalamic nuclei has contradicted this idea of the thalamus as a passive structure. Dated models of thalamic functions are being pushed aside, revealing a greater and far more complex contribution of the thalamus for cognition. In this <i>Viewpoints</i> article, we show how recent data support novel views of thalamic functions that emphasize integrative roles in cognition, ranging from learning and memory to flexible adaption. We propose that these apparently separate cognitive functions may indeed be supported by a more general role in shaping mental representations. Several features of thalamocortical circuits are consistent with this suggested role, and we highlight how divergent and convergent thalamocortical and corticothalamic pathways may complement each other to support these functions. Furthermore, the role of the thalamus for subcortical integration is highlighted as a key mechanism for maintaining and updating representations. Finally, we discuss future areas of research and stress the importance of incorporating new experimental findings into existing knowledge to continue developing thalamic models. The presence of thalamic pathology in a number of neurological conditions reinforces the need to better understand the role of this region in cognition.</p>

<p>Neuronal hyperexcitability is one of the major characteristics of fragile X syndrome (FXS), yet the molecular mechanisms of this critical dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here we report a major role of voltage-independent potassium (K<sup>+</sup>)-channel dysfunction in hyperexcitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out (KO) mice. We observed a reduction of voltage-independent small conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) currents in both male and female mice, leading to decreased action potential (AP) threshold and reduced medium afterhyperpolarization. These SK-channel-dependent deficits led to markedly increased AP firing and abnormal input–output signal transmission of CA3 pyramidal neurons. The SK-current defect was mediated, at least in part, by loss of FMRP interaction with the SK channels (specifically the SK2 isoform), without changes in channel expression. Intracellular application of selective SK-channel openers or a genetic reintroduction of an N-terminal FMRP fragment lacking the ability to associate with polyribosomes normalized all observed excitability defects in CA3 pyramidal neurons of <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. These results suggest that dysfunction of voltage-independent SK channels is the primary cause of CA3 neuronal hyperexcitability in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice and support the critical translation-independent role for the fragile X mental retardation protein as a regulator of neural excitability. Our findings may thus provide a new avenue to ameliorate hippocampal excitability defects in FXS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite two decades of research, no effective treatment is currently available for fragile X syndrome (FXS). Neuronal hyperexcitability is widely considered one of the hallmarks of FXS. Excitability research in the FXS field has thus far focused primarily on voltage-gated ion channels, while contributions from voltage-independent channels have been largely overlooked. Here we report that voltage-independent small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK)-channel dysfunction causes hippocampal neuron hyperexcitability in the FXS mouse model. Our results support the idea that translation-independent function of fragile X mental retardation protein has a major role in regulating ion-channel activity, specifically the SK channels, in hyperexcitability defects in FXS. Our findings may thus open a new direction to ameliorate hippocampal excitability defects in FXS.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/18?rss=1">An Alternative Exon of CAPS2 Influences Catecholamine Loading into LDCVs of Chromaffin Cells</a></h4>

<p>The calcium-dependent activator proteins for secretion (CAPS) are priming factors for synaptic and large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), promoting their entry into and stabilizing the release-ready state. A modulatory role of CAPS in catecholamine loading of vesicles has been suggested. Although an influence of CAPS on monoamine transporter function and on vesicle acidification has been reported, a role of CAPS in vesicle loading is disputed. Using expression of naturally occurring splice variants of CAPS2 into chromaffin cells from CAPS1/CAPS2 double-deficient mice of both sexes, we show that an alternative exon of 40 aa is responsible for enhanced catecholamine loading of LDCVs in mouse chromaffin cells. The presence of this exon leads to increased activity of both vesicular monoamine transporters. Deletion of CAPS does not alter acidification of vesicles. Our results establish a splice-variant-dependent modulatory effect of CAPS on catecholamine content in LDCVs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The calcium activator protein for secretion (CAPS) promotes and stabilizes the entry of catecholamine-containing vesicles of the adrenal gland into a release-ready state. Expression of an alternatively spliced exon in CAPS leads to enhanced catecholamine content in chromaffin granules. This exon codes for 40 aa with a high proline content, consistent with an unstructured loop present in the portion of the molecule generally thought to be involved in vesicle priming. CAPS variants containing this exon promote serotonin uptake into Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either vesicular monoamine transporter. Epigenetic tuning of CAPS variants may allow modulation of endocrine adrenaline and noradrenaline release. This mechanism may extend to monoamine release in central neurons or in the enteric nervous system.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/177?rss=1">CTCF Governs the Identity and Migration of MGE-Derived Cortical Interneurons</a></h4>

<p>The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a central regulator of chromatin topology recently linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to identify novel roles of CTCF in the developing mouse brain. We provide evidence that CTCF is required for the expression of the LIM homeodomain factor LHX6 involved in fate determination of cortical interneurons (CINs) that originate in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Conditional <i>Ctcf</i> ablation in the MGE of mice of either sex leads to delayed tangential migration, abnormal distribution of CIN in the neocortex, a marked reduction of CINs expressing parvalbumin and somatostatin (Sst), and an increased number of MGE-derived cells expressing <i>Lhx8</i> and other markers of basal forebrain projection neurons. Likewise, <i>Ctcf</i>-null MGE cells transplanted into the cortex of wild-type hosts generate fewer Sst-expressing CINs and exhibit lamination defects that are efficiently rescued upon reexpression of LHX6. Collectively, these data indicate that CTCF regulates the dichotomy between <i>Lhx6</i> and <i>Lhx8</i> to achieve correct specification and migration of MGE-derived CINs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work provides evidence that CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) controls an early fate decision point in the generation of cortical interneurons mediated at least in part by Lhx6. Importantly, the abnormalities described could reflect early molecular and cellular events that contribute to human neurological disorders previously linked to CTCF, including schizophrenia, autism, and intellectual disability.</p>

<p>How organisms learn the value of single stimuli through experience is well described. In many decisions, however, value estimates are computed "on the fly" by combining multiple stimulus attributes. The neural basis of this computation is poorly understood. Here we explore a common scenario in which decision-makers must combine information about quality and quantity to determine the best option. Using fMRI, we examined the neural representation of quality, quantity, and their integration into an integrated subjective value signal in humans of both genders. We found that activity within inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) correlated with offer quality, while activity in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) specifically correlated with offer quantity. Several brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), were sensitive to an interaction of quality and quantity. However, the ACC was uniquely activated by quality, quantity, and their interaction, suggesting that this region provides a substrate for flexible computation of value from both quality and quantity. Furthermore, ACC signals across subjects correlated with the strength of quality and quantity signals in IFG and IPS, respectively. ACC tracking of subjective value also correlated with choice predictability. Finally, activity in the ACC was elevated for choice trials, suggesting that ACC provides a nexus for the computation of subjective value in multiattribute decision-making.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Would you prefer three apples or two oranges? Many choices we make each day require us to weigh up the quality and quantity of different outcomes. Using fMRI, we show that option quality is selectively represented in the inferior frontal gyrus, while option quantity correlates with areas of the intraparietal sulcus that have previously been associated with numerical processing. We show that information about the two is integrated into a value signal in the anterior cingulate cortex, and the fidelity of this integration predicts choice predictability. Our results demonstrate how on-the-fly value estimates are computed from multiple attributes in human value-based decision-making.</p>

<p>Healthy aging is associated with decreased neural selectivity (dedifferentiation) in category-selective cortical regions. This finding has prompted the suggestion that dedifferentiation contributes to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with this possibility, dedifferentiation has been reported to negatively correlate with fluid intelligence in older adults. Here, we examined whether dedifferentiation is associated with performance in another cognitive domain—episodic memory—that is also highly vulnerable to aging. Given the proposed role of dedifferentiation in age-related cognitive decline, we predicted there would be a stronger link between dedifferentiation and episodic memory performance in older than in younger adults. Young (18–30 years) and older (64–75 years) male and female humans underwent fMRI scanning while viewing images of objects and scenes before a subsequent recognition memory test. We computed a differentiation index in two regions of interest (ROIs): parahippocampal place area (PPA) and lateral occipital complex (LOC). This index quantified the selectivity of the BOLD response to preferred versus nonpreferred category of an ROI (scenes for PPA, objects for LOC). The differentiation index in the PPA, but not the LOC, was lower in older than in younger adults. Additionally, the PPA differentiation index predicted recognition memory performance for the studied items. This relationship was independent of and not moderated by age. The PPA differentiation index also predicted performance on a latent "fluency" factor derived from a neuropsychological test battery; this relationship was also age invariant. These findings suggest that two independent factors, one associated with age, and the other with cognitive performance, influence neural differentiation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging is associated with neural dedifferentiation—reduced neural selectivity in "category-selective" cortical brain regions—which has been proposed to contribute to cognitive aging. Here, we examined whether neural differentiation is predictive of episodic memory performance, and whether the relationship is moderated by age. A neural differentiation index was estimated for scene-selective (PPA) and object-selective (LOC) cortical regions while participants studied images for a subsequent memory test. Age-related reductions were observed for the PPA, but not for the LOC, differentiation index. Importantly, the PPA differentiation index demonstrated age-invariant correlations with subsequent memory performance and a fluency factor derived from a neuropsychological battery. Together, these findings suggest that neural differentiation is associated with two independent factors: age and cognitive performance.</p>

<p>Social life requires people to predict the future: people must anticipate others' thoughts, feelings, and actions to interact with them successfully. The theory of predictive coding suggests that the social brain may meet this need by automatically predicting others' social futures. If so, when representing others' current mental state, the brain should already start representing their future states. To test this hypothesis, we used fMRI to measure female and male human participants' neural representations of mental states. Representational similarity analysis revealed that neural patterns associated with mental states currently under consideration resembled patterns of likely future states more so than patterns of unlikely future states. This effect manifested in activity across the social brain network and in medial prefrontal cortex in particular. Repetition suppression analysis also supported the social predictive coding hypothesis: considering mental states presented in predictable sequences reduced activity in the precuneus relative to unpredictable sequences. In addition to demonstrating that the brain makes automatic predictions of others' social futures, the results also demonstrate that the brain leverages a 3D representational space to make these predictions. Proximity between mental states on the psychological dimensions of rationality, social impact, and valence explained much of the association between state-specific neural pattern similarity and state transition likelihood. Together, these findings suggest that the way the brain represents the social present gives people an automatic glimpse of the social future.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When you see a ball in flight, your brain calculates, not just its static visual features such as size and shape, but also predicts its future trajectory. Here, we investigated whether the same might hold true in the social world: when we see someone flying into a rage, does our brain automatically predict their social trajectory? In this study, we scanned participants' brain activity while they judged others' mental states. We found that neural activity associated with a given state resembled activity associated with likely future states. Additionally, unpredictable sequences of states evoked more brain activity than predictable sequences, consistent with monitoring for, and updating from, prediction errors. These results suggest that the social brain automatically predicts others' future mental states.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/1/125?rss=1">Four Unique Interneuron Populations Reside in Neocortical Layer 1</a></h4>

<p>Sensory perception depends on neocortical computations that contextually adjust sensory signals in different internal and environmental contexts. Neocortical layer 1 (L1) is the main target of cortical and subcortical inputs that provide "top-down" information for context-dependent sensory processing. Although L1 is devoid of excitatory cells, it contains the distal "tuft" dendrites of pyramidal cells (PCs) located in deeper layers. L1 also contains a poorly characterized population of GABAergic interneurons (INs), which regulate the impact that different top-down inputs have on PCs. A poor comprehension of L1 IN subtypes and how they affect PC activity has hampered our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie contextual modulation of sensory processing. We used novel genetic strategies in male and female mice combined with electrophysiological and morphological methods to help resolve differences that were unclear when using only electrophysiological and/or morphological approaches. We discovered that L1 contains four distinct populations of INs, each with a unique molecular profile, morphology, and electrophysiology, including a previously overlooked IN population (named here "canopy cells") representing 40% of L1 INs. In contrast to what is observed in other layers, most L1 neurons appear to be unique to the layer, highlighting the specialized character of the signal processing that takes place in L1. This new understanding of INs in L1, as well as the application of genetic methods based on the markers described here, will enable investigation of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of top-down processing in L1 with unprecedented detail.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neocortical layer 1 (L1) is the main target of corticocortical and subcortical projections that mediate top-down or context-dependent sensory perception. However, this unique layer is often referred to as "enigmatic" because its neuronal composition has been difficult to determine. Using a combination of genetic, electrophysiological, and morphological approaches that helped to resolve differences that were unclear when using a single approach, we were able to decipher the neuronal composition of L1. We identified markers that distinguish L1 neurons and found that the layer contains four populations of GABAergic interneurons, each with unique molecular profiles, morphologies, and electrophysiological properties. These findings provide a new framework for studying the circuit mechanisms underlying the processing of top-down inputs in neocortical L1.</p>

<p>Hair cells transmit mechanical information by converting deflection of the hair bundle into synaptic release of glutamate. We have investigated this process in the lateral line of larval zebrafish (male and female) to understand how stimuli are encoded within a neuromast. Using multiphoton microscopy <i>in vivo</i>, we imaged synaptic release of glutamate using the reporter iGluSnFR as well as deflections of the cupula. We found that the neuromast is composed of a functionally diverse population of hair cells. Half the hair cells signaled cupula motion in both directions from rest, either by increasing glutamate release in response to a deflection in the positive direction or by reducing release in the negative direction. The relationship between cupula deflection and glutamate release demonstrated maximum sensitivity at displacements of just ~40 nm in the positive direction. The remaining hair cells only signaled motion in one direction and were less sensitive, extending the operating range of the neuromast beyond 1 μm. Adaptation of the synaptic output was also heterogeneous, with some hair cells generating sustained glutamate release in response to a steady deflection of the cupula and others generating transient outputs. Finally, a distinct signal encoded a return of the cupula to rest: a large and transient burst of glutamate release from hair cells unresponsive to the initial stimulus. A population of hair cells with these different sensitivities, operating ranges, and adaptive properties will allow the neuromast to encode weak stimuli while maintaining the dynamic range to signal the amplitude and duration of stronger deflections.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hair cells transmit information about mechanical stimuli by converting very small deflections of their hair bundle into changes in the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. We have measured this input/output relation in the live fish using a fluorescent protein and find that different hair cells vary in their mechanical sensitivity and the time course of their response. These variations will allow the fish to sense the timing and duration of both very weak stimuli (~40 nm deflections) and strong stimuli (~1 μm), underlying the ability of the fish to avoid predators and maintain its body position in flowing water.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42129">CtIP forms a tetrameric dumbbell-shaped particle which bridges complex DNA end structures for double-strand break repair</a></h4>

CtIP is involved in the resection of broken DNA during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle for repair by recombination. Acting with the MRN complex, it plays a particularly important role in handling complex DNA end structures by localised nucleolytic processing of DNA termini in preparation for longer range resection. Here we show that human CtIP is a tetrameric protein adopting a dumbbell architecture in which DNA binding domains are connected by long coiled-coils. The protein complex binds two short DNA duplexes with high affinity and bridges DNA molecules <i>in trans</i>. DNA binding is potentiated by dephosphorylation and is not specific for DNA end structures <i>per se</i>. However, the affinity for linear DNA molecules is increased if the DNA terminates with complex structures including forked ssDNA overhangs and nucleoprotein conjugates. This work provides a biochemical and structural basis for the function of CtIP at complex DNA breaks.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41803">ATP-induced asymmetric pre-protein folding as a driver of protein translocation through the Sec machinery</a></h4>

Transport of proteins across membranes is a fundamental process, achieved in every cell by the 'Sec' translocon. In prokaryotes, SecYEG associates with the motor ATPase SecA to carry out translocation for pre-protein secretion. Previously, we proposed a Brownian ratchet model for transport, whereby the free energy of ATP-turnover favours the directional diffusion of the polypeptide [Allen <i>et al. eLife </i>2016]. Here, we show that ATP enhances this process by modulating secondary structure formation within the translocating protein. A combination of molecular simulation with hydrogen-deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal an asymmetry across the membrane: ATP induced conformational changes in the cytosolic cavity promote unfolded pre-protein structure, while the exterior cavity favours its formation. This ability to exploit structure within a pre-protein is an unexplored area of protein transport, which may apply to other protein transporters, such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40836">Synergy between RecBCD subunits is essential for efficient DNA unwinding</a></h4>

The subunits of the bacterial RecBCD act in coordination, rapidly and processively unwinding DNA at the site of a double strand break. RecBCD is able to displace DNA binding proteins, suggesting that it generates high forces, but the specific role of each subunit in the force generation is unclear. Here, we present a novel optical tweezers assay that allows monitoring the activity of RecBCD's individual subunits, when they are part of an intact full complex. We show that RecBCD and its subunits are able to generate forces up to 25-40 pN without a significant effect on their velocity. Moreover, the isolated RecD translocates fast, but is a weak helicase with limited processivity. Experiments at a broad range of [ATP] and forces suggest that RecD unwinds DNA as a Brownian ratchet, rectified by ATP binding, and that the presence of the other subunits shifts the ratchet equilibrium towards the post-translocation state.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40670">RNA-binding proteins distinguish between similar sequence motifs to promote targeted deadenylation by Ccr4-Not</a></h4>

The Ccr4-Not complex removes mRNA poly(A) tails to regulate eukaryotic mRNA stability and translation. RNA-binding proteins contribute to specificity by interacting with both Ccr4-Not and target mRNAs, but this is not fully understood. Here, we reconstitute accelerated and selective deadenylation of RNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) and Pumilio-response elements (PREs). We find that the fission yeast homologues of Tristetraprolin/TTP and Pumilio/Puf (Zfs1 and Puf3) interact with Ccr4-Not via multiple regions within low-complexity sequences, suggestive of a multipartite interface that extends beyond previously defined interactions. Using a two-color assay to simultaneously monitor poly(A) tail removal from different RNAs, we demonstrate that Puf3 can distinguish between RNAs of very similar sequence. Analysis of binding kinetics reveals that this is primarily due to differences in dissociation rate constants. Consequently, motif quality is a major determinant of mRNA stability for Puf3 targets <i>in vivo</i> and can be used for the prediction of mRNA targets.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40520">Functionally defined white matter of the macaque monkey brain reveals a dorso-ventral attention network</a></h4>

Classical studies of attention have identified areas of parietal and frontal cortex as sources of attentional control. Recently, a ventral region in the macaque temporal cortex, the posterior infero-temporal dorsal area PITd, has been suggested as a third attentional control area. This raises the question of whether and how spatially distant areas coordinate a joint focus of attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that parieto-frontal attention areas and PITd are directly interconnected. By combining functional MRI with ex-vivo high-resolution diffusion MRI, we found that PITd and dorsal attention areas are all directly connected through three specific fascicles. These results ascribe a new function, the communication of attention signals, to two known fiber-bundles, highlight the importance of vertical interactions across the two visual streams, and imply that the control of endogenous attention, hitherto thought to reside in macaque dorsal cortical areas, is exerted by a dorso-ventral network.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39694">Chronology of motor-mediated microtubule streaming</a></h4>

We introduce a computer-based simulation model for coarse-grained, effective motor-mediated interaction between microtubule pairs to study the time-scales that compose cytoplasmic streaming. We characterise microtubule dynamics in two-dimensional systems by chronologically arranging five distinct processes of varying duration that make up streaming, from microtubule pairs to collective dynamics. The structures found were polarity sorted due to the propulsion of antialigned microtubules. This also gave rise to the formation of large polar-aligned domains, and streaming at the domain boundaries. Correlation functions, mean squared displacements, and velocity distributions reveal a cascade of processes ultimately leading to microtubule streaming and advection, spanning multiple microtubule lengths. The characteristic times for the processes span over three orders of magnitude from fast single-microtubule processes to slow collective processes. Our approach can be used to directly test the importance of molecular components, such as motors and crosslinking proteins between microtubules, on the collective dynamics at cellular scale.

Neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) of decerebrate cats show three major response patterns when tones of different frequencies and levels are presented to the contralateral ear. The frequency response maps of type I units uniquely exhibit a narrowly tuned I-shaped area of excitation around best frequency (the most sensitive frequency) and flanking regions of inhibition at lower and higher frequencies. Type I units receive ipsilateral inhibition, and show binaural excitatory/inhibitory interactions. Lateral superior olive (LSO) principal cells display a similar receptive field organization and sensitivity to interaural level differences (ILDs) and project directly to the ICC, therefore are supposed to be the dominant source of excitatory input for type I units. To test this hypothesis, the responses of ICC units were compared before and after reversible inactivation of the LSO by injection of the non-specific excitatory amino-acid antagonist kynurenic acid. When excitatory activity within the LSO was blocked, many ICC type I units (~50%) were silenced or showed substantially decreased activitycomparable. By contrast, the responses of the other two ICC unit types were largely unaffected. With regard to the origins of unaffected ICC type I units, evidence indicates that the LSO was inactivated in an incomplete, anisotropic manner, and the monaural and binaural responses of such units are similar to those of affected type I units. Taken together, these results support the interpretation that most type I units are the midbrain components of a functionally segregated ILD processing pathway initiated by the LSO.

In the healthy human brain, the processing of spoken words is strongly left-lateralised, while the processing of complex non-linguistic sounds recruits brain regions bilaterally. Here we asked whether the left anterior temporal lobe, strongly implicated in semantic processing, is critical to this special treatment of linguistic stimuli. Nine patients with semantic dementia (SD) and fourteen age-matched controls underwent magnetoencephalography and structural MRI. Voxel based morphometry demonstrated the stereotypical pattern of SD: severe grey matter loss restricted to the left anterior temporal lobe. During magnetoencephalography, participants listened to word sets in which identity and meaning were ambiguous until utterance completion, for example played vs plate. Whereas left-hemispheric responses were similar across groups, patients demonstrated increased right hemisphere activity 174-294ms after stimulus disambiguation. Source reconstructions confirmed recruitment of right-sided analogues of language regions in SD: atrophy of left anterior temporal lobe was associated with increased activity in right temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus. Moreover only healthy controls had differential responses to words versus non-words in right auditory cortex and planum temporale. Overall, the results indicate that anterior temporal lobe is necessary for normal and efficient processing of word identity in the rest of the language network.

The long-latency reflexive response (LLR) following an upper-limb mechanical disturbance is generated by neural circuitry shared with voluntary control. This feedback response supports many task-dependent behaviours and permits the expression of goal-directed corrections at latencies shorter than voluntary reaction time. An extensive body of literature has demonstrated that the LLR shows flexibility akin to voluntary control, but it has never been tested whether instruction-dependent LLR changes can also occur in the absence of an overt voluntary response. The present study used kinesthetic motor imagery (Experiment 1) and instructed participants to execute a voluntary response in a non-stretched contralateral muscle (Experiment 2) to explore the relationship between the overt production of a voluntary response and LLR facilitation. Activity in stretched right wrist flexors were compared to standard not-intervene and compensate conditions. Our findings revealed that on ~40% of imagery and ~50% of contralateral trials, a partial voluntary response leaked-out into the stretched right wrist flexor muscle. On these leaked trials, the early portion of the LLR (R2) was facilitated and displayed a similar increase to compensate trials. The latter half of the LLR (R3) showed further modulation, mirroring the patterns of voluntary response activity. By contrast, the LLR on non-leaked imagery and contralateral trials did not modulate. We suggest that even though a hastened voluntary response cannot account for all instruction-dependent LLR modulation, the overt execution of a voluntary response in the same muscle(s) as the LLR is a pre-requisite for facilitation of this rapid feedback response.

Sensory thalami are central sensory pathway stations for information processing. Their role for human cognition and perception, however, remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests a specific involvement of the sensory thalami in speech recognition. In particular, the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) response is modulated by speech recognition tasks and the amount of this task-dependent modulation is associated with speech recognition abilities. Here we tested the specific hypothesis that this behaviorally relevant modulation is present in the MGB subsection that corresponds to the primary auditory pathway (i.e., the ventral MGB [vMGB]). We used ultra-high field 7T fMRI to identify the vMGB, and found a significant positive correlation between the amount of task-dependent modulation and the speech recognition performance across participants within left vMGB, but not within the other MGB subsections. These results imply that modulation of thalamic driving input to the auditory cortex facilitates speech recognition.

Cognitive impairment is a primary feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders and there is a need for new therapeutic options. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors modulate cortical dopaminergic function and have been proposed as potential cognitive enhancers. Unfortunately, currently available COMT inhibitors are not good candidates due to either poor blood-brain barrier penetration or severe toxicity. To address the need for safe, brain-penetrant COMT inhibitors, we tested multiple novel COMT inhibitors in a set of preclinical in vivo efficacy assays to determine their viability as potential clinical candidates. We found that multiple COMT inhibitors, exemplified by LIBD-1 and LIBD-3, significantly modulated dopaminergic function measured as decreases in homovanillic acid (HVA) and increases in 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), two dopamine metabolites, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the frontal cortex. Additionally, we found the LIBD-1 significantly improved cognitive flexibility in a rat attentional set-shifting assay (ASST), an effect previously seen with the COMT inhibitor tolcapone. These results demonstrate that LIBD-1 is a novel COMT inhibitor with promising in vivo activity and the potential to serve as a new therapy for cognitive impairment.

Traditional neurobiological theories of musical emotions explain well why extreme music such as punk, hardcore or metal, whose vocal and instrumental characteristics share much similarity with acoustic threat signals, should evoke unpleasant feelings for a large proportion of listeners. Why it doesn't for metal music fans, however, remains a theoretical challenge: metal fans may differ from non-fans in how they process acoustic threat signals at the sub-cortical level, showing deactivated or reconditioned responses that differ from controls. Alternatively, it is also possible that appreciation for metal depends on the inhibition by cortical circuits of a normal low-order response to auditory threat. In a series of three experiments, we show here that, at a sensory level, metal fans actually react equally negatively, equally fast and even more accurately to cues of auditory threat in vocal and instrumental contexts than non-fans. Conversely, cognitive load somewhat appears to reduce fans' appreciation of metal to the level reported by non-fans. Taken together, these results are not compatible with the idea that extreme music lovers do so because of a different low-level response to threat, but rather, highlight a critical contribution of higher-order cognition to the aesthetic experience. These results are discussed in the light of recent higher-order theories of emotional consciousness, which we argue should be generalized to the emotional experience of music across musical genres.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/509943v1?rss=1">Context-specific modulation of intrinsic coupling modes shapes multisensory processing</a></h4>

Intrinsically generated patterns of coupled neuronal activity are associated with the dynamics of specific brain states. Sensory inputs are extrinsic factors that can perturb these intrinsic coupling modes, creating a complex scenario in which forthcoming stimuli are processed. Studying this intrinsic-extrinsic interplay is necessary to better understand perceptual integration and selection. Here, we show that this interplay leads to a reconfiguration of functional cortical connectivity that acts as a mechanism to facilitate stimulus processing. Using audiovisual stimulation in anesthetized ferrets, we found that this reconfiguration of coupling modes is context specific, depending on long-term modulation by repetitive sensory inputs. These reconfigured coupling modes, in turn, lead to changes in latencies and power of local field potential responses that support multisensory integration. Our study demonstrates that this interplay extends across multiple time scales and involves different types of intrinsic coupling. These results suggest a novel large-scale mechanism that facilitates multisensory integration.

A small subset of interneurons that are generated earliest as pioneer neurons are the first cohort of neurons that enter the neocortex. However, it remains largely unclear whether these early-generated interneurons (EGIns) predominantly regulate neocortical circuit formation. Using inducible genetic fate mapping to selectively labeled EGIns and pseudo-random interneurons (pRIns), we found that EGIns exhibited more mature electrophysiological and morphological properties and higher synaptic connectivity than pRIns at early postnatal stages. In addition, when stimulating one cell, the proportion of EGIns that influence spontaneous network synchronization is significantly higher than that of pRIns. Importantly, toxin-mediated ablation of EGIns after birth significantly reduce spontaneous network synchronization and decrease inhibitory synaptic transmission during the first postnatal week. These results suggest that EGIns can shape developing networks and may contribute to the re?nement of neuronal connectivity before the establishment of the adult neuronal circuit.

Recently, exploring brain activity based on functional networks during naturalistic stimuli especially music and video represents an attractive challenge because of the low signal-to-noise ratio in collected brain data. Although most efforts focusing on exploring the listening brain have been made through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), sensor-level electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) technique, little is known about how neural rhythms are involved in the brain network activity under naturalistic stimuli. This study exploited cortical oscillations through analysis of ongoing EEG and musical feature during free-listening to music. We used a data-driven method that combined music information retrieval with spatial Independent Components Analysis (ICA) to probe the interplay between the spatial profiles and the spectral patterns. We projected the sensor data into cortical space using a minimum-norm estimate and applied the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to obtain frequency information. Then, spatial ICA was made to extract spatial-spectral-temporal information of brain activity in source space and five long-term musical features were computationally extracted from the naturalistic stimuli. The spatial profiles of the components whose temporal courses were significantly correlated with musical feature time series were clustered to identify reproducible brain networks across the participants. Using the proposed approach, we found brain networks of musical feature processing are frequency-dependent and three plausible frequency-dependent networks were identified; the proposed method seems valuable for characterizing the large-scale frequency-dependent brain activity engaged in musical feature processing.

Robustly linking dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) states to behaviour is an important goal of the fledgling research using these methods. Here, we demonstrate in an independent dataset that two connectivity states previously linked to arousal and sustained attention are associated with individual differences in vulnerability to sleep deprivation. 32 healthy participants underwent two sets of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, once in a well-rested state and once after a single night of total sleep deprivation. Individual differences in vulnerability to this manipulation were measured using changes in Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) performance. DFC and clustering analysis on the resting state fMRI data revealed five centroids that were highly correlated with those found in previous work, including two states associated with high and low arousal. Changes in these arousal states from the well-rested to the sleep-deprived condition specifically were correlated with changes in PVT performance. Global signal was also correlated with this change in univariate analysis, but was not a significant incremental predictor in a multivariate model. Although head motion increased following sleep deprivation, this did not predict change in PVT performance. Our results provide good evidence of the reliability, validity, and reproducibility of DFC measures, particularly with regard to measuring arousal and attention.

Multi-photon calcium imaging (CaI) is an important tool to assess activity among neural populations within a column in the sensory cortex. However, the complex asymmetrical interactions among neural populations, termed effective connectivity, cannot be directly assessed by measuring the activity of each neuron using CaI but calls for computational modeling. To estimate effective connectivity among neural populations, we proposed a dynamic causal model (DCM) for CaI by combining a convolution-based dynamic neural state model and a dynamic calcium ion concentration model for CaI signals. After conducting a simulation study to evaluate DCM for CaI, we applied it to an experimental CaI data measured at the layer 2/3 of a barrel cortical column that differentially responds to hit and error whisking trails in mice. We first identified neural populations and constructed computational models with intrinsic connectivity of neural populations within the layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex and extrinsic connectivity with latent external modes. Bayesian model inversion and comparison shows that a top-down model with latent inhibitory and excitatory external modes explains the observed CaI signals during hit and error trials better than any other model, with a single external mode or without any latent modes. The best model also showed differential intrinsic and extrinsic effective connectivity between hit and error trials (corresponding to the bottom- up and top-down processes) in the functional hierarchical architecture. Both simulation and experimental results suggest the usefulness of DCM for CaI in terms of exploration of the hierarchical interactions among neural populations observed in CaI.

Many self-initiated, learned, motor sequences begin by repeating a simple movement, like ball-bouncing before a tennis serve, and this repetition is thought to represent motor preparation. Do these simple movements provide real-time sensory feedback used by the brain for getting ready or do they simply reflect internal neural preparatory processes? Here, we addressed this question by examining the introductory notes (INs) that zebra finches repeat before starting their learned song sequence. INs progress from a variable initial state to a stereotyped final state before each song and are thought to represent motor preparation before song. Here, we found that the mean number of INs before song and the progression of INs to song were not affected by removal of two sensory feedback pathways (auditory and proprioceptive). In both feedback-intact and feedback-deprived birds, the presence of calls (other non-song vocalizations), just before the first IN, was correlated with fewer INs before song and an initial state closer to song. Finally, the initial IN state correlated with the time to song initiation. Overall, these results show that INs do not provide real-time sensory feedback for preparing the motor system. Rather, repetition of INs, and possibly, other such simple movements, may reflect the ''current'' state of internal neural preparatory processes involved in getting the brain ready to initiate a learned movement sequence.

Memory formation is crucial for the survival of animals. Here, we study the effect of different crh-1 (C. elegans homolog of mammalian CREB1) mutations on the ability of C. elegans to form long-term memory (LTM). Null mutants in creb1/crh-1 are defective in LTM formation across phyla. We show that specific isoforms of CREB1/CRH-1, CRH-1c and CRH-1e, are primarily responsible for memory related functions of the transcription factor in C. elegans. Silencing of CRH-1e expressing neurons during training for LTM formation abolishes the long-term memory of the animal. Further, CRH-1e expression in RIM or AVE neurons is sufficient to rescue long-term memory defects of creb1/crh-1 null mutants. We show that apart from being LTM defective, creb1/crh-1 null mutant animals show defects in native chemotaxis behavior. We go on to characterize the amino acids K247 and K266 as responsible for the LTM related functions of CREB1/CRH-1 while being dispensable for its native chemotaxis behavior. These findings provide insight into the spatial and temporal workings of a crucial transcription factor and can be further exploited to find CREB1 targets involved in the process of memory formation.

Objective: It is not well understood how and to what extent electrical brain activity is affected in pharmacologically altered states of consciousness, where the phenomenological content rather than the level is consciousness is mainly altered. An example is the moderately 'psychedelic' state caused by low doses of ketamine. Therefore, we investigated whether and how measures of evoked and spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal diversity are altered by sub-anaesthetic levels of ketamine compared to normal wakefulness, and how these measures relate to subjective assessments of consciousness. Methods: High-density electroencephalography (EEG, 62 channels) was used to record spontaneous brain activity and responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 10 healthy volunteers before and after administration of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine in an open-label within-subject design. Evoked signal diversity was assessed using the perturbational complexity index (PCI), calculated from the global EEG responses to local TMS perturbations. Signal diversity of spontaneous EEG, with eyes open and eyes closed, was assessed by Lempel Ziv complexity (LZc), amplitude coalition entropy (ACE), and synchrony coalition entropy (SCE). Results: Although no significant difference was found in the index of TMS-evoked complexity (PCI) between the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition and normal wakefulness, all the three measures of spontaneous EEG signal diversity showed significantly increased values in the sub-anesthetic ketamine condition. This increase in apparent signal diversity also correlated with subjective assessment of altered states of consciousness. Moreover, spontaneous signal diversity was significantly higher when participants had eyes open compared to eyes closed, both during normal wakefulness and during influence of sub-anaesthetic ketamine doses. Conclusion: Three different measures of spontaneous EEG signal diversity all showed significantly increased values in the sub-anesthetic ketamine condition, whereas the index of TMS-evoked complexity (PCI) did not change significantly. These results seem to suggest that PCI and spontaneous signal diversity may measure different aspects of consciousness. Thus, our results seem compatible with PCI being indicative of the brain's ability to sustain a certain level of consciousness, as indicated by previous research, while spontaneous EEG signal diversity may be indicative of the complexity of conscious content. The observed sensitivity of the latter measures to visual input seems to support such an interpretation. Thus, sub-anaesthetic ketamine may increase the complexity of both the conscious content (experience) and the brain activity underlying it, as assessed by spontaneous signal diversity measures, while the 'level' or 'degree' of consciousness, assessed by PCI, remains largely unaffected.

<p>A companion paper introduces a nonlinear network with Hebbian excitatory (E)
neurons that are reciprocally coupled with anti-Hebbian inhibitory (I) neurons
and also receive Hebbian feedforward excitation from sensory (S) afferents. The
present paper derives the network from two normative principles that are
mathematically equivalent but conceptually different. The first principle
formulates unsupervised learning as a constrained optimization problem:
maximization of S-E correlations subject to a copositivity constraint on E-E
correlations. A combination of Legendre and Lagrangian duality yields a
zero-sum continuous game between excitatory and inhibitory connections that is
solved by the neural network. The second principle defines a zero-sum game
between E and I cells. E cells want to maximize S-E correlations and minimize
E-I correlations, while I cells want to maximize I-E correlations and minimize
power. The conflict between I and E objectives effectively forces the E cells
to decorrelate from each other, although only incompletely. Legendre duality
yields the neural network.

<p>In many systems we can describe emergent macroscopic behaviors,
quantitatively, using models that are much simpler than the underlying
microscopic interactions; we understand the success of this simplification
through the renormalization group. Could similar simplifications succeed in
complex biological systems? We develop explicit coarse-graining procedures that
we apply to experimental data on the electrical activity in large populations
of neurons in the mouse hippocampus. Probability distributions of
coarse-grained variables seem to approach a fixed non-Gaussian form, and we see
evidence of power-law dependencies in both static and dynamic quantities as we
vary the coarse-graining scale over two decades. Taken together, these results
suggest that the collective behavior of the network is described by a
non-trivial fixed point.

<p>Many organisms, from flies to humans, use visual signals to estimate their

constructed a camera/gyroscope system that allows us to sample, at high
temporal resolution, the joint distribution of input images and rotational
motions during a long walk in the woods. From these data we construct the
optimal estimator of velocity based on spatial and temporal derivatives of
image intensity in small patches of the visual world. Over the bulk of the
naturally occurring dynamic range, the optimal estimator exhibits the same
systematic errors seen in neural and behavioral responses, including the
confounding of velocity and contrast. These results suggest that apparent
errors of sensory processing may reflect an optimal response to the physical
signals in the environment.

<p>How does the size of a neural circuit influence its learning performance?
Intuitively, we expect the learning capacity of a neural circuit to grow with
the number of neurons and synapses. Larger brains tend to be found in species
with higher cognitive function and learning ability. Similarly, adding
connections and units to artificial neural networks can allow them to solve
more complex tasks. However, we show that in a biologically relevant setting
where synapses introduce an unavoidable amount of noise, there is an optimal
size of network for a given task. Beneath this optimal size, our analysis shows
how adding apparently redundant neurons and connections can make tasks more
learnable. Therefore large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to
generating complex behaviors, or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster
and more precise learning of simpler behaviors. Above the optimal network size,
the addition of neurons and synaptic connections starts to impede learning
performance. This suggests that overall brain size may be constrained by the
need to learn efficiently with unreliable synapses, and may explain why some
neurological learning deficits are associated with hyperconnectivity. Our
analysis is independent of specific learning rules and uncovers fundamental
relationships between learning rate, task performance, network size and
intrinsic noise in neural circuits.

<p>Volume transmission is an important neural communication pathway in which
neurons in one brain region influence the neurotransmitter concentration in the
extracellular space of a distant brain region. In this paper, we apply
asymptotic analysis to a stochastic partial differential equation model of
volume transmission to calculate the neurotransmitter concentration in the
extracellular space. Our model involves the diffusion equation in a
three-dimensional domain with interior holes that randomly switch between being
either sources or sinks. These holes model nerve varicosities that alternate
between releasing and absorbing neurotransmitter, according to when they fire
action potentials. In the case that the holes are small, we compute
analytically the first two nonzero terms in an asymptotic expansion of the
average neurotransmitter concentration. The first term shows that the
concentration is spatially constant to leading order and that this constant is
independent of many details in the problem. Specifically, this constant first
term is independent of the number and location of nerve varicosities, neural
firing correlations, and the size and geometry of the extracellular space. The
second term shows how these factors affect the concentration at second order.
Interestingly, the second term is also spatially constant under some mild
assumptions. We verify our asymptotic results by high-order numerical
simulation using radial basis function-generated finite differences.

<p>This paper introduces a rate-based nonlinear neural network in which
excitatory (E) neurons receive feedforward excitation from sensory (S) neurons,
and inhibit each other through disynaptic pathways mediated by inhibitory (I)
interneurons. Correlation-based plasticity of disynaptic inhibition serves to
incompletely decorrelate E neuron activity, pushing the E neurons to learn
distinct sensory features. The plasticity equations additionally contain
"extra" terms fostering competition between excitatory synapses converging onto
the same postsynaptic neuron and inhibitory synapses diverging from the same
presynaptic neuron. The parameters of competition between S$\to$E connections
can be adjusted to make learned features look more like "parts" or "wholes."
The parameters of competition between I-E connections can be adjusted to set
the typical decorrelatedness and sparsity of E neuron activity. Numerical
simulations of unsupervised learning show that relatively few I neurons can be
sufficient for achieving good decorrelation, and increasing the number of I
neurons makes decorrelation more complete. Excitatory and inhibitory inputs to
active E neurons are approximately balanced as a result of learning.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42078">Timing mechanism of sexually dimorphic nervous system differentiation</a></h4>

The molecular mechanisms that control the timing of sexual differentiation in the brain are poorly understood. We found that the timing of sexually dimorphic differentiation of postmitotic, sex-shared neurons in the nervous system of the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> male is controlled by the temporally regulated miRNA <i>let-7</i> and its target <i>lin-41</i>, a translational regulator. <i>lin-41</i> acts through <i>lin-29a,</i> an isoform of a conserved Zn finger transcription factor, expressed in a subset of sex-shared neurons only in the male. Ectopic <i>lin-29a</i> is sufficient to impose male-specific features at earlier stages of development and in the opposite sex. The temporal, sexual and spatial specificity of <i>lin-29a</i> expression is controlled intersectionally through the <i>lin-28/let-7/lin-41</i> heterochronic pathway, sex chromosome configuration and neuron-type-specific terminal selector transcription factors. Two Doublesex-like transcription factors represent additional sex- and neuron-type specific targets of LIN-41 and are regulated in a similar intersectional manner.

Mutations in pre-synaptic voltage gated calcium channels can lead to familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). While mammalian studies indicate that the migraine brain is hyperexcitable due to enhanced excitation or reduced inhibition, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance are poorly understood. We identified a gain-of-function (gf) mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans CaV2 channel 1 subunit, UNC-2, which leads to increased calcium currents. unc-2(gf) mutants exhibit hyperactivity and seizure-like motor behaviors. Expression of the unc-2 gene with FHM1 substitutions R192Q and S218L leads to hyperactivity similar to that of unc-2(gf) mutants unc-2(gf) mutants display increased cholinergic- and decreased GABAergic-transmission. Moreover, we reveal that and increased cholinergic transmission in unc-2(gf) mutants leads to reduction of GABA synapses in a TAX-6/calcineurin dependent manner. Our studies provide mechanistic insight into how CaV2 gain-of-function mutations disrupt excitation-inhibition balance in the nervous system.

<p>by Iris I. A. Groen, Sara Jahfari, Noor Seijdel, Sennay Ghebreab, Victor A. F. Lamme, H. Steven Scholte</p>

Selective brain responses to objects arise within a few hundreds of milliseconds of neural processing, suggesting that visual object recognition is mediated by rapid feed-forward activations. Yet disruption of neural responses in early visual cortex beyond feed-forward processing stages affects object recognition performance. Here, we unite these discrepant findings by reporting that object recognition involves enhanced feedback activity (recurrent processing within early visual cortex) when target objects are embedded in natural scenes that are characterized by high complexity. Human participants performed an animal target detection task on natural scenes with low, medium or high complexity as determined by a computational model of low-level contrast statistics. Three converging lines of evidence indicate that feedback was selectively enhanced for high complexity scenes. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in early visual cortex (V1) was enhanced for target objects in scenes with high, but not low or medium complexity. Second, event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by target objects were selectively enhanced at feedback stages of visual processing (from ~220 ms onwards) for high complexity scenes only. Third, behavioral performance for high complexity scenes deteriorated when participants were pressed for time and thus less able to incorporate the feedback activity. Modeling of the reaction time distributions using drift diffusion revealed that object information accumulated more slowly for high complexity scenes, with evidence accumulation being coupled to trial-to-trial variation in the EEG feedback response. Together, these results suggest that while feed-forward activity may suffice to recognize isolated objects, the brain employs recurrent processing more adaptively in naturalistic settings, using minimal feedback for simple scenes and increasing feedback for complex scenes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bWxjgjN2aIw" width="1" />

<p>by Zhen Wah Tan, Enrico Guarnera, Igor N. Berezovsky</p>

We propose a new computational method for exploring chromatin structural organization based on Markov State Modelling of Hi-C data, represented as an interaction network between genomic loci. A Markov process describes the random walk of a traveling probe in the corresponding energy landscape, mimicking the motion of a biomolecule involved in chromatin function. By studying the metastability of the associated Markov State Model upon annealing, the hierarchical structure of individual chromosomes is observed, and a corresponding set of structural partitions is identified at each level of hierarchy. Then, the notion of effective interaction between partitions is derived, delineating the overall topology and architecture of chromosomes. Mapping epigenetic data on the graphs of intra-chromosomal effective interactions helps in understanding how chromosome organization facilitates its function. A sketch of whole-genome interactions obtained from the analysis of 539 partitions from all 23 chromosomes, complemented by distributions of gene expression regulators and epigenetic factors, sheds light on the structure-function relationships in chromatin, delineating chromosomal territories, as well as structural partitions analogous to topologically associating domains and active / passive epigenomic compartments. In addition to the overall genome architecture shown by effective interactions, the affinity between partitions of different chromosomes was analyzed as an indicator of the degree of association between partitions in functionally relevant genomic interactions. The overall static picture of whole-genome interactions obtained with the method presented in this work provides a foundation for chromatin structural reconstruction and the modelling of chromatin dynamics to explore the regulation of genome function. The algorithms used in this study are implemented in a freely available Python package ChromaWalker (https://bitbucket.org/ZhenWahTan/chromawalker).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDKSI-jH4_Q" width="1" />

Pavlovian influences are important in guiding decision-making across health and psychopathology. There is an increasing interest in using concise computational tasks to parametrise such influences in large populations, and especially to track their evolution during development and changes in mental health. However, the developmental course of Pavlovian influences is uncertain, a problem compounded by the unclear psychometric properties of the relevant measurements. We assessed Pavlovian influences in a longitudinal sample using a well characterised and widely used Go-NoGo task. We hypothesized that the strength of Pavlovian influences and other ‘psychomarkers’ guiding decision-making would behave like traits. As reliance on Pavlovian influence is not as profitable as precise instrumental decision-making in this Go-NoGo task, we expected this influence to decrease with higher IQ and age. Additionally, we hypothesized it would correlate with expressions of psychopathology. We found that Pavlovian effects had weak temporal stability, while model-fit was more stable. In terms of external validity, Pavlovian effects decreased with increasing IQ and experience within the task, in line with normative expectations. However, Pavlovian effects were poorly correlated with age or psychopathology. Thus, although this computational construct did correlate with important aspects of development, it does not meet conventional requirements for tracking individual development. We suggest measures that might improve psychometric properties of task-derived Pavlovian measures for future studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JoPyq3Wkq5c" width="1" />

Antibiotics need to be effective in diverse environments <i>in vivo</i>. However, the pathogen microenvironment can have a significant impact on antibiotic potency. Further, antibiotics are increasingly used in combinations to combat resistance, yet, the effect of microenvironments on drug-combination efficacy is unknown. To exhaustively explore the impact of diverse microenvironments on drug-combinations, here we develop a computational framework—Metabolism And GENomics-based Tailoring of Antibiotic regimens (MAGENTA). MAGENTA uses chemogenomic profiles of individual drugs and metabolic perturbations to predict synergistic or antagonistic drug-interactions in different microenvironments. We uncovered antibiotic combinations with robust synergy across nine distinct environments against both <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and A. <i>baumannii</i> by searching through 2556 drug-combinations of 72 drugs. MAGENTA also accurately predicted the change in efficacy of bacteriostatic and bactericidal drug-combinations during growth in glycerol media, which we confirmed experimentally in both microbes. Our approach identified genes in glycolysis and glyoxylate pathway as top predictors of synergy and antagonism respectively. Our systems approach enables tailoring of antibiotic therapies based on the pathogen microenvironment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3iooan0rGtE" width="1" />

<p>by Andrew F. Neuwald, Stephen F. Altschul</p>

Protein Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), which predicts residue-residue contacts based on covarying positions within a multiple sequence alignment, has been remarkably effective. This suggests that there is more to learn from sequence correlations than is generally assumed, and calls for deeper investigations into DCA and perhaps into other types of correlations. Here we describe an approach that enables such investigations by measuring, as an estimated <i>p</i>-value, the statistical significance of the association between residue-residue covariance and structural interactions, either internal or homodimeric. Its application to thirty protein superfamilies confirms that direct coupling (DC) scores correlate with 3D pairwise contacts with very high significance. This method also permits quantitative assessment of the relative performance of alternative DCA methods, and of the degree to which they detect direct versus indirect couplings. We illustrate its use to assess, for a given protein, the biological relevance of alternative conformational states, to investigate the possible mechanistic implications of differences between these states, and to characterize subtle aspects of direct couplings. Our analysis indicates that direct pairwise correlations may be largely distinct from correlated patterns associated with functional specialization, and that the joint analysis of both types of correlations can yield greater power.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid‐beta (Aβ) and downstream Alzheimer's Disease pathology. We previously showed OSA may impair Aβ clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Aβ. In this study, SWA and CSF Aβ were measured in participants with OSA before and 1‐4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Aβ after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Aβ. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Aβ release and clearance.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Amyloid‐β transmission has been described in patients both with and without iatrogenic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease; however, there is little information regarding the impact of this acquired amyloid‐β pathology during life. Here, for the first time, we describe in detail the clinical and neuroimaging findings in three patients with early‐onset symptomatic amyloid‐β cerebral amyloid angiopathy following childhood exposure to cadaveric dura (by neurosurgical grafting in two patients, and tumour embolization in a third). Our observations provide further <i>in vivo</i> evidence that cerebral amyloid angiopathy might be caused by transmission of amyloid‐β seeds (prions) present in cadaveric dura, and has diagnostic relevance for younger patients presenting with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dysregulation of GABAergic transmission has been reported in lesional acquired epilepsies (gliomas, hippocampal sclerosis). We investigated its involvement in a developmental disorder, human Focal Cortical Dysplasia, focusing on chloride regulation driving GABAergic signals.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><i>In vitro</i> recordings of 47 human cortical acute slices from 11 pediatric patients operated from a Focal Cortical Dysplasia were performed on Multi Electrode Arrays. GABAergic receptors and chloride regulators were pharmacologically modulated. Immunostaining for chloride co‐transporter KCC2 and interneurons were performed on recorded slices to correlate electrophysiology and expression patterns.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Focal Cortical Dysplasia slices retain intrinsic epileptogenicity. 36/47 slices displayed spontaneous interictal discharges, along with a pattern specific to the histological subtypes. Ictal discharges were induced in pro‐epileptic conditions in 6/8 slices in the areas generating spontaneous interictal discharges, with a transition to seizure involving the emergence of preictal discharges. Interictal discharges were sustained by GABAergic signaling as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors blocker stopped them in 2/3 slices. Blockade of NKCC1 Cl<sup>‐</sup> co‐transporters further controlled interictal discharges in 9/12 cases, revealing a Cl<sup>‐</sup> dysregulation affecting actions of GABA. Immunohistochemistry highlighted decreased expression and changes in KCC2 sub‐cellular localization and a decrease in the number of GAD67‐positive interneurons in regions generating interictal discharges.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Altered chloride cotransporters expression and changes in interneuron density in FCD may lead to paradoxical depolarization of pyramidal cells. Spontaneous interictal discharges are consequently mediated by GABAergic signals and targeting chloride regulation in neurons may be considered for the development of new antiepileptic drugs.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Surgical specimens from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) show abnormalities in tissue concentrations of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5). To clarify whether these abnormalities are specific to the epileptogenic zone (EZ), we characterized <i>in vivo</i> whole‐brain mGluR5 availability in MTLE patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688, a radioligand that binds specifically to the mGluR5 allosteric site.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty‐one unilateral MTLE patients and 30 healthy controls underwent [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 PET. We compared partial volume corrected [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 non‐displaceable binding potentials (BP<sub>ND</sub>) between groups using region‐of‐interest and whole‐brain voxel‐wise analyses. [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was acquired in 15 patients, for whom we calculated asymmetry indices of [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake to compare lateralization and localization differences.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>[<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> was focally reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampal head and amygdala (p&lt;0.001). Patients with hippocampal atrophy showed more extensive abnormalities including the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (p=0.006). [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> showed interhemispheric differences of higher magnitude and discriminated the epileptogenic structures more accurately when compared to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake, which showed more widespread hypometabolism. Amongst 23/25 operated patients with &gt; 1 year follow‐up, 13 were seizure‐free (Engel Ia), and showed significantly lower [<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 BP<sub>ND</sub> in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>[<sup>11</sup>C]ABP688 PET provides a focal biomarker for the EZ in MTLE with higher spatial accuracy compared to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET. Focally reduced mGluR5 availability in the EZ might reflect receptor internalization or conformational changes in response to excessive extracellular glutamate, supporting a potential role for mGluR5 as therapeutic target in human MTLE.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as the relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP)‐PET and MRI scans were acquired from 42 healthy older adults (OA; 21 PiB+; age=77.6±4.6; 25F/17M) and 19 PiB+ patients with AD (age=63.1±10.3; 12F/7M) over 1‐3 years follow‐up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and crossmodal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percent change (APC) in FTP was also calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or <i>APOE</i>. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow‐up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with <i>in vivo</i> tau‐PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.</p>

<p>To understand multifactorial conditions such as Alzheimers disease (AD) we
need brain signatures that predict the impact of multiple pathologies and their
interactions. To help uncover the relationships between brain circuits and
cognitive markers we have used mouse models that represent, at least in part,
the complex interactions altered in AD. In particular, we aimed to understand
the relationship between vulnerable brain circuits and memory deficits measured
in the Morris water maze, and we tested several predictive modeling approaches.
We used in vivo manganese enhanced MRI voxel based analyses to reveal regional
differences in volume (morphometry), signal intensity (activity), and magnetic
susceptibility (iron deposition, demyelination). These regions included the
hippocampus, olfactory areas, entorhinal cortex and cerebellum. The image based
properties of these regions were used to predict spatial memory. We next used
eigenanatomy, which reduces dimensionality to produce sets of regions that
explain the variance in the data. For each imaging marker, eigenanatomy
revealed networks underpinning a range of cognitive functions including memory,
motor function, and associative learning. Finally, the integration of
multivariate markers in a supervised sparse canonical correlation approach
outperformed single predictor models and had significant correlates to spatial
memory. Among a priori selected regions, the fornix also provided good
predictors, raising the possibility of investigating how disease propagation
within brain networks leads to cognitive deterioration. Our results support
that modeling approaches integrating multivariate imaging markers provide
sensitive predictors of AD-like behaviors. Such strategies for mapping brain
circuits responsible for behaviors may help in the future predict disease
progression, or response to interventions.

<p>We develop a method that is based on processing gathered Event Related
Potentials (ERP) signals and the use of machine learning technique for
multivariate analysis (i.e. classification) that we apply in order to analyze
the differences between Dyslexic and Skilled readers.
</p>
<p>No human intervention is needed in the analysis process. This is the state of
the art results for automatic identification of Dyslexic readers using a
Lexical Decision Task. We use mathematical and machine learning based
techniques to automatically discover novel complex features that (i) allow for
reliable distinction between Dyslexic and Normal Control Skilled readers and
(ii) to validate the assumption that the most of the differences between
Dyslexic and Skilled readers located in the left hemisphere.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, these tools also pointed to the fact that High Pass signals
(typically considered as "noise" during ERP/EEG analyses) in fact contains
significant relevant information. Finally, the proposed scheme can be used for
analysis of any ERP based studies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42660">Symbiont location, host fitness, and possible coadaptation in a symbiosis between social amoebae and bacteria</a></h4>

Recent symbioses, particularly facultative ones, are well suited for unravelling the evolutionary give and take between partners. Here we look at variation in natural isolates of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum </i>and their relationships with bacterial symbionts, <i>Burkholderia hayleyella </i>and <i>Burkholderia agricolaris</i>. Only about a third of field-collected amoebae carry a symbiont. We cured and cross-infected amoebae hosts with different symbiont association histories and then compared host responses to each symbiont type. Before curing, field-collected clones did not vary significantly in overall fitness, but infected hosts produced morphologically different multicellular structures. After curing and reinfecting, host fitness declined. However, natural <i>B. hayleyella</i> hosts suffered fewer fitness costs when reinfected with <i>B. hayleyella, </i>indicating that they have evolved mechanisms to tolerate their symbiont. Our work suggests that amoebae hosts have evolved mechanisms to tolerate specific acquired symbionts; exploring host-symbiont relationships that vary within species may provide further insights into disease dynamics.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42519">Spinal Shox2 interneuron interconnectivity related to function and development</a></h4>

Neuronal networks generating hindlimb locomotion are located in the spinal cord. The mechanisms underlying spinal rhythmogenesis are unknown but network activity and interconnectivity of excitatory interneurons likely play prominent roles. Here, we investigate interconnectivity within the Shox2 interneuron population, a subset of which has been shown to be involved in locomotor rhythm generation, using paired recordings in isolated spinal cords or slices from transgenic mice. Sparse unidirectional connections consistent with chemical synaptic transmission and prominent bidirectional connections mediated by electrical synapses were present within distinct subsets of Shox2 interneurons. Moreover, bidirectional electrical connections were preferentially found between functionally-related Shox2 interneurons. Though prevalent in neonatal mice, electrical coupling began to decline in incidence and strength in mice ~3 weeks of age. Overall, our data suggest that gap junctional coupling promotes synchronization of Shox2 interneurons, and may be implicated in locomotor rhythmicity in developing mice.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42253">The ULK1-FBXW5-SEC23B nexus controls autophagy</a></h4>

In response to nutrient deprivation, the cell mobilizes an extensive amount of membrane to form and grow the autophagosome, allowing the progression of autophagy. By providing membranes and stimulating LC3 lipidation, COPII (Coat Protein Complex II) promotes autophagosome biogenesis. Here, we show that the F-box protein FBXW5 targets SEC23B, a component of COPII, for proteasomal degradation and that this event limits the autophagic flux in the presence of nutrients. In response to starvation, ULK1 phosphorylates SEC23B on Serine 186, preventing the interaction of SEC23B with FBXW5 and, therefore, inhibiting SEC23B degradation. Phosphorylated and stabilized SEC23B associates with SEC24A and SEC24B, but not SEC24C and SEC24D, and they re-localize to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, promoting autophagic flux. We propose that, in the presence of nutrients, FBXW5 limits COPII-mediated autophagosome biogenesis. Inhibition of this event by ULK1 ensures efficient execution of the autophagic cascade in response to nutrient starvation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38062">Cumulative mitochondrial activity correlates with ototoxin susceptibility in zebrafish mechanosensory hair cells</a></h4>

Mitochondria play a prominent role in mechanosensory hair cell damage and death. Although hair cells are thought to be energetically demanding cells, how mitochondria respond to these demands and how this might relate to cell death is largely unexplored. Using genetically encoded indicators, we found mitochondrial calcium flux and oxidation are regulated by mechanotransduction and demonstrate that hair cell activity has both acute and long-term consequences on mitochondrial function. We tested whether variation in mitochondrial activity reflected differences in vulnerability of hair cells to the toxic drug neomycin. We observed that susceptibility did not correspond to the acute level of mitochondrial activity but rather to the cumulative history of that activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37598">Pre-saccadic remapping relies on dynamics of spatial attention</a></h4>

Each saccade shifts the projections of the visual scene on the retina. It has been proposed that the receptive fields of neurons in oculomotor areas are predictively remapped to account for these shifts. While remapping of the whole visual scene seems prohibitively complex, selection by attention may limit these processes to a subset of attended locations. Because attentional selection consumes time, remapping of attended locations should evolve in time, too. In our study, we cued a spatial location by presenting an attention-capturing cue at different times before a saccade and constructed maps of attentional allocation across the visual field. We observed no remapping of attention when the cue appeared shortly before saccade. In contrast, when the cue appeared sufficiently early before saccade, attentional resources were reallocated precisely to the remapped location. Our results show that pre-saccadic remapping takes time to develop suggesting that it relies on the spatial and temporal dynamics of spatial attention.

Non-invasive detection of neural activity is important for the diagnosis of neurological diseases, evaluation of therapeutic outcomes, and collection of real-time feedback for stimulation based therapeutic approaches. In the case of vision loss, due to retinal degeneration, optic neuropathy, or enucleation of the eye, there is a need to map changes in visual cortical activity during disease progression and subsequent vision restoration by retinal, optic nerve or cortical stimulation. Existing technologies allow interrogation of neuronal circuits by both read and write activity, albeit with inherent limitations. Here, we present the development of bioluminescent multi-characteristic opsin (bMCO-11), which is comprised of a highly photosensitive ambient light-activatable domain and a Ca2+-sensitive bioluminescence reporter. The high quantum efficiency of bMCO-11 enables light activation and recording of cellular activity upon local as well as wide area optical stimulation. Furthermore, persistent Ca2+ influx was achieved by bioluminescence based cyclic activation of the opsin-domain of bMCO-11 by transporting the ions only into bMCO expressing cells. This allowed us to continuously monitor visual cortical activity in wild type and retinal degenerated mice, without requiring any additional external excitation source.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/509307v1?rss=1">Accurate Modeling of Brain Responses to Speech</a></h4>

Perceptual processes can be probed by fitting stimulus-response models that relate measured brain signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) to the stimuli that evoke them. These models have also found application for the control of devices such as hearing aids. The quality of the fit, as measured by correlation, classification, or information rate metrics, indicates the value of the model and the usefulness of the device. Models based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) achieve a quality of fit that surpasses that of commonly-used linear forward and backward models. Here, we show that their performance can be further improved using several techniques, including adaptive beamforming, CCA weight optimization, and recurrent neural networks that capture the time-varying and context-dependent relationships within the data. We demonstrate these results using a match-vs-mismatch classification paradigm, in which the classifier must decide which of two stimulus samples produced a given EEG response and which is a randomly chosen stimulus sample. This task captures the essential features of the more complex auditory attention decoding (AAD) task explored in many other studies. The new techniques yield a significant decrease in classification errors and an increase in information transfer rate, suggesting that these models better fit the perceptual processes reflected by the data. This is useful for improving brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

Synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release neurotransmitter following an action potential, after which new vesicles must refill vacated release sites. How many vesicles can fuse at a single active zone, where they fuse within the active zone, and how quickly they are replaced with new vesicles is not well-established. To capture synaptic vesicle exocytosis at cultured mouse hippocampal synapses, we induced single action potentials by electrical field stimulation then subjected neurons to high-pressure freezing to examine their morphology by electron microscopy. During synchronous release, multiple vesicles can fuse at a single active zone; this multivesicular release is augmented by increasing the extracellular calcium concentration. Synchronous fusions are distributed throughout the active zone, whereas asynchronous fusions are biased toward the center of the active zone. Immediately after stimulation a large fraction of vesicles become undocked. Between 8 and 14 ms, new vesicles are recruited to the plasma membrane and fully replenish the docked pool, but docking of these vesicles is transient and they either undock or fuse within 100 ms. These results demonstrate that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to release sites is rapid and reversible.

The concept of brain states, functionally relevant large-scale patterns, has become popular in neuroimaging. Not all components of such patterns are equally characteristic for each brain state, but machine learning provides a possibility of extracting the structure of brain states from functional data. However, the characterization in terms of functional connectivity measures varies widely, from cross-correlation to phase coherence, and the idea that different measures will provide the similar information is a common assumption made in neuroimaging. Here, we compare the performance of phase coherence, pairwise covariance, correlation, model-based covariance and model-based precision for a dataset of subjects performing five different cognitive tasks. We employ multinomial logistic regression for classification and consider two types of cross-validation schemes, between- and within-subjects. Furthermore, we investigate whether classification is robust for different temporal window lengths. We find that informative links for the classification, meaning changes between tasks that are consistent across subjects, are entirely uncorrelated between correlation and covariance. These results indicate that the corresponding FC signature can strongly differ across FC methods used and that interpretation is subject to caution in terms of subnetworks related to a task.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge for drug brain delivery. The limitation of our knowledge about the nature of BBB explains the slow progress in the therapy of brain diseases and absence of methods for drug brain delivery in the clinical practice. Here we show that BBB opens for low/high weight molecules and nanocarriers after exposure of loud music/sound of 90 dB and 100 dB (regardless its frequency) as being easily produced by MP3/MP4 players, kitchen appliances, loudspeakers at concerts. The role of sound, sound-induced stress and molecular mechanisms behind is discussed in the framework of BBB opening as an informative platform for a novel fundamental knowledge about the nature of BBB and for the development of a non-invasive brain drug delivery technology. Social aspects of music/sound-induced opening of BBB provide completely new information about noise and healthy life conditions that will stimulate new research in this field.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 1,349 Japanese community residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002–2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all <i>p</i> for trend &lt; 0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR = 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–2.97, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.02–2.55, <i>p</i> = 0.04 for AD; HR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.35–6.02, <i>p</i> = 0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk factor subgroups (all <i>p</i> for heterogeneity &gt; 0.11).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–12</p>

Abstract
<p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are highly organized components of the extracellular matrix that surround a subset of mature neurons in the CNS. These structures play a critical role in regulating neuronal plasticity, particularly during neurodevelopment. Consistent with this role, their presence is associated with functional and structural stability of the neurons they ensheath. A loss of PNNs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been suggested to contribute to cognitive impairment in disorders such as schizophrenia. However, the direct consequences of PNN loss in medial PFC (mPFC) on cognition has not been demonstrated. Here, we examined behavior after disruption of PNNs in mPFC of Long–Evans rats following injection of the enzyme chondroitinase ABC (ChABC). Our data show that ChABC-treated animals were impaired on tests of object oddity perception. Performance in the cross-modal object recognition (CMOR) task was not significantly different for ChABC-treated rats, although ChABC-treated rats were not able to perform above chance levels whereas control rats were. ChABC-treated animals were not significantly different from controls on tests of prepulse inhibition (PPI), set-shifting (SS), reversal learning, or tactile and visual object recognition memory. Posthumous immunohistochemistry confirmed significantly reduced PNNs in mPFC due to ChABC treatment. Moreover, PNN density in the mPFC predicted performance on the oddity task, where higher PNN density was associated with better performance. These findings suggest that PNN loss within the mPFC impairs some aspects of object oddity perception and recognition and that PNNs contribute to cognitive function in young adulthood.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurotrophin‐3 (NT3) plays a key role in the development and function of locomotor circuits including descending serotonergic and corticospinal tract axons and afferents from muscle and skin. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into affected forelimb muscles improves sensorimotor recovery after stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move toward the clinic, we tested the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Rats received unilateral ischemic stroke in sensorimotor cortex. To simulate a clinically feasible time to treatment, 24 hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into affected triceps brachii for 4 weeks using implanted catheters and minipumps.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Radiolabeled NT3 crossed from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in rodents with or without strokes. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory impairment of the affected wrist. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation of the affected wrist showed spontaneous recovery of peri‐infarct blood oxygenation level–dependent signal that NT3 did not further enhance. Rather, NT3 induced neuroplasticity of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of NT3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.

PR domain containing 9 (<i>Prdm9</i>) is a gene specifying hotspots of meiotic recombination but in hybrids between two mouse subspecies <i>Prdm9</i> controls failure of meiotic chromosome synapsis and hybrid male sterility. We have previously reported that <i>Prdm9</i>-controlled asynapsis and meiotic arrest are conditioned by the inter-subspecific heterozygosity of the hybrid genome and we presumed that the insufficient number of properly repaired PRDM9-dependent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) causes asynapsis of chromosomes and meiotic arrest (Gregorova<i> et al.</i> 2018). We now extend the evidence for the lack of properly processed DSBs by improving meiotic chromosome synapsis with exogenous DSBs. A single injection of chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin increased frequency of RPA and DMC1 foci at the zygotene stage of sterile hybrids, enhanced homolog recognition and increased the proportion of spermatocytes with fully synapsed homologs at pachytene. The results bring a new evidence for a DSB-dependent mechanism of synapsis failure and infertility of intersubspecific hybrids.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41877">Two central pattern generators from the crab <i>Cancer borealis </i>respond robustly and differentially to extreme extracellular pH</a></h4>

The activity of neuronal circuits depends on the properties of the constituent neurons and their underlying synaptic and intrinsic currents. We describe the effects of extreme changes in extracellular pH - from pH 5.5 to 10.4 - on two central pattern generating networks, the stomatogastric and cardiac ganglia of the crab, <i>Cancer borealis</i>. Given that the physiological properties of ion channels are known to be sensitive to pH within the range tested, it is surprising that these rhythms generally remained robust from pH 6.1 to pH 8.8. The pH sensitivity of these rhythms was highly variable between animals and, unexpectedly, between ganglia. Animal-to-animal variability was likely a consequence of similar network performance arising from variable sets of underlying conductances. Together, these results illustrate the potential difficulty in generalizing the effects of environmental perturbation across circuits, even within the same animal.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40174">Time-resolved mapping of genetic interactions to model rewiring of signaling pathways</a></h4>

Context-dependent changes in genetic interactions are an important feature of cellular pathways and their varying responses under different environmental conditions. However, methodological frameworks to investigate the plasticity of genetic interaction networks over time or in response to external stresses are largely lacking. To analyze the plasticity of genetic interactions, we performed a combinatorial RNAi screen in <i>Drosophila</i> cells at multiple time points and after pharmacological inhibition of Ras signaling activity. Using an image-based morphology assay to capture a broad range of phenotypes, we assessed the effect of 12768 pairwise RNAi perturbations in six different conditions. We found that genetic interactions form in different trajectories and developed an algorithm, termed MODIFI, to analyze how genetic interactions rewire over time. Using this framework, we identified more statistically significant interactions compared to end-point assays and further observed several examples of context-dependent crosstalk between signaling pathways such as an interaction between Ras and Rel which is dependent on MEK activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38889">The flow responsive transcription factor Klf2 is required for myocardial wall integrity by modulating Fgf signaling</a></h4>

Complex interplay between cardiac tissues is crucial for their integrity. The flow responsive transcription factor KLF2, which is expressed in the endocardium, is vital for cardiovascular development but its exact role remains to be defined. To this end, we mutated both <i>klf2 </i>paralogues in zebrafish, and while single mutants exhibit no obvious phenotype, double mutants display a novel phenotype of cardiomyocyte extrusion towards the abluminal side. This extrusion requires cardiac contractility and correlates with the mislocalization of N-cadherin from the lateral to the apical side of cardiomyocytes. Transgenic rescue data show that <i>klf2</i> expression in endothelium, but not myocardium, prevents this cardiomyocyte extrusion phenotype. Transcriptome analysis of <i>klf2</i> mutant hearts reveals that Fgf signaling is affected, and accordingly, we find that inhibition of Fgf signaling in wild-type animals can lead to abluminal cardiomyocyte extrusion. These studies provide new insights into how Klf2 regulates cardiovascular development and specifically myocardial wall integrity.

Pneumococcal whole cell vaccines (WCVs) could cost-effectively protect against a greater strain diversity than current capsule-based vaccines. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to a WCV were characterised by applying longitudinally-sampled sera, available from 35 adult placebo-controlled phase I trial participants, to a panproteome microarray. Despite individuals maintaining distinctive antibody 'fingerprints', responses were consistent across vaccinated cohorts. Seventy-two functionally distinct proteins were associated with WCV-induced increases in IgG binding. These shared characteristics with naturally immunogenic proteins, being enriched for transporters and cell wall metabolism enzymes, likely unusually exposed on the unencapsulated WCV's surface. Vaccine-induced responses were specific to variants of the diverse PclA, PspC and ZmpB proteins, whereas PspA- and ZmpA-induced antibodies recognised a broader set of alleles. Temporal variation in IgG levels suggested a mixture of anamnestic and novel responses. These reproducible increases in IgG binding a limited, but functionally diverse, set of conserved proteins indicate WCV could provide species-wide immunity.

<p>by Ashish B. George, Kirill S. Korolev</p>

Chirality in shape and motility can evolve rapidly in microbes and cancer cells. To determine how chirality affects cell fitness, we developed a model of chiral growth in compact aggregates such as microbial colonies and solid tumors. Our model recapitulates previous experimental findings and shows that mutant cells can invade by increasing their chirality or switching their handedness. The invasion results either in a takeover or stable coexistence between the mutant and the ancestor depending on their relative chirality. For large chiralities, the coexistence is accompanied by strong intermixing between the cells, while spatial segregation occurs otherwise. We show that the competition within the aggregate is mediated by bulges in regions where the cells with different chiralities meet. The two-way coupling between aggregate shape and natural selection is described by the chiral Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation coupled to the Burgers’ equation with multiplicative noise. We solve for the key features of this theory to explain the origin of selection on chirality. Overall, our work suggests that chirality could be an important ecological trait that mediates competition, invasion, and spatial structure in cellular populations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SwZSibGFqoA" width="1" />

Several key transcription factors have unusually short half-lives compared to other cellular proteins. Here, we explore the utility of active degradation in shaping how the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA coordinates its downstream targets. MarA controls a variety of stress response genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We modify its half-life either by knocking down the protease that targets it via CRISPRi or by engineering MarA to protect it from degradation. Our experimental and analytical results indicate that active degradation can impact both the rate of coordination and the maximum coordination that downstream genes can achieve. In the context of multi-gene regulation, trade-offs between these properties show that perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UhXoetl4a4g" width="1" />

<p>by John M. Jumper, Nabil F. Faruk, Karl F. Freed, Tobin R. Sosnick</p>

An ongoing challenge in protein chemistry is to identify the underlying interaction energies that capture protein dynamics. The traditional trade-off in biomolecular simulation between accuracy and computational efficiency is predicated on the assumption that detailed force fields are typically well-parameterized, obtaining a significant fraction of possible accuracy. We re-examine this trade-off in the more realistic regime in which parameterization is a greater source of error than the level of detail in the force field. To address parameterization of coarse-grained force fields, we use the contrastive divergence technique from machine learning to train from simulations of 450 proteins. In our procedure, the computational efficiency of the model enables high accuracy through the precise tuning of the Boltzmann ensemble. This method is applied to our recently developed <i>Upside</i> model, where the free energy for side chains is rapidly calculated at every time-step, allowing for a smooth energy landscape without steric rattling of the side chains. After this contrastive divergence training, the model is able to <i>de novo</i> fold proteins up to 100 residues on a single core in days. This improved <i>Upside</i> model provides a starting point both for investigation of folding dynamics and as an inexpensive Bayesian prior for protein physics that can be integrated with additional experimental or bioinformatic data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yjHFh9iipWU" width="1" />

<p>by Anne V. Brown, Jacqueline D. Campbell, Teshale Assefa, David Grant, Rex T. Nelson, Nathan T. Weeks, Steven B. Cannon</p>

As sequencing prices drop, genomic data accumulates—seemingly at a steadily increasing pace. Most genomic data potentially have value beyond the initial purpose—but only if shared with the scientific community. This, of course, is often easier said than done. Some of the challenges in sharing genomic data include data volume (raw file sizes and number of files), complexities, formats, nomenclatures, metadata descriptions, and the choice of a repository. In this paper, we describe 10 quick tips for sharing open genomic data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CRCq9aWfLPk" width="1" />

<p>by John M. Jumper, Nabil F. Faruk, Karl F. Freed, Tobin R. Sosnick</p>

To address the large gap between time scales that can be easily reached by molecular simulations and those required to understand protein dynamics, we present a rapid self-consistent approximation of the side chain free energy at every integration step. In analogy with the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation for electronic structure, the protein backbone dynamics are simulated as preceding according to the dictates of the free energy of an instantaneously-equilibrated side chain potential. The side chain free energy is computed on the fly, allowing the protein backbone dynamics to traverse a greatly smoothed energetic landscape. This computation results in extremely rapid equilibration and sampling of the Boltzmann distribution. Our method, termed <i>Upside</i>, employs a reduced model involving the three backbone atoms, along with the carbonyl oxygen and amide proton, and a single (oriented) side chain bead having multiple locations reflecting the conformational diversity of the side chain’s rotameric states. We also introduce a novel, maximum-likelihood method to parameterize the side chain interactions using protein structures. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for predicting <i>χ</i><sub>1</sub> rotamer states while consuming only milliseconds of CPU time. Our method enables rapidly equilibrating coarse-grained simulations that can nonetheless contain significant molecular detail. We also show that the resulting free energies of the side chains are sufficiently accurate for <i>de novo</i> folding of some proteins.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jYlak8hVP-c" width="1" />

<p>Correlated component analysis (CORRCA) is a novel method for frequency
recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based
brain-computer interface (BCI), which holds the potential to implement
high-performance SSVEP-based BCI systems. CORRCA could provide multiple
correlation coefficients to measure the correlation between two signals.
However, only the largest one is selected as feature while ignoring all others
in previous study, which loses the discriminating information. In current
study, we proposed a weighting strategy with nonlinear function to combine all
the correlation coefficients to enhance the performance of CORRCA method.
Extensive experimental results on a benchmark dataset of thirty-five subjects
indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the original CORRCA
method. This study demonstrates that the proposed method could be a good choice
for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCI systems.

<p>A common approach to modeling dynamic connectivity in resting-state
whole-brain fMRI is to compute (across moving temporal windows) the
Pearson-correlation between anatomical regions derived from predefined brain
parcellation. Due to image acquisition and physiological noise, the direct use
of the sample correlation matrices is not reliable for the subsequent modeling
of the dynamically-evolving connectivity matrices. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a new regression approach that smooths out the noise by exploiting
the geometric structure of correlation matrices. We demonstrate that the
proposed method is useful for identifying distinct state spaces in the
resting-state connectivities of males and females through the transition
matrices of the common states.

<p>Noise is an inherent part of neuronal dynamics, and thus of the brain. It can
be observed in neuronal activity at different spatiotemporal scales, including
in neuronal membrane potentials, local field potentials,
electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography. A central research topic in
contemporary neuroscience is to elucidate the functional role of noise in
neuronal information processing. Experimental studies have shown that a
suitable level of noise may enhance the detection of weak neuronal signals by
means of stochastic resonance. In response, theoretical research, based on the
theory of stochastic processes, nonlinear dynamics, and statistical physics,
has made great strides in elucidating the mechanism and the many benefits of
stochastic resonance in neuronal systems. In this perspective, we review recent
research dedicated to neuronal stochastic resonance in biophysical mathematical
models. We also explore the regulation of neuronal stochastic resonance, and we
outline important open questions and directions for future research. A deeper
understanding of neuronal stochastic resonance may afford us new insights into
the highly impressive information processing in the brain.

<p>Despite the remarkable similarities between deep neural networks (DNN) and
the human brain as shown in previous studies, the fact that DNNs still fall
behind humans in many visual tasks suggests that considerable differences still
exist between the two systems. To probe their dissimilarities, we leverage
adversarial noise (AN) and adversarial interference (AI) images that yield
distinct recognition performance in a prototypical DNN (AlexNet) and human
vision. The evoked activity by regular (RE) and adversarial images in both
systems is thoroughly compared. We find that representational similarity
between RE and adversarial images in the human brain resembles their perceptual
similarity. However, such representation-perception association is disrupted in
the DNN. Especially, the representational similarity between RE and AN images
idiosyncratically increases from low- to high-level layers. Furthermore,
forward encoding modeling reveals that the DNN-brain hierarchical
correspondence proposed in previous studies only holds when the two systems
process RE and AI images but not AN images. These results might be due to the
deterministic modeling approach of current DNNs. Taken together, our results
provide a complementary perspective on the comparison between DNNs and the
human brain, and highlight the need to characterize their differences to
further bridge artificial and human intelligence research.

<p>Coarse-graining microscopic models of biological neural networks to obtain
mesoscopic models of neural activities is an essential step towards multi-scale
models of the brain. Here, we extend a recent theory for mesoscopic population
dynamics with static synapses to the case of dynamic synapses exhibiting
short-term plasticity (STP). Under the assumption that spike arrivals at
synapses have Poisson statistics, we derive analytically stochastic mean-field
dynamics for the effective synaptic coupling between finite-size populations
undergoing Tsodyks-Markram STP. The novel mean-field equations account for both
finite number of synapses and correlations between the neurotransmitter release
probability and the fraction of available synaptic resources. Comparisons with
Monte Carlo simulations of the microscopic model show that in both feedforward
and recurrent networks the mesoscopic mean-field model accurately reproduces
stochastic realizations of the total synaptic input into a postsynaptic neuron
and accounts for stochastic switches between Up and Down states as well as for
population spikes. The extended mesoscopic population theory of spiking neural
networks with STP may be useful for a systematic reduction of detailed
biophysical models of cortical microcircuits to efficient and mathematically
tractable mean-field models.

<p>Developing whole-brain emulation (WBE) technology would provide immense
benefits across neuroscience, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and
robotics. At this time, constructing a simulated human brain lacks feasibility
due to limited experimental data and limited computational resources. However,
I suggest that progress towards this goal might be accelerated by working
towards an intermediate objective, namely insect brain emulation (IBE). More
specifically, this would entail creating biologically realistic simulations of
entire insect nervous systems along with more approximate simulations of
non-neuronal insect physiology to make "virtual insects." I argue that this is
realistically achievable within the next 25-50 years. I propose that developing
emulations of insect brains will galvanize the global community of scientists,
businesspeople, and policymakers towards pursuing the loftier goal of emulating
the human brain. By demonstrating that WBE is possible via IBE, simulating the
human brain will no longer be viewed as too radically ambitious to deserve
substantial funding and resources. This shift may facilitate a large-scale
organized push towards human WBE, making the goal potentially reachable during
the 21st century. By implementing IBE, large-scale scientific infrastructure
may shift towards developing more WBEs and move in the direction of
comprehensively understanding neural computation.

<p>Many neural systems display avalanche behavior characterized by uninterrupted
sequences of neuronal firing whose distributions of size and durations are
heavy-tailed. Theoretical models of such systems suggest that these dynamics
support optimal information transmission and storage. However, the unknown role
of network structure precludes an understanding of how variations in network
topology manifest in neural dynamics and either support or impinge upon
information processing. Here, using a generalized spiking model, we develop a
mechanistic understanding of how network topology supports information
processing through network dynamics. First, we show how network topology
determines network dynamics by analytically and numerically demonstrating that
network topology can be designed to propagate stimulus patterns for long
durations. We then identify strongly connected cycles as empirically observable
network motifs that are prevalent in such networks. Next, we show that within a
network, mathematical intuitions from network control theory are tightly linked
with dynamics initiated by node-specific stimulation and can identify stimuli
that promote long-lasting cascades. Finally, we use these network-based metrics
and control-based stimuli to demonstrate that long-lasting cascade dynamics
facilitate delayed recovery of stimulus patterns from network activity, as
measured by mutual information. Collectively, our results provide evidence that
cortical networks are structured with architectural motifs that support
long-lasting propagation and recovery of a few crucial patterns of stimulation,
especially those consisting of activity in highly controllable neurons.
Broadly, our results imply that avalanching neural networks could contribute to
cognitive faculties that require persistent activation of neuronal patterns,
such as working memory or attention.

Relapses of <i>Plasmodium </i>dormant liver hypnozoites compromise malaria eradication efforts. New radical cure drugs are urgently needed, yet the vast gap in knowledge of hypnozoite biology impedes drug discovery. We previously unraveled the transcriptome of 6 to 7 day-old <i>P. cynomolgi </i>liver stages, highlighting pathways associated with hypnozoite dormancy (Voorberg-van der Wel, 2017). We now extend these findings by transcriptome profiling of 9 to 10 day-old liver stage parasites, thus revealing for the first time the maturation of the dormant stage over time. Although progression of dormancy leads to a 10-fold decrease in transcription and expression of only 840 genes, including genes associated with housekeeping functions, we show that pathways involved in quiescence, energy metabolism and maintenance of genome integrity remain the prevalent pathways active in mature hypnozoites.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Rapid and flexible learning during behavioral choices is critical to our daily endeavors and constitutes a hallmark of dynamic reasoning. An important paradigm to examine flexible behavior involves learning new arbitrary associations mapping visual inputs to motor outputs. We conjectured that visuomotor rules are instantiated by translating visual signals into actions through dynamic interactions between visual, frontal and motor cortex. We evaluated the neural representation of such visuomotor rules by performing intracranial field potential recordings in epilepsy subjects during a rule-learning delayed match-to-behavior task. Learning new visuomotor mappings led to the emergence of specific responses associating visual signals with motor outputs in 3 anatomical clusters in frontal, anteroventral temporal and posterior parietal cortex. After learning, mapping selective signals during the delay period showed interactions with visual and motor signals. These observations provide initial steps towards elucidating the dynamic circuits underlying flexible behavior and how communication between subregions of frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex leads to rapid learning of task-relevant choices.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The executive control network is involved in the voluntary control of novel and complex situations. Solving conflict situations or detecting errors have demonstrated to impair conscious perception of near-threshold stimuli. The aim of this study was to explore the neural mechanisms underlying executive control and its interaction with conscious perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. To this end, we used a dual-task paradigm involving Stroop and conscious detection tasks with near-threshold stimuli. A set of prefrontal and frontoparietal regions were more strongly engaged for incongruent than congruent trials while a distributed set of frontoparietal regions showed stronger activation for consciously than nonconsciously perceived trials. Functional connectivity analysis revealed an interaction between executive control and conscious perception in frontal and parietal nodes. The microstructural properties of the middle branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus were associated with neural measures of the interaction between executive control and consciousness. These results demonstrate that conscious perception and executive control share neural resources in frontoparietal networks, as proposed by some influential models.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Seminal human brain histology work has demonstrated developmental waves of myelination. Here, using a micro-structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker linked to myelin, we studied fine-grained age differences to deduce waves of growth, stability, and decline of cortical myelination over the life-cycle. In 484 participants, aged 8–85 years, we fitted smooth growth curves to T1- to T2-weighted ratio in each of 360 regions from one of seven cytoarchitectonic classes. From the first derivatives of these generally inverted-U trajectories, we defined three milestones: the age at peak growth; the age at onset of a stable plateau; and the age at the onset of decline. Age at peak growth had a bimodal distribution comprising an early (pre-pubertal) wave of primary sensory and motor cortices and a later (post-pubertal) wave of association, insular and limbic cortices. Most regions reached stability in the 30-s but there was a second wave reaching stability in the 50-s. Age at onset of decline was also bimodal: in some right hemisphere regions, the curve declined from the 60-s, but in other left hemisphere regions, there was no significant decline from the stable plateau. These results are consistent with regionally heterogeneous waves of intracortical myelinogenesis and age-related demyelination.</span>

<p>by Jia Lu, Xiaoyi Cao, Sheng Zhong</p>

Central questions to epigenome evolution include whether interspecies changes of histone modifications are independent of evolutionary changes of DNA, and if there is dependence whether they depend on any specific types of DNA sequence changes. Here, we present a likelihood approach for testing hypotheses on the co-evolution of genome and histone modifications. The gist of this approach is to convert evolutionary biology hypotheses into probabilistic forms, by explicitly expressing the joint probability of multispecies DNA sequences and histone modifications, which we refer to as a class of Joint Evolutionary Model for the Genome and the Epigenome (JEMGE). JEMGE can be summarized as a mixture model of four components representing four evolutionary hypotheses, namely dependence and independence of interspecies epigenomic variations to underlying sequence substitutions and to underlying sequence insertions and deletions (indels). We implemented a maximum likelihood method to fit the models to the data. Based on comparison of likelihoods, we inferred whether interspecies epigenomic variations depended on substitution or indels in local genomic sequences based on DNase hypersensitivity and spermatid H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from human and rhesus macaque. Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited local-sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations. Substitutions accounted for less local-sequence-dependent H3K4me3 variations than indels. Among transposon-mediated indels, ERV1 insertions and L1 insertions were most strongly associated with H3K4me3 gains and losses, respectively. By initiating probabilistic formulation on the co-evolution of genomes and epigenomes, JEMGE helps to bring evolutionary biology principles to comparative epigenomic studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZM4wUNNtaVY" width="1" />

<p>by Gina Polo, Carlos Mera Acosta, Marcelo B. Labruna, Fernando Ferreira, Dirk Brockmann</p>

There are a huge number of pathogens with multi-component transmission cycles, involving amplifier hosts, vectors or complex pathogen life cycles. These complex systems present challenges in terms of modeling and policy development. A lethal tick-borne infectious disease, the Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF), is a relevant example of that. The current increase of human cases of BSF has been associated with the presence and expansion of the capybara <i>Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</i>, amplifier host for the agent <i>Rickettsia rickettsii</i> and primary host for the tick vector <i>Amblyomma sculptum</i>. We introduce a stochastic dynamical model that captures the spatial distribution of capybaras and ticks to gain a better understanding of the spatial spread of the <i>R. rickettsii</i> and potentially predict future epidemic outcomes. We implemented a reaction-diffusion process in which individuals were divided into classes denoting their state with respect to the disease. The model considered bidirectional movements between base and destination locations limited by the carrying capacity of the environment. We performed systematic stochastic simulations and numerical analysis of the model and investigate the impact of potential interventions to mitigate the spatial spread of the disease. The mobility of capybaras and their attached ticks was significantly influenced by the birth rate of capybaras and therefore, disease propagation velocity was higher in places with higher carrying capacity. Some geographical barriers, generated for example by riparian reforesting, can impede the spatial spread of BSF. The results of this work will allow the formulation of public actions focused on the prevention of BSF human cases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UUlMjPil1-k" width="1" />

This paper presents a variational framework for dense diffeomorphic atlas-mapping onto high-throughput histology stacks at the 20 μm meso-scale. The observed sections are modelled as Gaussian random fields conditioned on a sequence of unknown section by section rigid motions and unknown diffeomorphic transformation of a three-dimensional atlas. To regularize over the high-dimensionality of our parameter space (which is a product space of the rigid motion dimensions and the diffeomorphism dimensions), the histology stacks are modelled as arising from a first order Sobolev space smoothness prior. We show that the joint maximum a-posteriori, penalized-likelihood estimator of our high dimensional parameter space emerges as a joint optimization interleaving rigid motion estimation for histology restacking and large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping to atlas coordinates. We show that joint optimization in this parameter space solves the classical curvature non-identifiability of the histology stacking problem. The algorithms are demonstrated on a collection of whole-brain histological image stacks from the Mouse Brain Architecture Project.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nxjhT-P0nDc" width="1" />

<p>by Lindley Darden, Kunal Kundu, Lipika R. Pal, John Moult</p>

Mechanism is a widely used concept in biology. In 2017, more than 10% of PubMed abstracts used the term. Therefore, searching for and reasoning about mechanisms is fundamental to much of biomedical research, but until now there has been almost no computational infrastructure for this purpose. Recent work in the philosophy of science has explored the central role that the search for mechanistic accounts of biological phenomena plays in biomedical research, providing a conceptual basis for representing and analyzing biological mechanism. The foundational categories for components of mechanisms—entities and activities—guide the development of general, abstract types of biological mechanism parts. Building on that analysis, we have developed a formal framework for describing and representing biological mechanism, MecCog, and applied it to describing mechanisms underlying human genetic disease. Mechanisms are depicted using a graphical notation. Key features are assignment of mechanism components to stages of biological organization and classes; visual representation of uncertainty, ignorance, and ambiguity; and tight integration with literature sources. The MecCog framework facilitates analysis of many aspects of disease mechanism, including the prioritization of future experiments, probing of gene−drug and gene−environment interactions, identification of possible new drug targets, personalized drug choice, analysis of nonlinear interactions between relevant genetic loci, and classification of diseases based on mechanism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oqgpx4FsWtE" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel Blustein, Ahmed Shehata, Kevin Englehart, Jonathon Sensinger</p>

Research on human motor adaptation has often focused on how people adapt to self-generated or externally-influenced errors. <i>Trial-by-trial adaptation</i> is a person’s response to self-generated errors. Externally-influenced errors applied as catch-trial perturbations are used to calculate a person’s <i>perturbation adaptation</i> rate. Although these adaptation rates are sometimes compared to one another, we show through simulation and empirical data that the two metrics are distinct. We demonstrate that the trial-by-trial adaptation rate, often calculated as a coefficient in a linear regression, is biased under typical conditions. We tested 12 able-bodied subjects moving a cursor on a screen using a computer mouse. Statistically different adaptation rates arise when sub-sets of trials from different phases of learning are analyzed from within a sequence of movement results. We propose a new approach to identify when a person’s learning has stabilized in order to identify steady-state movement trials from which to calculate a more reliable trial-by-trial adaptation rate. Using a Bayesian model of human movement, we show that this analysis approach is more consistent and provides a more confident estimate than alternative approaches. Constraining analyses to steady-state conditions will allow researchers to better decouple the multiple concurrent learning processes that occur while a person makes goal-directed movements. Streamlining this analysis may help broaden the impact of motor adaptation studies, perhaps even enhancing their clinical usefulness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ASBzK5lPozA" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The subiculum is the main target of the hippocampal region CA1, and is the principle output region of the hippocampus. The subiculum is critical to learning and memory, though it has been relatively understudied. There are two functional types of principle neurons within the subiculum: regular spiking (RS) and burst spiking (BS) neurons. To determine whether these cell types are differentially modified by learning-related experience, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from male mouse brain slices following contextual fear conditioning and memory retrieval relative to a number of control behavioral paradigms. RS cells–but not BS cells– displayed a greater degree of experience-related plasticity in intrinsic excitability measures (afterhyperpolarization, input resistance, current required to elicit a spike), with fear conditioned animals having generally more excitable RS cells compared to naïve controls. Furthermore, we found that the relative proportion of RS to BS neurons is modified by the type of exposure, with the lowest proportion of BS subicular cells occurring in animals that underwent contextual fear conditioning followed by a retrieval test. These studies indicate that pyramidal neurons in the subiculum undergo experience- and learning-related plasticity in intrinsic properties in a cell-type specific manner. As BS and RS cells are thought to convey distinct types of information, this plasticity may be particularly important in encoding, consolidating, and recalling spatial information by modulating information flow from the hippocampus to cortical regions.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The subiculum is the main output region of the hippocampus and contains two main neuron types: regular-spiking and burst-spiking. Here, we show that learning and novel context exposure induces plasticity in intrinsic excitability in regular-spiking cells of the subiculum, and that this plasticity predicts degree of learning of contextual fear conditioning. In contrast, we observed no significant learning-induced plasticity in intrinsic properties in subicular burst-spiking cells; however, we did observe an apparent conversion of burst-spiking to regular-spiking as evidenced by a greater proportion of regular-spiking neurons within the subiculum following learning. This suggests that the ratio of regular-spiking to burst-spiking neurons within the subiculum, together with enhanced excitability of regular-spiking neurons, is important in learning and memory.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The ability to capture the most relevant information from everyday experiences without constantly learning unimportant details is vital to survival and mental health. While decreased activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is associated with failed or inflexible encoding of relevant events in the hippocampus, mechanisms used by the mPFC to discern behavioral relevance of events are not clear. To address this question, we chemogenetically activated excitatory neurons in the mPFC of male rats and examined its impact on local network activity and differential associative learning dependent on the hippocampus. Rats were exposed to two neutral stimuli in two environments whose contingency with an aversive stimulus changed systematically across days. Over two weeks of differential and reversal learning, theta band activity began to ramp up toward the expected onset of the aversive stimulus, and this ramping activity tracked the subsequent shift of the set (stimulus modality to environment) predictive of the aversive stimulus. With chemogenetic mPFC activation, the ramping activity emerged within a few sessions of differential learning, which paralleled faster learning and stronger correlations between the ramping activity and conditioned responses. Chemogenetic mPFC activity, however, did not affect the adjustment of ramping activity or behavior during reversal learning or set-shifting, suggesting that the faster learning was not due to a general enhancement of attention, sensory, or motor processing. Thus, the dynamics of the mPFC network activation during events provide a relevance-signaling mechanism through which the mPFC exerts executive control over the encoding of those events in the hippocampus.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although we now have a fair understanding of memory encoding, the real-time processes through which the brain controls the strength of memory encoding remain mostly unknown. Developing an understanding of these memory regulation processes is important because it informs a new strategy for memory enhancement, which is critically needed for the fast-growing elderly population facing memory handicaps. We discovered that activating one region of the brain, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) facilitated rats to form memories of important events without increasing the learning of unimportant details. The memory enhancement was associated with improved responses of mPFC network to the important events. Manipulations of the mPFC, therefore, allow for tapping into intrinsic memory encoding processes to enhance event memories.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Local translation in neurites is a phenomenon that enhances spatial segregation of proteins and their functions away from the cell body, yet it is unclear how local translation varies across neuronal cell types. Further, it is unclear if differences in local translation across cell types simply reflect differences in transcription or if there is also a cell type specific posttranscriptional regulation of the location and translation of specific mRNAs. Most of the mRNAs discovered as locally translated have been identified from hippocampal neurons because their laminar organization facilitates neurite specific dissection and microscopy methods. Given the diversity of neurons across the brain, studies have not yet analyzed how locally translated mRNAs differ across cell types. Here, we used the SynapTRAP method to harvest two broad cell types in the mouse forebrain: GABAergic neurons and layer 5 projection neurons. While some transcripts overlap, the majority of the local translatome is not shared across these cell types. In addition to differences driven by baseline expression levels, some transcripts also exhibit cell type specific post transcriptional regulation. Finally, we provide evidence that GABAergic neurons specifically localize mRNAs for peptide neurotransmitters, including somatostatin and cortistatin, suggesting localized production of these key signaling molecules in the neurites of GABAergic neurons. Overall, this work suggests that differences in local translation in neurites across neuronal cell types are poised to contribute substantially to the heterogeneity in neuronal phenotypes.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> All RNAs are generated in the nucleus, but in neurons some of these RNAs are shuttled for local protein production in neurites towards synapses. There are many types of neurons which express different complements of receptors and perform different functions. However, there has not yet been a direct comparison of the ribosome-bound transcripts in neurites across cells. Here, we identify and define differences in ribosome-bound RNAs isolated from neurites of two contrasting types of neurons. Some of these differences are due to the neurons not creating the RNA at baseline and some are differences in RNA localization or ribosome binding in neurites. We also identified RNAs for key neurotransmitter proteins that had not been previously described as produced in neurites, suggesting these may be locally produced.</p>

Abstract<p>This study examines longitudinal changes in the concreteness of nouns produced by human patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Cross-sectional studies show that patients with svPPA demonstrate severe loss of concrete noun knowledge linked to atrophy of the left ventral temporal lobe. It is unknown how disease spread and duration affect the magnitude of the concreteness impairment in svPPA. We evaluate longitudinal spoken production of concrete nouns in svPPA, and relate this to changes in longitudinal MRI measures of grey matter (GM). Noun concreteness in svPPA is compared to that of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who typically demonstrate highly concrete speech. We elicited naturalistic speech samples at two time points (Time 1 and Time 2) in patients with svPPA (n=11) and bvFTD (n=15) through descriptions of the Cookie Theft picture and evaluated each spoken noun for concreteness. Compared to bvFTD patients whose noun production remained highly concrete throughout the testing period, mixed-effects models revealed that noun concreteness significantly decreased as disease progressed in svPPA. We also measured longitudinal changes to GM in a subset of svPPA patients (n=7), who showed significant decline in the left and right temporal and frontal regions. Regression analyses revealed that longitudinal GM atrophy in the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri and the left superior temporal gyrus was related to decreasing noun concreteness. These results suggest that progressive atrophy of the ventral temporal lobe in svPPA contributes to declining concrete noun production over time.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Semantic memory is the generalizable knowledge of the world around us, including objects, concepts, and words. It is profoundly impaired in a rare form of frontotemporal dementia, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). The specific impairment of concrete concept knowledge in svPPA, compared to abstract concept knowledge, provides important neurolinguistic understanding of how we process word meaning. Yet, almost no studies to date have related longitudinal cognitive changes to progressive neurodegeneration in svPPA. This study is the first to relate progressive atrophy in svPPA to longitudinal semantic changes; we find that progressive grey matter atrophy in right ventral temporal regions is associated with declining production of concrete nouns in svPPA.</p>

Abstract<p>Fear of pain demonstrates significant prognostic value regarding the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain and disability. Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on "fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia", "fear avoidance beliefs" or "pain anxiety", pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with non-specific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied Multiple Kernel Learning approach allowed generating models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of non-overlapping neural predictors within fear processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Pain-related fear, often assessed through self-reports such as questionnaires, has shown prognostic value and clinical utility for a variety of musculoskeletal pain disorders. However, it remains difficult to determine a common underlying construct of pain-related fear due to several proposed constructs among questionnaires. The current study describes a novel neuroscientific approach using machine learning of neural patterns within the fear circuit of chronic low back pain patients that has the potential to identify neural commonalities or differences among the various constructs. Ultimately, this approach might afford a deeper understanding of the suggested constructs and might be also applied to other domains where ambiguity exists between different psychological constructs.</p>

Abstract
<p>BDNF is a critical contributor to neuronal growth, development, learning, and memory. Although extensively studied in the brain, BDNF is also expressed by primary afferent sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Unfortunately, anatomical and functional studies of primary afferent-derived BDNF have been limited by the availability of appropriate molecular tools. Here, we used targeted, inducible molecular approaches to characterize the expression pattern of primary afferent BDNF and the extent to which it contributes to a variety of pain and itch behaviors. Using a <i>BDNF-LacZ</i> reporter mouse, we found that BDNF is expressed primarily by myelinated primary afferents and has limited overlap with the major peptidergic and non-peptidergic subclasses of nociceptors and pruritoceptors. We also observed extensive neuronal, but not glial, expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn. In addition, because BDNF null mice are not viable and even Cre-mediated deletion of BDNF from sensory neurons could have developmental consequences, here we deleted BDNF selectively from sensory neurons, in the adult, using an advillin-Cre-ER line crossed to floxed BDNF mice. We found that BDNF deletion in the adult altered few itch or acute and chronic pain behaviors, beyond sexually dimorphic phenotypes in the tail immersion, histamine, and formalin tests. Based on the anatomical distribution of sensory neuron-derived BDNF and its limited contribution to pain and itch processing, we suggest that future studies of primary afferent-derived BDNF should examine behaviors evoked by activation of myelinated primary afferents.</p>

Abstract
<p>Neurodegeneration is a process transversal to neuropsychiatric diseases and the understanding of its mechanisms should allow devising strategies to prevent this irreversible step in brain diseases. Neurodegeneration caused by seizures is a critical step in the aggravation of temporal lobe epilepsy, but its mechanisms remain undetermined. Convulsions trigger an elevation of extracellular adenosine and upregulate adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>R), which have been associated with the control of neurodegenerative diseases. Using the rat and mouse kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy, we now tested whether A<sub>2A</sub>R control convulsions-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration. The pharmacological or genetic blockade of A<sub>2A</sub>R did not affect kainate-induced convulsions but dampened the subsequent neurotoxicity. This neurotoxicity began with a rapid A<sub>2A</sub>R upregulation within glutamatergic synapses (within 2 h), through local translation of synaptic A<sub>2A</sub>R mRNA. This bolstered A<sub>2A</sub>R-mediated facilitation of glutamate release and of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 synapses (4 h), triggered a subsequent synaptotoxicity, heralded by decreased synaptic plasticity and loss of synaptic markers coupled to calpain activation (12 h), that predated overt neuronal loss (24 h). All modifications were prevented by the deletion of A<sub>2A</sub>R selectively in forebrain neurons. This shows that synaptic A<sub>2A</sub>R critically control synaptic excitotoxicity, which underlies the development of convulsions-induced neurodegeneration.</p>

Abstract
<p>Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) recorded from the ear canal in the absence of sound reflect cochlear amplification, an outer hair cell (OHC) process required for the extraordinary sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing. Although wild-type mice rarely emit, those with mutations that influence the tectorial membrane (TM) show an incidence of SOAEs similar to that in humans. In this report, we characterized mice with a missense mutation in <i>Tecta,</i> a gene required for the formation of the striated-sheet matrix within the core of the TM. Mice heterozygous for the Y1870C mutation (<i>Tecta<sup>Y1870C/+</sup></i>) are prolific emitters, despite a moderate hearing loss. Additionally, Kimura’s membrane, into which the OHC stereocilia insert, separates from the main body of the TM, except at apical cochlear locations. Multimodal SOAEs are also observed in <i>Tecta<sup>Y1870C/+</sup></i> mice where energy is present at frequencies that are integer multiples of a lower-frequency SOAE (the primary). Second-harmonic SOAEs, at twice the frequency of a lower-frequency primary, are the most frequently observed. These secondary SOAEs are found in spatial regions where stimulus-evoked OAEs are small or in the noise floor. Introduction of high-level suppressors just above the primary SOAE frequency reduce or eliminate both primary and second-harmonic SOAEs. In contrast, second-harmonic SOAEs are not affected by suppressors, either above or below the second-harmonic SOAE frequency, even when they are much larger in amplitude. Hence, second-harmonic SOAEs do not appear to be spatially separated from their primaries, a finding that has implications for cochlear mechanics and the consequences of changes to TM structure.</p>

Abstract
<p>Sampling regulates stimulus intensity and temporal dynamics at the sense organ. Despite variations in sampling behavior, animals must make veridical perceptual judgments about external stimuli. In olfaction, odor sampling varies with respiration, which influences neural responses at the olfactory periphery. Nevertheless, rats were able to perform fine odor intensity judgments despite variations in sniff kinetics. To identify the features of neural activity supporting stable intensity perception, in awake mice we measured responses of mitral/tufted (MT) cells to different odors and concentrations across a range of sniff frequencies. Amplitude and latency of the MT cells’ responses vary with sniff duration. A fluid dynamics (FD) model based on odor concentration kinetics in the intranasal cavity can account for this variability. Eliminating sniff waveform dependence of MT cell responses using the FD model allows for significantly better decoding of concentration. This suggests potential schemes for sniff waveform invariant odor concentration coding.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain state–dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty‐four hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to 2 intervention groups: (1) the associative group received 30 pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; and (2) in the control group, the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl–Meyer assessment [LE‐FM; primary outcome measure]) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials [MEPs]) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median [interquartile range] LE‐FM improvement = 6.5 [3.5–8.25] and 3 [0.75–3], respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.006).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically viable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation. Ann Neurol 2018;00:1–12</p>

Williams and Fletcher use optogenetic and high-resolution electrophysiological techniques to demonstrate that the cholinergic system directly controls the electrical excitability of the dendrites of neocortical principal neurons, through the modulation of calcium channels, to powerfully enhance behaviorally relevant associative computations.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To this aim, we performed a 6‐month clinical study with 3 transradial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–18</p>

<p>Networks in the brain consist of different types of neurons. We here
investigate the influence of neuron diversity on the dynamical stability, phase
space structure, and computational capabilities of inhibitory spiking networks
using mixtures of neurons with positive and negative dissipation. We find that
already a single neuron of a different type may qualitatively change the
dynamics of a neural network and that mixed networks can combine the
computational capabilities of ones with only a single neuron type. Our networks
contain leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (positive dissipation) as well as
neurons with inverted sign of the leak current (negative dissipation). We first
show that such networks can exhibit a balanced state of irregular, asynchronous
spiking activity, if the neurons with negative dissipation are endowed with a
voltage-dependent input cutoff, which may be interpreted as a simple
conductance-based implementation of their synapses. We compute the voltage
probability distributions and self-consistent firing rates for both types of
neurons for finite size spike impacts assuming that inputs are Poissonian. The
balanced state exists in a variety of neural network models and its dynamical
properties such as chaoticity vary considerably. Our models generalize networks
of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons where the dynamics are non-chaotic despite
their irregularity. We show that switching the sign of the dissipation of a
single neuron renders the entire network dynamics unstable and chaotic as
indicated by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent. To further characterize the
dynamics we consider the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and the related
covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), which indicate the directions in which
infinitesimal perturbations grow or shrink with a rate given by the Lyapunov
exponents. We find that for each ...

<p>In this overview, we discuss the connections between the observations of
critical dynamics in neuronal networks and the maximum entropy models that are
often used as statistical models of neural activity, focusing in particular on
the relation between "statistical" and "dynamical" criticality. We present
examples of systems that are critical in one way, but not in the other,
exemplifying thus the difference of the two concepts. We then discuss the
emergence of Zipf laws in neural activity, verifying their presence in retinal
activity under a number of different conditions. In the second part of the
chapter we review connections between statistical criticality and the structure
of the parameter space, as described by Fisher information. We note that the
model-based signature of criticality, namely the divergence of specific heat,
emerges independently of the dataset studied; we suggest this is compatible
with previous theoretical findings.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Predictive coding (PC) has been suggested as one of the main mechanisms used by brains to interact with complex environments. PC theories posit top-down prediction signals, which are compared with actual outcomes, yielding in turn prediction error (PE) signals, which are used, bottom-up, to modify the ensuing predictions. However, disentangling prediction from PE signals has been challenging. Critically, while many studies found indirect evidence for PC in the form of PE signals, direct evidence for the prediction signal is mostly lacking. Here, we provide clear evidence, obtained from intracranial cortical recordings in human surgical patients, that the human lateral prefrontal cortex evinces prediction signals while anticipating an event. Patients listened to task-irrelevant sequences of repetitive tones including infrequent predictable or unpredictable pitch deviants. The broadband high-frequency amplitude (HFA) was decreased prior to the onset of expected relative to unexpected deviants in the frontal cortex only, and its amplitude was sensitive to the increasing likelihood of deviants following longer trains of standards in the unpredictable condition. Single-trial HFA predicted deviations and correlated with poststimulus response to deviations. These results provide direct evidence for frontal cortex prediction signals independent of PE signals.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Learning has been proposed to coincide with changes in connections between brain regions. In the present study, we used resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) to map brain-wide functional connectivity (FC) in mice that were trained in the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze. C57BL6 mice were investigated in a small animal MRI scanner following 2, 10, or 15 days of acquisition learning, or 5 days of reversal learning. Spatial learning coincided with progressive and changing FC between telencephalic regions that have been implemented in spatial learning (such as hippocampus, cingulate, visual, and motor cortex). Search strategy assessment demonstrated that the use of cognitively advanced spatial strategies correlated positively with extensive telencephalic connectivity, whereas non-spatial strategies correlated negatively with connectivity. FC patterns were different and more extensive after reversal learning compared with after extended acquisition learning, which could explain why reversal learning has been shown to be more sensitive to subtle functional defects.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a decrease in glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) expression, the major mechanism for glutamate removal from synapses. Coupled with an increase in glutamate release from dead and dying neurons, this causes an increase in extracellular glutamate. The ensuing glutamate excitotoxicity disproportionately damages vulnerable GABAergic parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons, resulting in a progressively worsening cortical excitatory:inhibitory imbalance due to a loss of GABAergic inhibitory tone, as evidenced by chronic post-traumatic symptoms such as epilepsy, and supported by neuropathologic findings. This loss of intracortical inhibition can be measured and followed noninvasively using long-interval paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with mechanomyography (LI-ppTMS-MMG). Ceftriaxone, a β-lactam antibiotic, is a potent stimulator of the expression of rodent GLT-1 and would presumably decrease excitotoxic damage to GABAergic interneurons. It may thus be a viable antiepileptogenic intervention. Using a rat fluid percussion injury TBI model, we utilized LI-ppTMS-MMG, quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry to test whether ceftriaxone treatment preserves intracortical inhibition and cortical parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneuron function after TBI in rat motor cortex. We show that neocortical GLT-1 gene and protein expression are significantly reduced 1 week after TBI, and this transient loss is mitigated by ceftriaxone. Importantly, whereas intracortical inhibition declines progressively after TBI, 1 week of post-TBI ceftriaxone treatment attenuates the loss of inhibition compared to saline-treated controls. This finding is accompanied by significantly higher parvalbumin gene and protein expression in ceftriaxone-treated injured rats. Our results highlight prospects for ceftriaxone as an intervention after TBI to prevent cortical inhibitory interneuron dysfunction, partly by preserving GLT-1 expression.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Memory retrieval is thought to depend on interactions between hippocampus and cortex, but the nature of representation in these regions and their relationship remains unclear. Here, we performed an ultra-high field fMRI (7T) experiment, comprising perception, learning and retrieval sessions. We observed a fundamental difference between representations in hippocampus and high-level visual cortex during perception and retrieval. First, while object-selective posterior fusiform cortex showed consistent responses that allowed us to decode object identity across both perception and retrieval one day after learning, object decoding in hippocampus was much stronger during retrieval than perception. Second, in visual cortex but not hippocampus, there was consistency in response patterns between perception and retrieval, suggesting that substantial neural populations are shared for both perception and retrieval. Finally, the decoding in hippocampus during retrieval was not observed when retrieval was tested on the same day as learning suggesting that the retrieval process itself is not sufficient to elicit decodable object representations. Collectively, these findings suggest that while cortical representations are stable between perception and retrieval, hippocampal representations are much stronger during retrieval, implying some form of reorganization of the representations between perception and retrieval.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in molecular pathways responsible for aging and prevalent aging-related chronic diseases. However, the lack of research linking circulating levels of miRNAs to changes in the aging brain hampers clinical translation. Here, we have investigated if serum expression of brain-enriched miRNAs that have been proposed as potential biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-125b, and miR-146a) are also associated with cognitive functioning and changes of the cerebral cortex in normal elderly subjects. Results revealed that candidate miRNAs were linked to changes in cortical thickness (miR-9, miR-29b, miR-34a, and miR-125b), cortical glucose metabolism (miR-29b, miR-125b, and miR-146a), and cognitive performance (miR-9, miR-34a, and miR-125b). While both miR-29b and miR-125b were related to aging-related structural and metabolic cortical changes, only expression levels of miR-125b were associated with patterns of glucose consumption shown by cortical regions that correlated with executive function. Together, these findings suggest that serum expression of AD-related miRNAs are biologically meaningful in aging and may play a role as biomarkers of cerebral vulnerability in late life.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is a major region of the adult rodent brain in which neurogenesis occurs throughout life. The EphA4 receptor, which regulates neurogenesis and boundary formation in the developing brain, is also expressed in the adult DG, but whether it regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not known. Here, we show that, in the adult mouse brain, EphA4 inhibits hippocampal precursor cell proliferation but does not affect precursor differentiation or survival. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of EphA4 significantly increased hippocampal precursor proliferation <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span>, by blocking EphA4 forward signaling. EphA4 was expressed by mature hippocampal DG neurons but not neural precursor cells, and an EphA4 antagonist, EphA4-Fc, did not activate clonal cultures of precursors until they were co-cultured with non-precursor cells, indicating an indirect effect of EphA4 on the regulation of precursor activity. Supplementation with <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-serine blocked the increased precursor proliferation induced by EphA4 inhibition, whereas blocking the interaction between <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-serine and <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>-methyl-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) promoted precursor activity, even at the clonal level. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EphA4 indirectly regulates adult hippocampal precursor proliferation and thus plays a role in neurogenesis via <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">d</span>-serine-regulated NMDAR signaling.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Metacognition, the ability to know about one’s thought process, is self-referential. Here, we combined psychophysics and time-resolved neuroimaging to explore metacognitive inference on the accuracy of a self-generated behavior. Human participants generated a time interval and evaluated the signed magnitude of their temporal production. We show that both self-generation and self-evaluation relied on the power of beta oscillations (β; 15–40 Hz) with increases in early β power predictive of increases in duration. We characterized the dynamics of β power in a low-dimensional space (β state-space trajectories) as a function of timing and found that the more distinct trajectories, the more accurate metacognitive inferences were. These results suggest that β states instantiate an internal variable determining the fate of the timing network’s trajectory, possibly as release from inhibition. Altogether, our study describes oscillatory mechanisms for timing, suggesting that temporal metacognition relies on inferential processes of self-generated dynamics.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Unilateral dorsal column lesions (DCL) at the cervical spinal cord deprive the hand regions of somatosensory cortex of tactile activation. However, considerable cortical reactivation occurs over weeks to months of recovery. While most studies focused on the reactivation of primary somatosensory area 3b, here, for the first time, we address how the higher-order somatosensory cortex reactivates in the same monkeys after DCL that vary across cases in completeness, post-lesion recovery times, and types of treatments. We recorded neural responses to tactile stimulation in areas 3a, 3b, 1, secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and occasionally areas 2/5. Our analysis emphasized comparisons of the responsiveness, somatotopy, and receptive field size between areas 3b, 1, and S2/PV across DCL conditions and recovery times. The results indicate that the extents of the reactivation in higher-order somatosensory areas 1 and S2/PV closely reflect the reactivation in primary somatosensory cortex. Responses in higher-order areas S2 and PV can be stronger than those in area 3b, thus suggesting converging or alternative sources of inputs. The results also provide evidence that both primary and higher-order fields are effectively activated after long recovery times as well as after behavioral and electrocutaneous stimulation interventions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div><span style="font-style: italic;">erbb4</span> is a known susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Chandelier cells (ChCs, also known as axo-axonic cells) are a distinct GABAergic interneuron subtype that exclusively target the axonal initial segment, which is the site of pyramidal neuron action potential initiation. ChCs are a source of ErbB4 expression and alterations in ChC-pyramidal neuron connectivity occur in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of schizophrenic patients and animal models of schizophrenia. However, the contribution of ErbB4 in mPFC ChCs to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remains unknown. By conditional deletion or knockdown of ErbB4 from mPFC ChCs, we demonstrated that ErbB4 deficits led to impaired ChC-pyramidal neuron connections and cognitive dysfunctions. Furthermore, the cognitive dysfunctions were normalized by L-838417, an agonist of GABA<sub>A</sub>α2 receptors enriched in the axonal initial segment. Given that cognitive dysfunctions are a core symptom of schizophrenia, our results may provide a new perspective for understanding the etiology of schizophrenia and suggest that GABA<sub>A</sub>α2 receptors may be potential pharmacological targets for its treatment.</span>

Abstract<p>Menthol contributes to poor cessation rates among smokers, in part because menthol enhances nicotine reward and reinforcement. Mentholated tobacco products contain (–)-menthol and (+)-menthol, in varying proportions. We examined these two menthol stereoisomers for their ability to upregulate α4β2 nAChRs and to alter dopamine neuron firing frequency using long-term, low-dose (≤ 500 nM) exposure that is pharmacologically relevant to smoking. We found that (–)-menthol upregulates α4β2 nAChRs while (+)-menthol does not. We also found that (–)-menthol decreases dopamine neuron baseline firing and dopamine neuron excitability, while (+)-menthol exhibits no effect. We then examined both stereoisomers for their ability to inhibit α4β2 nAChR function at higher concentrations (&gt;10 µM) using the <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte expression system. To probe for the potential binding site of menthol, we conducted flooding simulations and site-directed mutagenesis. We found that menthol likely binds to the 9’ position on the TM2 helix. We found that menthol inhibition is dependent on the end-to-end distance of the side chain at the 9’ residue. Additionally, we have found that (–)-menthol is only modestly (~25%) more potent than (+)-menthol at inhibiting wildtype α4β2 nAChRs and a series of L9’ mutant nAChRs. These data reveal that menthol exhibits a stereoselective effect on nAChRs and that the stereochemical effect is much greater for long-term, sub µM exposure in mice than for acute, higher level exposure. We hypothesize that of the two menthol stereoisomers, only (–)-menthol plays a role in enhancing nicotine reward through nAChRs on dopamine neurons.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Menthol is the most popular flavor used in all forms of tobacco products. Depending on the method used to produce the menthol, these products contain two stereoisomers ((–)-menthol and (+)-menthol) in unregulated and poorly characterized amounts. We studied how these isomers of menthol differ in their ability to alter nicotinic receptors on dopamine neurons that contribute to tobacco addiction. Long-term treatment with (–)-menthol and (+)-menthol resulted in a stereospecific effect on nicotinic receptor upregulation and dopamine neuron excitability: (+)-menthol exhibited no effect while (–)-menthol exhibited a robust effect. In acute treatments, we found only slight differences between effects of the two isomers on nicotine receptors. This suggests that long-term exposure to (–)-menthol may contribute to exacerbating tobacco addiction.</p>

Abstract<p>Transparent and flexible materials are attractive for a wide range of emerging bioelectronic applications. These include neural interfacing devices for both recording and stimulation, where low electrochemical electrode impedance is valuable. Here the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is utilized to fabricate electrodes that are small enough to allow unencumbered optical access for imaging a large cell population with two-photon (2P) microscopy, yet provide low impedance for simultaneous high quality recordings of neural activity <i>in vivo</i>. To demonstrate this, pathophysiological activity was induced in the mouse cortex using 4-aminopyridine (4AP) and the resulting electrical activity was detected with the PEDOT:PSS-based probe while imaging calcium activity directly below the probe area. The induced calcium activity of the neuronal network as measured by the fluorescence change in the cells correlated well with the electrophysiological recordings from the cortical grid of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes. Our approach provides a valuable vehicle for complementing classical high temporal resolution electrophysiological analysis with optical imaging.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Electrophysiological recordings, with varying degrees of invasiveness, are the traditional method for measuring neural activity, possessing the capability to measure both individual neurons and populations of neurons. Imaging methods, such as computed tomography scans and functional magnetic resonance imaging, have been developed to accomplish less invasive characterization of neuronal activity; traditionally offering good spatial or relatively high temporal resolution, yet resolution of individual neurons cannot be achieved. Two-photon imaging enables network-wide analysis with cellular resolution on a faster timescale with high spatial fidelity. This study presents a method for the combination of two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recordings with highly transparent arrays of organic electrodes, presenting a powerful tool to simultaneously acquire the electrical and optical activity of neural circuits.</p>

<p>In this study, we evaluate the role of the thalamus in the neural circuitry of arousal. Level of consciousness within the first 12 hours of a thalamic stroke is assessed with lesion symptom mapping. Impaired arousal correlates with lesions in the paramedian posterior thalamus near the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, posterior hypothalamus, and midbrain tegmentum. All patients with severely impaired arousal (coma, stupor) had lesion extension into the midbrain and/or pontine tegmentum, whereas purely thalamic lesions did not severely impair arousal. These results are consistent with growing evidence that pathways most critical for human arousal lie outside the thalamus. Ann Neurol 2018;84:926–930</p>

<p>Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‐matched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using 2‐way analysis of variance with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in milliseconds, VS: 152.7 ± 7.9 vs M: 145.3 ± 9.8 vs C: 145.5 ± 9.4; <i>F</i> = 3.28; <i>p</i> = 0.046) and reduced N75–P100 amplitudes (in microvolts, VS: 7.4 ± 3.5 vs M: 12.5 ± 4.7 vs C: 10.8 ± 3.4; <i>F</i> = 3.16; <i>p</i> = 0.051). Dunnett post hoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Galloway–Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a neural and renal disorder, characterized by microcephaly, brain anomalies, and early onset nephrotic syndrome. Biallelic mutations in <i>WDR73</i> and the 4 subunit genes of the KEOPS complex are reported to cause GAMOS. Furthermore, an identical homozygous <i>NUP107</i> (nucleoporin 107kDa) mutation was identified in 4 GAMOS‐like families, although biallelic <i>NUP107</i> mutations were originally identified in steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome. NUP107 and NUP133 (nucleoporin 133kDa) are interacting subunits of the nuclear pore complex in the nuclear envelope during interphase, and these proteins are also involved in centrosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in a previously reported GAMOS family with brain atrophy and steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a homozygous <i>NUP133</i> mutation, c.3335‐11T&gt;A, which results in the insertion of 9bp of intronic sequence between exons 25 and 26 in the mutant transcript. NUP133 and NUP107 interaction was impaired by the <i>NUP133</i> mutation based on an immunoprecipitation assay. Importantly, focal cortical dysplasia type IIa was recognized in the brain of an autopsied patient and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was confirmed in the kidneys of the 3 examined patients. A <i>nup133</i>‐knockdown zebrafish model exhibited microcephaly, fewer neuronal cells, underdeveloped glomeruli, and fusion of the foot processes of the podocytes, which mimicked human GAMOS features. <i>nup133</i> morphants could be rescued by human wild‐type <i>NUP133</i> mRNA but not by mutant mRNA.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data indicate that the biallelic <i>NUP133</i> loss‐of‐function mutation causes GAMOS. Ann Neurol 2018;84:814–828</p>

<p>We conducted a European‐only and transancestral genome‐wide association meta‐analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in <i>NOS3</i> (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; <i>p</i> = 2.2E‐8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.07) and variants in an intron of <i>COL4A1</i> (rs9521634; <i>p</i> = 3.8E‐8, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03–1.06) and near <i>DYRK1A</i> (rs720470; <i>p</i> = 6.1E‐9, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03–1.07) at genome‐wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian randomization, we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase–nitric oxide pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.

<p>A professional violinist reported increasing difficulties playing the violin. He executed the initial half of the musical piece well, but produced an increasing number of mistakes during the second half. Neurological examination was remarkable for bradykinesia and tremor. Formal acoustic analysis of finger taps and pronation‐supination showed a decrement in sound intensity and number of taps over time. Oscillations in performance correlated with a parkinsonian tremor. We interpret these findings as the audible equivalent of bradykinesia and tremor. Listening to bradykinesia and quantifying its decrement using acoustic analysis may offer a simple, objective, and reliable supplement to the neurological examination. Ann Neurol 2018;84:931–933.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> variants is around 20 to 30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 families with suspected <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. We validated the role of <i>COLGALT1</i> variants by constructing a 3‐dimensional structural model, evaluating collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1 (ColGalT1) protein expression and ColGalT activity by Western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing in vitro RNA interference and rescue experiments.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in <i>COLGALT1</i> encoding ColGalT1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in 2 unrelated patients: c.452 T &gt; G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G &gt; C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G &gt; C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. Three‐dimensional model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant <i>COLGALT1</i> insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild type.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The trigeminal autonomic reflex plays an important role in primary headache syndromes. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) may be an effective modulator of this reflex.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty‐two healthy volunteers underwent kinetic oscillation stimulation (KOS) of the left nostril as a reliable trigger of the trigeminal autonomic reflex. Previous to KOS, left cervical nVNS, sham simulation, or no stimulation was applied. Lacrimation was quantified using the standardized Schirmer ll test.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Treatment with cervical nVNS significantly reduced lacrimation between no stimulation and nVNS on the ipsilateral side (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.026, η<i>p</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–18.04; no stimulation: minute 5, 14.4 ± 9.3 mm; nVNS: minute 5, 4.7 ± 8.6 mm, mean ± standard deviation) as well as between sham stimulation and nVNS (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.030, η<i>p</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.85, 95% CI = 1.04–17.24; sham: minute 5, 13.9 ± 6.4 mm). On the contralateral side, no significant increase between baseline and KOS was observed for nVNS (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.614, <i>d</i> = 0.12, 95% CI = −7.09 to 4.31; minute 5, 1.4 ± 11.5 mm) compared to both sham stimulation (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.023, <i>d</i> = 0.57, 95% CI = −11.46 to −0.96; minute 5, 6.2 ± 10.9 mm) and no stimulation (minute 5: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.030, <i>d</i> = 0.62, 95% CI = −13.45 to −0.81; minute 5, 7.1 ± 11.4 mm).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cervical nVNS resulted in a robust bilateral reduction of provoked lacrimation. This effect could be mediated either by direct bilateral activation of structures such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or by a top‐down modulation via the hypothalamus. Ann Neurol 2018;84:886–892</p>

<p>by Marius Somveille, Josh A. Firth, Lucy M. Aplin, Damien R. Farine, Ben C. Sheldon, Robin N. Thompson</p>

The social transmission of information is critical to the emergence of animal culture. Two processes are predicted to play key roles in how socially-transmitted information spreads in animal populations: the movement of individuals across the landscape and conformist social learning. We develop a model that, for the first time, explicitly integrates these processes to investigate their impacts on the spread of behavioural preferences. Our results reveal a strong interplay between movement and conformity in determining whether locally-variable traditions establish across a landscape or whether a single preference dominates the whole population. The model is able to replicate a real-world cultural diffusion experiment in great tits <i>Parus major</i>, but also allows for a range of predictions for the emergence of animal culture under various initial conditions, habitat structure and strength of conformist bias to be made. Integrating social behaviour with ecological variation will be important for understanding the stability and diversity of culture in animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3hKz0zBUfxM" width="1" />

Population-wide fluctuations of neural population activity are widely observed in cortical recordings. Huang et al. show that turbulent dynamics in spatially ordered recurrent networks give rise to low-dimensional shared variability, which can be suppressed by depolarizing inhibitory neurons.

Koolschijn et al. reveal two distinct mechanisms that protect overlapping memories from interference in the human brain. One involves separating memories in the hippocampus. The other involves neocortical inhibition, which protects against memory interference unless GABA is reduced using brain stimulation.

Abstract
<p>Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc shows distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-&gt;NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50–12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA-&gt;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4- to 7-s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-&gt;NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-&gt;NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.</p>

Abstract<p>While PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is well characterized for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, much less is known concerning its ability to prevent synaptodendritic degeneration. Using unbiased proteomic methods, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a major PINK1-interacting protein. RNAi studies demonstrate that both VCP and its cofactor NSFL1C/p47 are necessary for the ability of PINK1 to increase dendritic complexity. Moreover, PINK1 regulates phosphorylation of p47, but not the VCP co-factor UFD1. Although neither VCP nor p47 interact directly with PKA, we found that PINK1 binds and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PKA at T197 (PKA<sub>cat</sub>(pT197)), a site known to activate the PKA holoenzyme. PKA in turn phosphorylates p47 at a novel site (S176) to regulate dendritic complexity. Given that PINK1 physically interacts with both the PKA holoenzyme and the VCP-p47 complex to promote dendritic arborization, we propose that PINK1 scaffolds a novel PINK1-VCP-PKA-p47 signaling pathway to orchestrate dendritogenesis in neurons. These findings highlight an important mechanism by which proteins genetically implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PINK1) and frontotemporal dementia (VCP) interact to support the health and maintenance of neuronal arbors.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This study delineates a novel molecular mechanism by which PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and valosin-containing protein (VCP) interact to promote dendritic arborization.</p>

Abstract<p>A multi-electrode system that can address widely-separated targets at multiple sites across multiple brain regions with independent implant angling is needed to investigate neural function and signaling in systems and circuits of small animals. Here, we present the systemDrive: a novel multi-site, multi-region microdrive that is capable of moving microwire electrode bundles into targets along independent and non-parallel drive trajectories. Our design decouples the stereotaxic surgical placement of individual guide cannulas for each trajectory from the placement of a flexible drive structure. This separation enables placement of many microwire multitrodes along widely-spaced and independent drive axes with user-set electrode trajectories and depths from a single microdrive body, and achieves stereotaxic precision with each. The system leverages tight tube-cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on flexible drive axes to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas. Additionally, the headmount and microdrive both have an open-center design to allow for the placement of additional sensing modalities. This design is the first, in the context of small rodent chronic research, to provide the capability to finely position microwires through multiple widely distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and non-parallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. We demonstrate the use of the systemDrive in male Long Evans rats to observe simultaneous single- and multi- unit activity from multiple widely-separated sleep-wake regulatory brainstem cell groups, along with cortical and hippocampal activity, during free behavior over multiple many-day continuous recording periods.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The novel design of the systemDrive overcomes current microdrive limitations by providing the ability to finely position microwires through multiple widely-distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and non-parallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. This allows for targeting of a larger set of brain regions, including deep brainstem areas, as the electrodes do not emerge from a single area, initial driving points can be placed at set distances from targets, and electrodes can be placed along trajectories designed to minimize collateral damage to sensitive brain structures. This technology enables easier simultaneous monitoring and analysis of neural activity in multiple widely-spaced brain regions that comprise a fully interconnected neural circuit.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>It has been reported that fast-acting antidepressants enhance glutamatergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions via alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the fast-acting antidepressants lead to an activation of AMPAR pathways remain largely unclear. To address this issue, a novel AMPAR positive allosteric agonist, PF-4778574, was used to test the rapid effects and the role of VGF (nonacronymic)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/AKT signaling in these actions in mice. We found that PF-4778574 rapidly alleviated chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behaviors in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, knock down of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) in the PFC of mice induced depression-like behaviors, whereas treatment with PF-4778574 was sufficient to alleviate it, indicating a presynaptic VGLUT1 independent effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibitors of AMPAR or of L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (L-VDCC) blocked the antidepressants’ effect on behaviors and the upregulation on the AMPAR-mediated VGF/BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling of PF-4778574. Together, our findings indicate that postsynaptic AMPAR activation followed by activation of L-VDCC and subsequent VGF/BDNF/TrkB/AKT signaling are required for the rapid antidepressant effects of PF-4778574. Our data support a promising therapeutic profile for PF-4778574 as a new fast-acting antidepressant.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the majority of neuroimaging studies have focused on the analysis of cortical morphology. White matter changes remain less understood, particularly their association to cortical structure and function. Here, we focused on region that has gained only little attention in ASD neuroimaging: the superficial white matter (SWM) immediately beneath the cortical interface, a compartment playing a prominent role in corticogenesis that incorporates long- and short-range fibers implicated in corticocortical connectivity. Studying a multicentric dataset of ASD and neurotypical controls, we harnessed surface-based techniques to aggregate microstructural SWM diffusion features. Multivariate analysis revealed SWM anomalies in ASD compared with controls in medial parietal and temporoparietal regions. Effects were similar in children and adolescents/adults and consistent across sites. Although SWM anomalies were more confined when correcting for cortical thickness and surface area, findings were overall robust. Diffusion anomalies modulated functional connectivity reductions in ASD and related to symptom severity. Furthermore, mediation models indicated a link between SWM changes, functional connectivity, and symptom load. Analyses targeting the SWM offer a novel perspective on the interplay between structural and functional network perturbations in ASD, highlighting a potentially important neurobiological substrate contributing to its diverse behavioral phenotype.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>When moving, the spatiotemporal unfolding of events is bound to our physical trajectory, and time and space become entangled in episodic memory. When imagining past or future events, or being in different geographical locations, the temporal and spatial dimensions of mental events can be independently accessed and manipulated. Using time-resolved neuroimaging, we characterized brain activity while participants ordered historical events from different mental perspectives in time (e.g., when imagining being 9 years in the future) or in space (e.g., when imagining being in Cayenne). We describe 2 neural signatures of temporal ordinality: an early brain response distinguishing whether participants were mentally in the past, the present or the future (self-projection in time), and a graded activity at event retrieval, indexing the mental distance between the representation of the self in time and the event. Neural signatures of ordinality and symbolic distances in time were distinct from those observed in the homologous spatial task: activity indicating spatial order and distances overlapped in latency in distinct brain regions. We interpret our findings as evidence that the conscious representation of time and space share algorithms (egocentric mapping, distance, and ordinality computations) but different implementations with a distinctive status for the psychological “time arrow.”</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Tau and amyloid β (Aβ), 2 key pathogenic proteins in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), reportedly spread throughout the brain as the disease progresses. Models of how these pathogenic proteins spread from affected to unaffected areas had been proposed based on the observation that these proteins could transmit to other regions either through neural fibers (transneuronal spread model) or through extracellular space (local spread model). In this study, we modeled the spread of tau and Aβ using a graph theoretical approach based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We tested whether these models predict the distribution of tau and Aβ in the brains of AD spectrum patients. To assess the models’ performance, we calculated spatial correlation between the model-predicted map and the actual map from tau and amyloid positron emission tomography. The transneuronal spread model predicted the distribution of tau and Aβ deposition with significantly higher accuracy than the local spread model. Compared with tau, the local spread model also predicted a comparable portion of Aβ deposition. These findings provide evidence of transneuronal spread of AD pathogenic proteins in a large-scale brain network and furthermore suggest different contributions of spread models for tau and Aβ in AD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Females might possess protective mechanisms regarding autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and require a higher detrimental load, including structural brain alterations, before developing clinically relevant levels of autistic traits. This study examines sex differences in structural brain morphology in autism and autistic traits using a within-twin pair approach. Twin design inherently controls for shared confounders and enables the study of gene-independent neuroanatomical variation. <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 148 twins (62 females) from 49 monozygotic and 25 dizygotic same-sex pairs were included. Participants were distributed along the whole continuum of autism including twin pairs discordant and concordant for clinical ASD. Regional brain volume, surface area, and cortical thickness were computed. Within-twin pair increases in autistic traits were related to decreases in cortical volume and surface area of temporal and frontal regions specifically in female twin pairs, in particular regions involved in social communication, while only two regions were associated with autistic traits in males. The same pattern was detected in the monozygotic twin pairs only. Thus, non-shared environmental factors seem to impact female more than male cerebral architecture associated with autistic traits. Our results are in line with the hypothesis of a female protective effect in autism and highlights the need to study ASD in females separately from males.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopamine modulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates diverse effects on neuronal physiology and function, but the expression of dopamine receptors at subpopulations of projection neurons and interneurons remains unresolved. Here, we examine D1 receptor expression and modulation at specific cell types and layers in the mouse prelimbic PFC. We first show that D1 receptors are enriched in pyramidal cells in both layers 5 and 6, and that these cells project to intratelencephalic targets including contralateral cortex, striatum, and claustrum rather than to extratelencephalic structures. We then find that D1 receptors are also present in interneurons and enriched in superficial layer VIP-positive (VIP+) interneurons that coexpresses calretinin but absent from parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons. Finally, we determine that D1 receptors strongly and selectively enhance action potential firing in only a subset of these corticocortical neurons and VIP+ interneurons. Our findings define several novel subpopulations of D1+ neurons, highlighting how modulation via D1 receptors can influence both excitatory and disinhibitory microcircuits in the PFC.</span>

<p>A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception <i>in vivo</i> by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, DPCPX; 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons shows that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of EPSCs but not IPSCs. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK)-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0241-18.2018?rss=1">Superior Visual Timing Sensitivity in Auditory But Not Visual World Class Drum Corps Experts</a></h4>

<p>World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from the color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly subdivide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments (TOJs) more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right, called a TOJ. Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard members from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did the color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 ms (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 ms (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intramodally, even when intramodal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the timing sensitivity of the nervous system.</p>

Advances in sequencing technology have significantly expanded our understanding of the genetics of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Continued technological improvements and cost reductions have now shifted the focus to investigations into the functional noncoding portions of the genome. There is a patient trend toward an excess of de novo and potentially disruptive mutations among conserved noncoding sequences implicated in the regulation of genes. The signals become stronger when restricted to genes already implicated in NDDs, but de novo mutation in such elements is estimated to account for &lt;5% of patients.

About 330 CNS cells comprise mostly ciliated ependymal cells, with ∼180 neurons that constitute about 50 morphologically distinguishable types. The neurons reveal various chordate characters amid many features that are idiosyncratic. Most neurons are ciliated and lack dendrites, some even lack an axon. Synapses mostly form en passant between axons, and resemble those in basal invertebrates; some are dyads and all have heterogenous synaptic vesicle populations. Each neuron has on average 49 synapses with other cells; these constitute a synaptic network of unpredicted complexity.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: April 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 55</p><p>Author(s): Eric Schulz, Samuel J. Gershman</p><div><p>Balancing exploration and exploitation is one of the central problems in reinforcement learning. We review recent studies that have identified multiple algorithmic strategies underlying exploration. In particular, humans use a combination of random and uncertainty-directed exploration strategies, which rely on different brain systems, have different developmental trajectories, and are sensitive to different task manipulations. Humans are also able to exploit sophisticated structural knowledge to aid their exploration, such as information about correlations between options. New computational models, drawing inspiration from machine learning, have begun to formalize these ideas and offer new ways to understand the neural basis of reinforcement learning.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Eran A Mukamel, John Ngai</p><div><p>The diversity of brain cell types was one of the earliest observations in modern neuroscience and continues to be one of the central concerns of current neuroscience research. Despite impressive recent progress, including single cell transcriptome and epigenome profiling as well as anatomical methods, we still lack a complete census or taxonomy of brain cell types. We argue this is due partly to the conceptual difficulty in defining a cell type. By considering the biological drivers of cell identity, such as networks of genes and gene regulatory elements, we propose a definition of cell type that emphasizes self-stabilizing regulation. We explore the predictions and hypotheses that arise from this definition. Integration of data from multiple modalities, including molecular profiling of genes and gene products, epigenetic landscape, cellular morphology, connectivity, and physiology, will be essential for a meaningful and broadly useful definition of brain cell types.</p></div>

In this brief review, we emphasize interspecies comparisons and an evolutionary perspective regarding the astro(glia) of vertebrates and invertebrates which are similar in form and function.
