<p>Although Shannon mutual information has been widely used, its effective
calculation is often difficult for many practical problems, including those in
neural population coding. Asymptotic formulas based on Fisher information
sometimes provide accurate approximations to the mutual information but this
approach is restricted to continuous variables because the calculation of
Fisher information requires derivatives with respect to the encoded variables.
In this paper, we consider information-theoretic bounds and approximations of
the mutual information based on Kullback--Leibler divergence and R\'{e}nyi
divergence. We propose several information metrics to approximate Shannon
mutual information in the context of neural population coding. While our
asymptotic formulas all work for discrete variables, one of them has consistent
performance and high accuracy regardless of whether the encoded variables are
discrete or continuous. We performed numerical simulations and confirmed that
our approximation formulas were highly accurate for approximating the mutual
information between the stimuli and the responses of a large neural population.
These approximation formulas may potentially bring convenience to the
applications of information theory to many practical and theoretical problems.

<p>Neural network models can now recognise images, understand text, translate
languages, and play many human games at human or superhuman levels. These
systems are highly abstracted, but are inspired by biological brains and use
only biologically plausible computations. In the coming years, neural networks
are likely to become less reliant on learning from massive labelled datasets,
and more robust and generalisable in their task performance. From their
successes and failures, we can learn about the computational requirements of
the different tasks at which brains excel. Deep learning also provides the
tools for testing cognitive theories. In order to test a theory, we need to
realise the proposed information-processing system at scale, so as to be able
to assess its feasibility and emergent behaviours. Deep learning allows us to
scale up from principles and circuit models to end-to-end trainable models
capable of performing complex tasks. There are many levels at which cognitive
neuroscientists can use deep learning in their work, from inspiring theories to
serving as full computational models. Ongoing advances in deep learning bring
us closer to understanding how cognition and perception may be implemented in
the brain -- the grand challenge at the core of cognitive neuroscience.

<p>by Songting Li, Nan Liu, Li Yao, Xiaohui Zhang, Douglas Zhou, David Cai</p>

The interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons imparts rich functions of the brain. To understand the synaptic mechanisms underlying neuronal computations, a fundamental approach is to study the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs of each neuron. The traditional method of determining input conductance, which has been applied for decades, employs the synaptic current-voltage (I-V) relation obtained via voltage clamp. Due to the space clamp effect, the measured conductance is different from the local conductance on the dendrites. Therefore, the interpretation of the measured conductance remains to be clarified. Using theoretical analysis, electrophysiological experiments, and realistic neuron simulations, here we demonstrate that there does not exist a transform between the local conductance and the conductance measured by the traditional method, due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp current and the synaptic current in the traditional method. Consequently, the conductance determined by the traditional method may not correlate with the local conductance on the dendrites, and its value could be unphysically negative as observed in experiment. To circumvent the challenge of the space clamp effect and elucidate synaptic impact on neuronal information processing, we propose the concept of effective conductance which is proportional to the local conductance on the dendrite and reflects directly the functional influence of synaptic inputs on somatic membrane potential dynamics, and we further develop a framework to determine the effective conductance accurately. Our work suggests re-examination of previous studies involving conductance measurement and provides a reliable approach to assess synaptic influence on neuronal computation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FPF0lnwu3Cs" width="1" />

<p>by Maor Grinberg, Tomer Orevi, Nadav Kashtan</p>

Early bacterial surface colonization is not a random process wherein cells arbitrarily attach to surfaces and grow; but rather, attachment events, movement and cellular interactions induce non-random spatial organization. We have only begun to understand how the apparent self-organization affects the fitness of the population. A key factor contributing to fitness is the tradeoff between solitary-planktonic and aggregated surface-attached biofilm lifestyles. Though planktonic cells typically grow faster, bacteria in aggregates are more resistant to stress such as desiccation, antibiotics and predation. Here we ask if and to what extent informed surface-attachments improve fitness during early surface colonization under periodic stress conditions. We use an individual-based modeling approach to simulate foraging planktonic cells colonizing a surface under alternating wet-dry cycles. Such cycles are common in the largest terrestrial microbial habitats–soil, roots, and leaf surfaces–that are not constantly saturated with water and experience daily periods of desiccation stress. We compared different surface-attachment strategies, and analyzed the emerging spatio-temporal dynamics of surface colonization and population yield as a measure of fitness. We demonstrate that a simple strategy of preferential attachment (PA), biased to dense sites, carries a large fitness advantage over any random attachment across a broad range of environmental conditions–particularly under periodic stress.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8cGSfKCRElk" width="1" />

Tumor therapy with replication competent viruses is an exciting approach to cancer eradication where viruses are engineered to specifically infect, replicate, spread and kill tumor cells. The outcome of tumor virotherapy is complex due to the variable interactions between the cancer cell and virus populations as well as the immune response. Oncolytic viruses are highly efficient in killing tumor cells in vitro, especially in a 2D monolayer of tumor cells, their efficiency is significantly lower in a 3D environment, both in vitro and in vivo. This indicates that the spatial dimension may have a major influence on the dynamics of virus spread. We study the dynamic behavior of a spatially explicit computational model of tumor and virus interactions using a combination of in vitro 2D and 3D experimental studies to inform the models. We determine the number of nearest neighbor tumor cells in 2D (median = 6) and 3D tumor spheroids (median = 16) and how this influences virus spread and the outcome of therapy. The parameter range leading to tumor eradication is small and even harder to achieve in 3D. The lower efficiency in 3D exists despite the presence of many more adjacent cells in the 3D environment that results in a shorter time to reach equilibrium. The mean field mathematical models generally used to describe tumor virotherapy appear to provide an overoptimistic view of the outcomes of therapy. Three dimensional space provides a significant barrier to efficient and complete virus spread within tumors and needs to be explicitly taken into account for virus optimization to achieve the desired outcome of therapy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nR2eiF7k9D8" width="1" />

<p>by Karin Münch, Richard Münch, Rebekka Biedendieck, Dieter Jahn, Johannes Müller</p>

Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA elements of microorganisms encoding beneficial genetic information. They were thought to be equally distributed to daughter cells during cell division. Here we use mathematical modeling to investigate the evolutionary stability of plasmid segregation for high-copy plasmids—plasmids that are present in up to several hundred copies per cell—carrying antibiotic resistance genes. Evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) are determined by numerical analysis of a plasmid-load structured population model. The theory predicts that the evolutionary stable segregation strategy of a cell depends on the plasmid copy number: For low and medium plasmid load, both daughters receive in average an equal share of plasmids, while in case of high plasmid load, one daughter obtains distinctively and systematically more plasmids. These findings are in good agreement with recent experimental results. We discuss the interpretation and practical consequences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aAgbikMsP0Q" width="1" />

The advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has opened new perspectives in deciphering the genetic mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Nowadays, the amount of genomic data is massive and substantial efforts and new tools are required to unveil the information hidden in the data. The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal is a platform that contains different genomic studies including the ones from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiatives, accounting for more than 40 tumor types originating from nearly 30000 patients. Such platforms, although very attractive, must make sure the stored data are easily accessible and adequately harmonized. Moreover, they have the primary focus on the data storage in a unique place, and they do not provide a comprehensive toolkit for analyses and interpretation of the data. To fulfill this urgent need, comprehensive but easily accessible computational methods for integrative analyses of genomic data that do not renounce a robust statistical and theoretical framework are required. In this context, the <i>R/Bioconductor</i> package <i>TCGAbiolinks</i> was developed, offering a variety of bioinformatics functionalities. Here we introduce new features and enhancements of <i>TCGAbiolinks</i> in terms of i) more accurate and flexible pipelines for differential expression analyses, ii) different methods for tumor purity estimation and filtering, iii) integration of normal samples from other platforms iv) support for other genomics datasets, exemplified here by the TARGET data. Evidence has shown that accounting for tumor purity is essential in the study of tumorigenesis, as these factors promote confounding behavior regarding differential expression analysis. With this in mind, we implemented these filtering procedures in <i>TCGAbiolinks</i>. Moreover, a limitation of some of the TCGA datasets is the unavailability or paucity of corresponding normal samples. We thus integrated into <i>TCGAbiolinks</i> the possibility to use normal samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which is another large-scale repository cataloging gene expression from healthy individuals. The new functionalities are available in the <i>TCGAbiolinks</i> version 2.8 and higher released in <i>Bioconductor</i> version 3.7.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1ig_w2APBLA" width="1" />

The plasticity of the human nervous system allows us to acquire an open-ended repository of sensorimotor skills in adulthood, such as the mastery of tools, musical instruments or sports. How novel sensorimotor skills are learned from scratch is yet largely unknown. In particular, the so-called inverse mapping from goal states to motor states is underdetermined because a goal can often be achieved by many different movements (motor redundancy). How humans learn to resolve motor redundancy and by which principles they explore high-dimensional motor spaces has hardly been investigated. To study this question, we trained human participants in an unfamiliar and redundant visually-guided manual control task. We qualitatively compare the experimental results with simulation results from a population of artificial agents that learned the same task by <i>Goal Babbling</i>, which is an inverse-model learning approach for robotics. In Goal Babbling, goal-related feedback guides motor exploration and thereby enables robots to learn an inverse model directly from scratch, without having to learn a forward model first. In the human experiment, we tested whether different initial conditions (starting positions of the hand) influence the acquisition of motor synergies, which we identified by Principal Component Analysis in the motor space. The results show that the human participants’ solutions are spatially biased towards the different starting positions in motor space and are marked by a gradual co-learning of synergies and task success, similar to the dynamics of motor learning by Goal Babbling. However, there are also differences between human learning and the Goal Babbling simulations, as humans tend to predominantly use Degrees of Freedom that do not have a large effect on the hand position, whereas in Goal Babbling, Degrees of Freedom with a large effect on hand position are used predominantly. We conclude that humans use goal-related feedback to constrain motor exploration and resolve motor redundancy when learning a new sensorimotor mapping, but in a manner that differs from the current implementation of Goal Babbling due to different constraints on motor exploration.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RWeYBIxEzy8" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>While the primary role of vesicular transporters is to load neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs), accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins also contribute to additional aspects of synaptic function, including vesicle release. In this study, we extend the role of the VAChT to include regulating the transmitter content of SVs. We report that manipulation of a C-terminal poly-glutamine (polyQ) region in the <i>Drosophila</i> VAChT is sufficient to influence transmitter content, and release frequency, of cholinergic vesicles from the terminals of premotor interneurons. Specifically, we find that reduction of the polyQ region, by one glutamine residue (<i>13Q</i> to <i>12Q</i>), results in a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of spontaneous cholinergic miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) recorded in the aCC and RP2 motoneurons. Moreover, this truncation also results in evoked synaptic currents that show increased duration: consistent with increased ACh release. By contrast, extension of the polyQ region by one glutamine (<i>13Q</i> to <i>14Q</i>) is sufficient to reduce mEPSC amplitude and frequency and, moreover, prevents evoked SV release. Finally, a complete deletion of the polyQ region (13Q to 0Q) has no obvious effects to mEPSCs, but again evoked synaptic currents show increased duration. The mechanisms that ensure SVs are filled to physiologically-appropriate levels remain unknown. Our study identifies the polyQ region of the insect VAChT to be required for correct vesicle transmitter loading and, thus, provides opportunity to increase understanding of this critical aspect of neurotransmission.</p>

Abstract
<p>Hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common seizures during childhood, and prolonged complex FSs can result in the development of epilepsy. Currently, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used as medications for FSs with the aim of enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity. However, it is still up for debate whether these enhancers of GABAergic neurotransmission could depolarize immature neurons with relatively higher levels of the intracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> in the developing brain during FSs. Here, we performed simultaneous video-local field potential monitoring to determine whether benzodiazepines and barbiturates affect the phenotypes of FSs in postnatal day (P)11 and P14 mice. We found that low-dose administration of diazepam decreased the incidence of clonic seizures at P11. We also found that high-dose administration of diazepam and pentobarbital exacerbated the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the induction phase of experimental FSs at P11 but not at P14. We further found that the deteriorated phenotypes at P11 were suppressed when Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>–</sup> cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), which mediates Cl<sup>–</sup> influx, was blocked by treatment with the diuretic bumetanide. Though our findings do not exclude the involvement of sedation effect of high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators in worsening experimental FSs at P11, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling could aggravate seizure activity in the early phase of FSs.</p>

Abstract
<p>Methylphenidate (MPH), commonly known as Ritalin, is the most widely prescribed drug worldwide to treat patients with attention deficit disorders. Although MPH is thought to modulate catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain, it remains unclear how these neurochemical effects influence neuronal activity and lead to attentional enhancements. Studies in rodents overwhelmingly point to the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a main site of action of MPH. To understand the mechanism of action of MPH in a primate brain, we recorded the responses of neuronal populations using chronic multielectrode arrays implanted in the caudal LPFC of two macaque monkeys while the animals performed an attention task (<i>N</i> = 2811 neuronal recordings). Over different recording sessions (<i>N</i> = 55), we orally administered either various doses of MPH or a placebo to the animals. Behavioral analyses revealed positive effects of MPH on task performance at specific doses. However, analyses of individual neurons activity, noise correlations, and neuronal ensemble activity using machine learning algorithms revealed no effects of MPH. Our results suggest that the positive behavioral effects of MPH observed in primates (including humans) may not be mediated by changes in the activity of caudal LPFC neurons. MPH may enhance cognitive performance by modulating neuronal activity in other regions of the attentional network in the primate brain.</p>

Abstract
<p>Processing of memory is supported by coordinated activity in a network of sensory, association, and motor brain regions. It remains a major challenge to determine where memory is encoded for later retrieval. Here, we used direct intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients performing free recall tasks to determine the temporal pattern and anatomical distribution of verbal memory encoding across the entire human cortex. High  frequency activity (65–115 Hz) showed consistent power responses during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words on a subset of electrodes localized in 16 distinct cortical areas activated in the tasks. More of the high  power during word encoding, and less power before and after the word presentation, was characteristic of successful recall and observed across multiple brain regions. Latencies of the induced power changes and this subsequent memory effect (SME) between the recalled and forgotten words followed an anatomical sequence from visual to prefrontal cortical areas. Finally, the magnitude of the memory effect was unexpectedly found to be the largest in selected brain regions both at the top and at the bottom of the processing stream. These included the language processing areas of the prefrontal cortex and the early visual areas at the junction of the occipital and temporal lobes. Our results provide evidence for distributed encoding of verbal memory organized along a hierarchical posterior-to-anterior processing stream.</p>

Abstract<p>Language difficulties have been reported in children and adolescents who were born very preterm (&lt; 32 weeks’ gestation) and associated with an atypical lateralisation of language processing, i.e. increased right-hemispheric engagement. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and spherical deconvolution tractography to study the hemodynamic responses associated with verbal fluency processing (easy and hard letter trials) and verbal fluency-related white matter fibre tracts in 64 very preterm born adults and 36 adult controls (mean age: 30 years). Tractography of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and frontal aslant tract (FAT) was performed. Tracts were quantified in terms of mean volume, hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy, and lateralisation, assessed using a laterality index to indicate hemispheric dominance. During verbal fluency fMRI, very preterm participants displayed decreased hemodynamic response suppression in both the <i>Easy &gt; Rest</i> and <i>Hard &gt; Rest</i> conditions, compared to controls, in superior temporal gyrus, insula, thalamus and sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere. At the whole-group level, decreased hemodynamic response suppression in the right sensorimotor cortex was associated with worse on-line performance on the hard letter trials. Increased left-laterality in the AF was present alongside increased right hemispheric hemodynamic response suppression in controls. When only right-handed participants were considered, decreased hemodynamic response suppression in the right superior temporal gyrus during hard letter trials was related to weaker left and right FAT white matter integrity in the preterm group only. These results show that verbal fluency is affected by altered functional lateralisation in adults who were born very preterm.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This is the first study to use both functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neuro-anatomy of verbal fluency in very preterm born adults. Less suppression of brain activation was observed in very preterm adults compared to controls in several brain regions during completion of both easy and hard verbal fluency trials. Furthermore, across all subjects, decreased brain activity suppression in the right sensorimotor cortex was associated with worse on-line performance on the hard letter trials. Increased left-laterality in the arcuate fasciculus, a language-related white matter tract, was present alongside increased right hemispheric brain activity suppression in controls. These findings suggest that alterations in the typical development of left-lateralisation in very preterm individuals are still present in adulthood.</p>

Abstract<p>We tend to re-live emotional experiences more richly in memory than more mundane experiences. According to one recent neurocognitive model of emotional memory, negative events may be encoded with a larger amount of sensory information than neutral and positive events. As a result, there may be more perceptual information available to reconstruct these events at retrieval, leading to memory reinstatement patterns that correspond with greater memory vividness and sense of recollection for negative events. In this commentary, we offer an alternative perspective on how emotion may influence such sensory cortex reinstatement that focuses on engagement of the noradrenergic (NE) and dopaminergic (DA) systems rather than valence. Specifically, we propose that arousal-related LC-NE system activation promotes the prioritization of the most salient features of an emotional experience in memory. Thus, a select few details may drive lower-level sensory cortical activity and a stronger sense of recollection for arousing events. By contrast, states of high behavioral activation, including novelty-seeking and exploration, may recruit the DA system to broaden the scope of cognitive processing and integrate multiple event aspects in memory. These more integrated memory representations may be reflected in higher-order cortical reinstatement at retrieval. Thus, the balance between activation in these neuromodulatory systems at encoding, rather than the valence of the event, may ultimately determine the quality of emotional memory recollection and neural reinstatement.</p><p><b>Significance Section</b> We tend to re-live emotional events more richly in memory than mundane experiences.

<p>This study analyzed serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) in 2 European cohorts of 312 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to investigate whether NfL are biomarkers of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) during natalizumab treatment. The cohort comprised 25 PML, 136 natalizumab‐treated, and 151 untreated MS patients. Patients subsequently developing PML had similar NfL to other natalizumab‐treated MS patients. At PML onset, NfL were 10‐fold higher than in the pre‐PML condition and in natalizumab‐treated or untreated MS patients, and NfL continued to increase until onset of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The results suggest that in natalizumab‐treated patients, NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML. Ann Neurol, 2019</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01301">On genetic correlation estimation with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. (arXiv:1903.01301v1 [stat.ME])</a></h4>

<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to examine the
association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and complex traits,
where both the sample size n and the number of SNPs p can be very large.
Recently, cross-trait polygenic risk score (PRS) method has gained extremely
popular for assessing genetic correlation of complex traits based on GWAS
summary statistics (e.g., SNP effect size). However, empirical evidence has
shown a common bias phenomenon that even highly significant cross-trait PRS can
only account for a very small amount of genetic variance (R^2 often &lt;1%). The
aim of this paper is to develop a novel and powerful method to address the bias
phenomenon of cross-trait PRS. We theoretically show that the estimated genetic
correlation is asymptotically biased towards zero when complex traits are
highly polygenic/omnigenic. When all p SNPs are used to construct PRS, we show
that the asymptotic bias of PRS estimator is independent of the unknown number
of causal SNPs m. We propose a consistent PRS estimator to correct such
asymptotic bias. We also develop a novel estimator of genetic correlation which
is solely based on two sets of GWAS summary statistics. In addition, we
investigate whether or not SNP screening by GWAS p-values can lead to improved
estimation and show the effect of overlapping samples among GWAS. Our results
may help demystify and tackle the puzzling "missing genetic overlap" phenomenon
of cross-trait PRS for dissecting the genetic similarity of closely related
heritable traits. We illustrate the finite sample performance of our
bias-corrected PRS estimator by using both numerical experiments and the UK
Biobank data, in which we assess the genetic correlation between brain white
matter tracts and neuropsychiatric disorders.

<p>Evolution has produced a multi-scale mosaic of interacting adaptive units.
Innovations arise when perturbations push parts of the system away from stable
equilibria into new regimes where previously well-adapted solutions no longer
work. Here we explore the hypothesis that multi-agent systems sometimes display
intrinsic dynamics arising from competition and cooperation that provide a
naturally emergent curriculum, which we term an autocurriculum. The solution of
one social task often begets new social tasks, continually generating novel
challenges, and thereby promoting innovation. Under certain conditions these
challenges may become increasingly complex over time, demanding that agents
accumulate ever more innovations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43736">Distinct progenitor populations mediate regeneration in the zebrafish lateral line</a></h4>

Mechanosensory hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line regenerate rapidly following damage. These renewed hair cells arise from the proliferation of surrounding support cells, which undergo symmetric division to produce two hair cell daughters. Given the continued regenerative capacity of the lateral line, support cells presumably have the ability to replenish themselves. Utilizing novel transgenic lines, we identified support cell populations with distinct progenitor identities. These populations show differences in their ability to generate new hair cells during homeostasis and regeneration. Targeted ablation of support cells reduced the number of regenerated hair cells. Furthermore, progenitors regenerated after targeted support cell ablation in the absence of hair cell damage. We also determined that distinct support cell populations are independently regulated by Notch signaling. The existence of independent progenitor populations could provide flexibility for the continued generation of new hair cells under a variety of conditions throughout the life of the animal.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43657">An atlas of polygenic risk score associations to highlight putative causal relationships across the human phenome</a></h4>

The age of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the genetic liability of complex disease using polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this study, we have analysed 162 PRS (p&lt;5×10<sup>−05</sup>) derived from GWAS and 551 heritable traits from the UK Biobank study (N = 334,398). Findings can be investigated using a web application (http:‌//‌mrcieu.‌mrsoftware.org/‌PRS‌_atlas/), which we envisage will help uncover both known and novel mechanisms which contribute towards disease susceptibility. To demonstrate this, we have investigated the results from a phenome-wide evaluation of schizophrenia genetic liability. Amongst findings were inverse associations with measures of cognitive function which extensive follow-up analyses using Mendelian randomization (MR) provided evidence of a causal relationship. We have also investigated the effect of multiple risk factors on disease using mediation and multivariable MR frameworks. Our atlas provides a resource for future endeavours seeking to unravel the causal determinants of complex disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43652">Kinetochore protein depletion underlies cytokinesis failure and somatic polyploidization in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i></a></h4>

Lagging chromosome is a hallmark of aneuploidy arising from errors in the kinetochore-spindle attachment in animal cells. However, kinetochore components and cellular phenotypes associated with kinetochore dysfunction are much less explored in plants. Here, we carried out a comprehensive characterization of conserved kinetochore components in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> and uncovered a distinct scenario in plant cells regarding both the localization and cellular impact of the kinetochore proteins. Most surprisingly, knock-down of several kinetochore proteins led to polyploidy, not aneuploidy, through cytokinesis failure in &gt;90% of the cells that exhibited lagging chromosomes for several minutes or longer. The resultant cells, containing two or more nuclei, proceeded to the next cell cycle and eventually developed into polyploid plants. As lagging chromosomes have been observed in various plant species in the wild, our observation raised a possibility that they could be one of the natural pathways to polyploidy in plants.

India comprises much of the persisting global childhood measles mortality. India implemented a mass second-dose measles immunization campaign in 2010. We used interrupted time series and multilevel regression to quantify the campaign's impact on measles mortality using the nationally representative Million Death Study (including 27,000 child deaths in 1.3 million households surveyed from 2005–2013). 1–59-month measles mortality rates fell more in the campaign states following launch (27%) versus non-campaign states (11%). Declines were steeper in girls than boys and were specific to measles deaths. Measles mortality risk was lower for children living in a campaign district (OR 0.6, 99%CI 0.4–0.8) or born in 2009 or later (OR 0.8, 99%CI 0.7–0.9). The campaign averted up to 41,000–56,000 deaths during 2010–13, or 39%–57% of the expected deaths nationally. Elimination of measles deaths in India is feasible.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40578">Fatigue induces long lasting detrimental changes in motor skill learning</a></h4>

Fatigue due to physical exertion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in everyday life and especially common in a range of neurological diseases. While the effect of fatigue on limiting skill execution are well known, its influence on learning new skills is unclear. This is of particular interest as it is common practice to train athletes, musicians or perform rehabilitation exercises up to and beyond a point of fatigue. In a series of experiments, we describe how muscle fatigue, defined as degradation of maximum force after exertion, impairs motor skill learning beyond its effects on task execution. The negative effects on learning are evidenced by impaired task acquisition on subsequent practice days even in the absence of fatigue. Further, we found that this effect is in part mediated centrally and can be alleviated by altering motor cortex function. Thus, the common practice of training while, or beyond, fatigue levels should be carefully reconsidered, since this affects overall long-term skill learning.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40538">Genetic and environmental perturbations lead to regulatory decoherence</a></h4>

Correlation among traits is a fundamental feature of biological systems that remains difficult to study. To address this problem, we developed a flexible approach that allows us to identify factors associated with inter-individual variation in correlation. We use data from three human cohorts to study the effects of genetic and environmental variation on correlations among mRNA transcripts and among NMR metabolites. We first show that environmental exposures (infection and disease) lead to a systematic loss of correlation, which we define as 'decoherence'. Using longitudinal data, we show that decoherent metabolites are better predictors of whether someone will develop metabolic syndrome than metabolites commonly used as biomarkers of this disease. Finally, we demonstrate that correlation itself is under genetic control by mapping hundreds of 'correlation quantitative trait loci (QTLs)'. Together, this work furthers our understanding of how and why coordinated biological processes break down, and points to a potential role for decoherence in disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40234">Regulating G protein-coupled receptors by topological inversion</a></h4>

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a family of proteins containing seven transmembrane helices, with the N- and C-terminus of the protein located at the extracellular space and cytosol, respectively. Here, we report that ceramide or related sphingolipids might invert the topology of many GPCRs that contain a GXXXN motif in their first transmembrane helix. The functional significance of this topological regulation is illustrated by the CCR5 chemokine receptor. In the absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CCR5 adopts a topology consistent with that of GPCR, allowing mouse peritoneal macrophages to migrate toward its ligand CCL5. LPS stimulation results in increased production of dihydroceramide, which inverts the topology of CCR5, preventing macrophages from migrating toward CCL5. These results suggest that GPCRs may not always adopt the same topology and can be regulated through topological inversion.

The dialogue between cortex and hippocampus is known to be crucial for sleep dependent consolidation of long lasting memories. During slow wave sleep memory replay depends on slow oscillation (SO) and spindles in the (neo)cortex and sharp wave-ripple complexes (SWR) in the hippocampus, however, the mechanisms underlying interaction of these rhythms are poorly understood. Here, we examined the interaction between cortical SOs and hippocampal SWRs in a computational model of hippo-cortico-thalamic network and compared the results with human intracranial recordings during sleep. We observed that ripple occurrence peaked following the onset of SO (Down-to-Up-state transition) and that cortical input to hippocampus was crucial to maintain this relationship. Ripples influenced the spatiotemporal structure of cortical SO and duration of the Up/Down-states. In particular, ripples were capable of synchronizing Up-to-Down state transition events across the cortical network. Slow waves had a tendency to initiate at cortical locations receiving hippocampal ripples, and these "initiators" were able to influence sequential reactivation within cortical Up states. We concluded that during slow wave sleep, hippocampus and neocortex maintain a complex interaction, where SOs bias the onset of ripples, while ripples influence the spatiotemporal pattern of SOs.

Age-related hearing loss leads to poorer speech comprehension, particularly in noise. Speech-in-noise (SIN) deficits among the elderly could result from weaker neural activity within, or poorer signal transmission between brainstem and auditory cortices. By recording neuroelectric responses from brainstem (BS) and primary auditory cortex (PAC), we show that beyond simply attenuating neural activity, hearing loss in older adults compromises the transmission of speech information between subcortical and cortical hubs of the auditory system. The strength of afferent BS-&gt;PAC neural signaling (but not the reverse efferent flow; PAC-&gt;BS) varied with mild declines in hearing acuity and this "bottom-up" functional connectivity robustly predicted older adults' SIN perception. Our neuroimaging findings underscore the importance of brain connectivity, particularly afferent neural communication, in understanding the biological basis of age-related hearing deficits in real-world listening environments.

Rett syndrome (RTT), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, is typified by profound cognitive impairment and severe language impairment, rendering it very difficult to accurately measure auditory processing capabilities behaviorally in this population. Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of RTT patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT. High-density EEG was successfully recorded in 18 females with RTT and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from 7 RTT and 3 TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1kHz tones with a standard duration of 100ms and deviant duration of 180ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900 and 1800ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the RTT group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while RTT patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.

Decision making is a complex process that interprets sensory information within the context of non-sensory factors such as reward expectation. How this process is implemented in the brain remains unclear. Here we show that, in monkeys making decisions based on noisy visual evidence and asymmetric reward context, neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus varies with evidence strength and reward context during decision formation, at both the population and single-neuron levels. Electrical microstimulation during motion viewing also induced changes in decision behavior that depended on neural activity patterns at the stimulation site. Within a drift-diffusion framework, distinct correlation patterns of the microstimulation effects on multiple parameters suggest that caudate neurons transform reward context information into a common signal to coordinate adjustments in decision-related computations and participate more directly to implement decision bound- and evidence accumulation-related computations. These results establish a central, causal role of the caudate nucleus in complex decision decision-making.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/568626v1?rss=1">What the odor is not: Estimation by elimination</a></h4>

The olfactory system uses the responses of a small number of broadly sensitive receptors to combinatorially encode a vast number of odors. Here, we propose a method for decoding such a distributed representation. Our main idea is that a receptor that does not respond to an odor carries more information than a receptor that does, because a typical receptor binds to many odorants. So a response below threshold signals the absence of all such odorants. As a result, it is easier to identify what the odor is not, rather than what the odor is. We demonstrate that, for biologically realistic numbers of receptors, response functions, and odor mixture complexity, this remarkably simple method of elimination turns an underdetermined decoding problem into an overdetermined one, allowing accurate de- termination of the odorants in a mixture and their concentrations. We give a simple neural network realization of our algorithm which resembles the known circuit architecture of the piriform cortex.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/568360v1?rss=1">Kinematics associated with treadmill walking in Rett Syndrome</a></h4>

Individuals with Rett syndrome suffer from severely impaired cognitive and motor performance. Current movement-related therapeutic programs often include traditional physical therapy activities and assisted treadmill walking routines for those patients who are ambulatory. However, there are no quantitative reports of kinematic gait parameters obtained during treadmill walking. Here we report the results of an investigation of 17 females diagnosed with typical Rett who walked on a treadmill as speed gradually increased. The objective included characterizing lower limb kinematics, including knee and hip joint range of motions, velocities, limb asymmetries, and the variance associated with these measures. Joint kinematics were obtained using a 12 camera motion capture system and associated processing and analysis software. Stride times progressively decreased as treadmill speeds increased although the range of speeds our participant could walk was quite slow: range 0.2 m/s - 0.5 m/s. There were significant main effects of speed on sagittal knee and hip range of motions and hip velocity. There were large joint asymmetries and variance values relative to both healthy walkers and others patient populations although variance values decreased as walking speed increased. There were significant correlations between joint range of motions and stride times and joint velocities and stride times. The results indicate that Rett patients can adapt their kinematic gait patterns in response to increasing treadmill speed but their ability to do so lies within a narrow range of speeds. We suggest that treadmill training for ambulatory individuals with Rett may further promote improved walking kinematics as well as overall health benefits.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/568303v1?rss=1">Content-based dissociation of hippocampal involvement in prediction</a></h4>

It has recently become clear that one of the key functions of the hippocampus is to predict future inputs. In line with this, previous research has revealed prediction-related signals in the hippocampus for complex visual objects, such as fractals and abstract shapes. Based on this, it has been suggested that the hippocampus may generate perceptual expectations, especially when relying on rapidly learned predictive associations between arbitrary stimuli. However, it is currently unknown whether the hippocampus implements general-purpose computations that subserve all associative predictions, regardless of stimulus properties, or whether the involvement of the hippocampus is stimulus-dependent. To investigate this, we exposed male and female human participants to complex auditory cues predicting either the shape of a complex object (Experiment 1) or the orientation of a simple line grating (Experiment 2). We measured brain activity using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in combination with inverted encoding models to reconstruct shape and orientation representations in visual cortex and the hippocampus. Our results revealed that expectations about shape and orientation evoked distinct representations in the hippocampus. For complex shapes, the hippocampus represented which shape was expected, potentially serving as a source of top-down predictions. In contrast, for simple gratings, the hippocampus represented only unexpected orientations, more reminiscent of a prediction error. We discuss several potential explanations for this dissociation, concluding that the computational role of the hippocampus in predictive processing depends upon the nature and complexity of stimuli.

Revealing the molecular organization of anatomically precisely defined brain regions is necessary for the refined understanding of synaptic plasticity. Although, three-dimensional (3D) single-molecule localization microscopy can provide the required molecular resolution, single-molecule imaging more than a few micrometers deep into tissue remains challenging. To quantify presynaptic active zones (AZ) of entire, large, conditional detonator hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) boutons with diameters as large as 10 m, we developed a method for aberration-free volumetric direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). An optimized protocol for fast repeated axial scanning and efficient sequential labeling of the AZ scaffold Bassoon and membrane bound GFP with Alexa Fluor 647 enables 3D-dSTORM imaging of 25m thick mouse brain sections and assignment of AZs to specific neuronal substructures. Quantitative data analysis revealed large differences in Bassoon cluster size and density for distinct hippocampal regions with largest clusters in MF boutons.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/568204v1?rss=1">Effect of task and attention on neural tracking of speech</a></h4>

EEG-based measures of neural tracking of natural running speech are becoming increasingly popular to investigate neural processing of speech and for applications in domains such as audiology. With a single speaker, it is usually assumed that the listener actively attends to and understands the stimulus. However, as the level of attention of the listener is inherently variable, we investigated how it affected neural envelope tracking. Using a video game or a movie as distractors, we varied the level of attention while we estimated neural envelope tracking. We varied the intelligibility level by adding stationary noise. We found a significant difference in neural envelope tracking between the condition with maximal attention and the movie condition. This difference was most pronounced in the right-frontal region of the brain. The degree of neural envelope tracking remained highly correlated with the stimulus signal-to-noise ratio, even in the movie condition. In the video game condition, this correlation was absent. This could be due to a lack of residual resources to even passively listen to the stimulus. For applied research this means that when neural envelope tracking is used as a proxy of speech intelligibility, the procedure can be made more enjoyable and feasible by letting participants watch a movie during stimulus presentation.

Studying the human subcortical auditory system non-invasively is challenging due to its small structures deep within the brain. Additionally, the elaborate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the system can be diZcult to understand based on currently available 2-D schematics and animal models. To address these issues, we measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses from the human subcortical auditory system at 7 Tesla and validated the results by creating an atlas based on state of the art human histology (BigBrain) and post mortem MRI. Furthermore, using diffusion MRI tractography, we revealed structural connectivity maps of the human subcortical auditory pathway both in vivo (1050 m isotropic resolution) and post mortem (200 m isotropic resolution). This work contributes novel tools for researching the human auditory system to understand its structural organization as well as facilitates dissemination of this knowledge by making the created atlases openly available.

The cortico-basal ganglia-thalamus (CBT) loop is important for behavior. However, the activity and learning-related modulation within the loop in behavior remain unclear. To tackle this problem, we trained mice to perform a delayed sensorimotor-transformation task and recorded single-unit activity during learning simultaneously from four regions in a CBT loop: prelimbic area (PrL), posterior premotor cortex (pM2), dorsomedial caudate/putamen (dmCP), and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Sensory and decision related information were encoded by the neurons within the loop, with weak interaction among neurons of different coding ability. The functional interaction among regions within the loop was dynamically routed in the loop during different behavioral phases and contributed to explain decision-related neuronal activity. The neurons of PrL and dmCP exhibited learning-related reorganization in neuronal activity and more persistent coding of sensory and decision-related information. Thus, both sensory- and decision-related information are processed in a functionally interacted CBT loop that is modulated by learning.

Transcriptome compartmentalization by the nuclear membrane provides both stochastic and functional buffering of transcript activity in the cytoplasm and has recently been implicated in neurodegenerative disease processes. Although many mechanisms regulating transcript compartmentalization are also prevalent in brain development, the extent to which subcellular localization differs as the brain matures has yet to be addressed. To characterize the nuclear and cytoplasmic transcriptomes during brain development, we sequenced both RNA fractions from homogenate prenatal and adult human postmortem cortex using PolyA+ and RiboZero library preparation methods. We find that while many genes are differentially expressed by fraction and developmental expression changes are similarly detectable in nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA, the compartmented transcriptomes become more distinct as the brain matures, perhaps reflecting increased utilization of nuclear retention as a regulatory strategy in adult brain. We examined potential mechanisms of this developmental divergence including alternative splicing, RNA editing, nuclear pore composition, RNA binding protein motif enrichment, and RNA secondary structure. Intron retention is associated with greater nuclear abundance in a subset of transcripts, as is enrichment for several splicing factor binding motifs. Finally, we examined disease association with fraction-regulated gene sets and found nuclear-enriched genes were also preferentially enriched in gene sets associated with neurodevelopmental psychiatric diseases. These results suggest that although gene-level expression is globally comparable between fractions, nuclear retention of transcripts may play an underappreciated role in developmental regulation of gene expression in brain, particularly in genes whose dysregulation is related to neuropsychiatric disorders.

We present a general numerical approach for solving the forward problem in high-resolution. This approach can be employed in the analysis of noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) as well as invasive electrocorticography (ECoG), stereoencephalography (sEEG), and local field potential (LFP) recordings. The underlying algorithm is our recently developed boundary element fast multipole method (BEM-FMM) that simulates anatomically realistic head models with unprecedented numerical accuracy and speed. This is achieved by utilizing the adjoint double layer formulation and zeroth-order basis functions in conjunction with the FMM acceleration. We present the mathematical formalism in detail and validate the method by applying it to the canonical multilayer sphere problem. The numerical error of BEM-FMM is 2-10 times lower while the computational speed is 1.5-20 times faster than those of the standard first-order FEM. We present four practical case studies: (i) evaluation of the effect of a detailed head model on the accuracy of EEG/MEG forward solution; (ii) demonstration of the ability to accurately calculate the electric potential and the magnetic field in the immediate vicinity of the sources and conductivity boundaries; (iii) computation of the field of a spatially extended cortical equivalent dipole layer; and (iv) taking into account the effect a fontanel for infant EEG source modeling and comparison of the results with a commercially available FEM. In all cases, BEM-FMM provided versatile, fast, and accurate high-resolution modeling of the electromagnetic field and has the potential of becoming a standard tool for modeling both extracranial and intracranial electrophysiological signals.

Background: Predicting cognitive decline and the eventual onset of dementia in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is of high value for patient management and potential cohort enrichment in pharmaceutical trials. We used cognitive scores and MRI biomarkers from a single baseline visit to predict the onset of dementia in an MCI population over a nine-year follow-up period. Method: All MCI subjects from ADNI1, ADNI2, and ADNI-GO with available baseline cognitive scores and T1w MRI were included in the study (n=756). We built a Naive Bayes classifier for every year over a 9-year follow-up period and tested each one with Leave one out cross validation. Results: We reached 87% prediction accuracy at five years follow-up with an AUC&gt;0.85 from two to seven years (peaking at 0.92 at five years). Both cognitive test scores and MR biomarkers were needed to make the prognostic models highly sensitive and specific, especially for longer follow-ups. MRI features are more sensitive, while cognitive features bring specificity to the prediction. Conclusion: Combining cognitive scores and MR biomarkers yield accurate prediction years before onset of dementia. Such a tool may be helpful in selecting patients that would most benefit from lifestyle changes, and eventually early treatments that would slow cognitive decline and delay the onset of dementia.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/567859v1?rss=1">Unexpected higher resilience to distraction during visual working memory in schizophrenia</a></h4>

Visual working memory (VWM) and distractibility are two core executive functions in human cognition. It has been suggested that schizophrenia (SZ) patients exhibit worse VWM performance and lower resilience to distraction compared with healthy control (HC) subjects. Previous studies, however, have largely investigated these two functions separately. It still remains unclear what are the mechanisms of the deficits, especially the interactions between the two cognitive domains. Here we modify the standard delay-estimation task in VWM and explicitly add distractors in the task so as to examine the two domains simultaneously. We find that SZ indeed exhibit worse performance compared with HC in almost all VWM load and distraction levels, a result consistent with most prior experimental findings. But adding distractors does not selectively impose larger impacts on SZ performance. Furthermore, unlike most previous studies that only focused on behavioral performance, we use the variable precision model to disentangle the distraction effect on different computational components of VWM (resources and resources allocation variability etc.). Surprisingly, adding distractors significantly elevates resources allocation variability, a parameter describing the heterogeneity of resource allocation across different targets, in HC but not in SZ. This counterintuitive result suggests that the internal VWM process in SZ is less interfered by the distractors. However, this unexpected higher resilience to distraction might be associated with less flexible cognitive control mechanisms. In sum, our work demonstrates that multiple cognitive functions might jointly contribute to dysfunctions in SZ and their interactions might manifest differently from merely summing their independent effects.

Functional brain connectivity is increasingly being seen as critical for cognition, perception and motor control. Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography are modalities that offer noninvasive mapping of electrophysiological interactions among brain regions, yet suffer from signal leakage and signal cancellation when estimating brain activity. This leads to biased connectivity values which complicate interpretation. In this study, we test the hypothesis that a Multiple Constrained Minimum Variance beamformer (MCMV) outperforms the more traditional Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance beamformer (LCMV) for estimation of electrophysiological connectivity. To this end, MCMV and LCMV performance is compared in task related analyses with both simulated data and human MEG recordings of visual steady state signals, and in resting state analyses with simulated data and human MEG data of 89 subjects. In task related scenarios connectivity was estimated using coherence and phase locking values, whereas envelope correlations were used for the resting state data. We also introduce a novel Augmented Pairwise MCMV (APW-MCMV) approach for signal leakage suppression in resting state analyses and assess its performance against LCMV and more conventional MCMV approaches. We demonstrate that with MCMV effects of signal mixing and coherent source cancellation are greatly reduced in both task related and resting state conditions, while in contrast to other approaches 0- and short time lag interactions are preserved. In addition, we demonstrate that in resting state analyses, APW-MCMV strongly reduces spurious connections while better controlling for false negatives compared to more conservative measures such as symmetrical orthogonalization.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/567701v1?rss=1">Bioisosterism reveals new structure-odor relationships</a></h4>

The question of structure-odor relationship (SOR) has inspired numerous studies into chemical odorants via their perceptual similarities. Much of this data comes from psychophysical studies on humans, precluding the possibility of direct measurements of receptor or receptor neuron activation. Remarkably, we find that many of the perceptual classifications used by human subjects translate well enough to mouse that we can apply cellular methods to better understand the molecular mechanism, that leads to odor discrimination and perception. Using a well studied and well recognizable odor percept of bitter almond, we have tested an odorant panel of aldehydes and ketones that were reported to share such perceptual qualities. These odorants include aromatic and aliphatic, as well as cyclic and allylic features. When parsing these odorants using chemical descriptors, we have a clear separation of molecules possessing these various features. However, here we show that OSN responses better recapitulate the physiological percept. Using these odorants, we also provide a proof-of-concept for non-classical bioisosterism at work in the olfactory system.

Attention and Visual Working Memory (VWM) are among the most theoretically detailed and empirically tested constructs in human cognition. Nevertheless, the nature of the interrelation between selective attention and VWM still presents a fundamental controversy: do they rely on the same cognitive resources or not? The present study aims at disentangling this issue by capitalizing on recent evidence showing that attention is a rhythmic phenomenon, oscillating over short time windows. Using a dual-task approach, we combined a classic VWM task with a detection task in which we densely sampled detection performance during the time between the memory and the test array. Our results show that an increment in VWM load was related to a worse detection of near threshold visual stimuli and, importantly, to the presence of an oscillatory pattern in detection performance at ~5 Hz. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the frequency of this sampling rhythm changes according to the strategic allocation of attentional resources to either the VWM or the detection task. This pattern of results is consistent with a central sampling attentional rhythm which allocates shared attentional resources both to the flow of external visual stimulation and also to the internal maintenance of visual information.

Interference and prediction have independently been identified as crucial influencing factors during language processing. However, their interaction remains severely underinvestigated. Furthermore, despite the growing body of behavioral studies investigating interference during sentence processing, the neurobiological basis of cue-based retrieval and retrieval interference remains insufficiently understood. Here, we addressed these issues with an ERP experiment that systematically examined the interaction of interference and prediction during language processing. We used the neurobiologically well-established predictive coding framework for the theoretical framing of our study. German sentence pairs were presented word-by-word, with an article in the second sentence constituting the critical word. We analyzed mean single trial EEG activity in a standard N400 time window and found an interaction between interference and prediction as measured by an offline cloze probability test. Under high predictability, sensory input was explained away (in the sense of predictive coding). Hence, no retrieval operations were necessary and no interference effects were observable. In contrast, under low predictability, model updating engendered memory retrieval, including the evaluation of distractor items, thus leading to interference effects. We conclude that interference should be included in predictive coding-based accounts of language because prediction errors can trigger retrieval operations and, therefore, induce interference.

We compare the performance of non-human primates and deep reinforcement learning agents in a virtual pursuit-avoidance task, as part of an effort to understand the role that cognitive control plays in the deeply evolved skill of chase and escape behavior. Here we train two agents, a deep Q network and an actor-critic model, on a video game in which the player must capture a prey while avoiding a predator. A previously trained rhesus macaque performed well on this task, and in a manner that obeyed basic principles of Newtonian physics. We sought to compare the principles learned by artificial agents with those followed by the animals, as determined by the ability of one to predict the other. Our findings suggest that the agents learn and the animals exhibit abilities consistent with the 2nd order physics of motion, although we also observed differences. We identify scenarios in which the actions taken by the animals and agents were consistent as well as ones in which they differed, including some surprising strategies exhibited by the agents. Finally, we remark on how the architectural differences between the two variants on the agent models affect how rapidly and proficiently they learned the task.

<p>by Thomas Dupic, Quentin Marcou, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Thierry Mora</p>

The T-cell (TCR) repertoire relies on the diversity of receptors composed of two chains, called <i>α</i> and <i>β</i>, to recognize pathogens. Using results of high throughput sequencing and computational chain-pairing experiments of human TCR repertoires, we quantitively characterize the <i>αβ</i> generation process. We estimate the probabilities of a rescue recombination of the <i>β</i> chain on the second chromosome upon failure or success on the first chromosome. Unlike <i>β</i> chains, <i>α</i> chains recombine simultaneously on both chromosomes, resulting in correlated statistics of the two genes which we predict using a mechanistic model. We find that ∼35% of cells express both <i>α</i> chains. Altogether, our statistical analysis gives a complete quantitative mechanistic picture that results in the observed correlations in the generative process. We learn that the probability to generate any TCR<i>αβ</i> is lower than 10<sup>−12</sup> and estimate the generation diversity and sharing properties of the <i>αβ</i> TCR repertoire.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XgrbXp606Kg" width="1" />

Consideration of previous successes and failures is essential to mastering a motor skill. Much of what we know about how humans and animals learn from such reinforcement feedback comes from experiments that involve sampling from a small number of discrete actions. Yet, it is less understood how we learn through reinforcement feedback when sampling from a continuous set of possible actions. Navigating a continuous set of possible actions likely requires using gradient information to maximize success. Here we addressed how humans adapt the aim of their hand when experiencing reinforcement feedback that was associated with a continuous set of possible actions. Specifically, we manipulated the change in the probability of reward given a change in motor action—the reinforcement gradient—to study its influence on learning. We found that participants learned faster when exposed to a steep gradient compared to a shallow gradient. Further, when initially positioned between a steep and a shallow gradient that rose in opposite directions, participants were more likely to ascend the steep gradient. We introduce a model that captures our results and several features of motor learning. Taken together, our work suggests that the sensorimotor system relies on temporally recent and spatially local gradient information to drive learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/65lC4sLQE18" width="1" />

<p>by Marc de Kamps, Mikkel Lepperød, Yi Ming Lai</p>

The importance of a mesoscopic description level of the brain has now been well established. Rate based models are widely used, but have limitations. Recently, several extremely efficient population-level methods have been proposed that go beyond the characterization of a population in terms of a single variable. Here, we present a method for simulating neural populations based on two dimensional (2D) point spiking neuron models that defines the state of the population in terms of a density function over the neural state space. Our method differs in that we do not make the diffusion approximation, nor do we reduce the state space to a single dimension (1D). We do not hard code the neural model, but read in a grid describing its state space in the relevant simulation region. Novel models can be studied without even recompiling the code. The method is highly modular: variations of the deterministic neural dynamics and the stochastic process can be investigated independently. Currently, there is a trend to reduce complex high dimensional neuron models to 2D ones as they offer a rich dynamical repertoire that is not available in 1D, such as limit cycles. We will demonstrate that our method is ideally suited to investigate noise in such systems, replicating results obtained in the diffusion limit and generalizing them to a regime of large jumps. The joint probability density function is much more informative than 1D marginals, and we will argue that the study of 2D systems subject to noise is important complementary to 1D systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Btvz0Sm3uc" width="1" />

<p>by Joshua H. Goldwyn, Michiel W. H. Remme, John Rinzel</p>

Coincidence detector neurons transmit timing information by responding preferentially to concurrent synaptic inputs. Principal cells of the medial superior olive (MSO) in the mammalian auditory brainstem are superb coincidence detectors. They encode sound source location with high temporal precision, distinguishing submillisecond timing differences among inputs. We investigate computationally how dynamic coupling between the input region (soma and dendrite) and the spike-generating output region (axon and axon initial segment) can enhance coincidence detection in MSO neurons. To do this, we formulate a two-compartment neuron model and characterize extensively coincidence detection sensitivity throughout a parameter space of coupling configurations. We focus on the interaction between coupling configuration and two currents that provide dynamic, voltage-gated, negative feedback in subthreshold voltage range: sodium current with rapid inactivation and low-threshold potassium current, <i>I</i><sub>KLT</sub>. These currents reduce synaptic summation and can prevent spike generation unless inputs arrive with near simultaneity. We show that strong soma-to-axon coupling promotes the negative feedback effects of sodium inactivation and is, therefore, advantageous for coincidence detection. Furthermore, the feedforward combination of strong soma-to-axon coupling and weak axon-to-soma coupling enables spikes to be generated efficiently (few sodium channels needed) and with rapid recovery that enhances high-frequency coincidence detection. These observations detail the functional benefit of the strongly feedforward configuration that has been observed in physiological studies of MSO neurons. We find that <i>I</i><sub>KLT</sub> further enhances coincidence detection sensitivity, but with effects that depend on coupling configuration. For instance, in models with weak soma-to-axon and weak axon-to-soma coupling, <i>I</i><sub>KLT</sub> in the axon enhances coincidence detection more effectively than <i>I</i><sub>KLT</sub> in the soma. By using a minimal model of soma-to-axon coupling, we connect structure, dynamics, and computation. Although we consider the particular case of MSO coincidence detectors, our method for creating and exploring a parameter space of two-compartment models can be applied to other neurons.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rw15o1NR4Io" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity is fundamental for working memory (WM), attention, and behavioral inhibition; however, a comprehensive understanding of the neural computations underlying these processes is still forthcoming. Towards this goal, neural recordings were obtained from the mPFC of awake, behaving rats performing an odor span task of WM capacity. Neural populations were observed to encode distinct task epochs and the transitions between epochs were accompanied by abrupt shifts in neural activity patterns. Putative pyramidal neuron activity increased earlier in the delay for sessions where rats achieved higher spans. Furthermore, increased putative interneuron activity was only observed at the termination of the delay thus indicating that local processing in inhibitory networks was a unique feature to initiate foraging. During foraging, changes in neural activity patterns associated with the approach to a novel odor, but not familiar odors, were robust. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct mPFC activity states underlie the delay, foraging, and reward epochs of the odor span task. Transitions between these states enable successful performance in dynamic environments placing strong demands on the substrates of working memory.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Working memory capacity is altered in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. In the present manuscript, we describe activity states of neurons in medial prefrontal cortex as well-trained rats perform the odor span task, which has been nominated as a task suitable for studying working memory capacity in rodents. Our results demonstrate dynamic and flexible activity patters during different epochs of the task (i.e., the delay period, foraging, reward collection, and after making errors). Our results bolster contemporary theories of the medial prefrontal cortex exhibiting metastable dynamics in complex environments. Disruptions in these dynamics may underlie some cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, including reduced working memory capacity.</p>

Abstract<p>Hippocampal place cells are known to have a key role in encoding spatial information. Aversive stimuli, such as predator odor, evoke place field remapping and a change in preferred firing locations. However, it remains unclear how place cells use positive or negative experiences to remap. We investigated whether CA1 place cells, recorded from behaving rats, remap randomly or whether their reconfiguration depends on the perceived location of the aversive stimulus. Exposure to trimethylthiazoline (TMT, an innately aversive odor), increased the amplitude of hippocampal beta oscillations in the two arms of the maze in which TMT exposure occurred. We found that a population of place cells with fields located outside the TMT arms increased their activity (extrafield spiking) in the TMT arms during the aversive episodes. Moreover, in the subsequent post-TMT recording, these cells exhibited a significant shift in their center of mass towards the TMT arms. The induction of extrafield plasticity was mediated by the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Photostimulation of the BLA triggered aversive behavior, synchronized hippocampal local field oscillations and increased the extrafield spiking of the hippocampal place cells for the first 100 ms after light delivery. Optogenetic BLA activation triggered an increase in extrafield spiking activity that was correlated with the degree of place field plasticity. Furthermore, BLA-mediated increase of the extrafield activity predicts the degree of subsequent field plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that that the remapping of hippocampal place cells during aversive episodes is not random but it depends on the location of the aversive stimulus.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Here, we successfully decoded the pattern of place field reconfiguration to an aversive experience after exposure to an innately aversive odor. For the first time, we reveal that the degree of place field plasticity closely correlates with the extrafield spiking rate during aversive episodes. Using a spatial optogenetic technique in behaving rats, we show that the link between aversive behavior and place field reconfiguration is mediated by the spatially confined activation of the basolateral amygdala. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus not only maps the spatial environment but also stores the affective value of experienced events.</p>

Abstract<p>During Pavlovian conditioning, if a cue (e.g., lever extension) predicts reward delivery in a different location (e.g., a food magazine), some individuals will come to approach and interact with the cue – a behavior known as sign tracking (ST) – and others will approach the site of reward, a behavior known as goal tracking (GT). In rats, the acquisition of ST vs. GT behavior is associated with distinct profiles of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but it is unknown whether it is associated with different patterns of accumbens neural activity. Therefore, we recorded from individual neurons in the NAc core during the acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of ST and GT behavior. Even though NAc dopamine is specifically important for the acquisition and expression of ST, we found that cue-evoked excitatory responses encode the vigor of both ST and GT behavior. In contrast, among sign trackers only, there was a prominent decrease in reward-related activity over the course of training, which may reflect the decreasing reward prediction error encoded by phasic dopamine. Finally, both behavior and cue-evoked activity were relatively resistant to extinction in sign trackers, as compared with goal trackers, although a subset of neurons in both groups retained their cue-evoked responses. Overall, the results point to the convergence of multiple forms of reward learning in the NAc.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> An individual’s tendency to interact with a cue that predicts reward – known as sign tracking – has been linked with impulsivity and addiction-related behaviors. Here, we show that, during learning, sign tracker rats – as compared with goal tracker rats, who preferentially interact with the site of reward – display different profiles of neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The evolution of NAc activity is uniquely linked to the acquisition of sign tracking, but not goal tracking; however, after learning, NAc activity reflects the vigor of both behaviors. These findings imply that sign tracking and goal tracking result from different learning processes and engage distinct neural circuits that partially overlap in the NAc.</p>

Abstract<p>Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency leads to obesity and metabolic deficiencies, largely due to the loss of melanocortin peptides. However, POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) are comprised of glutamatergic and GABAergic subpopulations. The developmental program, relative proportion and function of these two subpopulations are unresolved. To test whether glutamatergic POMC neurons serve a distinct role in maintaining energy homeostasis, we activated <i>Pomc</i> expression Cre-dependently in <i>Vglut2</i>-expressing neurons of mice with conditionally silenced <i>Pomc</i> alleles. The <i>Vglut2</i>-<i>Pomc</i> Restored mice had normal ARC <i>Pomc</i> mRNA levels, POMC immunoreactivity, as well as body weight and body composition at age 12 weeks. Unexpectedly, the cumulative total of <i>Vglut2<sup>+</sup></i> glutamatergic- and <i>Gad67<sup>+</sup> GABAergic</i>-<i>Pomc</i> neurons detected by in situ hybridization exceeded 100% in both <i>Vglut2</i>- <i>Pomc</i> Restored and Control mice, indicating that a subpopulation of <i>Pomc</i> neurons must express both neuronal markers. Consistent with this hypothesis, triple in situ hybridization of C57BL/6J hypothalami revealed that 35% of ARC <i>Pomc</i> neurons were selectively <i>Gad67</i><sup>+</sup>, 21% were selectively <i>Vglut2</i><sup>+</sup>, and 38% expressed both <i>Gad67</i> and <i>Vglut2</i>. The single <i>Gad67</i><sup>+</sup> and <i>Vglut2</i><sup>+</sup><i>Pomc</i> neurons were most prevalent in the rostral ARC, while the <i>Vglut2/Gad67</i><sup>+</sup> dual-phenotype cells predominated in the caudal ARC. A lineage trace using Ai9-tdTomato reporter mice to label fluorescently all <i>Vglut2</i>-expressing neurons showed equal numbers of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> and tdTomato<sup>-</sup> POMC immunoreactive neurons. Together, these data suggest that POMC neurons exhibit developmental plasticity in their expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, enabling re-establishment of normal energy homeostasis in the <i>Vglut2</i>-<i>Pomc</i> Restored mice.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Melanocortin peptides secreted from hypothalamic POMC neurons are anorexigenic and play a critical role in preventing obesity. However, POMC neurons are heterogeneous in their synaptic release of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. We used a conditional gene expression approach to test the hypothesis that these two subsets of POMC neurons influence distinct neural circuits controlling energy homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we found that <i>Vglut2</i>-IRES-Cre dependent <i>Pomc</i> restoration on a hypothalamic <i>Pomc</i> null background was sufficient to prevent obesity. A series of double- and triple-label in situ hybridization experiments showed that 38% of POMC neurons express both <i>Slc17a6</i> and <i>Gad67</i>, markers of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively. Together, these data suggest a previously unreported developmental plasticity in the neurotransmitter phenotype of POMC neurons.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>As communication signal properties change, through genetic drift or selective pressure, the sensory systems that receive these signals must also adapt to maintain sensitivity and adaptability in an array of contexts. Shedding light on this process helps us understand how sensory codes are tailored to specific tasks. In a species of weakly electric fish, <i>Apteronotus albifrons</i>, we examined the unique neurophysiological properties that support the encoding of electrosensory communication signals that the animal encounters in social exchanges. We compare our findings to known coding properties of the closely related species, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>, to establish how these animals differ in their ability to encode their distinctive communication signals. While there are many similarities between these two species, we found notable differences leading to relatively poor coding of the details of chirp structure occurring on high-frequency background beats. As a result, small differences in chirp properties are poorly resolved by the nervous system. We performed behavioral tests to relate <i>A. albifrons</i> chirp coding strategies to its use of chirps during social encounters. Our results suggest that <i>A. albifrons</i> do not exchange frequent chirps in non-breeding condition, particularly when the beat frequency is high. These findings parallel the mediocre chirp coding accuracy in that they both point to a reduced reliance on frequent and rich exchange of information through chirps during these social interactions. Therefore, our study suggests that neural coding strategies in the central nervous system vary across species in a way that parallels the behavioral use of the sensory signals.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE:</b> Sender-receiver matching is a phenomenon commonly observed in the peripheral nervous system. It enables communication production and reception to evolve together so that conspecifics remain sensitive to important signals. In this manuscript we examine this phenomenon in the central nervous system weakly electric fish <i>A. albifrons</i> and compare its processing of communication signals to a closely related species (<i>A. leptorhynchus)</i>. Although some differences across the two species can help tailor the system for processing species-specific signals, our data indicate that encoding of communication signals in <i>A. albifrons</i> is not as efficient as in <i>A. leptorhynchus</i> for certain categories of signals. Our data support the idea that the extent of sender-receiver matching can vary as a function of behavioral needs.</p>

Abstract<p>Multisensory effects are found when the input from single senses combines and this has been well-researched in the brain. Presently, we examined in humans the potential impact of visuo-proprioceptive interactions at the peripheral level, using microneurography, and compared it with a similar behavioral task. We used a paradigm where participants had either proprioceptive information only (no vision) or combined visual and proprioceptive signals (vision). We moved the foot to measure changes in the sensitivity of single muscle afferents, which can be altered by the descending fusimotor drive. Visual information interacted with proprioceptive information, where we found that for the same passive movement, the response of muscle afferents increased when the proprioceptive channel was the only source of information, as compared with when visual cues were added, regardless of the attentional level. Behaviorally, when participants looked at their foot moving, they more accurately judged differences between movement amplitudes, than in the absence of visual cues. These results impact our understanding of multisensory interactions throughout the nervous system, where the information from different senses can modify the sensitivity of peripheral receptors. This has clinical implications, where future strategies may modulate such visual signals during sensorimotor rehabilitation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> It is well known that multisensory processes occur in the brain, yet we know little about the consequences of multisensory interactions at the spinal level. We recorded from single muscle afferents, while participants either saw or did not see their foot moving. We show that adding visual information reduces muscle afferent firing, probably via descending commands by fusimotor efference. These results impact sensorimotor rehabilitation, where clinical strategies using exercises without visual feedback may promote proprioceptive training.</p>

Abstract
<p>Vestibulospinal neurons are organized into discrete groups projecting from brainstem to spinal cord, enabling vertebrates to maintain proper balance and posture. The two largest groups are the lateral vestibulospinal tract (LVST) group and the contralateral medial vestibulospinal tract (cMVST) group, with different projection lateralities and functional roles. In search of a molecular basis for these differences, we performed RNA sequencing on LVST and cMVST neurons from mouse and chicken embryos followed by immunohistofluorescence validation. Focusing on transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes, we identified TF signatures that uniquely distinguish the LVST from the cMVST group and further parse different rhombomere-derived portions comprising the cMVST group. Immunohistofluorescence assessment of the CNS from spinal cord to cortex demonstrated that these TF signatures are restricted to the respective vestibulospinal groups and some neurons in their immediate vicinity. Collectively, these results link the combinatorial expression of TFs to developmental and functional subdivisions within the vestibulospinal system.</p>

Abstract
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the gradual degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to striatal dopamine depletion. A partial unilateral striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion causes 40–60% dopamine depletion in the lesioned rat striatum, modeling the early stage of PD. In this study, we explored the connectivity between the brain regions in partially 6-OHDA lesioned male Wistar rats under urethane anesthesia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 5 weeks after the 6-OHDA infusion. Under urethane anesthesia, the brain fluctuates between the two states, resembling rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep states. We observed clear urethane-induced sleep-like states in 8/19 lesioned animals and 8/18 control animals. 6-OHDA lesioned animals exhibited significantly lower functional connectivity between the brain regions. However, we observed these differences only during the REM-like sleep state, suggesting the involvement of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in REM sleep regulation. Corticocortical and corticostriatal connections were decreased in both hemispheres, reflecting the global effect of the lesion. Overall, this study describes a promising model to study PD-related sleep disorders in rats using fMRI.</p>

<p>Development of the nervous system relies on a balance between axon and dendrite growth and subsequent pruning and degeneration. The developmental degeneration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory axons has been well studied in part because it can be readily modeled by removing the trophic support by nerve growth factor (NGF) <i>in vitro</i>. We have recently reported that axonal fragmentation induced by NGF withdrawal is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and here, we address the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry required for developmental axon degeneration of mouse embryonic DRG neurons. Our results show that the transient receptor potential vanilloid family member 1 (TRPV1) cation channel plays a critical role mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in DRG axons withdrawn from NGF. We further demonstrate that TRPV1 activation is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that is driven through protein kinase C (PKC) and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent pathways that become active upon NGF withdrawal. These findings demonstrate novel mechanistic links between NGF deprivation, PKC activation, ROS generation, and TRPV1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in sensory axon degeneration.</p>

<p>13 Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), also known as doublecortex syndrome,
is a 14 malformation of cortical development resulting from mutations in the
doublecortin gene 15 (DCX). It is characterized by a lack of migration of
cortical neurons that accumulate in the 16 white matter forming a heterotopic
band. Patients with SBH may present mild to moderate 17 intellectual disability
as well as epilepsy. The SBH condition can be modeled in rats by in 18 utero
knockdown (KD) of Dcx. The affected cells form an SBH reminiscent of that
observed in 19 human patients and the animals develop a chronic epileptic
condition in adulthood. Here, 20 we investigated if the presence of an SBH is
sufficient to induce cognitive impairment in 21

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44305">A novel L1CAM isoform with angiogenic activity generated by NOVA2-mediated alternative splicing</a></h4>

The biological players involved in angiogenesis are only partially defined. Here, we report that endothelial cells (ECs) express a novel isoform of the cell-surface adhesion molecule L1CAM, termed L1-ΔTM. The splicing factor NOVA2, which binds directly to <i>L1CAM</i> pre-mRNA, is necessary and sufficient for the skipping of L1CAM transmembrane domain in ECs, leading to the release of soluble L1-ΔTM. The latter exerts high angiogenic function through both autocrine and paracrine activities. Mechanistically, L1-ΔTM-induced angiogenesis requires fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 signaling, implying a crosstalk between the two molecules. NOVA2 and L1-ΔTM are overexpressed in the vasculature of ovarian cancer, where L1-ΔTM levels correlate with tumor vascularization, supporting the involvement of NOVA2-mediated L1-ΔTM production in tumor angiogenesis. Finally, high NOVA2 expression is associated with poor outcome in ovarian cancer patients. Our results point to L1-ΔTM as a novel, EC-derived angiogenic factor which may represent a target for innovative antiangiogenic therapies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43542">Automated cryo-EM structure refinement using correlation-driven molecular dynamics</a></h4>

We present a correlation-driven molecular dynamics (CDMD) method for automated refinement of atomistic models into cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at resolutions ranging from near-atomic to subnanometer. It utilizes a chemically accurate force field and thermodynamic sampling to improve the real-space correlation between the modeled structure and the cryo-EM map. Our framework employs a gradual increase in resolution and map-model agreement as well as simulated annealing, and allows fully automated refinement without manual intervention or any additional rotamer- and backbone-specific restraints. Using multiple challenging systems covering a wide range of map resolutions, system sizes, starting model geometries and distances from the target state, we assess the quality of generated models in terms of both model accuracy and potential of overfitting. To provide an objective comparison, we apply several well-established methods across all examples and demonstrate that CDMD performs best in most cases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42619">Division of labour between PP2A-B56 isoforms at the centromere and kinetochore</a></h4>

PP2A-B56 is a serine/threonine phosphatase complex that regulates several major mitotic processes, including sister chromatid cohesion, kinetochore-microtubule attachment and the spindle assembly checkpoint. We show here that these key functions are divided between different B56 isoforms that localise to either the centromere or kinetochore. The centromeric isoforms rely on a specific interaction with Sgo2, whereas the kinetochore isoforms bind preferentially to BubR1 and other proteins containing an LxxIxE motif. In addition to these selective binding partners, Sgo1 helps to anchor PP2A-B56 at both locations: it collaborates with BubR1 to maintain B56 at the kinetochore and it helps to preserve the Sgo2/B56 complex at the centromere. A series of chimaeras were generated to map the critical region in B56 down to a small C-terminal loop that regulates the key interactions and defines B56 localisation. Together, this study describes how different PP2A-B56 complexes utilise isoform-specific interactions to control distinct processes during mitosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42223">Perception in autism does not adhere to Weber's law</a></h4>

Perceptual atypicalities are a widely acknowledged but poorly understood feature of autism. We demonstrate here a striking violation of one of the most adaptive psychophysical computations - Weber's law - in high-functioning individuals with autism. JNDs based on the best-fitting psychometric functions were measured for size visual judgments (Exp. 1), weight haptic discrimination (Exp. 2), and illusive perception of weight (brightness-weight illusion; Exp. 3). Results for the typically developed group confirmed Weber's law, demonstrating a linear increase in JNDs with intensity, resulting in constant fractions across intensities. The results for the ASD, in contrast, showed no scaling of JNDs with intensity; instead, fractions decreased linearly with intensity. In striking contrast to its consistency in typical perception, Weber's law does not hold for visual and haptic perception in autism. These robust modulations in psychophysical computations, demonstrated for different domains of perception, suggest a modality-independent, low-level mechanism driving altered perception in autism.

During embryonic development, diffusible signaling molecules called morphogens are thought to determine cell fates in a concentration-dependent way. Yet, in mammalian embryos, concentrations change rapidly compared to the time for making cell fate decisions. Here, we use human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to address how changing morphogen levels influence differentiation, focusing on how BMP4 and Nodal signaling govern the cell-fate decisions associated with gastrulation. We show that BMP4 response is concentration dependent, but that expression of many Nodal targets depends on rate of concentration change. Moreover, in a self-organized stem cell model for human gastrulation, expression of these genes follows rapid changes in endogenous Nodal signaling. Our study shows a striking contrast between the specific ways ligand dynamics are interpreted by two closely related signaling pathways, highlighting both the subtlety and importance of morphogen dynamics for understanding mammalian embryogenesis and designing optimized protocols for directed stem cell differentiation.

Chandelier cells (ChCs) are the only interneuron subtype that selectively innervates the axon initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal neurons (PyNs) in the neocortex; yet, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Tai et al. reveal that neocortical ChC/PyN AIS innervation requires ankyrin-G-clustered L1CAM.

These mechanisms ensure that somatic inhibition scales appropriately with circuit activity.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
<i>LRRK2</i> mutations, the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease (PD), display incomplete penetrance, indicating the importance of other genetic and environmental influences on disease pathogenesis in <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers. The present study investigates whether urate, an antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, and inverse risk factor for idiopathic PD, is one such candidate biomarker of PD risk modulation in pathogenic <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Banked plasma samples or urate levels were obtained for 3 cohorts of age‐ and sex‐matched subjects with and without a known <i>LRRK2</i> mutation in PD and unaffected controls to conduct a pilot study of 192 subjects from the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium (LCC) and 2 validation studies of 380 additional subjects from the LCC and 922 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Urate levels were compared by multiple regression between subjects with and without a PD diagnosis conditional on <i>LRRK2</i> status, controlling for age and sex.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nonmanifesting <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers had significantly higher levels of urate than those who developed PD in each of the 3 independent cohorts. A meta‐analysis demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 0.62 mg/dL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with similar results for separate assessments of women (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.02) and men (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). A 2 mg/dL increment in urate concentration decreased the odds of having PD by approximately 50% (odds ratio = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings identify and substantiate urate as a biomarker of resistance to PD among <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers. Ann Neurol 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>High remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with high risk of ischemic heart disease, but whether this is also the case for ischemic stroke is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that high remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the general population.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 102,964 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with information on remnant cholesterol at baseline in 2003–2015 were included in a prospective, observational association study. Individuals were followed for up to 14 years, during which time 2,488 were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results were independently confirmed in 9,548 individuals enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991–1994; 983 ischemic strokes developed during up to 26 years of follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Step‐wise higher remnant cholesterol concentrations were associated with step‐wise higher ischemic stroke risk in the Copenhagen General Population Study, with multivariable adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.99 (95%confidence interval: 1.49–2.67) for individuals with remnant cholesterol concentrations ≥1.5 mmol/l (58 mg/dl), compared to individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5 mmol/l (19 mg/dl). Results were similar in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke at age 80 in the Copenhagen General Population Study ranged from 7.3% for individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5 mmol/l (19 mg/dl) to 11.5% for individuals with remnant cholesterol ≥1.5 mmol/l (58 mg/dl).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Individuals with high remnant cholesterol concentrations had higher risk of ischemic stroke. These results indicate that randomized clinical trials with remnant cholesterol lowering in individuals with high concentrations, with the aim of preventing ischemic strokes, are needed.

<p>by Jingyu Zhang, Hengyu Chen, Ruoyan Li, David A. Taft, Guang Yao, Fan Bai, Jianhua Xing</p>

Many cellular responses to surrounding cues require temporally concerted transcriptional regulation of multiple genes. In prokaryotic cells, a single-input-module motif with one transcription factor regulating multiple target genes can generate coordinated gene expression. In eukaryotic cells, transcriptional activity of a gene is affected by not only transcription factors but also the epigenetic modifications and three-dimensional chromosome structure of the gene. To examine how local gene environment and transcription factor regulation are coupled, we performed a combined analysis of time-course RNA-seq data of TGF-β treated MCF10A cells and related epigenomic and Hi-C data. Using Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM), we clustered differentially expressed genes based on gene expression profiles and associated transcription factors. Genes in each class have similar temporal gene expression patterns and share common transcription factors. Next, we defined a set of linear and radial distribution functions, as used in statistical physics, to measure the distributions of genes within a class both spatially and linearly along the genomic sequence. Remarkably, genes within the same class despite sometimes being separated by tens of million bases (Mb) along genomic sequence show a significantly higher tendency to be spatially close despite sometimes being separated by tens of Mb along the genomic sequence than those belonging to different classes do. Analyses extended to the process of mouse nervous system development arrived at similar conclusions. Future studies will be able to test whether this spatial organization of chromosomes contributes to concerted gene expression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aTopIcpYdBk" width="1" />

Understanding the fundamental characteristics of microbial communities could have far reaching implications for human health and applied biotechnology. Despite this, much is still unknown regarding the genetic basis and evolutionary strategies underlying the formation of viable synthetic communities. By pairing auxotrophic mutants in co-culture, it has been demonstrated that viable nascent <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> communities can be established where the mutant strains are metabolically coupled. A novel algorithm, OptAux, was constructed to design 61 unique multi-knockout <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> auxotrophic strains that require significant metabolite uptake to grow. These predicted knockouts included a diverse set of novel non-specific auxotrophs that result from inhibition of major biosynthetic subsystems. Three OptAux predicted non-specific auxotrophic strains—with diverse metabolic deficiencies—were co-cultured with an L-histidine auxotroph and optimized via adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). Time-course sequencing revealed the genetic changes employed by each strain to achieve higher community growth rates and provided insight into mechanisms for adapting to the syntrophic niche. A community model of metabolism and gene expression was utilized to predict the relative community composition and fundamental characteristics of the evolved communities. This work presents new insight into the genetic strategies underlying viable nascent community formation and a cutting-edge computational method to elucidate metabolic changes that empower the creation of cooperative communities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gTcSmTNK8MY" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Dynamical changes in the environment strongly impact our perception. Likewise, sensory systems preferentially represent stimulus changes, enhancing temporal contrast. In olfaction, odor concentration changes across consecutive inhalations (<i>C<sub>t</sub></i>) can guide odor source localization, yet the neural representation of <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> has not been studied in vertebrates. We have found that, in the mouse olfactory bulb, a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, enhancing the contrast between different concentrations. These concentration change responses are direction selective: they respond either to increments or decrements of concentration, reminiscent of ON and OFF selectivity in the retina. This contrast enhancement scales with the magnitude, but not the duration of the concentration step. Further, <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.</p>

Abstract
<p>Odor information is transmitted from olfactory sensory neurons to principal neurons at the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. The intraglomerular neuronal circuit also includes hundreds of interneurons referred to as juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. Stimulus selectivity is well correlated among many JG cells that are associated with the same glomerulus, consistent with their highly homogeneous sensory inputs. However, much less is known about the temporal aspects of their activity, including the temporal coordination of their odor-evoked responses. As many JG cells within a glomerular module respond to the same stimulus, the extent to which their activity is temporally aligned will affect the temporal profile of their population inhibitory inputs. Using random-access high-speed two-photon microscopy, we recorded the odor-evoked calcium transients of mouse JG cells and compared the onset latency and rise time among neurons putatively associated with the same and different glomeruli. Whereas the overall onset latencies of odor-evoked transients were distributed across a ~150 ms time window, those from cells putatively associated with the same glomerulus were confined to a much narrower window of several tens of milliseconds. This result suggests that onset latency primarily depends on the associated glomerulus. We also observed glomerular specificity in the rise time. The glomerulus-specific temporal pattern of odor-evoked activity implies that the temporal patterns of inputs from the intraglomerular circuit are unique to individual glomerulus–odor pairs, which may contribute to efficient shaping of the temporal pattern of activity in the principal neurons.</p>

Abstract
<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the repeated rise of concerns (obsessions) and repetitive unwanted behavior (compulsions). Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-choice drug, response rates to SSRI treatment vary between symptom dimensions. In this study, to find a therapeutic target for SSRI-resilient OCD symptoms, we evaluated treatment responses of quinpirole (QNP) sensitization-induced OCD-related behaviors in mice. SSRI administration rescued the cognitive inflexibility, as well as hyperactivity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), while no improvement was observed for the repetitive behavior. D<sub>2</sub> receptor signaling in the central striatum (CS) was involved in SSRI-resistant repetitive behavior. An adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist, istradefylline, which rescued abnormal excitatory synaptic function in the CS indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of sensitized mice, alleviated both of the QNP-induced abnormal behaviors with only short-term administration. These results provide a new insight into therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant OCD symptoms and indicate the potential of A<sub>2A</sub> antagonists as a rapid-acting anti-OCD drug.</p>

Abstract
<p>Cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic (CCK-GABA) neurons are perisomatic inhibitory cells that have been argued to regulate emotion and sculpt the network oscillations associated with cognition. However, no study has selectively manipulated CCK-GABA neuron activity during behavior in freely-moving animals. To explore the behavioral effects of activating CCK-GABA neurons on emotion and cognition, we utilized a novel intersectional genetic mouse model coupled with a chemogenetic approach. Specifically, we generated triple transgenic <i>CCK-Cre;Dlx5/6-Flpe;RC::FL-hM3Dq</i> (CCK-GABA/hM3Dq) mice that expressed the synthetic excitatory hM3Dq receptor in CCK-GABA neurons. Results showed that clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)-mediated activation of CCK-GABA neurons did not alter open field (OF) or tail suspension (TS) performance and only slightly increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Although CNO treatment had only modestly affected emotional behavior, it significantly enhanced multiple cognitive and memory behaviors including social recognition, contextual fear conditioning, contextual discrimination, object recognition, and problem-solving in the puzzle box. Collectively, these findings suggest that systemic activation of CCK-GABA neurons minimally affects emotion but significantly enhances cognition and memory. Our results imply that CCK-GABA neurons are more functionally diverse than originally expected and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive/memory disorders.</p>

<p>Automatic mimicry is a critical element of social interaction. A salient type of automatic mimicry is eye contact characterized by sharing of affective and mental states among individuals. We conducted a hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging study involving on-line (LIVE) and delayed off-line (REPLAY) conditions to test our hypothesis that recurrent interaction through eye contact activates the limbic mirror system, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex (AIC), both of which are critical for self-awareness. Sixteen pairs of human adults participated in the experiment. Given that an eye-blink represents an individual’s attentional window toward the partner, we analyzed pairwise time-series data for eye-blinks. We used multivariate autoregression analysis to calculate the noise contribution ratio (NCR) as an index of how a participant’s directional attention was influenced by that of their partner. NCR was greater in the LIVE than in the REPLAY condition, indicating mutual perceptual–motor interaction during real-time eye contact. Relative to the REPLAY condition, the LIVE condition was associated with greater activation in the left cerebellar hemisphere, vermis, and ACC, accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity between ACC and right AIC. Given the roles of the cerebellum in sensorimotor prediction and ACC in movement initiation, ACC–cerebellar activation may represent their involvement in modulating visual input related to the partner’s movement, which may, in turn, involve the limbic mirror system. Our findings indicate that mutual interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system.</p>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Lalanti Venkatasubramanian, Richard S Mann</p><div><p>In order to generate complex motor outputs, the nervous system integrates multiple sources of sensory information that ultimately controls motor neurons to generate coordinated movements. The neural circuits that integrate higher order commands from the brain and generate motor outputs are located in the nerve cord of the central nervous system. Recently, genetic access to distinct functional subtypes that make up the <em>Drosophila</em> adult ventral nerve cord has significantly begun to advance our understanding of the structural organization and functions of the neural circuits coordinating motor outputs. Moreover, lineage-tracing and genetic intersection tools have been instrumental in deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate and assemble the functional units of the adult nerve cord. Together, the <em>Drosophila</em> adult ventral nerve cord is emerging as a powerful system to understand the development and function of neural circuits that are responsible for coordinating complex motor outputs.</p></div>

<p>This article introduces a model-agnostic approach to study statistical
synergy, a form of emergence in which patterns at large scales are not
traceable from lower scales. Our framework leverages various multivariate
extensions of Shannon's mutual information, and introduces the O-information as
a metric capable of characterising synergy- and redundancy-dominated systems.
We develop key analytical properties of the O-information, and study how it
relates to other metrics of high-order interactions from the statistical
mechanics and neuroscience literature. Finally, as a proof of concept, we use
the proposed framework to explore the relevance of statistical synergy in
Baroque music scores.

<p>A large variety of methods has been proposed for automatic seizure detection
in EEG signals. Those achieving maximal performance are based on
machine-learning techniques, which require long training sessions with large
labelled databases, and produce a verdict with no intuitive justification. As
an alternative, we here explore an unsupervised algorithm applicable to
intra-cranial EEG recordings that requires good sampling of the non-ictal
periods, but imposes no demands on the amount of data during ictal activity.
The algorithm analyses how the amount of power in each frequency band
fluctuates ( an evaluation physicians are familiar with ) and can be
implemented online. The analysis is performed electrode by electrode, thus
providing the spatio-temporal sequence in which the affected regions are
recruited into the crisis. We test it with 32 crisis registered in 5 patients,
for which we also have the degree of loss of consciousness as determined from a
behavioural analysis. The method can achieve a precision of 85% and a recall of
88% in the identification of seizures, and 77% and 88% in the identification of
recruited electrodes. The intuitive nature of the analysis allows us to
identify certain physiological features that are correlated with the degree of
loss of consciousness. For example, epileptic crisis in which the variance of
the power in the alpha band increases at around seizure onset are particularly
likely to impair consciousness. We conclude that the PCA of the distribution of
power in different frequency bands provides information both about the
detection and the characterization of epileptic seizures.

<p>How do organisms recognize their environment by acquiring knowledge about the
world, and what actions do they take based on this knowledge? This article
examines hypotheses about organisms' adaptation to the environment from machine
learning, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic perspectives. We start with
constructing a hierarchical model of the world as an internal model in the
brain, and review standard machine learning methods to infer causes by
approximately learning the model under the maximum likelihood principle. This
in turn provides an overview of the free energy principle for an organism, a
hypothesis to explain perception and action from the principle of least
surprise. Treating this statistical learning as communication between the world
and brain, learning is interpreted as a process to maximize information about
the world. We investigate how the classical theories of perception such as the
infomax principle relates to learning the hierarchical model. We then present
an approach to the recognition and learning based on thermodynamics, showing
that adaptation by causal learning results in the second law of thermodynamics
whereas inference dynamics that fuses observation with prior knowledge forms a
thermodynamic process. These provide a unified view on the adaptation of
organisms to the environment.

<p>We introduce a probabilistic generative model for disentangling
spatio-temporal disease trajectories from series of high-dimensional brain
images. The model is based on spatio-temporal matrix factorization, where
inference on the sources is constrained by anatomically plausible statistical
priors. To model realistic trajectories, the temporal sources are defined as
monotonic and time-reparametrized Gaussian Processes. To account for the
non-stationarity of brain images, we model the spatial sources as sparse codes
convolved at multiple scales. The method was tested on synthetic data
favourably comparing with standard blind source separation approaches. The
application on large-scale imaging data from a clinical study allows to
disentangle differential temporal progression patterns mapping brain regions
key to neurodegeneration, while revealing a disease-specific time scale
associated to the clinical diagnosis.

<p>Fluctuation-based dispersion entropy (FDispEn) is a new approach to estimate
the dynamical variability of the fluctuations of signals. It is based on
Shannon entropy and fluctuation-based dispersion patterns. To quantify the
physiological dynamics over multiple time scales, multiscale FDispEn (MFDE) is
developed in this article. MFDE is robust to the presence of baseline wanders,
or trends, in the data. We evaluate MFDE, compared with popular multiscale
sample entropy (MSE), and the recently introduced multiscale dispersion entropy
(MDE), on selected synthetic data and five neurological diseases' datasets: 1)
focal and non-focal electroencephalograms (EEGs); 2) walking stride interval
signals for young, elderly, and Parkinson's subjects; 3) stride interval
fluctuations for Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; 4)
EEGs for controls and Alzheimer's disease patients; and 5) eye movement data
for Parkinson's disease and ataxia. MFDE dealt with the problem of undefined
MSE values and, compared with MDE, led to more stable entropy values over the
scale factors for pink noise. Overall, MFDE was the fastest and most consistent
method for the discrimination of different states of neurological data,
especially where the mean value of a time series considerably changes along the
signal (e.g., eye movement data). This study shows that MFDE is a relevant new
metric to gain further insights into the dynamics of neurological diseases
recordings.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44487">Dynamic control of hippocampal spatial coding resolution by local visual cues</a></h4>

The ability to flexibly navigate an environment relies on a hippocampal-dependent cognitive map. External space can be internally mapped at different spatial resolutions. However, whether hippocampal spatial coding resolution can rapidly adapt to local features of an environment remains unclear. To explore this possibility, we recorded the firing of hippocampal neurons in mice navigating virtual reality environments, embedding or not local visual cues (virtual 3D objects) in specific locations. Virtual objects enhanced spatial coding resolution in their vicinity with a higher proportion of place cells, smaller place fields, increased spatial selectivity and stability. This effect was highly dynamic upon objects manipulations. Objects also improved temporal coding resolution through improved theta phase precession and theta timescale spike coordination. We propose that the fast adaptation of hippocampal spatial coding resolution to local features of an environment could be relevant for large-scale navigation.

Elevated glucose increases vascular reactivity by promoting L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel (LTCC) activity by protein kinase A (PKA). Yet, how glucose activates PKA is unknown. We hypothesized that a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor is an upstream activator of PKA mediating LTCC potentiation during diabetic hyperglycemia. Experiments in apyrase-treated cells suggested involvement of a P2Y receptor underlying the glucose effects on LTTCs. Using human tissue, expression for P2Y<sub>11</sub>, the only G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor, was detected in nanometer proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA. FRET-based experiments revealed that the selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 and elevated glucose stimulate cAMP production resulting in enhanced PKA-dependent LTCC activity. These changes were blocked by the selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor NF340. Comparable results were observed in mouse tissue, suggesting that a P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor is mediating the glucose response in these cells. These findings established a key role for P2Y<sub>11</sub> in regulating PKA-dependent LTCC function and vascular reactivity during diabetic hyperglycemia.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neocortical astrogenesis follows neuronogenesis and precedes oligogenesis. Among key factors dictating its temporal articulation, there are progression rates of pallial stem cells (SCs) towards astroglial lineages as well as activation rates of astrocyte differentiation programs in response to extrinsic gliogenic cues. In this study, we showed that high Foxg1 SC expression antagonizes astrocyte generation, while stimulating SC self-renewal and committing SCs to neuronogenesis. We found that mechanisms underlying this activity are mainly cell autonomous and highly pleiotropic. They include a concerted downregulation of 4 key effectors channeling neural SCs to astroglial fates, as well as defective activation of core molecular machineries implementing astroglial differentiation programs. Next, we found that SC Foxg1 levels specifically decline during the neuronogenic-to-gliogenic transition, pointing to a pivotal Foxg1 role in temporal modulation of astrogenesis. Finally, we showed that Foxg1 inhibits astrogenesis from human neocortical precursors, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily ancient trait.</span>

The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula.

<p>by Moritz Hoffmann, Christoph Fröhner, Frank Noé</p>

Interacting-particle reaction dynamics (iPRD) combines the simulation of dynamical trajectories of interacting particles as in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with reaction kinetics, in which particles appear, disappear, or change their type and interactions based on a set of reaction rules. This combination facilitates the simulation of reaction kinetics in crowded environments, involving complex molecular geometries such as polymers, and employing complex reaction mechanisms such as breaking and fusion of polymers. iPRD simulations are ideal to simulate the detailed spatiotemporal reaction mechanism in complex and dense environments, such as in signalling processes at cellular membranes, or in nano- to microscale chemical reactors. Here we introduce the iPRD software ReaDDy 2, which provides a Python interface in which the simulation environment, particle interactions and reaction rules can be conveniently defined and the simulation can be run, stored and analyzed. A C++ interface is available to enable deeper and more flexible interactions with the framework. The main computational work of ReaDDy 2 is done in hardware-specific simulation kernels. While the version introduced here provides single- and multi-threading CPU kernels, the architecture is ready to implement GPU and multi-node kernels. We demonstrate the efficiency and validity of ReaDDy 2 using several benchmark examples. ReaDDy 2 is available at the https://readdy.github.io/ website.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TKkTeOngpuQ" width="1" />

<p>by Alejandro Tabas, Martin Andermann, Valeria Schuberth, Helmut Riedel, Emili Balaguer-Ballester, André Rupp</p>

Pitch is a fundamental attribute of auditory perception. The interaction of concurrent pitches gives rise to a sensation that can be characterized by its degree of consonance or dissonance. In this work, we propose that human auditory cortex (AC) processes pitch and consonance through a common neural network mechanism operating at early cortical levels. First, we developed a new model of neural ensembles incorporating realistic neuronal and synaptic parameters to assess pitch processing mechanisms at early stages of AC. Next, we designed a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment to measure the neuromagnetic activity evoked by dyads with varying degrees of consonance or dissonance. MEG results show that dissonant dyads evoke a pitch onset response (POR) with a latency up to 36 ms longer than consonant dyads. Additionally, we used the model to predict the processing time of concurrent pitches; here, consonant pitch combinations were decoded faster than dissonant combinations, in line with the experimental observations. Specifically, we found a striking match between the predicted and the observed latency of the POR as elicited by the dyads. These novel results suggest that consonance processing starts early in human auditory cortex and may share the network mechanisms that are responsible for (single) pitch processing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OHw2bFBunrk" width="1" />

<p>by Shayne M. Plourde, Prativa Amom, Michelle Tan, Adriana T. Dawes, Anna A. Dobritsa</p>

Pollen provides an excellent system to study pattern formation at the single-cell level. Pollen surface is covered by the pollen wall exine, whose deposition is excluded from certain surface areas, the apertures, which vary between the species in their numbers, positions, and morphology. What determines aperture patterns is not understood. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> normally develops three apertures, equally spaced along the pollen equator. However, Arabidopsis mutants whose pollen has higher ploidy and larger volume develop four or more apertures. To explore possible mechanisms responsible for aperture patterning, we developed a mathematical model based on the Gierer-Meinhardt system of equations. This model was able to recapitulate aperture patterns observed in the wild-type and higher-ploidy pollen. We then used this model to further explore geometric and kinetic factors that may influence aperture patterns and found that pollen size, as well as certain kinetic parameters, like diffusion and decay of morphogens, could play a role in formation of aperture patterns. In conjunction with mathematical modeling, we also performed a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis and discovered two mutants with aperture patterns that had not been previously observed in this species but were predicted by our model. The <i>macaron</i> mutant develops a single ring-like aperture, matching the unusual ring-like pattern produced by the model. The <i>doughnut</i> mutant forms two pore-like apertures at the poles of the pollen grain. Further tests on these novel mutants, motivated by the modeling results, suggested the existence of an area of inhibition around apertures that prevents formation of additional apertures in their vicinity. This work demonstrates the ability of the theoretical model to help focus experimental efforts and to provide fundamental insights into an important biological process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-XSS-63H_Vw" width="1" />

<p>by Sen Pei, Mark A. Cane, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Process-based models have been used to simulate and forecast a number of nonlinear dynamical systems, including influenza and other infectious diseases. In this work, we evaluate the effects of model initial condition error and stochastic fluctuation on forecast accuracy in a compartmental model of influenza transmission. These two types of errors are found to have qualitatively similar growth patterns during model integration, indicating that dynamic error growth, regardless of source, is a dominant component of forecast inaccuracy. We therefore examine the nonlinear growth of model initial error and compute the fastest growing directions using singular vector analysis. Using this information, we generate perturbations in an ensemble forecast system of influenza to obtain more optimal ensemble spread. In retrospective forecasts of historical outbreaks for 95 US cities from 2003 to 2014, this approach improves short-term forecast of incidence over the next one to four weeks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z3MCPHxJnME" width="1" />

Metabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites. The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA, as well as the case study datasets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dHF-_ktVih0" width="1" />

<p>by Moritz Möller, Rafal Bogacz</p>

A set of sub-cortical nuclei called basal ganglia is critical for learning the values of actions. The basal ganglia include two pathways, which have been associated with approach and avoid behavior respectively and are differentially modulated by dopamine projections from the midbrain. Inspired by the influential opponent actor learning model, we demonstrate that, under certain circumstances, these pathways may represent learned estimates of the positive and negative consequences (payoffs and costs) of individual actions. In the model, the level of dopamine activity encodes the motivational state and controls to what extent payoffs and costs enter the overall evaluation of actions. We show that a set of previously proposed plasticity rules is suitable to extract payoffs and costs from a prediction error signal if they occur at different moments in time. For those plasticity rules, successful learning requires differential effects of positive and negative outcome prediction errors on the two pathways and a weak decay of synaptic weights over trials. We also confirm through simulations that the model reproduces drug-induced changes of willingness to work, as observed in classical experiments with the D2-antagonist haloperidol.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OuBZysQ44wM" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inward. We assessed how early in the multiple sclerosis course a "surface‐in" process of injury suggesting progressive biology may begin.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We focused on the thalamus, which notably has both a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface and a white matter interface. Thalamic volume trajectories were assessed in a prospectively followed cohort of children from initial presentation with either multiple sclerosis or monophasic acquired demyelination, and healthy controls. Voxelwise volume changes were calculated using deformation‐based morphometry, and analyzed in relation to distance from the CSF interface by mixed effects modeling and semiparametric smoothing methods.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty‐seven children with multiple sclerosis and 73 children with monophasic demyelination were prospectively followed with yearly brain scans (mean follow‐up = 4.6 years, standard deviation = 1.9). A total of 282 healthy children with serial scans were included as controls. Relative to healthy controls, children with multiple sclerosis and children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated volume loss in thalamic regions adjacent to the white matter. However, only children with multiple sclerosis exhibited an additional surface‐in gradient of thalamic injury on the ventricular side, which was already notable in the first year of clinical disease (asymptote estimate = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44–4.58, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and worsened over time (asymptote:time estimate = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12–0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.0021).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that a multiple sclerosis disease‐specific surface‐in process of damage can manifest at the earliest stages of the disease. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:340–351.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the association of poststroke baseline blood pressure with cerebral collateral flow and functional outcome in acute ischemic patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients identified with large vessel occlusion/stenosis with baseline multimodal computed tomography, follow‐up imaging, and complete clinical profiles were included. A 90‐day modified Rankin Scale of 0–1 was defined as an excellent functional outcome. Cerebral collateral flow was quantified by the volume ratio of tissue within the delay time &gt;3 seconds perfusion lesion with severely delayed contrast transit (delay time &gt;3 seconds/delay time &gt;6 seconds).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 306 patients included in this study. With every increase of 10 mmHg in baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome decreased by 12% in multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.048). Conversely, increased baseline blood pressure was associated with better collateral flow. In subgroup analysis of patients with major reperfusion, higher blood pressure was associated with decreased infarct growth and a better clinical outcome, and vice versa in patients without reperfusion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis was associated with better collateral flow. However, for patients without reperfusion, higher baseline blood pressure was associated with increased infarct growth, leading to an unfavorable clinical outcome. The relationship between blood pressure and outcomes is highly dependent on reperfusion, and active blood pressure–lowering treatment may be inappropriate in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to reperfusion treatment. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:331–339.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic modifiers in rare disease have long been suspected to contribute to the considerable variance in disease expression, including Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). To address this question, the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium collected a large standardized sample of such rare CMT1A patients over a period of 8 years. CMT1A is caused in most patients by a uniformly sized 1.5 Mb duplication event involving the gene <i>PMP22</i>.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients on Illumina BeadChips. Genome‐wide analysis was performed in a subset of 330 of these patients, who expressed the extremes of a hallmark symptom: mild and severe foot dorsiflexion strength impairment. <i>SIPA1L2</i> (signal‐induced proliferation‐associated 1 like 2), the top identified candidate modifier gene, was expressed in the peripheral nerve, and our functional studies identified and confirmed interacting proteins using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro siRNA experiments were used to analyze gene regulation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified significant association of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10910527, rs7536385, rs4649265, rs1547740) in <i>SIPA1L2</i> with foot dorsiflexion strength (<i>p</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>). Coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy studies identified β‐actin and MYH9 as SIPA1L2 binding partners. Furthermore, we show that <i>SIPA1L2</i> is part of a myelination‐associated coexpressed network regulated by the master transcription factor SOX10. Importantly, in vitro knockdown of <i>SIPA1L2</i> in Schwannoma cells led to a significant reduction of <i>PMP22</i> expression, hinting at a potential strategy for drug development.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>
<i>SIPA1L2</i> is a potential genetic modifier of CMT1A phenotypic expressions and offers a new pathway to therapeutic interventions. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:316–330.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Solriamfetol (JZP‐110) is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with wake‐promoting effects. This phase 3 study (NCT02348593) evaluated the safety and efficacy of solriamfetol in narcolepsy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with narcolepsy with mean sleep latency &lt;25 minutes on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score ≥10, and usual nightly sleep ≥6 hours were randomized to solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg, or placebo for 12 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to week 12 in MWT and ESS. Improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI‐C) was the key secondary endpoint.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Safety and modified intention‐to‐treat populations included 236 and 231 patients, respectively. Solriamfetol 300 and 150 mg were positive on both coprimary endpoints. Least squares mean (standard error [SE]) changes from baseline were 12.3 (SE = 1.4) and 9.8 (SE = 1.3) minutes for solriamfetol 300 and 150 mg on the MWT, respectively, versus 2.1 (SE = 1.3) minutes for placebo, and −6.4 (SE = 0.7) for 300 mg and −5.4 (SE = 0.7) for 150 mg on the ESS versus −1.6 (SE = 0.7) for placebo (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). At week 12, higher percentages of patients treated with solriamfetol 150 mg (78.2%) and 300 mg (84.7%) reported PGI‐C improvement relative to placebo (39.7%; both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Adverse events ≥5% across all solriamfetol doses included headache (21.5%), nausea (10.7%), decreased appetite (10.7%), nasopharyngitis (9.0%), dry mouth (7.3%), and anxiety (5.1%).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Solriamfetol has the potential to be an important therapeutic option for the treatment of impaired wakefulness and excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:359–370.</b></p>

<p>A new scale consisting of 9 items (seizure, memory dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms, consciousness, language problems, dyskinesia/dystonia, gait instability and ataxia, brainstem dysfunction, and weakness) was developed. Each item was assigned a value of up to 3 points. The total score could therefore range from 0 to 27. We named the scale the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). The new scale showed excellent interobserver (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.97) and intraobserver (ICC = 0.96) reliability for total scores, was highly correlated with modified Rankin scale (<i>r</i> = 0.86, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.88). Additionally, in the validation cohort, the scale showed high interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.99) and internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.92).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CASE is a novel clinical scale for AE with a high level of clinimetric properties. It would be suitable for application in clinical practice and might help overcome the limitations of current outcome scales for AE. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:352–358.</b></p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25418?af=R">Neural function in DCC mutation carriers with and without mirror movements</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recently identified mutations of the axon guidance molecule receptor gene, <i>DCC,</i> present an opportunity to investigate, in living human brain, mechanisms affecting neural connectivity and the basis of mirror movements, involuntary contralateral responses that mirror voluntary unilateral actions. We hypothesized that haploinsufficient <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers with mirror movements would exhibit decreased <i>DCC</i> mRNA expression, a functional ipsilateral corticospinal tract, greater “mirroring” motor representations, and reduced interhemispheric inhibition. <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers without mirror movements might exhibit some of these features.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The participants (n = 52) included 13 <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers with mirror movements, 7 <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers without mirror movements, 13 relatives without the mutation or mirror movements, and 19 unrelated healthy volunteers. The multimodal approach comprised quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under resting and task conditions, and measures of white matter integrity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mirror movements were associated with reduced <i>DCC</i> mRNA expression, increased ipsilateral TMS‐induced motor evoked potentials, increased fMRI responses in the mirroring M1 and cerebellum, and markedly reduced interhemispheric inhibition. The <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation, irrespective of mirror movements, was associated with reduced functional connectivity and white matter integrity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Diverse connectivity abnormalities were identified in mutation carriers with and without mirror movements, but corticospinal effects and decreased peripheral <i>DCC</i> mRNA appeared driven by the mirror movement phenotype. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:433–442.</b></p>

<p>Disorders of consciousness (DOC) are a common consequence of severe brain injuries, and clinical evaluation is critical to provide a correct diagnosis and prognosis. The revised Motor Behavior Tool (MBT‐r) is a clinical complementary tool aiming to identify subtle motor behaviors that might reflect residual cognition in DOC. In this prospective study including 30 DOC patients in the early stage after brain injury, we show that the revised MBT‐r has an excellent inter‐rater agreement and has the ability to identify a subgroup of patients, underestimated by the Coma Recovery Scale‐Revised, showing residual cognition and a subsequent recovery of consciousness. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:443–447.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the initial termination rate of status epilepticus (SE) in a large observational study and explore associated variables.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data of adults treated for SE were collected prospectively in centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, during 4.5 years. Incident episodes of 1,049 patients were analyzed using uni‐ and multivariate statistics to determine factors predicting cessation of SE within 1 hour (for generalized convulsive SE [GCSE]) and 12 hours (for non‐GCSE) of initiating treatment.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age at SE onset was 70 years; most frequent etiologies were remote (32%) and acute (31%). GCSE was documented in 43%. Median latency between SE onset and first treatment was 30 minutes in GCSE and 150 minutes in non‐GCSE. The first intravenous compound was a benzodiazepine in 86% in GCSE and 73% in non‐GCSE. Bolus doses of the first treatment step were lower than recommended by current guidelines in 76% of GCSE patients and 78% of non‐GCSE patients. In 319 GCSE patients (70%), SE was ongoing 1 hour after initiating treatment and in 342 non‐GCSE patients (58%) 12 hours after initiating treatment. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that use of benzodiazepines as first treatment step and a higher cumulative dose of anticonvulsants within the first period of treatment were associated with shorter time to cessation of SE for both groups.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In clinical practice, treatment guidelines were not followed in a substantial proportion of patients. This underdosing correlated with lack of cessation of SE. Our data suggest that sufficiently dosed benzodiazepines should be used as a first treatment step. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:421–432.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The two related tumor necrosis factor members a proliferation‐inducing ligand (APRIL) and B‐cell activation factor (BAFF) are currently targeted in autoimmune diseases as B‐cell regulators. In multiple sclerosis (MS), combined APRIL/BAFF blockade led to unexpected exacerbated inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients. Here, we investigate the role of the APRIL/BAFF axis in the CNS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>APRIL expression was analyzed in MS lesions by immunohistochemistry. The <i>in vivo</i> role of APRIL was assessed in the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Functional <i>in vitro</i> studies were performed with human and mouse astrocytes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>APRIL was expressed in lesions from EAE. In its absence, the disease was worst. Lesions from MS patients also showed APRIL expression upon infiltration of macrophages. Notably, all the APRIL secreted by these macrophages specifically targeted astrocytes. The upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, sometimes bearing chondroitin sulfate of type E sugar moieties, binding APRIL, in reactive astrocytes explained the latter selectivity. Astrocytes responded to APRIL by producing a sufficient amount of IL‐10 to dampen antigen‐specific T‐cell proliferation and pathogenic cytokine secretion. Finally, an intraspinal delivery of recombinant APRIL before disease onset, shortly reduced EAE symptoms. Repeated intravenous injections of recombinant APRIL before and even at disease onset also had an effect.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data show that APRIL mediates an anti‐inflammatory response from astrocytes in MS lesions. This protective activity is not shared with BAFF. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:406–420.</b></p>

<p>High levels of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed in patients with different neurological disorders, but cells producing these autoantibodies are largely unexplored. We detect circulating GAD‐reactive B cells in peripheral blood that readily differentiate into antibody‐producing cells. These cells are highly elevated in most patients with GAD‐antibody–associated disorders (n = 15) compared to controls (n = 19). They mainly produce GAD65 antibodies of the IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses and are as abundant as B cells reactive for common recall antigens. Bone marrow cells represent an additional source of GAD antibodies. The identification of GAD‐antibody–producing cells has implications for the selection of cell‐specific biologics. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:448–454.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioral symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilizes postmortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorized into 2 groups: “motor” or “mood.”</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, postmortem delay, CAG repeat in the <i>IT15</i> gene, or age at death.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provides novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia, and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:396–405.</b></p>

<p>Inspired by the adaptation phenomenon of biological neuronal firing rate, we
propose regularity normalization: a reparameterization of the activation in the
neural network that take into account the statistical regularity in the
implicit space. By considering the neural network optimization process as a
model selection problem, the implicit space is constrained by the normalizing
factor, the minimum description length of the optimal universal code. We
introduce an incremental version of computing this universal code as normalized
maximum likelihood and demonstrated its flexibility to include data prior such
as top-down attention and other oracle information and its compatibility to be
incorporated into batch normalization and layer normalization. The preliminary
empirical results are inconclusive regarding its advantages in tackling the
limited and imbalanced data from a non-stationary distribution benchmarked on
computer vision task. This biologically plausible normalization, however, has
the potential to deal with other complicated real-world scenarios - further
research are proposed to discover these scenarios and explore the behaviors
among different variants.

<p>Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) is the predominant method for inferring
effective connectivity from neuroimaging data. In the 15 years since its
introduction, the neural models and statistical routines in DCM have developed
in parallel, driven by the needs of researchers in cognitive and clinical
neuroscience. In this tutorial, we step through an exemplar fMRI analysis in
detail, reviewing the current implementation of DCM and demonstrating recent
developments in group-level connectivity analysis. In the first part of the
tutorial (current paper), we focus on issues specific to DCM for fMRI,
unpacking the relevant theory and highlighting practical considerations. In
particular, we clarify the assumptions (i.e., priors) used in DCM for fMRI and
how to interpret the model parameters. This tutorial is accompanied by all the
necessary data and instructions to reproduce the analyses using the SPM
software. In the second part (in a companion paper), we move from subject-level
to group-level modelling using the Parametric Empirical Bayes framework, and
illustrate how to test for commonalities and differences in effective
connectivity across subjects, based on imaging data from any modality.

<p>Avalanches whose sizes and durations are distributed as power laws appear in
many contexts. Here, we show that there is a hidden peril in thresholding
continuous times series --either from empirical or synthetic data-- for the
detection of avalanches. In particular, we consider two possible alternative
definitions of avalanche size used e.g. in the empirical determination of
avalanche exponents in the analysis of neural-activity data. By performing
analytical and computational studies of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (taken as
a guiding example) we show that if (i) relatively large threshold values are
employed to determine the beginning and ending of avalanches and if (ii) --as
sometimes done in the literature-- avalanche sizes are defined as the total
area (above zero) of the avalanche, then true asymptotic scaling behavior is
not seen, instead the observations are dominated by transient effects. These
can induce misinterpretations of the resulting scaling regimes as well as to a
wrong assignation of universality classes.

<p>Maintaining upright posture is a complex task governed by the integration of
afferent sensorimotor and visual information with compensatory neuromuscular
reactions. The objective of this work was to characterize the visual dependency
and functional dynamics of cortical activation during postural control.
Proprioceptic vibratory stimulation of calf muscles at 85 Hz was performed to
evoke postural perturbation in open-eye (OE) and closed-eye (CE) experimental
trials, with pseudorandom binary stimulation phases divided into four segments
of 16 stimuli. 64-channel EEG was recorded; with perturbation epochs defined
using bipolar electrodes placed proximal to each vibrator. Finally, functional
connectivity assessment was explored via network segregation and integration
analyses. Spectra variation showed waveform and vision-dependent activation
within cortical regions specific to both postural adaptation and habituation.
Generalized spectral variation yielded significant shifts from low to high
frequencies in CE adaptation trials, with overall activity suppressed in
habituation; OE trials showed the opposite phenomenon, with both adaptation and
habituation yielding increases in spectral power. Finally, our analysis of
functional dynamics reveals novel cortical networks implicated in postural
control using EEG source-space brain networks. In particular, our reported
significant increase in local theta connectivity may signify the planning of
corrective steps and/or the analysis of falling consequences, while alpha band
network integration results reflect an inhibition of error detection within the
cingulate cortex, likely due to habituation. Our findings suggest that specific
cortical waveforms are dependent upon the availability of visual feedback, and
we present the first evidence that local and global brain networks undergo
characteristic modification during postural control.

<p>Echolocating bats locate the targets by echolocation. Many theoretical
frameworks have been suggested the abilities of bats are related to the shapes
of bats ears, but few artificial bat-like ears have been made to mimic the
abilities, the difficulty of which lies in the determination of the elevation
angle of the target. In this study, we present a device with artificial bat
pinnae modeling by the ears of brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) which
can accurately estimate the elevation angle of the aerial target by virtue of
active sonar. An artificial neural-network with the labeled data obtained from
echoes as the trained and tested data is used and optimized by a tenfold
cross-validation technique. A decision method we named sliding window averaging
algorithm is designed for getting the estimation results of elevation. At last,
a right-angle pinnae construction is designed for determining direction of the
target. The results show a higher accuracy for the direction determination of
the single target. The results also demonstrate that for the Plecotus auritus
bat, not only the binaural shapes, but the binaural relative orientations also
play important roles in the target localization.

<p>Robust motifs are graphs associated to threshold-linear networks (TLNs) for
which the structure of fixed points is independent of the choice of
connectivity matrix $W$. In this work we describe infinite families of robust
motifs, and use them to completely characterize all robust motifs for networks
of size $n \leq 5$. These graph structures tightly constrain the dynamics of
the associated TLNs, making them ideal candidates for constructing network
architectures whose dynamics are robust despite allowing great flexibility in
the choice of $W$.

<p>Movement experience and the coordination of perception and action are the
basis of developing body awareness, emotion, motivation and cognition and the
sense of self. The four limbs play a key role in the developing sense of body
ownership, agency and peripersonal space. Neonatal limb movements were
investigated respective processes of self-organization and developing body
awareness. Application of symbolic dynamics to kinematic data of radial
distance trajectories of the hands and feet determined 16 coordination patterns
according to the distance of the effectors to the body center. From time series
analysis of occurrence and recurrence of these configurations of 25 movement
episodes of 14 infants both characteristics of self-organization as well as
features assumed to provide neonates with experiences involved in the
development of body awareness were found. With increasing age a shift from
configurations with proximal to distal positions suggests a role of the
proximal-distal dimension in movement development. We conclude that
self-organization in spontaneous movements provides neonates with perceptual
body- and self-specifying stimuli involved in developing body awareness and
postulate the involvement of emotional and cognitive processes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42806">Membrane bridging by Munc13-1 is crucial for neurotransmitter release</a></h4>

Munc13-1 plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release. We recently proposed that the C-terminal region encompassing the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1 (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) bridges the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes through interactions involving the C<sub>2</sub>C domain and the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region. However, the physiological relevance of this model has not been demonstrated. Here we show that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bridges membranes through opposite ends of its elongated structure. Mutations in putative membrane-binding sites of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain disrupt the ability of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C to bridge liposomes and to mediate liposome fusion in vitro. These mutations lead to corresponding disruptive effects on synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release in mouse neurons. Remarkably, these effects include an almost complete abrogation of release by a single residue substitution in this 200 kDa protein. These results show that bridging the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes is a central function of Munc13-1.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41535">Coding of whisker motion across the mouse face</a></h4>

Haptic perception synthesizes touch with proprioception, the sense of body position. Humans and mice alike experience rich active touch of the face. Because most facial muscles lack proprioceptor endings, the sensory basis of facial proprioception remains unsolved. Facial proprioception may instead rely on mechanoreceptors that encode both touch and self-motion. In rodents, whisker mechanoreceptors provide a signal that informs the brain about whisker position. Whisking involves coordinated orofacial movements, so mechanoreceptors innervating facial regions other than whiskers could also provide information about whisking. To define all sources of sensory information about whisking available to the brain, we recorded spikes from mechanoreceptors innervating diverse parts of the face. Whisker motion was encoded best by whisker mechanoreceptors, but also by those innervating whisker pad hairy skin and supraorbital vibrissae. Redundant self-motion responses may provide the brain with a stable proprioceptive signal despite mechanical perturbations during active touch.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39404">Control of entropy in neural models of environmental state</a></h4>

Humans and animals construct internal models of their environment in order to select appropriate courses of action. The representation of uncertainty about the current state of the environment is a key feature of these models that controls the rate of learning as well as directly affecting choice behaviour. To maintain flexibility, given that uncertainty naturally decreases over time, most theoretical inference models include a dedicated mechanism to drive up model uncertainty. Here we probe the long-standing hypothesis that noradrenaline is involved in determining the uncertainty, or entropy, and thus flexibility, of neural models. Pupil diameter, which indexes neuromodulatory state including noradrenaline release, predicted increases (but not decreases) in entropy in a neural state model encoded in human medial orbitofrontal cortex, as measured using multivariate functional MRI. Activity in anterior cingulate cortex predicted pupil diameter. These results provide evidence for top-down, neuromodulatory control of entropy in neural state models.

<p>Stroke robustly stimulates adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. It is currently unknown whether this process induces beneficial or maladaptive effects, but morphological and behavioral studies have reported aberrant neurogenesis and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory following stroke. However, the intrinsic function and network incorporation of adult-born granule cells (ABGCs) after ischemia is unclear. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we evaluated doublecortin-positive (DCX<sup>+</sup>) ABGCs as well as DCX<sup>–</sup> dentate gyrus granule cells 2 weeks after a stroke or sham operation in DCX<i>/</i>DsRed transgenic mice of either sex. The developmental status, intrinsic excitability, and synaptic excitability of ABGCs were accelerated following stroke, while dendritic morphology was not aberrant. Regression analysis revealed uncoupled development of intrinsic and network excitability, resulting in young, intrinsically hyperexcitable ABGCs receiving disproportionately large glutamatergic inputs. This aberrant functional maturation in the subgroup of ABGCs in the hippocampus may contribute to defective hippocampal function and increased seizure susceptibility following stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stroke increases hippocampal neurogenesis but the functional consequences of the postlesional response is mostly unclear. Our findings provide novel evidence of aberrant functional maturation of newly generated neurons following stroke. We demonstrate that stroke not only causes an accelerated maturation of the intrinsic and synaptic parameters of doublecortin-positive, new granule cells in the hippocampus, but that this accelerated development does not follow physiological dynamics due to uncoupled intrinsic and synaptic maturation. Hyperexcitable immature neurons may contribute to disrupted network integration following stroke.</p>

<p>The acquisition of drug, including alcohol, use is associated with activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, over the course of drug exposure the control over drug seeking progressively devolves to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms. The causal importance of this functional recruitment of aDLS in the switch from controlled to compulsive drug use in vulnerable individuals remains to be established. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the susceptibility to aDLS dopamine-dependent control over alcohol seeking predicts and underlies the development of compulsive alcohol seeking. Male alcohol-preferring rats, the alcohol-preferring phenotype of which was confirmed in an intermittent two-bottle choice procedure, were implanted bilaterally with cannulae above the aDLS and trained instrumentally on a seeking–taking chained schedule of alcohol reinforcement until some individuals developed compulsive seeking behavior. The susceptibility to aDLS dopamine control over behavior was investigated before and after the development of compulsivity by measuring the extent to which bilateral aDLS infusions of the dopamine receptor antagonist α-flupenthixol (0, 5, 10, and 15 μg/side) decreased alcohol seeking at different stages of training, as follows: (1) after acquisition of instrumental taking responses for alcohol; (2) after alcohol-seeking behavior was well established; and (3) after the development of punishment-resistant alcohol seeking. Only alcohol-seeking, not alcohol-taking, responses became dependent on aDLS dopamine. Further, marked individual differences in the susceptibility of alcohol seeking to aDLS dopamine receptor blockade actually predicted the vulnerability to develop compulsive alcohol seeking, but only in subjects dependent on aDLS dopamine-dependent control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over the course of addictive drug exposure, there is a transition in the control over drug seeking from ventral to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms, but it is unclear whether this is causally involved in the development of compulsive drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the reliance of alcohol seeking on aDLS dopamine predicts and underlies the emergence of compulsive alcohol seeking. We identified individual differences in the reliance of well established alcohol seeking, but not taking behavior, on aDLS mechanisms and also showed that this predicted the subsequent development of compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior. Thus, those individuals in whom alcohol seeking depended on aDLS mechanisms were vulnerable subsequently to display compulsivity.</p>

<p>Many important situations require human observers to simultaneously search for more than one object. Despite a long history of research into visual search, the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with multiple-target search are poorly understood. Here we test the novel theory that the efficiency of looking for multiple targets critically depends on the mode of cognitive control the environment affords to the observer. We used an innovative combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking while participants searched for two targets, within two different contexts: either both targets were present in the search display and observers were free to prioritize either one of them, thus enabling proactive control over selection; or only one of the two targets would be present in each search display, which requires reactive control to reconfigure selection when the wrong target has been prioritized. During proactive control, both univariate and multivariate signals of beta-band (15–35 Hz) power suppression before display onset predicted switches between target selections. This signal originated over midfrontal and sensorimotor regions and has previously been associated with endogenous state changes. In contrast, imposed target selections requiring reactive control elicited prefrontal power enhancements in the delta/theta band (2–8 Hz), but only after display onset. This signal predicted individual differences in associated oculomotor switch costs, reflecting reactive reconfiguration of target selection. The results provide compelling evidence that multiple target representations are differentially prioritized during visual search, and for the first time reveal distinct neural mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control over multiple-target search.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Searching for more than one object in complex visual scenes can be detrimental for search performance. Although perhaps annoying in daily life, this can have severe consequences in professional settings such as medical and security screening. Previous research has not yet resolved whether multiple-target search involves changing priorities in what people attend to, and how such changes are controlled. We approached these questions by concurrently measuring cortical activity and eye movements using EEG and eye tracking while observers searched for multiple possible targets. Our findings provide the first unequivocal support for the existence of two modes of control during multiple-target search, which are expressed in qualitatively distinct time-frequency signatures of the EEG both before and after visual selection.</p>

<p>Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the inability to acquire typical reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral cortex alterations; however, recent evidence also points toward sensory thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is highly correlated with reading proficiency. Here, we tested two hypotheses that were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left MGB and the auditory-motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT). Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT–MGB connectivity correlates with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging-based probabilistic tracking, we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT–MGB connectivity was not associated with faster RANln scores in dyslexics, but was in neurotypical readers. Our findings provide the first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia and it may also affect reading-related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developmental dyslexia is one of the most widespread learning disabilities. Although previous neuroimaging research mainly focused on pathomechanisms of dyslexia at the cerebral cortex level, several lines of evidence suggest an atypical functioning of subcortical sensory structures. By means of diffusion tensor imaging, we here show that dyslexic male adults have reduced white matter connectivity in a cortico-thalamic auditory pathway between the left auditory motion-sensitive planum temporale and the left medial geniculate body. Connectivity strength of this pathway was associated with measures of reading fluency in neurotypical readers. This is novel evidence on the neurocognitive correlates of reading proficiency, highlighting the importance of cortico-subcortical interactions between regions involved in the processing of spectrotemporally complex sound.</p>

<p>The basal ganglia, especially the circuits originating from the putamen, are essential for controlling normal body movements. Notably, the putamen receives inputs not only from motor cortical areas but also from multiple sensory cortices. However, how these sensory signals are processed in the putamen remains unclear. We recorded the activity of tentative medium spiny neurons in the caudal part of the putamen when the monkey viewed many fractal objects. We found many neurons that responded to these objects, mostly in the ventral region. We called this region "putamen tail" (PUTt), as it is dorsally adjacent to "caudate tail" (CDt). Although PUTt and CDt are mostly separated by a thin layer of white matter, their neurons shared several features. Almost all of them had receptive fields in the contralateral hemifield. Moreover, their responses were object selective (i.e., variable across objects). The object selectivity was higher in the ventral region (i.e., CDt &gt; PUTt). Some neurons above PUTt, which we called the caudal–dorsal putamen (cdPUT), also responded to objects, but less selectively than PUTt. Next, we examined whether these visual neurons changed their responses based on the reward outcome. We found that many neurons encoded the values of many objects based on long-term memory, but not based on short-term memory. Such stable value responses were stronger in PUTt and CDt than in cdPUT. These results suggest that PUTt, together with CDt, controls saccade/attention among objects with different historical values, and may control other motor actions as well.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although the putamen receives inputs not only from motor cortical areas but also from sensory cortical areas, how these sensory signals are processed remains unclear. Here we found that neurons in the caudal–ventral part of the putamen (putamen tail) process visual information including spatial and object features. These neurons discriminate many objects, first by their visual features and later by their reward values as well. Importantly, the value discrimination was based on long-term memory, but not on short-term memory. These results suggest that the putamen tail controls saccade/attention among objects with different historical values and might control other motor actions as well.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1699?rss=1">Auditory Figure-Ground Segregation Is Impaired by High Visual Load</a></h4>

<p>Figure-ground segregation is fundamental to listening in complex acoustic environments. An ongoing debate pertains to whether segregation requires attention or is "automatic" and preattentive. In this magnetoencephalography study, we tested a prediction derived from load theory of attention (e.g., Lavie, 1995) that segregation requires attention but can benefit from the automatic allocation of any "leftover" capacity under low load. Complex auditory scenes were modeled with stochastic figure-ground stimuli (Teki et al., 2013), which occasionally contained repeated frequency component "figures." Naive human participants (both sexes) passively listened to these signals while performing a visual attention task of either low or high load. While clear figure-related neural responses were observed under conditions of low load, high visual load substantially reduced the neural response to the figure in auditory cortex (planum temporale, Heschl's gyrus). We conclude that fundamental figure-ground segregation in hearing is not automatic but draws on resources that are shared across vision and audition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work resolves a long-standing question of whether figure-ground segregation, a fundamental process of auditory scene analysis, requires attention or is underpinned by automatic, encapsulated computations. Task-irrelevant sounds were presented during performance of a visual search task. We revealed a clear magnetoencephalography neural signature of figure-ground segregation in conditions of low visual load, which was substantially reduced in conditions of high visual load. This demonstrates that, although attention does not need to be actively allocated to sound for auditory segregation to occur, segregation depends on shared computational resources across vision and hearing. The findings further highlight that visual load can impair the computational capacity of the auditory system, even when it does not simply dampen auditory responses as a whole.</p>

<p>Environmental change can lead decision makers to shift rapidly among different behavioral regimes. These behavioral shifts can be accompanied by rapid changes in the firing pattern of neural networks. However, it is unknown what the populations of neurons that participate in such "network reset" phenomena are representing. Here, we investigated the following: (1) whether and where rapid changes in multivariate activity patterns are observable with fMRI during periods of rapid behavioral change and (2) what types of representations give rise to these phenomena. We did so by examining fluctuations in multivoxel patterns of BOLD activity from male and female human subjects making sequential inferences about the state of a partially observable and discontinuously changing variable. We found that, within the context of this sequential inference task, the multivariate patterns of activity in a number of cortical regions contain representations that change more rapidly during periods of uncertainty following a change in behavioral context. In motor cortex, this phenomenon was indicative of discontinuous change in behavioral outputs, whereas in visual regions, the same basic phenomenon was evoked by tracking of salient environmental changes. In most other cortical regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, the phenomenon was most consistent with directly encoding the degree of uncertainty. However, in a few other regions, including orbitofrontal cortex, the phenomenon was best explained by representations of a shifting context that evolve more rapidly during periods of rapid learning. These representations may provide a dynamic substrate for learning that facilitates rapid disengagement from learned responses during periods of change.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain activity patterns tend to change more rapidly during periods of uncertainty and behavioral adjustment, yet the computational role of such rapid transitions is poorly understood. Here, we identify brain regions with fMRI BOLD activity patterns that change more rapidly during periods of behavioral adjustment and use computational modeling to attribute the phenomenon to specific causes. We demonstrate that the phenomenon emerges in different brain regions for different computational reasons, the most common being the representation of uncertainty itself, but that, in a selective subset of regions including orbitofrontal cortex, the phenomenon was best explained as a shifting latent state signal that may serve to control the degree to which recent temporal context affects ongoing expectations.</p>

<p>Neurons in primary visual cortex are strongly modulated both by stimulus contrast and by fluctuations of internal inputs. An important question is whether the population code is preserved under these conditions. Changes in stimulus contrast are thought to leave the population code invariant, whereas the effect of internal gain modulations remains unknown. To address these questions we studied how the direction-of-motion of oriented gratings is encoded in layer 2/3 primary visual cortex of mouse (with C57BL/6 background, of either sex). We found that, because contrast gain responses across cells are heterogeneous, a change in contrast alters the information distribution profile across cells leading to a violation of contrast invariance. Remarkably, internal input fluctuations that cause commensurate firing rate modulations at the single-cell level result in more homogeneous gain responses, respecting population code invariance. These observations argue that the brain strives to maintain the stability of the neural code in the face of fluctuating internal inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal responses are modulated both by stimulus contrast and by the spontaneous fluctuation of internal inputs. It is not well understood how these different types of input impact the population code. Specifically, it is important to understand whether the neural code stays invariant in the face of significant internal input modulations. Here, we show that changes in stimulus contrast lead to different optimal population codes, whereas spontaneous internal input fluctuations leave the population code invariant. This is because spontaneous internal input fluctuations modulate the gain of neuronal responses more homogeneously across cells compared to changes in stimulus contrast.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1649?rss=1">Nonlinear Processing of Shape Information in Rat Lateral Extrastriate Cortex</a></h4>

<p>In rodents, the progression of extrastriate areas located laterally to primary visual cortex (V1) has been assigned to a putative object-processing pathway (homologous to the primate ventral stream), based on anatomical considerations. Recently, we found functional support for such attribution (Tafazoli et al., 2017), by showing that this cortical progression is specialized for coding object identity despite view changes, the hallmark property of a ventral-like pathway. Here, we sought to clarify what computations are at the base of such specialization. To this aim, we performed multielectrode recordings from V1 and laterolateral area LL (at the apex of the putative ventral-like hierarchy) of male adult rats, during the presentation of drifting gratings and noise movies. We found that the extent to which neuronal responses were entrained to the phase of the gratings sharply dropped from V1 to LL, along with the quality of the receptive fields inferred through reverse correlation. Concomitantly, the tendency of neurons to respond to different oriented gratings increased, whereas the sharpness of orientation tuning declined. Critically, these trends are consistent with the nonlinear summation of visual inputs that is expected to take place along the ventral stream, according to the predictions of hierarchical models of ventral computations and a meta-analysis of the monkey literature. This suggests an intriguing homology between the mechanisms responsible for building up shape selectivity and transformation tolerance in the visual cortex of primates and rodents, reasserting the potential of the latter as models to investigate ventral stream functions at the circuitry level.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the growing popularity of rodents as models of visual functions, it remains unclear whether their visual cortex contains specialized modules for processing shape information. To addresses this question, we compared how neuronal tuning evolves from rat primary visual cortex (V1) to a downstream visual cortical region (area LL) that previous work has implicated in shape processing. In our experiments, LL neurons displayed a stronger tendency to respond to drifting gratings with different orientations while maintaining a sustained response across the whole duration of the drift cycle. These trends match the increased complexity of pattern selectivity and the augmented tolerance to stimulus translation found in monkey visual temporal cortex, thus revealing a homology between shape processing in rodents and primates.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1631?rss=1">Mouse Parabrachial Neurons Signal a Relationship between Bitter Taste and Nociceptive Stimuli</a></h4>

<p>Taste and somatosensation both mediate protective behaviors. Bitter taste guides avoidance of ingestion of toxins while pain sensations, such as noxious heat, signal adverse conditions to ward off harm. Although brain pathways for taste and somatosensation are typically studied independently, prior data suggest that they intersect, potentially reflecting their common protective role. To investigate this, we applied electrophysiologic and optogenetic techniques in anesthetized mice of both sexes to evaluate relationships between oral somatosensory and taste activity in the parabrachial nucleus (PbN), implicated for roles in gustation and pain. Spikes were recorded from taste-active PbN neurons tested with oral delivery of thermal and chemesthetic stimuli, including agonists of nocisensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels on somatosensory fibers. Gustatory neurons were also tested to follow electrical pulse stimulation of an oral somatosensory region of the spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), which projects to the PbN. Neurons composed classic taste groups, including sodium, electrolyte, appetitive, or bitter cells. Across groups, most neurons spiked to Vc pulse stimulation, implying that trigeminal projections reach PbN gustatory neurons. Among such cells, a subpopulation responsive to the bitter taste stimuli quinine and cycloheximide, and aversive concentrations of sodium, cofired to agonists of nocisensitive TRP channels, including capsaicin, mustard oil, and noxious heat. Such neurons populated the lateral PbN. Further, nociceptive activity in PbN bitter taste neurons was suppressed during optogenetic-assisted inhibition of the Vc, implying convergent trigeminal input contributed to such activity. Our results reveal a novel role for PbN gustatory cells in cross-system signaling related to protection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior data suggest that gustatory and trigeminal neural pathways intersect and overlap in the parabrachial area. However, no study has directly examined such overlap and why it may exist. Here we found that parabrachial gustatory neurons can receive afferent projections from trigeminal nuclei and fire to oral nociceptive stimuli that excite somatosensory receptors and fibers. Activation to aversive nociceptive stimuli in gustatory cells was associated with responding to behaviorally avoided bitter tastants. We were further able to show that silencing trigeminal projections inhibited nociceptive activity in parabrachial bitter taste neurons. Our results imply that in the parabrachial area, there is predictable overlap between taste and somatosensory processing related to protective coding and that classically defined taste neurons contribute to this process.</p>

<p>To provide organisms with a fitness advantage, circadian clocks have to react appropriately to changes in their environment. High-intensity (HI) light plays an essential role in the adaptation to hot summer days, which especially endanger insects of desiccation or prey visibility. Here, we show that solely increasing light intensity leads to an increased midday siesta in <i>Drosophila</i> behavior. Interestingly, this change is independent of the fly's circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome and is solely caused by a small visual organ, the Hofbauer–Buchner eyelets. Using receptor knock-downs, immunostaining, and recently developed calcium tools, we show that the eyelets activate key core clock neurons, namely the s-LN<sub>v</sub>s, at HI. This activation delays the decrease of PERIOD (PER) in the middle of the day and propagates to downstream target clock neurons that prolong the siesta. We show a new pathway for integrating light-intensity information into the clock network, suggesting new network properties and surprising parallels between <i>Drosophila</i> and the mammalian system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability of animals to adapt to their ever-changing environment plays an important role in their fitness. A key player in this adaptation is the circadian clock. For animals to predict the changes of day and night, they must constantly monitor, detect and incorporate changes in the environment. The appropriate incorporation and reaction to high-intensity (HI) light is of special importance for insects because they might suffer from desiccation during hot summer days. We show here that different photoreceptors have specialized functions to integrate low-intensity, medium-intensity, or HI light into the circadian system in <i>Drosophila</i>. These results show surprising parallels to mammalian mechanisms, which also use different photoreceptor subtypes to respond to different light intensities.</p>

<p>Newborn dentate granule cells (DGCs) are generated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of rodents through a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is subjected to tight intrinsic and extrinsic regulation. The use of retroviruses encoding fluorescent proteins has allowed the characterization of the maturation dynamics of newborn DGCs, including their morphological development and the establishment and maturation of their afferent and efferent synaptic connections. However, the study of a crucial cellular compartment of these cells, namely, the axon initial segment (AIS), has remained unexplored to date. The AIS is not only the site of action potential initiation, but it also has a unique molecular identity that makes it one of the master regulators of neural plasticity and excitability. Here we examined the dynamics of AIS formation in newborn DGCs of young female adult C57BL/6J mice <i>in vivo</i>. Our data reveal notable changes in AIS length and thickness throughout cell maturation under physiological conditions and show that the most remarkable structural changes coincide with periods of intense morphological and functional remodeling. Moreover, we demonstrate that AIS development can be modulated extrinsically by both neuroprotective (environmental enrichment) and detrimental (lipopolysaccharide from <i>Escherichia coli</i>) stimuli.</p>

<p>Neurons have high plasticity in developmental and juvenile stages that decreases in adulthood. Mitochondrial dynamics are highly important in neurons to maintain normal function. To compare dependency on mitochondrial dynamics in juvenile and adult stages, we generated a mouse model capable of selective timing of the expression of a mutant of the mitochondrial fusion factor <i>Mitofusin 2</i> (<i>MFN2</i>). Mutant expression in the juvenile stage had lethal effects. Contrastingly, abnormalities did not manifest until 150 d after mutant expression during adulthood. After this silent 150 d period, progressive neurodegeneration, abnormal behaviors, and learning and memory deficits similar to those seen in human neurodegenerative diseases were observed. This indicates that abnormal neuronal mitochondrial dynamics seriously affect survival during early life stages and can also significantly damage brain function after maturation. Our findings highlight the need to consider the timing of disease onset in mimicking human neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To compare the dependency on mitochondrial dynamics in neurons in juvenile and adult stages, we generated a mouse model expressing a mutant of the mitochondrial fusion factor <i>MFN2</i> in an arbitrary timing. Juvenile expression of the mutant showed acute and severe phenotypes and had lethal effects; however, post-adult expression induced delayed but progressive phenotypes resembling those found in human neurodegenerative diseases. Our results indicate that abnormal neuronal mitochondrial dynamics seriously affect survival during early life stages and can also significantly damage brain function after maturation. This strongly suggests that the timing of expression should be considered when establishing an animal model that closely resembles human neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1566?rss=1">Gq-Coupled Muscarinic Receptor Enhancement of KCNQ2/3 Channels and Activation of TRPC Channels in Multimodal Control of Excitability in Dentate Gyrus Granule Cells</a></h4>

<p>KCNQ (Kv7, "M-type") K<sup>+</sup> channels and TRPC (transient receptor potential, "canonical") cation channels are coupled to neuronal discharge properties and are regulated via G<sub>q/11</sub>-protein-mediated signals. Stimulation of G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled receptors both consumes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) via phosphalipase Cβ hydrolysis and stimulates PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis via rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> and other signals. Using brain-slice electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from male and female mice, we characterized threshold K<sup>+</sup> currents in dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) and CA1 pyramidal cells, the effects of G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> acetylcholine (M<sub>1</sub>R) stimulation on M current and on neuronal discharge properties, and elucidated the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved. We observed disparate signaling cascades between DGGCs and CA1 neurons. DGGCs displayed M<sub>1</sub>R enhancement of M-current, rather than suppression, due to stimulation of PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis, which was paralleled by increased PIP<sub>2</sub>-gated G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> currents as well. Deficiency of KCNQ2-containing M-channels ablated the M<sub>1</sub>R-induced enhancement of M-current in DGGCs. Simultaneously, M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation in DGGCs induced robust increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, mostly due to TRPC currents, consistent with, and contributing to, neuronal depolarization and hyperexcitability. CA1 neurons did not display such multimodal signaling, but rather M current was suppressed by M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation in these cells, similar to the previously described actions of M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation on M-current in peripheral ganglia that mostly involves PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion. Therefore, these results point to a pleiotropic network of cholinergic signals that direct cell-type-specific, precise control of hippocampal function with strong implications for hyperexcitability and epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At the neuronal membrane, protein signaling cascades consisting of ion channels and metabotropic receptors govern the electrical properties and neurotransmission of neuronal networks. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are G-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors that control the excitability of neurons through regulating ion channels, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and other second-messenger cascades. We have illuminated previously unknown actions of muscarinic stimulation on the excitability of hippocampal principal neurons that include M channels, TRPC (transient receptor potential, "canonical") cation channels, and powerful regulation of lipid metabolism. Our results show that these signaling pathways, and mechanisms of excitability, are starkly distinct between peripheral ganglia and brain, and even between different principal neurons in the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Excitatory synapses can be potentiated by chemical neuromodulators, including 17β-estradiol (E2), or patterns of synaptic activation, as in long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we investigated kinases and calcium sources required for acute E2-induced synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus of each sex and tested whether sex differences in kinase signaling extend to LTP. We recorded EPSCs from CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices from adult rats and used specific inhibitors of kinases and calcium sources. This revealed that, although E2 potentiates synapses to the same degree in each sex, cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) is required to initiate potentiation only in females. In contrast, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Src tyrosine kinase, and rho-associated kinase are required for initiation in both sexes; similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-activated kinase II is required for expression/maintenance of E2-induced potentiation in both sexes. Calcium source experiments showed that L-type calcium channels and calcium release from internal stores are both required for E2-induced potentiation in females, whereas in males, either L-type calcium channel activation or calcium release from stores is sufficient to permit potentiation. To investigate the generalizability of a sex difference in the requirement for PKA in synaptic potentiation, we tested how PKA inhibition affects LTP. This showed that, although the magnitude of both high-frequency stimulation-induced and pairing-induced LTP is the same between sexes, PKA is required for LTP in females but not males. These results demonstrate latent sex differences in mechanisms of synaptic potentiation in which distinct molecular signaling converges to common functional endpoints in males and females.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemical- and activity-dependent neuromodulation alters synaptic strength in both male and female brains, yet few studies have compared mechanisms of neuromodulation between the sexes. Here, we studied molecular signaling that underlies estrogen-induced and activity-dependent potentiation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. We found that, despite similar magnitude increases in synaptic strength in males and females, the roles of cAMP-regulated protein kinase, internal calcium stores, and L-type calcium channels differ between the sexes. Therefore, latent sex differences in which the same outcome is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms in males and females include kinase and calcium signaling involved in synaptic potentiation, demonstrating that sex is an important factor in identification of molecular targets for therapeutic development based on mechanisms of neuromodulation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10073">Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder by Causal Influence Strength Learned from Resting-State fMRI Data. (arXiv:1902.10073v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the major developmental disorders
affecting children. Recently, it has been hypothesized that ASD is associated
with atypical brain connectivities. A substantial body of researches use
Pearson's correlation coefficients, mutual information, or partial correlation
to investigate the differences in brain connectivities between ASD and typical
controls from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However,
correlation or partial correlation does not directly reveal causal influences -
the information flow - between brain regions. Comparing to correlation,
causality pinpoints the key connectivity characteristics and removes redundant
features for diagnosis.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a two-step method for large-scale and cyclic causal
discovery from fMRI. It can identify brain causal structures without doing
interventional experiments. The learned causal structure, as well as the causal
influence strength, provides us the path and effectiveness of information flow.
With the recovered causal influence strength as candidate features, we then
perform ASD diagnosis by further doing feature selection and classification. We
apply our methods to three datasets from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
(ABIDE).
</p>
<p>From experimental results, it shows that with causal connectivities, the
diagnostic accuracy largely improves. A closer examination shows that
information flows starting from the superior front gyrus to default mode
network and posterior areas are largely reduced. Moreover, all enhanced
information flows are from posterior to anterior or in local areas. Overall, it
shows that long-range influences have a larger proportion of reductions than
local ones, while local influences have a larger proportion of increases than
long-range ones. By examining the graph properties of brain causal structure,
the group of ASD shows reduced small-worldness.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10070">Warped phase coherence: an empirical synchronization measure combining phase and amplitude information. (arXiv:1902.10070v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The entrainment between weakly-coupled nonlinear oscillators, as well as
between complex signals such as those representing physiological activity, is
frequently assessed in terms of whether a stable relationship is detectable
between the instantaneous phases extracted from the measured or simulated
time-series via the analytic signal. Here, we demonstrate that adding a
possibly complex constant value to this normally null-mean signal has a
non-trivial warping effect. Among other consequences, this introduces a level
of sensitivity to the amplitude fluctuations and average relative phase. By
means of simulations of Roessler systems and experiments on single-transistor
oscillator networks, it is shown that the resulting coherence measure may have
an empirical value in improving the inference of the structural couplings from
the dynamics. When tentatively applied to the electroencephalogram recorded
while performing imaginary and real movements, this straightforward
modification of the phase locking value substantially improved the
classification accuracy. Hence, its possible practical relevance in
brain-computer and brain-machine interfaces deserves consideration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43738">Amplification of a broad transcriptional program by a common factor triggers the meiotic cell cycle in mice</a></h4>

The germ line provides the cellular link between generations of multicellular organisms, its cells entering the meiotic cell cycle only once each generation. However, the mechanisms governing this initiation of meiosis remain poorly understood. Here, we examined cells undergoing meiotic initiation in mice, and we found that initiation involves the dramatic upregulation of a transcriptional network of thousands of genes whose expression is not limited to meiosis. This broad gene expression program is directly upregulated by STRA8, encoded by a germ cell-specific gene required for meiotic initiation. STRA8 binds its own promoter and those of thousands of other genes, including meiotic prophase genes, factors mediating DNA replication and the G1-S cell-cycle transition, and genes that promote the lengthy prophase unique to meiosis I. We conclude that, in mice, the robust amplification of this extraordinarily broad transcription program by a common factor triggers initiation of meiosis.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Structural and functional differences in brain hemispheric asymmetry have been well documented between female and male adults. However, potential differences in the connectivity patterns of the rich-club organization of hemispheric structural networks in females and males remain to be determined. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct hemispheric structural networks in healthy subjects, and graph theoretical analysis approaches were applied to quantify hemisphere and gender differences in rich-club organization. The results showed that rich-club organization was consistently observed in both hemispheres of female and male adults. Moreover, a reduced level of connectivity was found in the left hemisphere. Notably, rightward asymmetries were mainly observed in feeder and local connections among one hub region and peripheral regions, many of which are implicated in visual processing and spatial attention functions. Additionally, significant gender differences were revealed in the rich-club, feeder, and local connections in rich-club organization. These gender-related hub and peripheral regions are involved in emotional, sensory, and cognitive control functions. The topological changes in rich-club organization provide novel insight into the hemisphere and gender effects on white matter connections and underlie a potential network mechanism of hemisphere- and gender-based differences in visual processing, spatial attention and cognitive control.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09189">Cortical Mirror-System Activation During Real-Life Game Playing: An Intracranial Electroencephalography (EEG) Study. (arXiv:1902.09189v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Analogous to the mirror neuron system repeatedly described in monkeys as a
possible substrate for imitation learning and/or action understanding, a
neuronal execution/observation matching system (OEMS) is assumed in humans, but
little is known to what extent this system is activated in non-experimental,
real-life conditions. In the present case study, we investigated brain activity
of this system during natural, non-experimental motor behavior as it occurred
during playing of the board game "Malefiz". We compared spectral modulations of
the high-gamma band related to ipsilateral reaching movement execution and
observation of the same kind of movement using electrocorticography (ECoG) in
one participant. Spatially coincident activity during both conditions execution
and observation was recorded at electrode contacts over the premotor/primary
motor cortex. The topography and amplitude of the high-gamma modulations
related to both, movement observation and execution were clearly spatially
correlated over several fronto-parietal brain areas. Thus, our findings
indicate that a network of cortical areas contributes to the human OEMS, beyond
primary/premotor cortex including Brocas area and the temporo-parieto-occipital
junction area, in real-life conditions.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the stop-signal task, an electrophysiological signature of action-stopping is increased early right frontal beta band power for successful vs. failed stop trials. Here we tested whether the requirement to stop an unwanted thought from coming to mind also elicits this signature. We recorded scalp EEG during a Think/No-Think task and a subsequent stop signal task in 42 participants. In the Think/No-Think task, participants first learned word pairs. In a second phase, they received the left-hand word as a reminder and were cued either to retrieve the associated right-hand word (“Think”) or to stop retrieval (“No-Think”). At the end of each trial, participants reported whether they had experienced an intrusion of the associated memory. Finally, they received the left-hand reminder word and were asked to recall its associated target. Behaviorally, there was worse final recall for items in the No-Think condition, and decreased intrusions with practice for No-Think trials. For EEG, we reproduced increased early right frontal beta power for successful vs. failed action stopping. Critically, No-Think trials also elicited increased early right frontal beta power and this was stronger for trials without intrusion. These results suggest that preventing a thought from coming to mind also recruits fast prefrontal stopping.</span>

Animals engage in local search behavior after recent encounters with food-related sensory cues. López-Cruz et al. show that parallel chemosensory or mechanosensory circuits can independently trigger local search after food removal in C. elegans, each using a similar glutamate receptor module.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical activity is organized across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Most research on the dynamics of neuronal spiking is concerned with timescales of 1 ms–1 s, and little is known about spiking dynamics on timescales of tens of seconds and minutes. Here, we used frequency domain analyses to study the structure of individual neurons’ spiking activity and its coupling to local population rate and to arousal level across 0.01–100 Hz frequency range. In mouse medial prefrontal cortex, the spiking dynamics of individual neurons could be quantitatively captured by a combination of interspike interval and firing rate power spectrum distributions. The relative strength of coherence with local population often differed across timescales: a neuron strongly coupled to population rate on fast timescales could be weakly coupled on slow timescales, and vice versa. On slow but not fast timescales, a substantial proportion of neurons showed firing anticorrelated with the population. Infraslow firing rate changes were largely determined by arousal rather than by local factors, which could explain the timescale dependence of individual neurons’ population coupling strength. These observations demonstrate how neurons simultaneously partake in fast local dynamics, and slow brain-wide dynamics, extending our understanding of infraslow cortical activity beyond the mesoscale resolution of fMRI.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus is functionally heterogeneous between the dorsal and ventral subfields with left–right asymmetry. To determine the possible location of contextual memory, we performed an inhibitory avoidance task to analyze synaptic plasticity using slice patch-clamp technique. The training bilaterally increased the AMPA/NMDA ratio at dorsal CA3–CA1 synapses, whereas the training did not affect the ratio at ventral CA3–CA1 synapses regardless of the hemisphere. Moreover, sequential recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents from the same CA1 neuron clearly showed learning-induced synaptic plasticity. In dorsal CA1 neurons, the training dramatically strengthened both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses in both hemispheres, whereas the training did not promote the plasticity in either hemisphere in ventral CA1 neurons. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis further revealed that the training bilaterally increased the number of AMPA or GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor channels at dorsal CA1 synapses, but not at ventral CA1 synapses, suggesting functional heterogeneity of learning-induced receptor mobility. Finally, the performance clearly impaired by the bilateral microinjection of plasticity blockers in dorsal, but not ventral CA1 subfields, suggesting a crucial role for contextual learning. The quantification of synaptic diversity in specified CA1 subfields may help us to diagnose and evaluate cognitive disorders at the information level.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Affective disorders are associated with increased sensitivity to negative feedback that influences approach–avoidance decision making. Although neuroimaging studies of these disorders reveal dysregulation in primate cingulate areas 25 and 32 and the anterior hippocampus (aHipp), the causal involvement of these structures and their interaction in the primate brain is unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of localized pharmacological manipulations of areas 25 and 32 and/or the aHipp of the marmoset monkey on performance of an anxiolytic-sensitive instrumental decision-making task in which an approach–avoidance conflict is created by pairing a response with reward and punishment. During control infusions animals avoided punishment, but this bias was reduced by increasing glutamate release within the aHipp or area 32, and inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25. Conversely, increasing glutamate release in area 25 enhanced punishment avoidance but, in contrast to previous reports, area 32 and aHipp inactivations had no effect. Simultaneous inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25, but not area 32, abolished the reduced punishment avoidance seen after increasing aHipp glutamate. Besides providing causal evidence that these primate areas differentially regulate negative feedback sensitivity, this study links the decision-making deficits in affective disorders to aberrant aHipp–area 25 circuit activity.</span>

Recent decades have seen dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries, typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology that is used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms that are used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information.

Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.</p></div>

Painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN) may be caused by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, a sodium channel subtype predominantly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons. However, it is not clear how Nav1.8 disease mutations induce sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Here we studied two mutations in Nav1.8 associated with hypersensitive sensory neurons: G1662S reported in painful SFN; and T790A, which underlies increased pain behaviors in the <i>Possum</i> transgenic mouse strain. We show that, in male DRG neurons, these mutations, which impair inactivation, significantly increase TTX-resistant resurgent sodium currents mediated by Nav1.8. The G1662S mutation doubled resurgent currents, and the T790A mutation increased them fourfold. These unusual currents are typically evoked during the repolarization phase of action potentials. We show that the T790A mutation greatly enhances DRG neuron excitability by reducing current threshold and increasing firing frequency. Interestingly, the mutation endows DRG neurons with multiple early afterdepolarizations and leads to substantial prolongation of action potential duration. In DRG neurons, siRNA knockdown of sodium channel β4 subunits fails to significantly alter T790A current density but reduces TTX-resistant resurgent currents by 56%. Furthermore, DRG neurons expressing T790A channels exhibited reduced excitability with fewer early afterdepolarizations and narrower action potentials after β4 knockdown. Together, our data demonstrate that open-channel block of TTX-resistant currents, enhanced by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, can make major contributions to the hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, likely leading to altered sensory phenotypes including neuropathic pain in SFN.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work demonstrates that two disease mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 that induce nociceptor hyperexcitability increase resurgent currents. Nav1.8 is crucial for pain sensations. Because resurgent currents are evoked during action potential repolarization, they can be crucial regulators of action potential activity. Our data indicate that increased Nav1.8 resurgent currents in DRG neurons greatly prolong action potential duration and enhance repetitive firing. We propose that Nav1.8 open-channel block is a major factor in Nav1.8-associated pain mechanisms and that targeting the molecular mechanism underlying these unique resurgent currents represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of aberrant pain sensations.</p>

<p>Overreactivity and defensive behaviors in response to tactile stimuli are common symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Similarly, somatosensory hypersensitivity has also been described in mice lacking ASD-associated genes such as <i>Fmr1</i> (fragile X mental retardation protein 1). <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice also show reduced functional connectivity between sensory cortical areas, which may represent an endogenous biomarker for their hypersensitivity. Here, we measured whole-brain functional connectivity in <i>Engrailed-2</i> knock-out (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup>) adult mice, which show a lower expression of <i>Fmr1</i> and anatomical defects common to <i>Fmr1</i> knock-outs. MRI-based resting-state functional connectivity in adult <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice revealed significantly reduced synchronization in somatosensory-auditory/associative cortices and dorsal thalamus, suggesting the presence of aberrant somatosensory processing in these mutants. Accordingly, when tested in the whisker nuisance test, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> but not WT mice of both sexes showed fear behavior in response to repeated whisker stimulation. <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice undergoing this test exhibited decreased c-Fos-positive neurons (a marker of neuronal activity) in layer IV of the primary somatosensory cortex and increased immunoreactive cells in the basolateral amygdala compared with WT littermates. Conversely, when tested in a sensory maze, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> and WT mice spent a comparable time in whisker-guided exploration, indicating that whisker-mediated behaviors are otherwise preserved in <i>En2</i> mutants. Therefore, fearful responses to somatosensory stimuli in <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice are accompanied by reduced basal connectivity of sensory regions, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala, suggesting that impaired somatosensory processing is a common feature in mice lacking ASD-related genes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Overreactivity to tactile stimuli is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Recent studies performed in mice bearing ASD-related mutations confirmed these findings. Here, we evaluated the behavioral response to whisker stimulation in mice lacking the ASD-related gene <i>Engrailed-2</i> (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice). Compared with WT controls, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice showed reduced functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex, which was paralleled by fear behavior, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala in response to repeated whisker stimulation. These results suggest that impaired somatosensory signal processing is a common feature in mice harboring ASD-related mutations.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1505?rss=1">Degeneration of ipRGCs in Mouse Models of Huntington's Disease Disrupts Non-Image-Forming Behaviors Before Motor Impairment</a></h4>

<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express the photopigment melanopsin, are photosensitive neurons in the retina and are essential for non-image-forming functions, circadian photoentrainment, and pupillary light reflexes. Five subtypes of ipRGCs (M1–M5) have been identified in mice. Although ipRGCs are spared in several forms of inherited blindness, they are affected in Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are associated with impaired circadian rhythms. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the <i>huntingtin</i> gene. In addition to motor function impairment, HD mice also show impaired circadian rhythms and loss of ipRGC. Here, we found that, in HD mouse models (R6/2 and N171-82Q male mice), the expression of melanopsin was reduced before the onset of motor deficits. The expression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, was associated with the survival of ipRGCs. The number of M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 male mice was reduced due to apoptosis, whereas non-M1 ipRGCs were relatively resilient to HD progression. Most importantly, the reduced innervations of M1 ipRGCs, which was assessed by X-gal staining in R6/2-OPN4<sup>Lacz/+</sup> male mice, contributed to the diminished light-induced c-fos and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which may explain the impaired circadian photoentrainment in HD mice. Collectively, our results show that M1 ipRGCs were susceptible to the toxicity caused by mutant Huntingtin. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and disrupted circadian regulation during HD progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian disruption is a common nonmotor symptom of Huntington's disease (HD). In addition to the molecular defects in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the cause of circadian disruption in HD remains to be further explored. We hypothesized that ipRGCs, by integrating light input to the SCN, participate in the circadian regulation in HD mice. We report early reductions in melanopsin in two mouse models of HD, R6/2, and N171-82Q. Suppression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, by mutant Huntingtin might mediate the reduced number of ipRGCs. Importantly, M1 ipRGCs showed higher susceptibility than non-M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 mice. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and the circadian abnormality during HD progression.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1484?rss=1">Activation of 5-HT1A Receptors Promotes Retinal Ganglion Cell Function by Inhibiting the cAMP-PKA Pathway to Modulate Presynaptic GABA Release in Chronic Glaucoma</a></h4>

<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor agonists are neuroprotective in CNS injury models. However, the neuroprotective functional implications and synaptic mechanism of 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) agonist, in an adult male Wistar rat model of chronic glaucoma model remain unknown. We found that ocular hypertension decreased 5-HT1A receptor expression in rat retinas because the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was significantly reduced in rats with induced ocular hypertension relative to that in control retinas and 8-OH-DPAT enhanced the RGC viability. The protective effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by intravitreal administration of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 or the selective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531. Using patch-clamp techniques, spontaneous and miniature GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) of RGCs in rat retinal slices were recorded. 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic sIPSCs and mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs. Among the signaling cascades mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor, the role of cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling was investigated. The 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes at the synaptic level were enhanced by PKA inhibition by H-89 and blocked by PKA activation with bucladesine. Furthermore, the density of phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA)/PKA was significantly increased in glaucomatous retinas and 8-OH-DPAT significantly decreased p-PKA/PKA expression, which led to the inhibition of PKA phosphorylation upon relieving neurotransmitter GABA release. These results showed that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in retinas facilitated presynaptic GABA release functions by suppressing cAMP-PKA signaling and decreasing PKA phosphorylation, which could lead to the de-excitation of RGC circuits and suppress excitotoxic processes in glaucoma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found that serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the retina (5-HT1A receptors) were downregulated after intraocular pressure elevation. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrated differences in the frequencies of miniature GABAergic IPSCs (mIPSCs) in ON- and OFF-type retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGCs in normal and glaucomatous retinal slices. Therefore, phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition upon release of the neurotransmitter GABA was eliminated by 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), which led to increased levels of GABAergic mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs, thus enhancing RGC viability and function. These protective effects were blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635. This study identified a novel mechanism by which activation of 5-HT1A receptors protects damaged RGCs via the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway that modulates GABAergic presynaptic activity.</p>

Synapse dysfunction is thought to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. In this issue of Neuron, Tsai et al. (2019) uncover how membrane phospholipid biosynthesis regulates Drosophila photoreceptor (PR) degeneration and the synaptic vesicle pool through a transcriptional-translational feedback loop from the synaptic terminal to the nucleus.

In this issue of Neuron, Li et al. (2019) distinguish two separable GABAergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with differential μ-opioid receptor regulation, each targeting different postsynaptic neurons and promoting opposing behavioral states.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is not only processed to the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide but also to various types of secreted APP variants. In a recent issue of Science, Rice et al. (2019) now demonstrate that secreted APP functions as a modulator of synaptic transmission by binding to GABABR1a.

Accurate sensing of changes in environmental temperature is a fundamental process. Budelli et al. (2019) describe a specific type of phasic thermosensory neurons in the Drosophila arista, dubbed “cooling cells,” that rely on ionotropic receptors (IRs) for their function and mediate cold and warm avoidance.

Over a billion people worldwide are affected by vitamin D deficiency. Although vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired cognition, the mechanisms mediating this link are poorly understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has now emerged as an important participant of synaptic plasticity and a new hypothesis is that vitamin D may interact with aggregates of the ECM, perineuronal nets (PNNs), to regulate brain plasticity. Dysregulation of PNNs caused by vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the presentation of cognitive deficits.

From an evolutionary perspective, the genes of enteric microbes transmitted reliably across generations are nearly as much a part of the human organism as our own genes. Disruption of the microbiome leading to extinction of key ‘heirloom’ taxa can deprive individuals of metabolic pathways that have been present in their ancestors for millennia. Some of these pathways support essential synthesis and toxin clearance processes, including the generation of blood–brain barrier-crossing metabolic products crucial for normal brain function.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Steven A Connor, Jonathan Elegheert, Yicheng Xie, Ann Marie Craig</p><div><p>Synapse development depends on a dynamic balance between synapse promoters and suppressors. MDGAs, immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, negatively regulate synapse development through blocking neuroligin–neurexin interactions. Recent analyses of MDGA–neuroligin complexes revealed the structural basis of this activity and indicate that MDGAs interact with all neuroligins with differential affinities. Surprisingly, analyses of mouse mutants revealed a functional divergence, with targeted mutation of <em>Mdga1</em> and <em>Mdga2</em> elevating inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Further research is needed to determine the synapse-specific organizing properties of MDGAs in neural circuits, which may depend on relative levels and subcellular distributions of each MDGA, neuroligin and neurexin. Behavioral deficits in <em>Mdga</em> mutant mice support genetic links to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders and raise the possibility of harnessing these interactions for therapeutic purposes.</p></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Synaptic dysfunction is widely proposed as an initial insult leading to the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We hypothesize that the initial insult originates in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) due to deficits in key interneuronal functions and synaptic signaling mechanisms, in particular, Wnt (Wingless/integrated). To investigate this hypothesis, we utilized the first knock-in mouse model of AD (<span style="font-style: italic;">App</span><sup><span style="font-style: italic;">NL-F/NL-F</span></sup>), expressing a mutant form of human amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein. This model shows an age-dependent accumulation of Aβ, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Prior to the typical AD pathology, we showed a decrease in canonical Wnt signaling activity first affecting the LEC in combination with synaptic hyperexcitation and severely disrupted excitatory–inhibitory inputs onto principal cells. This synaptic imbalance was consistent with a reduction in the number of parvalbumin-containing (PV) interneurons, and a reduction in the somatic inhibitory axon terminals in the LEC compared with other cortical regions. However, targeting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on PV cells using allosteric modulators, diazepam, zolpidem, or a nonbenzodiazepine, L-838,417 (modulator of α2/3 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors), restored the excitatory–inhibitory imbalance observed at principal cells in the LEC. These data support our hypothesis, providing a rationale for targeting the synaptic imbalance in the LEC for early stage therapeutic intervention to prevent neurodegeneration in AD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Current knowledge regarding the processing of observed manipulative actions (OMAs) (e.g., grasping, dragging, or dropping) is limited to grasping and underlying neural circuitry remains controversial. Here, we addressed these issues by combining chronic neuronal recordings along the anteroposterior extent of monkeys’ anterior intraparietal (AIP) area with tracer injections into the recorded sites. We found robust neural selectivity for 7 distinct OMAs, particularly in the posterior part of AIP (pAIP), where it was associated with motor coding of grip type and own-hand visual feedback. This cluster of functional properties appears to be specifically grounded in stronger direct connections of pAIP with the temporal regions of the ventral visual stream and the prefrontal cortex, as connections with skeletomotor related areas and regions of the dorsal visual stream exhibited opposite or no rostrocaudal gradients. Temporal and prefrontal areas may provide visual and contextual information relevant for manipulative action processing. These results revise existing models of the action observation network, suggesting that pAIP constitutes a parietal hub for routing information about OMA identity to the other nodes of the network.</span>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Changliang Liu, Pascal S Kaeser</p><div><p>Dopamine controls motor functions, motivation, and reward-related learning through G-protein coupled receptor signaling. The current working model is that upon release, dopamine diffuses to influence many target cells via wide-spread receptors. Recent studies, however, suggest that dopamine release is fast and generates small signaling hotspots. In this review, we summarize progress on the understanding of the dopamine release apparatus and evaluate how its properties may shape dopamine signaling during firing. We discuss how mechanisms of regulation may act through this machinery and propose that striatal architecture for dopamine signaling may have evolved to support rapid dopamine coding.</p></div>
