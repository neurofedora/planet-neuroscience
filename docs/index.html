              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10094">Theory of enhanced-by-coincidence neural information transmission</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The activity of neurons within brain circuits has been ubiquitously reported to be correlated. The impact of these correlations on brain function has been extensively investigated. Correlations can in principle increase or decrease the information that neural populations carry about sensory stimuli, but experiments in cortical areas have mostly reported information-limiting correlations, which decrease the information encoded in the population. However, a second stream of evidence suggests that temporal correlations between the spiking activity of different neurons may increase the impact of neural activity downstream, implying that temporal correlations affect both the encoding of information and its downstream readout. The principle of how encoding and readout combine are still unclear. Here, we consider a model of transmission of stimulus information encoded in pre-synaptic input spike trains with information-limiting time-correlations to the output firing of a post-synaptic biologicaly-plausible leaky integrate and fire (LIF) readout neuron. We derive an analytical solution of the model in the diffusion approximation, in which the encoding spiking activity is treated as a continuous-time stochastic variable. An ansatz based on a separation of timescales allows us compute the stimulus information transmitted to the readout over a broad range of parameters. Our analytical results reveal that, for sufficiently low input firing rates, large enough difference in input stimulus-specific activity, and moderately large input temporal correlations, the stimulus discriminability of the firing of the LIF readout neuron can be enhanced by the presence of input time correlations, despite they decrease the stimulus information encoded in its inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10098">Structuring the Environment Nudges Participants Toward Hierarchical Over Shortest Path Planning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective planning is crucial for navigating complex environments and achieving goals efficiently. In this study, we investigated how environmental structure influences the selection of planning strategies. Participants navigated a space station to collect colored spheres, with environments either structured (spheres grouped by color) or unstructured (spheres scattered randomly). We tested three types of plans: hierarchical (grouping spheres by color), shortest path (minimizing travel distance), and neutral (none of the above). By manipulating environmental structure, we were able to nudge participants toward a preference for hierarchical planning in structured environments, while shortest path plans were favored in unstructured environments. A mismatch between self-reported preferences and actual choices indicated that participants often adopted implicit strategies, unaware of their decision-making processes. These findings highlight the powerful effect of environmental cues on planning and suggest that even subtle changes in structure can guide the selection of planning strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10108">NeuroXVocal: Detection and Explanation of Alzheimer's Disease through Non-invasive Analysis of Picture-prompted Speech</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through non invasive methods remains a significant healthcare challenge. We present NeuroXVocal, a novel dual-component system that not only classifies but also explains potential AD cases through speech analysis. The classification component (Neuro) processes three distinct data streams: acoustic features capturing speech patterns and voice characteristics, textual features extracted from speech transcriptions, and precomputed embeddings representing linguistic patterns. These streams are fused through a custom transformer-based architecture that enables robust cross-modal interactions. The explainability component (XVocal) implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, leveraging Large Language Models combined with a domain-specific knowledge base of AD research literature. This architecture enables XVocal to retrieve relevant clinical studies and research findings to generate evidence-based context-sensitive explanations of the acoustic and linguistic markers identified in patient speech. Using the IS2021 ADReSSo Challenge benchmark dataset, our system achieved state-of-the-art performance with 95.77% accuracy in AD classification, significantly outperforming previous approaches. The explainability component was qualitatively evaluated using a structured questionnaire completed by medical professionals, validating its clinical relevance. NeuroXVocal's unique combination of high-accuracy classification and interpretable, literature-grounded explanations demonstrates its potential as a practical tool for supporting clinical AD diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01350">Human foraging strategies flexibly adapt to resource distribution and time constraints</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.01350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foraging is a crucial activity, yet the extent to which humans employ flexible versus rigid strategies remains unclear. This study investigates how individuals adapt their foraging strategies in response to resource distribution and foraging time constraints. For this, we designed a video-game-like foraging task that requires participants to navigate a four-areas environment to collect coins from treasure boxes within a limited time. This task engages multiple cognitive abilities, such as navigation, learning, and memorization of treasure box locations. Findings indicate that participants adjust their foraging strategies -- encompassing both stay-or-leave decisions, such as the number of boxes opened in initial areas and behavioral aspects, such as the time to navigate from box to box -- depending on both resource distribution and foraging time. Additionally, they improved their performance over time as an effect of both enhanced navigation skills and adaptation of foraging strategies. Finally, participants' performance was initially distant from the reward-maximizing performance of optimal agents due to the learning process humans undergo; however, it approximated the optimal agent's performance towards the end of the task, without fully reaching it. These results highlight the flexibility of human foraging behavior and underscore the importance of employing optimality models and ecologically rich scenarios to study foraging.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15108">The shape of the brain's connections is predictive of cognitive performance: an explainable machine learning study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.15108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shape of the brain's white matter connections is relatively unexplored in diffusion MRI tractography analysis. While it is known that tract shape varies in populations and across the human lifespan, it is unknown if the variability in dMRI tractography-derived shape may relate to the brain's functional variability across individuals. This work explores the potential of leveraging tractography fiber cluster shape measures to predict subject-specific cognitive performance. We implement machine learning models to predict individual cognitive performance scores. We study a large-scale database from the HCP-YA study. We apply an atlas-based fiber cluster parcellation to the dMRI tractography of each individual. We compute 15 shape, microstructure, and connectivity features for each fiber cluster. Using these features as input, we train a total of 210 models to predict 7 different NIH Toolbox cognitive performance assessments. We apply an explainable AI technique, SHAP, to assess the importance of each fiber cluster for prediction. Our results demonstrate that shape measures are predictive of individual cognitive performance. The studied shape measures, such as irregularity, diameter, total surface area, volume, and branch volume, are as effective for prediction as microstructure and connectivity measures. The overall best-performing feature is a shape feature, irregularity, which describes how different a cluster's shape is from an idealized cylinder. Further interpretation using SHAP values suggest that fiber clusters with features highly predictive of cognitive ability are widespread throughout the brain, including fiber clusters from the superficial association, deep association, cerebellar, striatal, and projection pathways. This study demonstrates the strong potential of shape descriptors to enhance the study of the brain's white matter and its relationship to cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01360">A Relative Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which the network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define the equivalence class of inputs $\sim_\Phi$, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the overlap decomposition $O_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and the input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to relative homology groups $H_k(\Phi(M)) \simeq H_k(M,O_\Phi)$. This lets us compute Betti numbers without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our relative homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on various classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09954">On Space Folds of ReLU Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.09954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent findings suggest that the consecutive layers of ReLU neural networks can be understood geometrically as space folding transformations of the input space, revealing patterns of self-similarity. In this paper, we present the first quantitative analysis of this space folding phenomenon in ReLU neural networks. Our approach focuses on examining how straight paths in the Euclidean input space are mapped to their counterparts in the Hamming activation space. In this process, the convexity of straight lines is generally lost, giving rise to non-convex folding behavior. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel measure based on range metrics, similar to those used in the study of random walks, and provide the proof for the equivalence of convexity notions between the input and activation spaces. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on a geometrical analysis benchmark (CantorNet) as well as an image classification benchmark (MNIST). Our work advances the understanding of the activation space in ReLU neural networks by leveraging the phenomena of geometric folding, providing valuable insights on how these models process input information.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10200">Dynamic Reinforcement Learning for Actors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Reinforcement Learning (Dynamic RL), proposed in this paper, directly controls system dynamics, instead of the actor (action-generating neural network) outputs at each moment, bringing about a major qualitative shift in reinforcement learning (RL) from static to dynamic. The actor is initially designed to generate chaotic dynamics through the loop with its environment, enabling the agent to perform flexible and deterministic exploration. Dynamic RL controls global system dynamics using a local index called "sensitivity," which indicates how much the input neighborhood contracts or expands into the corresponding output neighborhood through each neuron's processing. While sensitivity adjustment learning (SAL) prevents excessive convergence of the dynamics, sensitivity-controlled reinforcement learning (SRL) adjusts them -- to converge more to improve reproducibility around better state transitions with positive TD error and to diverge more to enhance exploration around worse transitions with negative TD error. Dynamic RL was applied only to the actor in an Actor-Critic RL architecture while applying it to the critic remains a challenge. It was tested on two dynamic tasks and functioned effectively without external exploration noise or backward computation through time. Moreover, it exhibited excellent adaptability to new environments, although some problems remain. Drawing parallels between 'exploration' and 'thinking,' the author hypothesizes that "exploration grows into thinking through learning" and believes this RL could be a key technique for the emergence of thinking, including inspiration that cannot be reconstructed from massive existing text data. Finally, despite being presumptuous, the author presents the argument that this research should not proceed due to its potentially fatal risks, aiming to encourage discussion.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11793">Coevolution of Camouflage</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2304.11793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Camouflage in nature seems to arise from competition between predator and prey. To survive, predators must find prey, and prey must avoid being found. This work simulates an abstract model of that adversarial relationship. It looks at crypsis through evolving prey camouflage patterns (as color textures) in competition with evolving predator vision. During their "lifetime" predators learn to better locate camouflaged prey. The environment for this 2D simulation is provided by a set of photographs, typically of natural scenes. This model is based on two evolving populations, one of prey and another of predators. Mutual conflict between these populations can produce both effective prey camouflage and predators skilled at "breaking" camouflage. The result is an open source artificial life model to help study camouflage in nature, and the perceptual phenomenon of camouflage more generally.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07538">Evidence of Scaling Regimes in the Hopfield Dynamics of Whole Brain Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2401.07538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a Hopfield recurrent neural network exhibits a scaling regime, whose specific exponents depend on the number of parcels used and the decay length of the coupling strength. This scaling regime recovers the picture introduced by Deco et al., according to which the process of information transfer within the human brain shows spatially correlated patterns qualitatively similar to those displayed by turbulent flows, although with a more singular exponent, 1/2 instead of 2/3. Both models employ a coupling strength which decays exponentially with the Euclidean distance between the nodes, informed by experimentally derived brain topology. Nevertheless, their mathematical nature is very different, Hopf oscillators versus a Hopfield neural network, respectively. Hence, their convergence for the same data parameters, suggests an intriguing robustness of the scaling picture.Furthermore, the present analysis shows that the Hopfield model brain remains functional by removing links above about five decay lengths, corresponding to about one sixth of the size of the global brain. This suggests that, in terms of connectivity decay length, the Hopfield brain functions in a sort of intermediate ``turbulent liquid''-like state, whose essential connections are the intermediate ones between the connectivity decay length and the global brain size. The evident sensitivity of the scaling exponent to the value of the decay length, as well as to the number of brain parcels employed, leads us to take with great caution any quantitative assessment regarding the specific nature of the scaling regime.

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, incorporates multi-view learning to construct more interpretable representations in the latent space. Moreover, we present the Analytic Neural Network, which incorporates a consistency penalty that encourages analytic signal representations in the latent space of the Steinmetz neural network. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship between the real and imaginary components. Using an information-theoretic construction, we demonstrate that the generalization gap upper bound posited by the analytic neural network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our numerical experiments depict the improved performance and robustness to additive noise, afforded by our proposed networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples.

Abstract: This paper provides a unique approach with AI algorithms to predict emerging stock markets volatility. Traditionally, stock volatility is derived from historical volatility,Monte Carlo simulation and implied volatility as well. In this paper, the writer designs a consolidated model with back-propagation neural network and genetic algorithm to predict future volatility of emerging stock markets and found that the results are quite accurate with low errors.

">Transferrin receptor-binding blood-brain barrier shuttle enhances brain delivery and efficacy of a therapeutic anti-Abeta antibody</a></h4>

              
                Transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) transcytosis-mediated delivery of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a promising concept in drug development for CNS disorders. We sought to investigate brain delivery and efficacy of Aducanumab (Adu), an anti-A{beta} antibody, when fused to a mouse TfR1-binding Fab fragment as BBB shuttle (TfR1-Adu). Automated 3D light sheet fluorescence imaging coupled with computational analysis was applied to evaluate drug IgG distribution and plaque counts throughout the intact brain of transgenic APP/PS1 mice. TfR1-Adu demonstrated enhanced brain delivery and more homogeneous distribution after both acute and chronic dosing in transgenic APP/PS1 mice compared with unmodified Adu. Also, importantly, only unmodified Adu showed perivascular labelling. While high-dose Adu promoted A{beta} plaque depletion in multiple brain regions, similar plaque-clearing efficacy was achieved with a five-fold lower dose of TfR1-Adu. Furthermore, low-dose TfR1-Adu demonstrated greater capacity to reduce congophilic plaque burden. Collectively, these observations strongly support the applicability of TfR1-enabled BBB shuttle strategies to improve brain delivery and plaque-clearing efficacy while mitigating the risk of vascular-associated amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) adverse effects associated with current A{beta} immunotherapeutics.

">Glutamatergic heterogeneity in the neuropeptide projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                The direct pathway from the lateral hypothalamus to the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) includes neurons that express the neuropeptide orexin-A, and others that do not. The OB-projecting neurons that do not express orexin-A are present in an area of the lateral hypothalamus known to contain neurons that express the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). We used virally mediated anterograde tract tracing and immunohistochemistry for orexin-A and MCH to demonstrate that the OB is broadly innervated by axon projections from both populations of neurons. Orexin-A and MCH were expressed in each OB layer across its anterior to posterior axis. Both orexin-A and MCH neurons are genetically heterogeneous, with subsets that co-express an isoform of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). We used high-resolution confocal imaging to test whether the projections from orexin-A and MCH neurons to the OB reflect this glutamatergic heterogeneity. The majority (~57%) of putative orexin-A axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with smaller proportions that co-expressed VGLUT1, or that did not overlap with either VGLUT1 or VGLUT2. In contrast, only ~26% of putative MCH axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with the majority not overlapping with either VGLUT. Therefore, the projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the OB are genetically heterogeneous and include neurons that can release two different neuropeptides. The projections from both populations are themselves genetically heterogeneous with distinct ratios of glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic axon terminals.

">Sleep duration and efficiency moderate the effects of prenatal and childhood ambient pollutant exposure on global white matter microstructural integrity in adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Background: Air pollution is a ubiquitous neurotoxicant associated with alterations in structural connectivity. Good habitual sleep may be an important protective lifestyle factor due to its involvement in the brain waste clearance and its bidirectional relationship with immune function. Wearable multisensory devices may provide more objective measures of sleep quantity and quality. We investigated whether sleep duration and efficiency moderated the relationship between prenatal and childhood pollutant exposure and whole-brain white matter microstructural integrity at ages 10-13 years. Methods: We used multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging data collected on 3T MRI scanners and objective sleep data collected with Fitbit Charge 2 from the 2-year follow-up visit for 2178 subjects in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study(R). White matter tracts were identified using a probabilistic atlas. Restriction spectrum imaging was performed to extract restricted normalized isotropic (RNI) and directional (RND) signal fraction parameters for all white matter tracts, then averaged to calculate global measures. Sleep duration was calculated by summing the time spent in each sleep stage; sleep efficiency was calculated by dividing sleep duration by time spent in bed. Using an ensemble-based modeling approach, air pollution concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, and O3 were assigned to each child's residential addresses during the prenatal period (9-month average before birthdate) as well as at ages 9-10 years. Multi-pollutant linear mixed effects models assessed the associations between global RNI and RND and sleep-by-pollutant interactions, adjusting for appropriate covariates. Results: Sleep duration interacted with childhood NO2 exposure and sleep efficiency interacted with prenatal O3 exposure to affect RND at ages 10-13 years. Longer sleep duration and higher sleep efficiency in the context of higher pollutant exposure was associated with lower RND compared to those with similar pollutant exposure but shorter sleep duration and lower sleep efficiency. Conclusions: Low-level air pollution poses a risk to brain health in youth, and healthy sleep duration and efficiency may increase resilience to its harmful effects on white matter microstructural integrity. Future studies should evaluate the generalizability of these results in more diverse cohorts as well as utilize longitudinal data to understand how sleep may impact brain health trajectories in the context of pollution over time.

">A Novel Method for Culturing Telencephalic Neurons in Axolotls</a></h4>

              
                The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), a neotenic salamander with remarkable regenerative capabilities, serves as a key model for studying nervous system regeneration. Despite its potential, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this regenerative capacity remain poorly understood, partly due to the lack of reliable in vitro models for axolotl neural cells. In this study, we developed a novel protocol for primary cultures of adult axolotl telencephalon/pallium, enabling the maintenance of viable and functionally active neural cells. Using calcium imaging and immunocytochemistry, we demonstrated the presence of neuronal and glial markers, synaptic connections, and spontaneous calcium activity, highlighting the functional integrity of the cultured cells. Our findings reveal that these cultures can be maintained in both serum and serum-free conditions, with neurons exhibiting robust neurite outgrowth and responsiveness to injury. This protocol addresses a critical gap in axolotl research by providing a controlled in vitro system to study neurogenesis and regeneration. By offering insights into the regenerative mechanisms of axolotl neurons, this work lays the foundation for comparative studies with mammalian systems, potentially informing therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases and CNS injuries in humans.

">Microglia Adopt Temporally Specific Subtypes after Irradiation, Correlating with Neuronal Asynchrony</a></h4>

              
                Cranial radiotherapy causes progressive neurocognitive impairments in cancer survivors. Neuroinflammation is believed to be a key contributor, but its dynamics and consequences for brain function remain poorly understood. Here, we performed comprehensive longitudinal profiling, from 6 hours to 1 year after irradiation (IR) of the mouse hippocampus, using transcriptomic, protein and histological analyses. We identified a delayed microglial response coupling interferon signaling to mitotic progression, and a subsequent induction of temporally regulated subtypes. IR rewired the parenchymal phagocyte profiles due to progressive microglial loss, failure of repopulation through self-renewal and compensatory generation of microglia-like cells derived from peripheral monocytes. These findings were confirmed in autopsied human brain. Finally, we demonstrate two phases of neuronal asynchrony, an early one associated with inflammation and a late one associated with synaptic aberrant regulation. These results provide comprehensive, longitudinal insights into microglia responses that can aid tailoring therapies to preserve cognition in cancer survivors.

">Selective manipulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in top-down and bottom-up visual pathways using ultrasound stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Techniques for precise manipulation of neurons in specific neural pathways are crucial for excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and investigation of complex brain circuits. Low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation (LIFUS) has emerged as a promising tool for noninvasive deep-brain targeting at high spatial resolution. However, there is a lack of studies that extensively investigate the modulation of top-down and bottom-up corticothalamic circuits via selective manipulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Here, a comprehensive methodology using electrophysiological recording and c-Fos staining is employed to demonstrate pulse repetition frequency (PRF)-dependent E/I selectivity of ultrasound stimulation in the top-down and bottom-up corticothalamic pathways of the visual circuit in rodents. Ultrasound stimulation at various PRFs is applied to either the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LP) or the primary visual cortex (V1), and multi-channel single-unit activity is recorded from the V1 using a silicon probe. Our results demonstrate that high frequency PRFs, particularly at 3 kHz and 1 kHz, are effective at activating the bidirectional corticothalamic visual pathway. In addition, brain region-specific PRFs modulate E/I cortical signals, corticothalamic projections, and synaptic neurotransmission, which is imperative for circuit-specific applications and behavioral studies.

">A vector-based strategy for olfactory navigation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Odors serve as essential cues for navigation. Although tracking an odor plume has been modeled as a reflexive process, it remains unclear whether animals can use memories of their past odor encounters to infer the spatial structure of their chemical environment or their location within it. Here we developed a virtual-reality olfactory paradigm that allows head-fixed Drosophila to navigate structured chemical landscapes, offering insight into how memory mechanisms shape their navigational strategies. We found that flies track an appetitive odor corridor by following its boundary, alternating between rapid counterturns to exit the plume and directed returns to its edge. Using a combination of behavioral modeling, functional calcium imaging, and neural perturbations, we demonstrate that this 'edge-tracking' strategy relies on vector-based computations within the Drosophila central complex in which flies store and dynamically update memories of the direction to return them to the plume's boundary. Consistent with this, we find that FC2 neurons within the fan-shaped body, which encode a fly's navigational goal, signal the direction back to the odor boundary when flies are outside the plume. Together, our studies suggest that flies leverage the plume's boundary as a dynamic landmark to guide their navigation, analogous to the memory-based strategies other insects use for long-distance migration or homing to their nests. Plume tracking thus uses components of a conserved navigational toolkit, enabling flies to use memory mechanisms to navigate through a complex shifting chemical landscape.

">Transient Acute Neuronal Activation Response Caused by High Concentrations of Oligonucleotides in the Cerebral Spinal Fluid</a></h4>

              
                Oligonucleotide (ON) therapeutics are promising as a disease-modifying therapy for central nervous system disorders. Intrathecal ON administration into the cerebral spinal fluid is a safe and effective delivery mode to the CNS. However, preclinical studies have shown acute toxicities following high-dose central ON delivery. Here we characterize a transient neurobehavioral change peaking 15 minutes after ON dosing and resolving after 120 minutes. Symptoms include shaking, muscle twitching, cramping, hyperactivity, stereotypic movements, hyperreactivity, vocalizations, tremors, convulsions, and seizures. These are collectively referred here as the acute neuronal activation response. Acute neuronal activation is observed in rats, mice, and non-human primates and is quantifiable using a simple scoring system. It is distinct from acute sedation seen with some phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides, characterized by loss of spinal reflexes, ataxia, and sedation. The acute neuronal activation response is largely sequence-independent and is driven by ON chelation of divalent cations, particularly influenced by the divalent cations-to-ON ratio in the dosing solution. Acute neuronal activation can be safely mitigated by adjusting this ratio through magnesium supplementation in the ON formulation. We provide a comprehensive framework for quantifying and mitigating the acute neuronal activation response caused by high concentrations of centrally delivered ON therapeutics in preclinical species.

">Top-down control of the descending pain modulatory system drives placebo analgesia</a></h4>

              
                In placebo analgesia, prior experience and expectations lead to pain suppression by the administration of an inert substance, but causal evidence for its neural basis is lacking. To identify the underlying neural circuits, we reverse-translated a conditioned placebo protocol from humans to mice. Surprisingly, the placebo effect suppresses both nociception and unconditioned emotional-motivational pain-related behavior. Descending pain modulatory neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) are critical for both morphine and placebo antinociception. The placebo effect depends on input to the PAG from the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, but not anterior insular cortex. Conditioning enhances noxious stimulus-evoked endogenous opioid release in the PAG to produce analgesia. Our results suggest that cortical control of the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) is gated by rapid endogenous opioid signaling in the PAG during placebo trials. This study bridges clinical and preclinical research, establishing a central role for the DPMS in placebo analgesia.

">Mice dynamically adapt to opponents in competitive multi-player games</a></h4>

              
                Competing for resources in dynamic social environments is fundamental for survival, and requires continuous monitoring of both 'self' and 'others' to guide effective choices. Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about 'self' and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.

">3D markerless tracking of speech movements with submillimeter accuracy</a></h4>

              
                Speech movements are highly complex and require precise tuning of both spatial and timing of oral articulators to support intelligible communication. These properties also make measurement of speech movements challenging, often requiring extensive physical sensors placed around the mouth and face that are not easily tolerated by certain populations such as young children. Recent progress in machine learning-based markerless facial landmark tracking technology demonstrated its potential to provide lip tracking without the need for physical sensors, but whether such technology can provide submillimeter precision and accuracy in 3D remains unknown. Moreover, it is also unclear whether such technology can be applied to track speech movements in young children. Here, we developed a novel approach that integrates Shape Preserving Facial Landmarks with Graph Attention Networks (SPIGA), a facial landmark detector, and CoTracker, a transformer-based neural network model that jointly tracks dense points across a video sequence. We further examined and validated this novel approach by assessing its tracking precision and accuracy. The findings revealed that our approach that integrates SPIGA and CoTracker was more precise ({approx} 0.15 mm in standard deviation) than SPIGA alone ({approx} 0.35 mm). In addition, its 3D tracking performance was comparable to electromagnetic articulography ({approx} 0.29 mm RMSE against simultaneously recorded articulograph data). Importantly, the approach performed similarly well across adults and young children (i.e., 3- and 4-year-olds). Because our framework is built upon open-source pretrained models that are fully trained, it promotes accessibility and open science while saving computing resources. Furthermore, given that this framework combines a landmark detection model (SPIGA) with a tracker model (CoTracker) to improve precision/accuracy, our novel approach serves as a proof-of-concept for enhancing the performance of a wide variety of commonly used markerless tracking applications in biology and neuroscience.

">Depolarizing afterpotentials in rodent mEC layer II neurons vary gradually across all principal cell types</a></h4>

              
                Principal cells in Layer II (LII) of the rodent medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) often discharge in short burst episodes, whose biophysical mechanism and biological function are not fully understood. As shown by in vitro recordings in rats and in vivo recordings in mice, action potentials of stellate cells (SCs) and pyramidal cells (PCs) in mEC LII can trigger depolarizing afterpotentials (DAPs) that facilitate spike doublets and burst firing. In vitro recordings in mice confirm these findings for SCs and two additional cell types intermediate between SCs and PCs but suggest that mouse PCs generate minute DAPs only. To better understand the diversity and physiology of the intermediate LII mEC cell types, we performed slice experiments in Long Evans rats of both sexes and analyzed the data using clustering techniques. The analysis suggests four distinct cell clusters, reminiscent of previous observations in mice. On purpose, DAP properties were not used for the cluster analysis so that they could be studied post-hoc in an unbiased manner. Our results show that characteristic features of DAPs and other physiological markers are broadly distributed within each cell class and vary gradually from cluster to cluster, forming a continuum of biophysical properties.

">Degeneracy explains diversity in interneuronal regulation of pattern separation in heterogeneous dentate gyrus networks</a></h4>

              
                Background and motivations: The Marr-Albus theory postulates that pattern separation is realized by divergent feedforward excitatory connectivity. Yet, there are several lines of evidence for strong but differential regulation of pattern separation by local circuit connectivity, even when feedforward connectivity is divergent. What are the relative contributions of divergent feedforward connectivity and local circuit interactions to pattern separation? How do we reconcile the contrasting lines of evidence on local circuit regulation of pattern separation in circuits endowed with divergent feedforward connectivity? In this study, we quantitatively address these questions in a population of heterogeneous dentate gyrus (DG) networks, where we enforced feedforward connectivity to be identically divergent. Methodology: We generated tens of thousands of random spiking neuronal models to arrive at thousands of non-repeating heterogeneous single-neuron models of four different DG neuronal subtypes, each satisfying their respective functional characteristics. We connected these heterogeneous populations of neurons with subtype proportions and local connectivity that reflected the DG microcircuit. In a second level of unbiased search, we generated 20,000 identical networks that differed from each other only in their synaptic weight values. Thus, within the Marr-Albus framework, these networks that were identical in terms of neuronal composition and divergent feedforward connectivity should all be capable of performing effective pattern separation. To test this, we fed these networks with morphed sets of input patterns, recorded granule cell outputs, and computed similarity metrics based on correlation measures across input or output patterns. We developed novel quantitative metrics for pattern separation from plots of output similarity vs. input similarity and validated each network with bounds on these metrics. Results: Despite being identical in terms of divergent feedforward connectivity, we found only a very small proportion (47 of 20,000 or 0.23%) of the randomly generated networks to manifest effective pattern separation. We tested the specific contributions of interneurons by assessing pattern separation in all pattern-separating networks after individually deleting each of the three interneuron subtypes. Strikingly, we found pronounced network-to-network variability in how each interneuron subtype contributed to granule cell sparsity and pattern separation. We traced this variability to differences in local synaptic connectivity, which also resulted in network-to-network variability in firing rates and sparsity of different interneurons. Finally, we found heterogeneous DG networks to be more resilient to synaptic jitter compared to their homogeneous counterparts, with specific reference to pattern separation computed through average firing rate correlations. Implications: Our population-of-networks approach clearly shows that divergent connectivity of afferent inputs does not guarantee pattern separation in DG networks. Instead, we demonstrate strong yet variable roles for interneurons and local connectivity in implementing pattern separation. Importantly, our analyses unveil degeneracy in DG circuits, whereby similar pattern separation efficacy was achieved through disparate local-circuit interactions. These observations, alongside network-to-network variability in dependencies on different interneurons, strongly advocate the complex adaptive systems approach as a unifying framework to study DG pattern separation.

">Partial Input Loss Differentially Modifies Neural Pathways</a></h4>

              
                Following input loss from degeneration, injury, and/or aging, downstream circuits undergo modifications that can impact fundamental sensory computations. Using the retina to leverage known cell types, well-defined circuitry, and molecular tools, we show how multiple pathways adjust their functional properties differently to common input loss and further locate these changes within each pathway. Specifically, we asked if two OFF ganglion cell types, alpha OFF-sustained (AOFF-S) and OFF-transient (AOFF-T) cells, and their respective dominant presynaptic partners, type 2 and type 3a cone bipolar cells, respond differentially to partial cone loss. We find that AOFF-T ganglion cells exhibit more circuit changes than AOFF-S ganglion cells, resulting in altered spatiotemporal tuning following partial cone loss. We show that the underlying mechanisms include changes in glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic circuits in the pathway of AOFF-T ganglion cells. In response to common input loss, our study finds different locations of circuit modifications across OFF pathways. These distinct functional changes in two pathways contribute to maintaining perceptually relevant information, preserving key visual features despite input loss. These findings provide insight into how sensory systems can compensate to ultimately serve vision.

">Linguistic coupling between neural systems for speech production and comprehension during real-time dyadic conversations</a></h4>

              
                The core use of human language is communicating complex ideas from one mind to another in everyday conversations. In conversations, comprehension and production processes are intertwined, as speakers soon become listeners, and listeners become speakers. Nonetheless, the neural systems underlying these faculties are typically studied in isolation using paradigms that cannot fully engage our capacity for interactive communication. Here, we used an fMRI hyperscanning paradigm to measure neural activity simultaneously in pairs of subjects engaged in real-time, interactive conversations. We used contextual word embeddings from a large language model to quantify the linguistic coupling between production and comprehension systems within and across individual brains. We found a highly overlapping network of regions involved in both production and comprehension spanning much of the cortical language network. Our findings reveal that shared representations for both processes extend beyond the language network into areas associated with social cognition. Together, these results suggest that the specialized neural systems for speech perception and production align on a common set of linguistic features encoded in a broad cortical network for language and communication.

">Divergent modulation of dopaminergic neurons by hypocretin/orexin receptors-1 and -2 shapes dopaminergic cell activity and socio-emotional behavior</a></h4>

              
                Many neuropsychiatric disorders involve dysregulation of the dopaminergic (DA) input to the forebrain. Of particular relevance are DA projections originating from the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA). A key neuromodulatory influence onto DAVTA neurons arises from the dense axonal projections emanating from lateral hypothalamic area hypocretin/orexin (OX) neurons. Despite being a major input, the differential action of orexin peptides A and B (OXA and OXB) on orexin receptors 1 and 2 (OX1R and OX2R) in DA cells is poorly characterized. We thus genetically engineered mice whose DA neurons are selectively unresponsive to OX input via OX1R (DAOx1R-KO mice) or OX2R (DAOx2R-KO mice) and compared their behavior and DA cell electrophysiology to genetic controls. We previously showed a profound functional divergence between OX1R- and OX2R-mediated modulation of DA neurons in controlling vigilance states, brain oscillations and cognitive behavior. Inactivation of OX2R, but not OX1R, in DA neurons dramatically increased time spent in EEG theta-rich wakefulness, improved reward-driven learning and attentional skills, while it impaired inhibitory control. Here, we interrogate DAOx1R-KO and DAOx2R-KO mice in further behavioral domains. We show that mice with DA-specific OX1R loss exhibit hyperactivity, or anxiety-like responding, in context-dependent manners. OX2R loss in contrast decreases sociability and aversion-driven learning. We next investigate the underlying electrophysiological substrates and uncover previously unrecognized effects of OX peptides on DAVTA cell responses. In WT and control mice, we show that while OXA enhances, OXB diminishes DAVTA neuronal excitability. OX1R-deficient DA cells lose OXA responding and OX2R-deficient DA cells lose OXB responding. We altogether evidence strikingly distinct functions of OX1 vs OX2R signaling in modulating the intrinsic excitability of DAVTA neurons and influencing DA-related behaviors. Our data position OX[-&gt;]DA neurotransmission via OX1 or OX2R as relevant to endophenotypes observed in the context of disorders such as obsessive-compulsive, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorders.

">Hierarchical encoding of natural sounds mixtures in ferret auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Extracting relevant auditory signals from complex natural scenes is a fundamental challenge for the auditory system. Sounds from multiple sources overlap in time and frequency. In particular, dynamic "foreground" sounds are often masked by more stationary "background" sounds. Human auditory cortex exhibits a hierarchical organization where background-invariant representations are progressively enhanced along the processing stream, from primary to non-primary regions. However, we do not know whether this organizational principle is conserved across species and which neural mechanisms drive this invariance. To address these questions, we investigated background invariance in ferret auditory cortex using functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), which enables large-scale, high-resolution recordings of hemodynamic responses. We measured responses across primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortical regions as ferrets passively listened to mixtures of natural sounds and their components in isolation. We found a hierarchical gradient of background invariance, mirroring findings in humans: responses in primary auditory cortex reflected contributions from both foreground and background sounds, while background invariance increased in higher-order auditory regions. Using a spectrotemporal filter-bank model, we found that in ferrets, this hierarchical structure could be largely explained by tuning to low-order acoustic features. However, this model failed to fully account for background invariance in human non-primary auditory cortex, suggesting that additional, higher-order mechanisms are crucial for background segregation in humans.

">Capicua refines mossy fiber-CA3 axon targeting in the late postnatal hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Proper brain wiring relies on the precise distribution of axonal projections to specific subcellular domains of their target neurons. These spatially confined connections establish the anatomical foundation for neural circuit assembly. The mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 pathway in the hippocampus is an excellent system to study the mechanisms underlying lamina-specific connectivity. In rodents, MF projections develop postnatally and reach their mature configuration by the end of the second postnatal week. MF axons synapse on the proximal segments of the dendrites but avoid the somas of CA3 pyramidal neurons. As dentate gyrus granule neurons are continuously generated and integrated into the existing hippocampal circuit throughout the postnatal period and adulthood, the mechanisms that guide MF axons to achieve lamina-specific targeting of these later-born granule neurons remain unclear. Here, we show that deletion of the neurodevelopmental disorder-associated protein capicua (CIC) results in abnormal MF targeting in the mouse hippocampus. Notably, this defect emerges after the second postnatal week and persists into adulthood, distinguishing it from classical MF guidance defects, which typically manifest during the first postnatal week. We also demonstrate that this miswiring is due to CIC loss in dentate gyrus granule neurons rather than CA3 pyramidal neurons. Single-nucleus transcriptomics and trajectory analysis reveal a loss of a mature granule neuron subtype and dysregulation of axon guidance genes that are normally downregulated as granule neurons mature. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for CIC in hippocampus development and offer insights into the regulation of lamina-specific MF connectivity in the postnatal brain.

">Voltage-gated ion channel diversity underlies neuronal excitability and nervous system evolution</a></h4>

              
                All nervous systems function via electrical excitability mediated by ion channels. However, channels and excitability are both ancient, preneuronal features that many cells use to rapidly adjust behavior. We systematically studied the evolutionary paths to neuronal excitability by characterizing the voltage-gated ion channel complements (VGL-chanomes) of 623 organisms, dissecting their expression patterns in 11 whole-body cell atlases and 3 entire nervous systems, and recording electrical properties of primitive neurons in the sea anemone. We find a disconnect between ion channel availability and organismal or nervous system complexity and find instead an association with lifestyle and behavior. Cell type restricted chanome expression predated the emergence of nervous systems in multicellular organisms. Multiple gene-family expansions and contractions independently specialized or diversified VGL-chanomes leading to a surprising convergent pattern: not the number of channels but their diversity and restrictive recruitment is a hallmark of neuronal complexity. These findings suggest that the evolution of highly complex nervous systems was not a stepwise progression of expanding complexity.

">A neuro-immune axis of transcriptomic dysregulation within the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Many genes are linked to psychiatric disorders, but genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and differential gene expression (DGE) analyses in post-mortem brain tissue often implicate distinct gene sets. This disconnect impedes therapeutic development, which relies on integrating genetic and genomic insights. We address this issue using a novel multivariate technique that reduces DGE bias by leveraging gene co-expression networks and controlling for confounds such as drug exposure. Deep RNA sequencing was performed in bulk post-mortem sgACC from individuals with bipolar disorder (BD; N=35), major depression (MDD; N=51), schizophrenia (SCZ; N=44), and controls (N=55). Toxicology data dimensionality was reduced using multiple correspondence analysis; case-control gene expression was then analyzed using 1) traditional DGE and 2) group regularized canonical correlation analysis (GRCCA) - a multivariate regression method that accounts for feature interdependence. Gene set enrichment analyses compared results with established neuropsychiatric risk genes, gene ontology pathways, and cell type enrichments. GRCCA revealed a significant association with SCZ (Pperm=0.001; no significant BD or MDD association), and the resulting gene weight vector correlated with DGE SCZ-control t-statistics (R=0.53; P<0.05). Both methods indicated down-regulation of immune and microglial genes and upregulation of ion transport and excitatory neuron genes. However, GRCCA - at both the gene and transcript level - showed stronger enrichments (FDR<0.05). Notably, GRCCA results were enriched for SCZ GWAS-implicated genes (FDR<0.05), while DGE results were not. These findings identify a SCZ-specific sgACC gene expression pattern that highlights SCZ risk genes and implicates neuro-immune pathways, thus demonstrating the utility of multivariate approaches to integrate genetic and genomic signals.

">Neuropeptide CRH prevents premature differentiation of OPCs following CNS injury and in early postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                The role of neuropeptides and their receptors in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) has largely been overlooked so far. Here, we describe a new subpopulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing OPCs that aggregate around acute brain injuries and exhibit an elevated capacity to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). We found that CRH expression in OPCs is rapidly induced de novo as a transient response within the first 72 hours after injury. As target cells, we identified CRH receptor type 1 (CRHR1)-expressing OPCs which show a decreased differentiation velocity. We demonstrate that CRH/CRHR1 system inactivation increases the speed of OL generation compromising the long-term survival of OLs after acute injury. Furthermore, we prove that a CRH/CRHR1 system deficiency under non-injury conditions leads to increased early postnatal oligodendrogenesis and alterations in adult myelination. Altogether, we show that OPC-derived CRH not only actively influences the injury environment through the interaction with CRHR1-expressing OPCs, but also identify the G-protein coupled receptor CRHR1 as a critical modulator of oligodendrogenesis at early postnatal stages with lasting effects on adult myelination.

                Naturalistic electrocorticography (ECoG) data are a rare but essential resource for studying the brain's linguistic capabilities. ECoG offers a high temporal resolution suitable for investigating processes at multiple temporal timescales and frequency bands. It also provides broad spatial coverage, often along critical language areas. Here, we share a dataset of nine ECoG participants with 1,330 electrodes listening to a 30-minute audio podcast. The richness of this naturalistic stimulus can be used for various research endeavors, from auditory perception to semantic integration. In addition to the neural data, we extract linguistic features of the stimulus ranging from phonetic information to large language model word embeddings. We use these linguistic features in encoding models that relate stimulus properties to neural activity. Finally, we provide detailed tutorials for preprocessing raw data, extracting stimulus features, and running encoding analyses that can serve as a pedagogical resource or a springboard for new research.

">Full inter-hemispheric integration sustained by a fraction of posterior callosal fibers</a></h4>

              
                The dynamic integration of the lateralized and specialized capacities of the two cerebral hemispheres constitutes a hallmark feature of human brain function. This inter-hemispheric exchange of information is thought to critically depend upon the corpus callosum. Classical anatomical descriptions of callosal organization outline a topographic gradient from front to back, such that specific transcallosal fibers support distinct aspects of integrated brain function. Here we present a challenge to this conventional model. Using neuroimaging data obtained from a new cohort of adult callosotomy patients, we leverage modern network neuroscience techniques to show - for the first time - that full inter-hemispheric integration can be achieved via a small proportion of posterior callosal fibers. Partial callosotomy patients with spared callosal fibers retained widespread patterns of inter-hemispheric functional connectivity and showed no signs of behavioral disconnection syndromes, even with only 1 cm of the splenium intact. Conversely, only complete corpus callosotomy patients demonstrated sweeping disruptions of inter-hemispheric network architectures, aligning with disconnection syndromes long-thought to reflect diminished information propagation and communication across the brain. These findings motivate a novel mechanistic understanding of synchronized inter-hemispheric neural activity for large-scale human brain function and behavior.

	<p>Background: Emerging evidence suggests that peripheral immunoinflammatory responses contribute to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pathogenesis, and endothelial cells (ECs) are involved in these responses. Nevertheless, the potential molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways by which ECs modulate peripheral immunoinflammatory responses and thus contribute to AD pathogenesis are not fully understood. Methods: The single-cell RNA sequencing dataset GSE157827 was analyzed, and AD key genes were screened using LASSO regression and random forest algorithms. Functional enrichment analyses of these AD key genes were conducted using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis. Immune cell infiltration analyses for AD key genes were performed using single-sample GSEA, and their correlations with immunoinflammatory factors were assessed using the TISIDB database. Peripheral blood RNA sequencing data from our cohort were utilized to validate the expression patterns of EC-related AD key genes in peripheral blood and to investigate their association with cognition. Results: ECs are the most significant contributors to AD among all brain cell subpopulations. For the first time, the EC-related genes EIF1 and HSPA1B were identified as key genes associated with AD progression. These two EC-related key genes may participate in AD pathogenesis by modulating peripheral immunoinflammatory responses. The levels of EIF1 and HSPA1B were significantly altered in the peripheral blood during AD progression, and EIF1 levels correlated with cognitive functions in AD clinical continuum patients. Conclusions: These findings underscore the critical roles of the EC-related genes EIF1 and HSPA1B in AD pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers for this disease.</p>

	<p>Background: Acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) is associated with a high risk of epilepsy, a complication linked to poor outcomes. Craniotomy is a known risk factor, with an epilepsy incidence of approximately 25%. This study evaluated radiomic features from preoperative CT scans to predict epilepsy risk in aSDH patients undergoing craniotomy. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 178 adult aSDH patients treated between 2016 and 2022 identified 64 patients meeting inclusion criteria. Radiomic features (e.g., Feret diameter, elongation, flatness, surface area, and volume) from preoperative CT scans within 24 h of surgery were analyzed alongside clinical factors, including cardiac comorbidities, pupillary response, SOFA score, age, and anticoagulation status. Results: Of the 64 patients, 18 (28%) developed generalized seizures. Univariate analysis showed significant associations with Feret diameter (p = 0.045), elongation (p = 0.005), cardiac comorbidities (p = 0.017), and SOFA score (p = 0.036). ROC analysis showed excellent discriminatory ability for elongation (AUC = 0.82). Multivariate analysis identified elongation as an independent predictor (p = 0.003); elongation &amp;amp;ge; 1.45 increased seizure risk 7.78-fold (OR = 7.778; 95% CI = 1.969&amp;amp;ndash;30.723). Conclusions: Radiomic features, particularly elongation, may help predict epilepsy risk in aSDH patients undergoing craniotomy. Prospective validation is needed.</p>

They establish that actively invading NSCLC leader and follower cells communicate to establish a pro-invasive signature, sustain subpopulation proliferation, and drive tumor progression with TGFB1 identified as a key mediator.

Macaluso et al. show that, while most euploid cells become aneuploid, a small fraction of cells acquires compensatory mutations that are fixed in the population. All mutations restoring growth restore microtubule dynamics, although to varying degrees.

                Competition from high-affinity B cells has long been viewed as an obstacle for low-affinity B cells entering GC responses. However, Li et al. demonstrate, using a multivalent virus-like particle antigen, that low-affinity B cells not only survive but also benefit from competition, with the affinity maturation process accelerated.

">Quantitative evaluation of normal cerebrospinal fluid flow in the Sylvian aqueduct and perivascular spaces of the middle cerebral artery and circle of Willis via 2D phase-contrast MR imaging</a></h4>

              
                Recently, it was proposed that CSF flow constitutes a critical part of the glymphatic system, playing a critical role in various brain abnormalities from Alzheimers disease to hydrocephalus. Thus, measurement of CSF flow has been increasingly used for diagnostic and clinical monitoring purposes. Phase-contrast MRI has been used to determine CSF flow. However, CSF flow in the periarterial spaces of the circle of Willis and the middle cerebral artery which are important conduits remain unexplored. We employed phase-contrast MRI to explore CSF flow along the perivascular spaces of the circle of Willis and the middle cerebral artery to establish baseline parameters of CSF and compare them with the Sylvian aqueduct. To analyze CSF flow in the perivascular space, we developed a new, semi-automated method for outlining the perivascular space and extracting CSF flow parameters. The twenty-four healthy participants were recruited to achieve an even distribution by age (mean: 40 +/- 11) and gender (13 males). We validated our routine for CSF flow measurements by comparing CSF flow in the Sylvian aqueduct (0.00700 mL/s) with the range of literature values, 0.0049-0.0432 mL/s. For all CSF parameters, the circle of Willis and middle cerebral artery were differed from the Sylvian aqueduct. For most CSF flow parameters, the 95% confidence intervals of the circle of Willis and middle cerebral artery overlap. The linear mixed models and general linear mixed models for flow indicate strong effects of the conduits. CSF velocity in these conduits were lower 0.159 cm/s and 0.198 cm/s respectively than in the Sylvian aqueduct. Overall, differences in CSF flow parameters between sex and age groups were negligible. In this study, we have validated our routine and established baseline values of CSF flow along the circle of Willis and the middle cerebral artery as well as highlighted the limited influence of sex and/or age.

">Gene Editing for ATXN3 Inactivation in Machado-Joseph disease: CRISPR-Cas9 as a Therapeutic Alternative to TALEN-Induced Toxicity</a></h4>

              
                Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominantly-inherited neurodegenerative disorder, caused by an over-repetition of the polyglutamine-codifying region in the ATXN3 gene. Strategies based on the suppression of the deleterious gene products have demonstrated promising results in pre-clinical studies. Nonetheless, these strategies do not target the root cause of the disease. In order to prevent the downstream toxic pathways, our goal was to develop gene editing-based strategies to permanently inactivate the human ATXN3 gene. TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9 systems were designed to target exon 2 of this gene and functional characterization was performed in a human cell line. After the demonstration of TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency on gene disruption, a sequence of each system was selected for further in vivo experiments. Although both TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9 systems led to a drastic reduction of ATXN3 aggregates in the striatum of a lentiviral-based mouse model of MJD/SCA3, only CRISPR-Cas9 system allowed the improvement of key neuropathological markers of the disease. Importantly, the administration of the engineered system in YAC-MJD84.2/84.2 mice mediated a delay in disease progression, when compared with non-treated littermates. These data provide the first in vivo evidence of the efficacy of a CRISPR-Cas9-based approach to permanently inactivate the ATXN3 gene in the brain of two mouse models of the disease, supporting its potential as a new therapeutic avenue in the context of MJD/SCA3.

">Genetic and pharmacological correction of impaired mitophagy in retinal ganglion cells rescues glaucomatous neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and degeneration of optic nerve axons are the pathological hallmarks of glaucoma. Ocular hypertension (OHT) and mitochondrial dysfunction are linked to neurodegeneration and vision loss in glaucoma. However, the exact mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction leading to glaucomatous neurodegeneration is poorly understood. Using multiple mouse models of OHT and human eyes from normal and glaucoma donors, we show that OHT induces impaired mitophagy in RGCs, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and contributing to glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Using mitophagy reporter mice, we show that impaired mitophagy precedes glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Notably, the pharmacological rescue of impaired mitophagy via Torin-2 or genetic upregulation of RGC-specific Parkin expression restores the structural and functional integrity of RGCs and their axons in mouse models of glaucoma and ex-vivo human retinal-explant cultures. Our study indicates that impaired mitophagy contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, leading to glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Enhancing mitophagy in RGCs represents a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent glaucomatous neurodegeneration.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This systematic review integrates Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), Educational Neuroscience (EdNeuro), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to examine their combined impact on optimizing learning environments. It explores how AI-driven adaptive learning systems, informed by neurophysiological insights, enhance personalized education for K-12 students and adult learners. This study emphasizes the role of Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), and other neurophysiological tools in assessing cognitive states and guiding AI-powered interventions to refine instructional strategies dynamically. Methods: This study reviews n = 103 papers related to the integration of principles of CLT with AI and ML in educational settings. It evaluates the progress made in neuroadaptive learning technologies, especially the real-time management of cognitive load, personalized feedback systems, and the multimodal applications of AI. Besides that, this research examines key hurdles such as data privacy, ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, and scalability issues while pinpointing best practices for robust and effective implementation. Results: The results show that AI and ML significantly improve Learning Efficacy due to managing cognitive load automatically, providing personalized instruction, and adapting learning pathways dynamically based on real-time neurophysiological data. Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) improve classification accuracy, making AI-powered adaptive learning systems more efficient and scalable. Multimodal approaches enhance system robustness by mitigating signal variability and noise-related limitations by combining EEG with fMRI, Electrocardiography (ECG), and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). Despite these advances, practical implementation challenges remain, including ethical considerations, data security risks, and accessibility disparities across learner demographics. Conclusions: AI and ML are epitomes of redefinition potentials that solid ethical frameworks, inclusive design, and scalable methodologies must inform. Future studies will be necessary for refining pre-processing techniques, expanding the variety of datasets, and advancing multimodal neuroadaptive learning for developing high-accuracy, affordable, and ethically responsible AI-driven educational systems. The future of AI-enhanced education should be inclusive, equitable, and effective across various learning populations that would surmount technological limitations and ethical dilemmas.</p>

	<p>The global rise in mental health-related disorders represents a significant health and wellbeing challenge, imposing a substantial social and economic burden on individuals, communities, and healthcare systems. According to the World Health Organization, one in four people globally will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, highlighting a significant global health concern that warrants carefully considered and innovative responses. While mental health challenges arise from complex, multifaceted factors, emerging research indicates that the built environment&amp;amp;mdash;the architecture of our homes, workplaces, and public spaces&amp;amp;mdash;may exert a critical but underappreciated influence on mental health outcomes. This paper outlines a novel theoretical framework for how visual stressors in the built environment might trigger neurophysiological stress responses via the HPA and SAM axes, potentially contributing over time to allostatic load. In this paper, it is proposed that chronic physiological strain can alter neuroplastic processes and neurogenesis in key brain regions&amp;amp;mdash;such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala&amp;amp;mdash;thereby affecting cognitive health, emotional regulation, and overall mental wellbeing. Drawing on the principle of neurosustainability, this paper suggests that long-term exposure to stress-inducing environments may create feedback loops, particularly involving the amygdala, that have downstream effects on other brain areas and may be linked to adverse mental health outcomes such as depression. By presenting this framework, this paper aims to inspire further inquiry and applied experimental research into the intersection of neurophysiology, mental health, and the built environment, with a particular emphasis on rigorous testing and validation of the proposed mechanisms, that may then be translated into practical architectural design strategies for supporting health and wellbeing. In doing so, it is hoped that this work may contribute to a more holistic approach to improving mental health that integrates the creation of nurturing, resilient spaces into the broader public health agenda.</p>

	<p>Background: Hypermobility Ehlers&amp;amp;ndash;Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a clinical condition characterized by hypermobility and tissue fragility and is associated with chronic pain. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between affect regulation, pain perception, and psychophysical dimensions as well as alexithymic characteristics in the pathological range. Methods: Twenty-five hEDS patients completed a socio-anamnestic questionnaire as well as the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the 36-Item Short Form Survey (psychophysical health), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (affect regulation). Results: Correlational analysis showed several negative significant associations between the SF-36, DERS, and TAS-20. The BPI showed few significant associations with both affect regulation measures. Moreover, a relationship between psychological dimensions and the time since diagnosis emerged. A total of 28% of participants reported TAS-20 scores in the clinical range and 36% reported scores in the borderline area. Discussion: Patients with hEDS seem to show high alexithymia levels; pain seems to interfere with the practical aspects of daily life and may reduce an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s awareness of their emotional capabilities. The perception of heightened pain has a stronger impact on emotional resources when it interferes with affective life than when it interferes with practical life. Finally, delayed diagnoses of hEDS entail psychological consequences such as alexithymia. Conclusions: The present findings highlight the importance of promoting affect regulation capabilities through the implementation of psychological intervention programs for patients suffering from this medical condition.</p>

                <p>The amygdala is believed to make invaluable contributions to visual emotion processing. Yet how this subcortical body contributes to emotion perception across time is contended. Here, we measured differences in the perceptual processing of emotional stimuli after unilateral temporal lobe and amygdala resection (TLR) in humans, using EEG. Through mass univariate analysis of brain activity, we compared responses to fearful and neutral faces (left TLR <I>N</I> = 8, right TLR <I>N</I> = 8, control <I>N</I> = 8), and fearful and neutral bodies (left TLR <I>N</I> = 9, right TLR <I>N</I> = 9, control <I>N</I> = 9). We found that TLR impaired the early-stage perceptual processing of emotional stimuli seen in the control group. Indeed, in controls a heightened responses to fearful faces was found in the 140&ndash;170&nbsp;ms time window, over temporoparietal electrodes. This effect was also present in the left TLR group but disappeared in the right TLR group. For emotional bodies, brain activity was differentially sensitive to fearful stimuli at 90&ndash;120&nbsp;ms in the control group, but this effect was eliminated in both TLR groups. Collectively, these results reveal the amygdala contributes to the early stages of perceptual processing that discriminate emotional stimuli from neutral stimuli. Further, they emphasize the unique role of the right medial temporal structures such as the amygdala in emotional face perception.</p>

                <p>Axons in the mammalian brain show significant diversity in myelination motifs, displaying spatial heterogeneity in sheathing along individual axons and across brain regions. However, its impact on neural signaling and susceptibility to injury remains poorly understood. To address this, we leveraged cable theory and developed model axons replicating the myelin sheath distributions observed experimentally in different regions of the mouse central nervous system. We examined how the spatial arrangement of myelin affects propagation and predisposition to conduction failure in axons with cortical versus callosal myelination motifs. Our results indicate that regional differences in myelination significantly influence conduction timing and signaling reliability. Sensitivity of action potential propagation to the specific positioning, lengths, and ordering of myelinated and exposed segments reveals non-linear and path-dependent conduction. Furthermore, myelination motifs impact signaling vulnerability to demyelination, with callosal motifs being particularly sensitive to myelin changes. These findings highlight the crucial role of myelinating glia in brain function and disease.</p>

                <p>The behavioral interactions between adults and newborns are decisive for the fitness and the survival of offspring across the animal kingdom. In laboratory mice, while virgin females display caregiving behaviors, virgin males are rather neglectful or aggressive toward pups. Despite the importance of these behavioral variations, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Brain regions encoding these behaviors may exhibit sex-dependent functional differences at the baseline. Additionally, these structures might undergo sex-specific plasticity after adults interact with the offspring. Emerging evidence suggests sex-based differences in input connectivity, genetics, and receptor expression of the epithalamic lateral habenula (LHb). Moreover, LHb neuronal activity is instrumental for adult&ndash;newborn interactions. However, whether LHb neuronal function varies between sexes and/or undergoes adaptations following interactions with pups has not been fully investigated. In this study, we used in vivo and ex vivo single-cell electrophysiology to examine the basal LHb neuronal activity of virgin female and male mice. In a second set of experiments, we exposed mice to pups and recapitulated sex-based divergent behaviors. Recordings in acute slices showed no alterations in LHb firing properties, regardless of sex or pup exposure. These findings suggest that, although the LHb participates in adult behaviors toward pups, this is not mediated by sex-dependent functional differences or adaptations in the neuronal firing properties. Thus, this study provides new insights into the neural basis of sex-specific adult&ndash;newborn behaviors and the role of the LHb in these processes.</p>

                Background This study investigated the relationship between preferred bubble speeds in sensory room bubble tubes and physiological–psychological factors, including interoceptive sensitivity, subjective time perception, visual discomfort, and anxiety levels. Methods A sample of 50 participants engaged in a controlled experiment in which they used the method of adjustment to determine their preferred speed of a bubble tube simulated by an upward-moving Random Dot Motion (RDM) stimulus. Subjective time perception was evaluated through a time estimation task in which participants estimated a 60-second interval, and interoceptive sensitivity was measured via a heartbeat-tracking task. Participants’ visual discomfort and anxiety levels were assessed using the Visual Discomfort Scale Japanese Version (VDS-J), Trypophobia Questionnaire Japanese Version (TQ-J), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results The results from the method of adjustment indicated that the preferred speed varied largely, from 1.09 to 13.86 degrees per second. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed that higher interoceptive awareness correlated with a preference for slower speeds, whereas higher anxiety levels correlated with a preference for faster speeds. In addition, our multiple regression analysis showed that subjective time perception accuracy and visual discomfort levels were significant predictors of the participants’ preferred RDM speeds in the regression model. Conclusion The results indicate that interoceptive sensitivity, subjective time, visual discomfort, and anxiety levels play significant roles in determining the preferred speeds for RDM stimulation. Our results highlight the importance of considering individual differences in physiological and psychological states when designing therapeutic sensory environments such as sensory rooms and bubble tubes to enhance well-being and therapeutic outcomes.

                Background The Federalist Society, a leading conservative legal organization, has played a significant role in shaping the American judiciary for decades. Despite its influence, comprehensive empirical data on the organization remains scarce. We address this gap by systematically documenting 20,205 public events hosted by the Society from 1984 to 2024, with substantive coverage from 2007 onward. Methods Following ethical best practices in data collection and ownership, we gathered event metadata—including titles, dates, locations, sponsors, topics, and speakers—via web scraping from the Federalist Society’s archives. The dataset is structured to facilitate analysis of event trends, co-speaking networks, and thematic shifts over time. To ensure data integrity, we performed validation, deduplication, and cleaning, resulting in a well-structured, high-quality dataset. Conclusions This dataset provides an empirical foundation for examining the Federalist Society’s role in legal discourse. It is a resource for scholars in law, political science, sociology, gender studies, network science, and computational social science, enabling investigations into key themes of discussion, event participation patterns, demographic diversity, professional backgrounds, and more.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-212/v1?src=rss"> Open science in Spain: Influence of personal and contextual factors on deposit patterns [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study investigates factors influencing the deposit of academic publications and research data in open access repositories by Spanish researchers. Methods Using survey data from a sample of Spanish academics, the research examines the impact of personal attributes (e.g., gender, age, knowledge of open science) and contextual variables (e.g., academic discipline, institutional type) on deposit behaviours. Quantitative methods, including chi-square tests and regression analysis, reveal significant associations between knowledge of open science and deposit practices. Results Researchers familiar with open science principles were more likely to deposit multiple versions of articles and datasets, albeit with varying intensity. Key findings highlight disciplinary and institutional differences: researchers in Life Sciences and Experimental Sciences showed higher engagement with both article and data deposits, whereas Health Sciences lagged. Gender differences were also observed, with male researchers depositing articles and datasets more frequently than their female counterparts, though age showed limited impact. Public institutions exhibited lower data deposit rates despite mandates supporting open access. Conclusions The study underscores the need for tailored policies, including awareness campaigns, infrastructure investment, and discipline-specific strategies, to promote equitable and widespread adoption of open science practices. Findings contribute to understanding open science implementation, emphasizing the interplay of individual, institutional, and systemic factors.

                We developed a new time-calibrated phylogenetic tree incorporating primarily endemic Ryukyu Islands cicada data, along with some cryptic species, following the recent global cicada studies by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021). A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1.10.4 software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations dating as far back as the Triassic were adopted, largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), with a Quaternary geological event calibration based on Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b), which was input into BEAST v1.10.4. In the COI tree, the crown age of Cicadoidea was estimated at 200.63 Ma. Tettigarctidae was found to be the oldest lineage, sister to all remaining cicadas. Derotettiginae, at 99.2 Ma, is the next oldest lineage, sister to all other monophyletic cicadas. The Tibicininae clade branched at 66.15 Ma, with the subfamilies Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae diverging at a crown age of 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of many tribe and genus-specific clades, with numerous cryptic species emerging due to vicariance and adaptive radiation. We estimated the base substitution rate as a function of age, and the results strongly indicate an exponential increase in substitution rates during recent geological time. This increase in cicada biodiversity, including the generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surrounding regions, may have been driven by the spread of C4 grasses and concurrent Quaternary climate changes.

                Background Musculoskeletal disorders comprise injuries that limit the ability of the human body to move and include elements such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments. They are considered significant problems within the practice of clinical dentistry, arising mainly because of physical overload resulting from dynamic and static activities. The aim of the research was to evaluate the relationship between shoulder, arm, and hand disability and body mass index in dentists. Methods The study was classified as applied research with a non-experimental and correlational design. The sample consisted of 222 private practice´s dentists. A simple random probabilistic sampling was chosen. A questionnaire was considered to collect demographic, occupational, anthropometric, and exercise data. To assess the presence of symptoms of functional disability of the shoulder, arm, and hand, the shortened Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scale (QuickDASH) was used. Results There are differences in shoulder, arm, and hand disability scores among the body mass index classification groups (PR=12.74, 95% CI [9.08; 16.4], p<0.001), even after adjusting for occupational and physical activity variables (PR=10544.08, 95% CI [302.84; 367111.40], p<0.001). Conclusion This study highlights the significant relationship between BMI and functional disability of the shoulder, arm, and hand in dental surgeons, emphasizing the need for preventive strategies focused on weight management and the promotion of physical activity.

Biological and dynamic mechanisms by which Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells contribute to the development of acquired drug resistance have not been fully elucidated. Here, by integrating multidimensional data from drug-treated PC9 cells, we developed a novel multiscale mathematical model from an evolutionary perspective that encompasses epigenetic and cellular population dynamics. By coupling stochastic simulation with quantitative analysis, we identified epigenetic instability as the most prominent kinetic feature related to the emergence of DTP cell subpopulations and the effectiveness of intermittent treatment. Moreover, we revealed the optimal schedule for intermittent treatment, including the optimal area for therapeutic time and drug holidays. By leveraging single-cell RNA-seq data characterizing the drug tolerance of lung cancer, we validated the predictions made by our model and further revealed previously unrecognized biological features of DTP cells, such as cell autophagy and migration, as well as new biomarker genes of therapeutic tolerance. Our work not only provides a paradigm for the integration of multiscale mathematical models with newly emerging genomics data but also improves our understanding of the crucial roles of DTP cells and offers guidance for developing new intermittent treatment strategies against acquired drug resistance in cancer.

Research lab groups are hotspots for the education of the next generation of scientists, and making these units work as creatively as possible is essential for solving pressing issues in biology, the environment, and beyond. This article highlights 10 points that can help make labs as creative as possible. Several of these points are about setting up a creative lab culture; others are about fostering group-level creative output, some are more about encouraging creativity of individual team members, or both. While the head of a research group, the principal investigator, plays an important role, this can only be successful in healthy labs where everyone contributes.

                <p>by Wenxuan Li, Xu Chen, Suli Liu, Chiyu Zhang, Guyue Liu</p>

With the ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its increasing adaptation to humans, several variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) have been identified since late 2020. These include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron parent lineage, and other variants. These variants may show distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, which require specific defense and control measures. In this study, we propose an SI1…InR infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population. We combine the proposed epidemic model and reported infected data of variants with physical information neural networks (PINNs) to develop a novel mechanism called VOCs-informed neural network (VOCs-INN). In our experiments, we found that this algorithm can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia (BC) province and its five internal health agencies in Canada. Furthermore, it can simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. The experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across these regions. VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data.

                <p>by Christina Y. Lee, Sina Bonakdar, Kelly B. Arnold</p>

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition characterized by a shift in vaginal microbiome composition that is linked to negative reproductive outcomes and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections. Despite the commonality of BV, standard-of-care antibiotics provide limited control of recurrent BV episodes and development of new biotherapies is limited by the lack of controlled models needed to evaluate new dosing and treatment regimens. Here, we develop an <i>in silico</i> framework to evaluate selection criteria for potential probiotic strains, test adjunctive therapy with antibiotics, and alternative dosing strategies. This computational framework highlighted the importance of resident microbial species on the efficacy of hypothetical probiotic strains, identifying specific interaction parameters between resident non-optimal anaerobic bacteria (nAB) and <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. with candidate probiotic strains as a necessary selection criterion. Model predictions were able to replicate results from a recent phase 2b clinical trial for the live biotherapeutic product, Lactin-V, demonstrating the relevance of the <i>in silico</i> platform. Results from the computational model support that the probiotic strain in Lactin-V requires adjunctive antibiotic therapy to be effective, and that increasing the dosing frequency of the probiotic could have a moderate impact on BV recurrence at 12 and 24 weeks. Altogether, this framework could provide evidence for the rational selection of probiotic strains and help optimize dosing frequency or adjunctive therapies.

<p>COMPLEX CELLS, COMPLEX CIRCUITS: We found great diversity of synaptic motifs in the lobula tree of crabs’ giant neurons, MLG1. They acted both as presynaptic and postsynaptic partners. The dendritic arbor seems compartmentalized, with primary and secondary branches participating in different functions.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Arthropods are diverse, abundant, successful animals that exploit all available ecological niches. They sense the environment, move, interact with prey/predators/conspecifics, learn, and so forth using small brains with five orders of magnitude less neurons than mammals. Hence, these brains need to be efficient in information processing. One distinct aspect is the presence of large, easily identifiable single neurons that act as functional units for information processing integrating a high volume of information from different sources to guide behavior. To understand the synaptic organization behind these high-integration nodes research on suitable neurons is needed. The lobula giant neurons (LGs) found in the third optic neuropil, the lobula, of semiterrestrial crabs <i>Neohelice granulata</i> respond to moving stimuli, integrate information from both eyes, and show short- and long-term plasticity. They are thought to be key elements in the visuomotor transformation guiding escape responses to approaching objects. One subgroup, the MLG1 (monostratified LG type 1), is composed of 16 elements that have very wide main branches and a regular arrangement in a deep layer of the lobula which allows their identification even in unstained preparations. Here, we describe the types and abundance of synaptic contacts involving MLG1 profiles using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We found an unexpected diversity of synaptic motifs and an apparent compartmentalization of the dendritic arbor in two domains where MLG1s act predominantly as presynaptic or postsynaptic, respectively. We propose that the variety of contact types found in the dendritic arbor of the MLG1s reflects the multiple circuits in which these cells are involved. Regarding the detection of approaching objects, the distinctive input contact motifs shared by lobula giant neurons in crabs and locusts suggest a similar organization of the collision-detecting pathways in both species.</p>

                Background Hybrid nanofluids, consisting of two distinct nanoparticles dispersed in a base fluid, are widely used in industries requiring enhanced heat and mass transfer, such as cooling systems and heat exchangers. These fluids improve thermal conductivity and fluid dynamics, leading to better heat management and energy efficiency. This study investigates the combined effects of non-linear thermal radiation, Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass fluxes, and other factors on the three-dimensional flow, heat, and mass transfer of a Williamson hybrid nanofluid. The flow occurs over a stretching porous sheet subjected to an external magnetic field, Joule heating, chemical reactions, and heat generation. Methods Copper (Cu) and aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) nanoparticles are suspended in ethylene glycol (C₂C₆O₂) to form the hybrid nanofluid. The governing partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations and solved numerically with MATLAB’s bvp4c solver. The study examines various parameters, including stretching ratio, nanoparticle volume fraction, and relaxation times for concentration and thermal effects. Results are validated against existing literature. Results The findings reveal that a higher stretching ratio reduces velocity, temperature, concentration profiles, and local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, while also lowering skin friction and secondary velocity. Increasing nanoparticle volume fraction decreases velocity and temperature profiles but enhances skin friction, local Nusselt, and Sherwood numbers. Concentration profiles decline with higher concentration relaxation time, while temperature increases with longer thermal relaxation time. Conclusions In conclusion, Cu−Al₂O₃/C₂C₆O₂ hybrid nanofluids demonstrate superior heat and mass transfer capabilities compared to mono-nanofluids. The performance is significantly influenced by parameters such as nanoparticle volume fraction, relaxation times, and the stretching ratio, providing valuable insights for heat and mass transfer applications.

                Background Increased awareness of sustainability has renewed academic interest in understanding perception. The objective was to determine the expected behavior among university students concerning air quality mitigation. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used as a theoretical framework to understand students’ attitudes toward air quality mitigation along with subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Method This study uses the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to provide an understanding of current studies regarding the aspect of air quality and behavior from databases reviewed by experts. The research highlights the gap in the current study area and provides a need for more detailed empirical research. Result The study reviewed 24 articles and proposed a conceptual model based on the TPB framework to understand the means of air quality mitigation behaviors in a campus environment. Conclusion This model aims to guide future research to improve air quality in higher education institutions. The findings also focuses on theoretical contributions by applying TPB.

                Background Awareness of COS development and use among Chinese researchers has increased since the concept was introduced in China in 2012. An increasing number of COS have been registered and completed by Chinese developers. The status of relevant COS research led by Chinese researchers and their quality remains unclear. Methods An electronic search will be conducted in the COMET, ChiCOS, and Chinese literature databases (CNKI, WanFang, and SinoMed). According to different study types (registration entry, protocol, or completed research), the information of the included studies will be extracted into different Excel tables. The extracted information depends on the type of study. The findings of the review will be presented descriptively. For protocol, we will check the quality with COS-STAP. For completed research, we will check the quality with COS-STAR and COS-STAD. In addition, we will conduct a comparative analysis to determine how many entries in the ChiCOS database have not been registered in the COMET database. Discussion This study will provide valuable insights into the current state of COS in China. This is essential for a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators to COS development and application. Study registration This research is registered in Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/3277.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We analyzed the genotypic and phenotypic features of patients with psychosis of epilepsy (POE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with POE recruited to an epilepsy genetics research program underwent phenotyping and genetic analysis. The latter included screening for rare pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes, and polygenic risk score (PRS) calculation for common risk variants associated with schizophrenia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred twenty-two individuals with POE were identified. Eighty-six of 122 of the individuals (70%) had interictal psychosis, with schizophrenia the most common interictal phenotype (36/86, 42%). Twenty-eight of 122 of the individuals (23%) had postictal psychosis (PIP), 2 of 122 of the individuals (2%) had antiseizure medication-induced psychosis, and 6 of 122 of the individuals (5%) had substance-induced psychosis. Focal epilepsies were more frequently associated with PIP (24/28, 86%) compared to interictal psychosis (39/86, 45%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twenty-nine percent of the patients with POE with genetic data had a rare pathogenic variant: 19 in an epilepsy gene (<i>PCDH19</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>KCNT1</i>, <i>CHD2</i>, <i>SLC2A1</i>, <i>NPRL3</i>, <i>CLN3</i>, <i>NPRL3</i>, <i>ATP1A3</i>, and <i>CACNA1A</i>) and 4 had a chromosomal anomaly. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with a rare pathogenic variant had interictal schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder rather than PIP (9%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). PRSs showed that schizophrenia-related common risk variants were enriched in patients with POE compared to population controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0007), however, among the POE phenotypes, a raised PRS was only observed in interictal schizophrenia (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and not in those with PIP or other interictal POEs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Interictal POE is threefold more common than PIP, and more likely to be associated with both rare pathogenic variants for epilepsy and common risk variants for schizophrenia. Distinguishing between different POE phenotypes enhances clinical practice and our understanding of etiology, paving the way for precision medicine. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Rapid advances in transcriptomics have driven efforts to identify deregulated pathways in multiple sclerosis (MS) tissues, though many detected differentially expressed genes are likely false positives, with only a small fraction reflecting actual pathological events. Robust, integrative methods are essential for accurately understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying MS pathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a gene prioritization analysis of MS white matter pathology transcriptomic studies. Articles were sought in Scopus and PubMed up to July 31, 2024. Potentially eligible publications were those that provided either transcriptomics datasets (deposited in GEO) or lists of differentially expressed genes comparing MS white matter to control white matter.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Applying a vote-count strategy to search for the intersection of genes reported in multiple independent studies with a consistent fold-change direction, followed by a Monte Carlo simulation, we identified 528 highly significant differentially expressed multi-study genes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; 10,000 simulations). Functional enrichment analysis revealed deregulation of the folate pathway in MS normal-appearing white matter, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related and complement-related pathways in active and chronic active lesions, respectively. Network analysis identified 6 key signaling hubs: PTPRC, HLA-B, MYC, MMP2, COL11A2, MAG. The major nodes identified revealed mechanistic concordance with published in vivo MS models, supporting their value as potential therapeutic targets.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our strategy provides a robust framework for integrating gene expression data, effectively identifying the intricate pathways altered in human diseased tissues. This method holds potential for translating findings into drug development strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Early protein malnutrition has been shown to affect the brain reward circuitry, leading to enduring molecular, neurochemical, and behavioral alterations. This study explored how maternal protein restriction contributes to anhedonia, a key depression symptom, focusing on the hippocampal BDNF–TrkB signaling and structural plasticity changes in the CA1 subregion of the dorsal hippocampus (DH). To achieve our goal, adult rats submitted to a protein restriction schedule from the 14th day of gestation up to 30 days of age (PR-rats) were subjected to the sucrose preference test (SPT) and compared with animals fed a normoprotein diet. Immediately after SPT, we assessed the levels of BDNF and its receptor TrkB and structural plasticity changes. Interestingly, PR-rats showed a significant decrease in sucrose preference. Furthermore, perinatal protein-restriction-induced anhedonia correlated with decreased BDNF and p-TrkB levels in the DH, alongside reduced dendritic spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons, particularly mature spines (i.e., stubby and mushroom spines). These findings suggest that decreased hippocampal BDNF–TrkB signaling accompanied by structural remodeling in the CA1 pyramidal neurons may contribute to the reduced ability of undernourished animals to respond to rewarding stimuli, increasing their vulnerability to anhedonia later in life.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99971">fmo-4 promotes longevity and stress resistance via ER to mitochondria calcium regulation in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a conserved family of xenobiotic enzymes upregulated in multiple longevity interventions, including nematode and mouse models. Previous work supports that <i>C. elegans fmo-2</i> promotes longevity, stress resistance, and healthspan by rewiring endogenous metabolism. However, there are five <i>C. elegans</i> FMOs and five mammalian FMOs, and it is not known whether promoting longevity and health benefits is a conserved role of this gene family. Here, we report that expression of <i>C. elegans fmo-4</i> promotes lifespan extension and paraquat stress resistance downstream of both dietary restriction and inhibition of mTOR. We find that overexpression of <i>fmo-4</i> in just the hypodermis is sufficient for these benefits, and that this expression significantly modifies the transcriptome. By analyzing changes in gene expression, we find that genes related to calcium signaling are significantly altered downstream of <i>fmo-4</i> expression. Highlighting the importance of calcium homeostasis in this pathway, <i>fmo-4</i> overexpressing animals are sensitive to thapsigargin, an ER stressor that inhibits calcium flux from the cytosol to the ER lumen. This calcium/<i>fmo-4</i> interaction is solidified by data showing that modulating intracellular calcium with either small molecules or genetics can change expression of <i>fmo-4</i> and/or interact with <i>fmo-4</i> to affect lifespan and stress resistance. Further analysis supports a pathway where <i>fmo-4</i> modulates calcium homeostasis downstream of activating transcription factor-6 (<i>atf-6</i>), whose knockdown induces and requires <i>fmo-4</i> expression. Together, our data identify <i>fmo-4</i> as a longevity-promoting gene whose actions interact with known longevity pathways and calcium homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100394">Specific presynaptic functions require distinct Drosophila Cav2 splice isoforms</a></h4>

              
                At many vertebrate synapses, presynaptic functions are tuned by expression of different Ca<sub>v</sub>2 channels. Most invertebrate genomes contain only one <i>Ca<sub>v</sub>2</i> gene. The <i>Drosophila</i> Ca<sub>v</sub>2 homolog, cacophony (cac), induces synaptic vesicle release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). We hypothesize that <i>Drosophila</i> cac functional diversity is enhanced by two mutually exclusive exon pairs that are not conserved in vertebrates, one in the voltage sensor and one in the loop binding Ca<sub>β</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> subunits. We find that alternative splicing in the voltage sensor affects channel activation voltage. Only the isoform with the higher activation voltage localizes to AZs at the glutamatergic <i>Drosophila</i> larval neuromuscular junction and is imperative for normal synapse function. By contrast, alternative splicing at the other alternative exon pair tunes multiple aspects of presynaptic function. While expression of one exon yields normal transmission, expression of the other reduces channel number in the AZ and thus release probability. This also abolishes presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Moreover, reduced channel number affects short-term plasticity, which is rescued by increasing the external calcium concentration to match release probability to control. In sum, in <i>Drosophila</i> alternative splicing provides a mechanism to regulate different aspects of presynaptic functions with only one <i>Ca<sub>v</sub>2</i> gene.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100820">T3SS translocon induces pyroptosis by direct interaction with NLRC4/NAIP inflammasome</a></h4>

              
                Type III secretion system (T3SS) is a virulence apparatus existing in many bacterial pathogens. Structurally, T3SS consists of the base, needle, tip, and translocon. The NLRC4 inflammasome is the major receptor for T3SS needle and basal rod proteins. Whether other T3SS components are recognized by NLRC4 is unclear. In this study, using <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> as a model intracellular pathogen, we examined T3SS−inflammasome interaction and its effect on cell death. <i>E. tarda</i> induced pyroptosis in a manner that required the bacterial translocon and the host inflammasome proteins of NLRC4, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1/4. The translocon protein EseB triggered NLRC4/NAIP-mediated pyroptosis by binding NAIP via its C-terminal region, particularly the terminal 6 residues (T6R). EseB homologs exist widely in T3SS-positive bacteria and share high identities in T6R. Like <i>E. tarda</i> EseB, all of the representatives of the EseB homologs exhibited T6R-dependent NLRC4 activation ability. Together these results revealed the function and molecular mechanism of EseB to induce host cell pyroptosis and suggested a highly conserved inflammasome-activation mechanism of T3SS translocon in bacterial pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98280">Sleep need driven oscillation of glutamate synaptic phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Sleep loss increases AMPA-synaptic strength and number in the neocortex. However, this is only part of the synaptic sleep loss response. We report an increased AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio in frontal-cortical pyramidal neurons of layers 2–3. Silent synapses are absent, decreasing the plastic potential to convert silent NMDA to active AMPA synapses. These sleep loss changes are recovered by sleep. Sleep genes are enriched for synaptic shaping cellular components controlling glutamate synapse phenotype, overlap with autism risk genes, and are primarily observed in excitatory pyramidal neurons projecting intra-telencephalically. These genes are enriched with genes controlled by the transcription factor, MEF2c, and its repressor, HDAC4. Sleep genes can thus provide a framework within which motor learning and training occur mediated by the sleep-dependent oscillation of glutamate-synaptic phenotypes.

                <i>Plasmodium</i> sporozoites are inoculated into the skin during the bite of an infected mosquito. This motile stage invades cutaneous blood vessels to reach the liver and infect hepatocytes. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) on the sporozoite surface is an important antigen targeted by protective antibodies (Abs) in immunoprophylaxis or elicited by vaccination. Antibody-mediated protection mainly unfolds during parasite skin migration, but rare and potent protective Abs additionally neutralize sporozoite in the liver. Here, using a rodent malaria model, microscopy and bioluminescence imaging, we show a late-neutralizing effect of 3D11 anti-CSP monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the liver. The need for several hours to eliminate parasites in the liver was associated with an accumulation of 3D11 effects, starting with the inhibition of sporozoite motility, sinusoidal extravasation, cell invasion, and terminating with the parasite killing inside the invaded cell. This late-neutralizing activity could be helpful to identify more potent therapeutic mAbs with stronger activity in the liver.

">Deep Sound Synthesis Reveals Novel Category-Defining Sound Features in the Human Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The human auditory system extracts meaning from the environment by transforming acoustic input signals into semantic categories. Specific acoustic features give rise to distinct categorical percepts, such as speech or music, and to spatially distinct preferential responses in the auditory cortex. These responses contain category-relevant information, yet their representational level and role within the acoustic-to-semantic transformation process remain unclear. We combined neuroimaging, a deep neural network, a brain-based sound synthesis, and psychophysics to identify the sound features that are internally represented in the speech- and music-selective human auditory cortex and test their functional role in sound categorization. We found that the synthetized sounds exhibit unnatural features distinct from those normally associated with speech and music, yet they elicit categorical cortical and behavioral responses resembling those of natural speech and music. Our findings provide new insights into the fundamental sound features underlying speech and music categorization in the human auditory cortex.

">Decoding auditory working memory load from EEG alpha oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) enables temporary retention of task-relevant information for imminent use. Increases in visual WM load are accompanied by elevated contralateral delay activity (CDA), and EEG alpha-band power. While most WM research focuses on the visual domain, it remains unknown whether similar EEG responses also reflect WM load in the auditory domain. Using EEG, we set out to establish such neuro-markers of auditory WM load. Participants memorized the pitches of 1 to 4 pure tones presented to one ear, with 1 to 4 consistent distractor tones presented to the other ear. Behaviorally, auditory WM capacity plateaued between set-sizes two and three. Unlike for visual WM, auditory WM load was not reflected in lateralized EEG responses. This shows that the CDA is a vision-specific rather than domain-general neuro-marker of WM load. Applying multivariate pattern analyses on the delay activity revealed that auditory WM load is reflected in (mostly temporal) patterns of alpha-band oscillations. Surprisingly, a temporal generalization analysis revealed that the alpha patterns reflecting specific load conditions changed throughout the maintenance period (despite load being inherently constant), revealing dynamic coding of auditory WM load.

">Connectome-seq: High-throughput Mapping of Neuronal Connectivity at Single-Synapse Resolution via Barcode Sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neuronal connectivity at single-cell resolution remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, with current methods particularly limited in mapping long-distance circuits and preserving cell type information. Here we present Connectome-seq, a high-throughput method that combines engineered synaptic proteins, RNA barcoding, and parallel single-nucleus and single-synaptosome sequencing to map neuronal connectivity at single-synapse resolution. This AAV-based approach enables simultaneous capture of both synaptic connections and molecular identities of connected neurons. We validated this approach in the mouse pontocerebellar circuit, identifying both established projections and potentially novel synaptic partnerships. Through integrated analysis of connectivity and gene expression, we identified molecular markers enriched in connected neurons, suggesting potential determinants of circuit organization. By enabling systematic mapping of neuronal connectivity across brain regions with single-cell precision and gene expression information, Connectome-seq provides a scalable platform for comprehensive circuit analysis across different experimental conditions and biological states. This advance in connectivity mapping methodology opens new possibilities for understanding circuit organization in complex mammalian brains.

">Neurons in auditory cortex integrate information within constrained temporal windows that are invariant to the stimulus context and information rate</a></h4>

              
                Much remains unknown about the computations that allow animals to flexibly integrate across multiple timescales in natural sounds. One key question is whether multiscale integration is accomplished by diverse populations of neurons, each of which integrates information within a constrained temporal window, or whether individual units effectively integrate across many different temporal scales depending on the information rate. Here, we show that responses from neurons throughout the ferret auditory cortex are nearly completely unaffected by sounds falling beyond a time-limited "integration window". This window varies substantially across cells within the auditory cortex (~15 to ~150 ms), increasing substantially from primary to non-primary auditory cortex across all cortical layers, but is unaffected by the information rate of sound. These results indicate that multiscale computation is predominantly accomplished by diverse and hierarchically organized neural populations, each of which integrates information within a highly constrained temporal window.

	<p>Growth mindset, which asserts that intelligence and abilities can be cultivated through effort and learning, has garnered substantial attention in psychological and educational research. While the psychological and behavioral impacts of growth mindset are well-established, the underlying neural mechanisms remain relatively underexplored. Furthermore, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews synthesizing the neural evidence on growth mindset, hindering a fuller understanding of this concept. This scoping review aims to synthesize existing empirical studies on the neural mechanisms of growth mindset, focusing on research objectives, methods, and participant characteristics. A total of 15 studies were reviewed, revealing six primary research objectives: (1) neural mechanisms of error and feedback processing, (2) domain-specific mindsets, (3) neural changes resulting from mindset interventions, (4) mindsets and grit, (5) the neuroanatomy of mindsets, and (6) neural mechanisms of stereotype violation, with error and feedback processing being the most frequently investigated. Ten of the 15 studies employed EEG, while other techniques included structural MRI, task-based fMRI, and resting-state fMRI, with the majority of research focusing on adult populations. Although the existing literature offers valuable insights, further research is needed to explore additional aspects of mindsets, particularly in children, and to refine the methodologies used to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying growth mindset.</p>

	<p>Current standard of care treatment for patients with spine tumors includes multidisciplinary approaches, including the following: (1) surgical tumor debulking, epidural spinal cord decompression, and spine stabilization techniques; (2) systemic chemo/targeted therapies; (3) radiation therapy; and (4) surveillance imaging for local disease control and recurrence. Titanium pedicle screw and rod fixation have become commonplace in the spine surgeon&amp;amp;rsquo;s armamentarium for the stabilization of the spine following tumor resection and separation surgery. However, the high degree of imaging artifacts seen with titanium implants on postoperative CT and MRI scans can significantly hinder the accurate delineation of vertebral anatomy and adjacent neurovascular structures to allow for the safe and effective planning of downstream radiation therapies and detection of disease recurrence. Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) spine implants have emerged as a promising alternative to titanium due to the lack of artifact signals on CT and MRI, allowing for more accurate and safe postoperative radiation planning. In this article, we review the tenants of the surgical and radiation management of spine tumors and discuss the safety, efficacy, and current limitations of CFR-PEEK spine implants in the multidisciplinary management of spine oncology patients.</p>

	<p>Statistical learning (SL), the ability to extract patterns from the environment, has been assumed to play a central role in whole cognition, particularly in language acquisition. Evidence has been gathered, however, from behavioral experiments relying on simplified artificial languages, raising doubts on the generalizability of these results to natural contexts. Here, we tested if SL is affected by the composition of the speech streams by expositing participants to auditory streams containing either four nonsense words presenting a transitional probability (TP) of 1 (unmixed high-TP condition), four nonsense words presenting TPs of 0.33 (unmixed low-TP condition) or two nonsense words presenting a TP of 1, and two of a TP of 0.33 (mixed condition); first under incidental (implicit), and, subsequently, under intentional (explicit) conditions to further ascertain how prior knowledge modulates the results. Electrophysiological and behavioral data were collected from the familiarization and test phases of each of the SL tasks. Behavior results revealed reliable signs of SL for all the streams, even though differences across stream conditions failed to reach significance. The neural results revealed, however, facilitative processing of the mixed over the unmixed low-TP and the unmixed high-TP conditions in the N400 and P200 components, suggesting that moderate levels of entropy boost SL.</p>

	<p>Aside from its immediate traumatic effects, spinal cord injury (SCI) presents multiple secondary complications that can be harmful to those who have been affected by SCI. Among these secondary effects, gut dysbiosis (GD) and the activation of the NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) like receptor-family pyrin-domain-containing three (NLRP3) inflammasome are of special interest for their roles in impacting mental health. Studies have found that the state of the gut microbiome is thrown into disarray after SCI, providing a chance for GD to occur. Metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and a variety of neurotransmitters produced by the gut microbiome are hampered by GD. This disrupts healthy cognitive processes and opens the door for SCI patients to be impacted by mental health disorders. Additionally, some studies have found an increased presence and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its respective parts in SCI patients. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can initiate and eventually aggravate mental health disorders after SCI. In addition to the mechanisms of GD and the NLRP3 inflammasome in intensifying mental health disorders after SCI, this review article further focuses on three promising treatments: fecal microbiome transplants, phytochemicals, and melatonin. Studies have found these treatments to be effective in combating the pathogenic mechanisms of GD and NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as alleviating the symptoms these complications may have on mental health. Another area of focus of this review article is exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to support treatments. AI models have already been developed to track changes in the gut microbiome, simulate drug-gut interactions, and design novel anti-NLRP3 inflammasome peptides. While these are promising, further research into the applications of AI for the treatment of mental health disorders in SCI is needed.</p>

	<p>Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of discharge against medical advice (DAMA) among schizophrenia patients in Germany and to identify factors associated with the risk of DAMA. Methods: This multicenter cross-sectional study was based on data from the IQVIA hospital database, which contains records from 36 hospitals across Germany. This study included all hospitalizations for patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of schizophrenia between January 2019 and December 2023. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, primary or secondary schizophrenia diagnosis, as well as codiagnoses, were conducted to assess the associations between demographic and clinical variables and DAMA. Results: A total of 7663 hospitalization cases (mean age: 49.5 years, 40.6% female) were included in the study. The DAMA rate was 31.1% in patients with schizophrenia as the primary diagnoses and 6.0% in patients with schizophrenia as a secondary diagnosis. Younger age (i.e., adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 7.44; 95% CI: 4.35&amp;amp;ndash;12.73 in the age group 18&amp;amp;ndash;30; aOR: 6.63; 95% CI: 3.89&amp;amp;ndash;11.29 in the age group 31&amp;amp;ndash;40; aOR: 5.59; 95% CI: 3.28&amp;amp;ndash;9.54 in the age group 41&amp;amp;ndash;50), schizophrenia as the primary diagnosis (aOR: 3.61; 95% CI: 3.05&amp;amp;ndash;4.26), alcohol-related disorders (aOR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.38&amp;amp;ndash;2.04), and cannabis-related disorders (aOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.18&amp;amp;ndash;1.72) were significantly associated with an increased risk of DAMA. Conclusions: This study highlights the high prevalence of DAMA among hospitalized schizophrenia patients and identifies the important factors (i.e., younger age, alcohol-related disorders, and cannabis-related disorders) associated with DAMA risk. Additional studies are recommended for further exploration into the reasons for DAMA.</p>

	<p>Most brain development occurs in the &amp;amp;ldquo;first 1000 days&amp;amp;rdquo;, a critical period from conception to a child&amp;amp;rsquo;s second birthday. Critical brain processes that occur during this time include synaptogenesis, myelination, neural pruning, and the formation of functioning neuronal circuits. Perturbations during the first 1000 days likely contribute to later-life neurodegenerative disease, including sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neurodevelopment is determined by many events, including the maturation and colonization of the infant microbiome and its metabolites, specifically neurotransmitters, immune modulators, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids. Successful microbiome maturation and gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis function depend on maternal factors (stress and exposure to toxins during pregnancy), mode of delivery, quality of the postnatal environment, diet after weaning from breast milk, and nutritional deficiencies. While the neonatal microbiome is highly plastic, it remains prone to dysbiosis which, once established, may persist into adulthood, thereby inducing the development of chronic inflammation and abnormal excitatory/inhibitory balance, resulting in neural excitation. Both are recognized as key pathophysiological processes in the development of ALS.</p>

	<p>Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a substantial burden for psychiatric care, affecting approximately one-third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Adolescent populations with depression are a particularly challenging demographic to treat as early intervention is crucial to prevent treatment resistance, but treatment options are limited. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive option for TRD in adults as well as adolescents, offering hope for patients who have not responded to conventional therapies. This review examines the convergence of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a tool to examine how TMS modulates functional connectivity in adolescents with MDD. Such analyses have led to advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD, TRD, and the mechanisms of TMS. We review this evidence, evaluate methodological approaches, and identify critical gaps in the existing literature, highlighting how neuroimaging-guided TMS protocols offer a promising therapeutic avenue for adolescent TRD, particularly in cases where conventional treatments have proven ineffective.</p>

                Background Pain management during the vaccination of infants is a challenge for healthcare professionals. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Helfer skin tap technique on pain among infants undergoing intramuscular vaccination. Methods This study adopted a randomized controlled trial with a post-test control design. It was conducted in the Immunization clinic, Pediatric department of Pradyumna Bal Memorial Hospital, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. A total of 62 infants participated in this study, with 31 each in the experimental and control groups. By random allocation, participants were randomized to an experimental group that received the Helfer skin tap technique. The control group received the standard injection technique during Penta or Hexaxim intramuscular vaccination. Data was collected using a self-structured questionnaire and the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) The Outcome Variables were pain level in terms of cry, facial expression, breathing patterns, positioning of arms and legs, and state of arousal. Results Significant changes were observed in the mean pain score of the control group (6.55 ± 1.028) and experimental group (5.52 ± 1.411), with a mean difference of 1.032 and a p-value of 0.002. In addition to this, 29% of infants in the experimental group experienced the worst pain, compared to 74.2% of infants in the control group. Conclusion According to study results, the Helfer skin tapping was successful in lowering pain thresholds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-204/v1?src=rss">Towards Enhanced Healthcare: A Mixed Methods Exploration of Responsiveness in Gamo Gofa Zone Hospitals, Southern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Assessing health service responsiveness is crucial for evaluating a health system’s ability to address non-health related aspects of care. This study aimed to assess the responsiveness of inpatient and outpatient services and identify influencing factors in Gamo Gofa zone hospitals, southern Ethiopia from March 2011 to June 2013. Methods A mixed methods approach was employed, involving systematic random sampling for surveys and purposive sampling for focus group discussions. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, mean score calculations, principal component analysis, and regression analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted on the transcribed qualitative data, which were triangulated with the quantitative findings. Results A survey of 419 individuals and focus group discussions with 72 participants revealed disparities in responsiveness. Dignity and confidentiality were rated high, while basic amenities for inpatients and prompt attention to outpatients were notably lacking. Principal component analysis identified patient-centered communication, patient-centered care environments, and prompt attention as key factors underlying responsiveness. The qualitative findings emphasized healthcare providers’ time insensitivity, inadequate facilities, and limited patient involvement in decision-making. Conclusion This study highlights significant gaps in health service responsiveness in Gamo Gofa zone hospitals. Interventions targeting deficiencies in patient-centered communication, patient- centered care environment and prompt attention can enhance healthcare quality and patient-centeredness. Addressing these areas is critical for improving the overall patient experience.

                Background This study was primarily intended to validate a comprehensive and psychometrically acceptable measure of students’ propensity to cheat (PTC) behavior among undergraduate students in Ethiopian universities by assessing their engagement in different types of cheating behavior. Methods The present study employed an explanatory research design using a questionnaire based on the Propensity to Cheat Scale (PCS). The questionnaire was administered to 500 university students (male = 367 [73.4%]; female = 133 [26.6%]) selected from three Ethiopian public universities between November and January 2022. In order to measure the underlying variables of propensity towards cheating, a factor model is developed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the students’ perceived PTC. The internal consistency of the PTC scale was assessed using reliability analysis, and validity evaluations were conducted to confirm the scale’s discriminant and convergent validity. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results revealed a good fit to the data, and the internal consistency of the PCS was found to be strong, providing a reliable measure of students’ propensity for cheating. Validity evaluations, including discriminant validity and convergent validity, confirmed the validity of the scale. The average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability values also supported the scale’s convergent validity. The multidimensional concept of the PTC was supported by a four-factor solution consisting of 26 reliable and valid items. Conclusion The findings of the study demonstrate that the scale has also provided sufficient evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. By establishing discriminant and convergent validity, as well as reliability, through different validation procedures, the study has provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the PCS as an instrument for determining whether university students are likely to engage in cheating behavior.

                Background Current treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) mainly focused on treating symptoms. Exosome from Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (Ad-MSC) have been shown to delay degenerative process. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, radiological and histological impact of combined intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) and exosome Ad-MSCs in-vivo using a larger animal model with low-grade OA. Methods Eighteen male Ovies aries sheep underwent total lateral meniscectomy and conventional radiography was performed to confirm low-grade OA after 6 weeks. The sheep were divided into three groups, Group 1 (G1; n=6) received thrice exosome injections, G2 (n=6) received twice HA injection, and G3 (n=6) received both treatments with a 1-week interval after 10 days of meniscectomy. Clinical evaluations were conducted using the Clinical Lameness Score (CLS), radiographic with X-ray using OA score by Innes et al, while macroscopic evaluation by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Results Lameness parameter scored lowest in G3 significantly (2.0±0.0 VS 2.7±0.52 VS 2.7±0.52; p=0.024) at the second month although the overall CLS score did not significantly differ at the 3rd month. The best improvement of conventional total OA radiographic score at the 3rd month compared to all groups (5.2±1.17 vs 6.3±0.82 vs 6.7±1.03; p=0.053). Macroscopic OARSI evaluation showed no difference (p=0.711). Conclusions Combined repeated exosome Ad-MSC and HA IA injection proven to delay OA progression, however longer duration of follow up is required to evaluate its long-term effect.

                Background Poverty remained pervasive in affecting households particularly in developing countries like Ethiopia. Purpose The main target of this study was to estimate the multidimensional poverty index of households in Debre Tabor city along with the analysis of determinants of multidimensional poverty. Method The researchers selected 394 households from six Kebeles using a stratified random sampling technique. The Alkire and Foster dual cut-off method of measuring poverty was employed to estimate the multidimensional poverty index and ordered logistic regression was used to analyze the effects of determinants of multidimensional poverty. Five dimensions of poverty namely, income, education, health, living standards, and energy use were incorporated in measuring it. Results and conclusion The result revealed that 59% of households were multidimensional poor with a poverty cut-off of 33%. The multidimensional poor households were underprivileged in 54% of weighted indicators. The energy use dimension was a serious contributor to the incidence and severity of multidimensional poverty. In addition, poverty incidence by illiterate-headed household heads, with single marital status, and casual wage worker-headed households was higher relative to their counterparts. Policy recommendation We strongly recommended that education must be extensively provided not only to children but also to adults; females must be promoted to participate in business activities, credit must be expanded with an excellent follow-up, and households should participate in existing cooperatives.

                Background Pregnant women are a nutritionally vulnerable group that requires special attention due to the risk of malnutrition, which may result in low birth weight (LBW) infants. Enhancing nutritional status during pregnancy can be achieved through supplementation with locally sourced functional foods, such as dadih and bread. This study aims to evaluate the effects of dadih-based functional bread on nutritional intake, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes. Methods A randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 143 pregnant women, divided into two groups: the intervention group (IG, n = 77), who consumed dadih-based functional bread, and the control group (CG, n = 66), who consumed original functional bread. Data analysis used the independent t-test for normally distributed variables and the Mann–Whitney test for non-parametric variables. Results Significant differences were observed in carbohydrate intake during the third trimester between the IG (320.40 [198.24–666.72] grams/day) and CG (312.37 [137.87–556.85] grams/day; p = 0.019) and in fat intake (IG: 74.30 [25.53–245.47] grams/day; CG: 62.85 [21.71–128.59] grams/day; p = 0.025). A significant difference in BMI in the third month was noted between IG and CG (p = 0.025). However, no significant differences were observed in neonatal outcomes between the groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions Dadih demonstrates benefits for maternal health during pregnancy, its effects on fetal growth pa-rameters may be limited and potentially influenced by factors beyond maternal diet alone. Further research is required to explore dadih’s potential role in enhancing long-term child health outcomes.

                <p>by Ines S. C. Baptista, Suchintak Dash, Amir M. Arsh, Vinodh Kandavalli, Carlo Maria Scandolo, Barry C. Sanders, Andre S. Ribeiro</p>

Bacteria evolved genes whose single-cell distributions of expression levels are broad, or even bimodal. Evidence suggests that they might enhance phenotypic diversity for coping with fluctuating environments. We identified seven genes in <i>E. coli</i> with bimodal (low and high) single-cell expression levels under standard growth conditions and studied how their dynamics are modified by environmental and antibiotic stresses known to target gene expression. We found that all genes lose bimodality under some, but not under all, stresses. Also, bimodality can reemerge upon cells returning to standard conditions, which suggests that the genes can switch often between high and low expression rates. As such, these genes could become valuable components of future multi-stable synthetic circuits. Next, we proposed models of bimodal transcription dynamics with realistic parameter values, able to mimic the outcome of the perturbations studied. We explored several models’ tunability and boundaries of parameter values, beyond which it shifts to unimodal dynamics. From the model results, we predict that bimodality is robust, and yet tunable, not only by RNA and protein degradation rates, but also by the fraction of time that promoters remain unavailable for new transcription events. Finally, we show evidence that, although the empirical expression levels are influenced by many factors, the bimodality emerges during transcription initiation, at the promoter regions and, thus, may be evolvable and adaptable.

space</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vemund Sigmundson Schøyen, Kosio Beshkov, Markus Borud Pettersen, Erik Hermansen, Konstantin Holzhausen, Anders Malthe-Sørenssen, Marianne Fyhn, Mikkel Elle Lepperød</p>

Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are known for their hexagonal spatial activity patterns and are thought to provide a neural metric for space, and support path integration. In this study, we further investigate grid cells as a metric of space by optimising them for a conformal isometric (CI) map of space using a model based on a superposition of plane waves. By optimising the phases within a single grid cell module, we find that the module can form a CI of two-dimensional flat space with phases arranging into a regular hexagonal pattern, supporting an accurate spatial metric. Additionally, we find that experimentally recorded grid cells exhibit CI properties, with one example module showing a phase arrangement similar to the hexagonal pattern observed in our model. These findings provide computational and preliminary experimental support for grid cells as a CI-based spatial representation. We also examine other properties that emerge in CI-optimised modules, including consistent energy expenditure across space and the minimal cell count required to support unique representation of space and maximally topologically persistent toroidal population activity. Altogether, our results suggest that grid cells are well-suited to form a CI map, with several beneficial properties arising from this organisation.

Accurately labeling large datasets is important for biomedical machine learning yet challenging while modern data augmentation methods may generate noise in the training data, which may deteriorate machine learning model performance. Existing approaches addressing noisy training data typically rely on strict modeling assumptions, classification models and well-curated dataset. To address these, we propose a novel reliability-based training-data-cleaning method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method uses a small set of well-curated training data and leverages ICP-calculated reliability metrics to selectively correct mislabeled data and outliers within vast quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy is validated across three classification tasks with distinct modalities: filtering drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with free-text title and abstract, predicting ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels of noise to the training labels were introduced via label permutation. Our training-data-cleaning method significantly enhanced the downstream classification performance (paired t-tests, <i>p</i> ≤ 0 . 05 among 30 random train/test partitions): significant accuracy enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4% increase from 0.812 to 0.905), significant AUROC and AUPRC enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% increase from 0.597 to 0.739 for AUROC, and 69.8% increase from 0.183 to 0.311 for AUPRC), and significant accuracy and macro-average F1-score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing experiments (up to 74.6% increase from 0.351 to 0.613 for accuracy, and 89.0% increase from 0.267 to 0.505 for F1-score). The improvement can be both statistically and clinically significant for information retrieval, disease diagnosis and prognosis. The method offers the potential to substantially boost classification performance in biomedical machine learning tasks without necessitating an excessive volume of well-curated training data or strong data distribution and modeling assumptions in existing semi-supervised learning methods.

Forecasting the occurrence and absence of novel disease outbreaks is essential for disease management, yet existing methods are often context-specific, require a long preparation time, and non-outbreak prediction remains understudied. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework using a feature-based time series classification (TSC) method to forecast outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We tested our methods on synthetic data from a Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model for slowly changing, noisy disease dynamics. Outbreak sequences give a transcritical bifurcation within a specified future time window, whereas non-outbreak (null bifurcation) sequences do not. We identified incipient differences, reflected in 22 statistical features and 5 early warning signal indicators, in time series of infectives leading to future outbreaks and non-outbreaks. Classifier performance, given by the area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC), ranged from 0 . 99 for large expanding windows of training data to 0 . 7 for small rolling windows. The framework is further evaluated on four empirical datasets: COVID-19 incidence data from Singapore, 18 other countries, and Edmonton, Canada, as well as SARS data from Hong Kong, with two classifiers exhibiting consistently high accuracy. Our results highlight detectable statistical features distinguishing outbreak and non-outbreak sequences well before potential occurrence, in both synthetic and real-world datasets presented in this study.

<i>Hermetia illucens</i> is an important insect resource. Studies have shown that exploring the effects of Cu<sup>2+</sup>-stressed on the growth and development of the <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome holds significant scientific importance. There are three major challenges in the current studies of <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data analysis: firstly, the lack of available genomic data which limits researchers in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data analysis. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, there are no Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature selection models designed specifically for <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome. Unlike human genomic data, noise in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> data is a more serious problem. Third, how to choose those genes located in the pathway enrichment region. Existing models assume that each gene probe has the same priori weight. However, researchers usually pay more attention to gene probes which are in the pathway enrichment region. Based on the above challenges, we initially construct experiments and establish a new Cu<sup>2+</sup>-stressed <i>Hermetia illucens</i> growth genome dataset. Subsequently, we propose AWGE-ESPCA: an edge Sparse PCA model based on adaptive noise elimination regularization and weighted gene network. The AWGE-ESPCA model innovatively proposes an adaptive noise elimination regularization method, effectively addressing the noise challenge in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data. We also integrate the known gene-pathway quantitative information into the Sparse PCA(SPCA) framework as a priori knowledge, which allows the model to filter out the gene probes in pathway-rich regions as much as possible. Ultimately, this study conducts five independent experiments and compared four latest Sparse PCA models as well as representative supervised and unsupervised baseline models to validate the model performance. The experimental results demonstrate the superior pathway and gene selection capabilities of the AWGE-ESPCA model. Ablation experiments validate the role of the adaptive regularizer and network weighting module. To summarize, this paper presents an innovative unsupervised model for <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome analysis, which can effectively help researchers identify potential biomarkers. In addition, we also provide a working AWGE - ESPCA model code in the address: https://github.com/yhyresearcher/AWGE_ESPCA.

                <p>by Alexa Aucoin, Kevin K. Lin, Katalin M. Gothard</p>

The amygdala responds to a large variety of socially and emotionally salient environmental and interoceptive stimuli. The context in which these stimuli occur determines their social and emotional significance. In canonical neurophysiological studies, the fast-paced succession of stimuli and events induce phasic changes in neural activity. During inter-trial intervals neural activity is expected to return to a stable and featureless level of spontaneous activity, often called baseline. In previous studies we found that context, such as the presence of a social partner, induces brain states that can transcend the fast-paced succession of stimuli and can be recovered from the spontaneous, inter-trial firing rate of neurons. Indeed, the spontaneous firing rates of neurons in the amygdala are different during blocks of gentle grooming touches delivered by a trusted social partner, and during blocks of non-social airflow stimuli delivered by a computer-controlled air valve. Here, we examine local field potentials (LFPs) recorded during periods of spontaneous activity to determine whether information about context can be extracted from these signals. We found that information about social vs. non-social context is present in the local field potential during periods of spontaneous activity between the application of grooming and airflow stimuli, as machine learning techniques can reliably decode context from spectrograms of spontaneous LFPs. No significant differences were detected between the nuclei of the amygdala that receive direct or indirect inputs from areas of the prefrontal cortex known to coordinate flexible, context-dependent behaviors. The lack of nuclear specificity suggests that context-related synaptic inputs arise from a shared source, possibly interoceptive inputs, that signal the physiological state of the body during social and non-social blocks of tactile stimulation.

                <p>by Deepanshu N. D. Singh, Abigail R. E. Roberts, Xiaocui Wang, Guiyi Li, Enrique Quesada Moraga, David Alliband, Elizabeth Ballou, Hung-Ji Tsai, Alicia Hidalgo</p>

Fungi can intervene in hosts’ brain function. In humans, they can drive neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. However, how fungi alter the host brain is unknown. The mechanism underlying innate immunity to fungi is well-known and universally conserved downstream of shared Toll/TLR receptors, which via the adaptor MyD88 and the transcription factor Dif/NFκB, induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). However, in the brain, Toll-1 could also drive an alternative pathway via Sarm, which causes cell death instead. Sarm is the universal inhibitor of MyD88 and could drive immune evasion. Here, we show that exposure to the fungus <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> reduced fly life span, impaired locomotion and caused neurodegeneration. <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> entered the <i>Drosophila </i>brain and induced the up-regulation of <i>AMPs</i>, and the Toll adaptors <i>wek</i> and <i>sarm</i>, within the brain. RNAi knockdown of <i>Toll-1, wek</i> or <i>sarm</i> concomitantly with infection prevented <i>B. bassiana-</i>induced cell loss. By contrast, over-expression of <i>wek</i> or <i>sarm</i> was sufficient to cause neuronal loss in the absence of infection. Thus, <i>B. bassiana</i> caused cell loss in the host brain via Toll-1/Wek/Sarm signalling driving immune evasion. A similar activation of Sarm downstream of TLRs upon fungal infections could underlie psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases in humans.

Tropical forests hold most of Earth’s biodiversity and a higher concentration of threatened mammals than other biomes. As a result, some mammal species persist almost exclusively in protected areas, often within extensively transformed and heavily populated landscapes. Other species depend on remaining remote forested areas with sparse human populations. However, it remains unclear how mammalian communities in tropical forests respond to anthropogenic pressures in the broader landscape in which they are embedded. As governments commit to increasing the extent of global protected areas to prevent further biodiversity loss, identifying the landscape-level conditions supporting wildlife has become essential. Here, we assessed the relationship between mammal communities and anthropogenic threats in the broader landscape. We simultaneously modeled species richness and community occupancy as complementary metrics of community structure, using a state-of-the-art community model parameterized with a standardized pan-tropical data set of 239 mammal species from 37 forests across 3 continents. Forest loss and fragmentation within a 50-km buffer were associated with reduced occupancy in monitored communities, while species richness was unaffected by them. In contrast, landscape-scale human density was associated with reduced mammal richness but not occupancy, suggesting that sensitive species have been extirpated, while remaining taxa are relatively unaffected. Taken together, these results provide evidence of extinction filtering within tropical forests triggered by anthropogenic pressure occurring in the broader landscape. Therefore, existing and new reserves may not achieve the desired biodiversity outcomes without concurrent investment in addressing landscape-scale threats.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.087, p = 0.001). Social support was significantly related to Academic stress (β = 0.117, p = 0.031) and self-efficacy (β =0.088, p = 0.021). However, both social support (β = 0.099, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.646, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.012, CI [0.002, 0.024], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.057, CI [0.006, 0.111], p = 0.068). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

                Background Biogas production from different types of biodegradable wastes used as an alternative for fossil fuels for energy consumption and biodegradable waste management. Biogas is a cost-effective, ecologically friendly, sustainable energy source that is also a reliable method to handle food waste. Methods This study used rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F to maximize the production of biogas from household consumption of three substrates such as cattle manure, cafeteria leftover foods, and fruit and vegetable wastes. Plastic 0.6 L digesters operating at a mesophilic temperature (30°C) were used to produce biogas from the mixed waste. Biogas production was recorded after the 60-day retention period. Standard methods were used to figure out parameters like pH, total solids, organic carbon volatile solids, and moisture content of the raw mixed wastes. This study was carried out experimentally using factorial patterns and a completely randomized 6 × 2 design. The water displacement method was used to estimate the average amount of biogas generated by a 0.6 L digester. Result The corresponding VS/TS ratios for cattle manure, fruit and vegetable waste, and leftover cafeteria food waste were 91.2%, 80.2%, and 78.3%. More biogas was produced using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F than from mixed wastes without inoculums. The highest volume of biogas (6900.3 ml) was generated by mixing 10 ml of S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F with the rumen fluids (100 ml). The digester that included 100 ml of rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae was the optimum performance for biogas production. Conclusion This result suggests that using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as inoculums in a biogas digestor can enhance the production of biogas.
