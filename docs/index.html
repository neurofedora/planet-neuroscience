">Role of oligodendroglial ADAM10 in oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination and myelin maintenance</a></h4>

              
                In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes extend their processes to wrap axons to form myelin sheaths, ensuring saltatory conduction of action potentials and providing trophic support for the axon. Our previous work demonstrated that pharmacological activation of -secretase promotes myelin protection and remyelination after both ex vivo and in vivo demyelination. Based on these findings, the present study aims to investigate the role of oligodendroglial ADAM10 (OLA10; a member of the a-secretase family) in myelin development and maintenance. Using an inducible knockout mouse model for OLA10 (KOOL-A10), we demonstrated that OLA10 deficiency results in delayed maturation of OPC in primary culture, and altered myelination in primary neuron/glia co-culture. Furthermore, an induction of OLA10 deficiency in adult mice was associated with an alteration of myelin sheath thickness and long-term motor and cognitive deficit in males but not in females. Overall, our study highlights the subtle but significant role of ADAM10 expressed by oligodendrocytes in the formation and maintenance of the myelin over time, while emphasizing a sexual dimorphism that carries important relevance for current research.

">Developmental prosopagnosics have normal spatial integration in posterior ventral face-selective regions</a></h4>

              
                Population receptive field (pRF) mapping is an influential neuroimaging technique used to estimate the region of visual space modulating the response of a neuronal population. While pRF mapping has advanced our understanding of visual cortical organization, evidence linking variation in pRF properties to behavioral performance remains limited. One of the most compelling pRF-to-behavior relationships has emerged from research into developmental prosopagnosia (DP). Individuals with DP have severe deficits in facial identity recognition sometimes linked to diminished holistic processing of faces. This perceptual deficit could be explained at the neural level by abnormally small pRFs in face-selective regions that restrict spatial integration of the face information. This hypothesis is supported by data from a small group of DPs but needs to be rigorously evaluated in a larger sample. Here, we measured pRF properties in 20 individuals with DP and 20 controls using a stimulus designed to robustly activate both low- and high-level visual areas. Consistent with previous studies, DPs exhibited weaker face selectivity in core ventral face-selective areas. Crucially, however, across the visual processing hierarchy - from early visual cortex, to intermediate visual areas, and face-selective areas - DPs and controls exhibited remarkable similarity in pRF properties, including pRF size, visual field coverage, and the distribution of pRF centers. Using a larger sample and the latest methods for mapping and modeling pRFs, these results challenge theories attributing DP to reduced spatial integration in face-selective regions. This underscores the need to explore alternative neural mechanisms of DP and to re-evaluate links between pRF properties and behavior more broadly.

">Developmental time course of social touch, parvalbumin interneurons, perineuronal nets and Mef2c expression reveals a sensitive period of somatosensory cortex development in prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                Social touch facilitates our attachment to others, especially early in life, which may be linked to the maturation of parvalbumin interneurons (PVI) in the somatosensory cortex (S1). These neurons respond to social touch, mature in a sensory experience-dependent manner, and influence both somatosensory processing and social behavior in models of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are an ideal rodent model for studying these concepts since they engage in a species-typical social touch called huddling. This study first showed that over development from juvenile to adult, same-sex siblings huddled less and explored more. Next, we tracked two markers of plasticity indicative of PVI maturation, extracellular perineuronal nets (PNNs) and nuclear transcription factor Myocyte enhancing factor 2C (Mef2c) across seven developmental timepoints. We found that, while PV expression in S1 was stable by P21, PNNs and Mef2c continued to shift afterwards, indicating a protracted development. Four unique clusters of PVIs converge during development between P14-P21, suggesting a sensitive period of PVI development. Finally, to determine environmental factors affecting these processes, environmental enrichment between P21-P28 led to accelerated PVI maturation. This developmental mapping provides a particularly salient model to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cortical and social development.

">Functional Dissociation in the Developing Superior Temporal Lobe: Language and Theory of Mind</a></h4>

              
                Language and theory of mind (ToM; the ability to infer others' mental states) are both crucial for human communication and yet their developmental origins are unclear. Are their neural substrates distinct within the superior temporal lobe (STL) but with opposing lateralization, as in adults? Or do they emerge from common neural substrates during development, perhaps in homologous regions originally involved in more basic social processing? Here we investigate the development of this functional dissociation, and the dissociation of their underlying connectivity fingerprints in a large cohort of children (ages 4-9 years, n=58 sessions) and adults (n=29). We demonstrate for the first time that children show distinct patterns of neural specificity for language and ToM in STL, just like adults. Children show no evidence of developmental 'disentangling' cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Finally, children's connectivity fingerprints predicting future language or ToM activation are almost identical to concurrent fingerprints and are largely non-overlapping across domains. While linguistic and ToM processing undergo continued neural specialization to reach the mature adult-like state, they are distinct remarkably early in human development. Our results challenge the idea that language develops from neural processors common for social communication and instead support distinct neural origins of these mental domains.

                <p>There is a growing imperative to understand the neurophysiological impact of our rapidly changing and diverse technological, social, chemical, and physical environments. To untangle the multidimensional and interacting effects requires data at scale across diverse populations, taking measurement out of a controlled lab environment and into the field. Electroencephalography (EEG), which has correlates with various environmental factors as well as cognitive and mental health outcomes, has the advantage of both portability and cost-effectiveness for this purpose. However, with numerous field researchers spread across diverse locations, data quality issues and researcher idle time due to insufficient participants can quickly become unmanageable and expensive problems. In programs we have established in India and Tanzania, we demonstrate that with appropriate training, structured teams, and daily automated analysis and feedback on data quality, nonspecialists can reliably collect EEG data alongside various survey and assessments with consistently high throughput and quality. Over a 30&nbsp;week period, research teams were able to maintain an average of 25.6 participants per week, collecting data from a diverse sample of 7,933 participants ranging from Hadzabe hunter-gatherers to office workers. Furthermore, data quality, computed on the first 5,831 records using two common methods, PREP and FASTER, was comparable to benchmark datasets from controlled lab conditions. Altogether this resulted in a cost per participant of under $50, a fraction of the cost typical of such data collection, opening up the possibility for large-scale programs particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

                <p>Previous research suggests that stress predisposes individuals to develop substance use disorders by disrupting the brain processing of rewards. Yet, how stressful experiences disrupt the brain processing of reward-related cues at the neuronal level is poorly understood. Intermittent social defeat (ISD) is a stress animal model that increases reward-seeking behavior, drug self-administration, and choice impulsivity up to several weeks after stress. We tested the hypothesis that ISD disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in key areas of the brain that regulate reward-seeking. We examined in vivo neuronal dynamics in response to reward cues in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) simultaneously, and longitudinally, in control and stressed Long&ndash;Evans male rats during a discriminative stimulus reward-seeking task. In the dmPFC, ISD decreased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1 and 15&nbsp;d after stress, which indicates a long-term degradation of outcome anticipation-related processing. In the VTA, ISD increased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1&nbsp;d after stress but decreased cue-evoked activity 15&nbsp;d after stress. Moreover, decoding analysis in single neurons and populations showed parallel increases and decreases in reward discrimination accuracy in the VTA which points to time-dependent changes in incentive salience after stress. These results demonstrate that ISD differently disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in the dmPFC and the VTA and identify novel neurofunctional signatures that underlie a higher predisposition to seek out rewards after stress.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity, gait initiation (GI), and freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recorded GI and STN local field potentials (LFPs) via externalized cables in 38 patients with PD (35 reporting FOG in daily life), both OFF- and ON-dopamine (DOPA). GI was also recorded in 24 age-matched controls. GI scores related to pace, rhythm, and balance were derived from kinetics, and FOG was identified using kinematics. We compared GI performance related to FOG and DOPA, and GI-LFP relationships between posterior-sensorimotor versus central-associative STN regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DOPA<sup>OFF</sup>, 12 patients with PD had FOG observed (FOG-OBS, 263 episodes), occurring at a mean of 8 steps after GI, and 26 had no FOG observed (NOBS; FOG-NOBS). GI pace scores were worse in FOG-OBS than in FOG-NOBS patients with PD, even when not followed by FOG, with weaker association with alpha/low-beta activity in the posterior STN. Although rhythm/balance scores were similar between groups, their association with low-beta activity was stronger in FOG-OBS patients, with rhythm correlating more in the central STN and balance in the posterior STN. GI was worse preceding imminent FOG, with disrupted low-beta GI-LFP associations and emergent high-beta correlations with reversed spatial distribution (pace/rhythm-posterior STN, balance-central). Dopamine improved pace, rhythm, and FOG, and partially restored STN activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results reveal 3 distinct GI patterns in patients with PD associated with absence, predisposition to, or imminent occurrence of FOG, with STN neuronal modulations differing dynamically between the posterior and central subregions. These markers could support developing adaptive DBS strategies tailored for episodic gait impairments. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Recent studies report reduced dementia risk following shingles vaccination, suggesting that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) latency contributes to neuroimmune vulnerability. We propose that subclinical VZV reactivation acts as a renewable peripheral immune stressor, amplifying microglial priming in aging brains. Shingles vaccination may suppress this viral reservoir, reducing cumulative inflammatory tone. In this opinion article we contrast this mechanism with trained immunity and highlight how pathogen-specific and systemic effects may converge. Finally, we discuss the role of innate phagocytosis and resolution, suggesting that impaired clearance, rather than activation alone, sustains neuroinflammatory risk. Vaccination may thus modulate innate responsiveness and preserve neuroimmune balance in later life.

                Microglial ADGRG1 drives a protective state in Alzheimer’s disease by activating the transcription factor MYC, which upregulates genes associated with homeostasis, phagocytosis, and lysosomal functions. This leads to increased Aβ clearance, improved neuronal health, and preserved cognitive function.

Strikingly, only one, SUGP1, did so, implicating SUGP1 loss from mutant spliceosomes as the sole driver of missplicing.

                Takemura et al. demonstrate that the birth process triggers the transformation of radial glia (RG)-to-postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) through calpain- and endocytosis-mediated fiber transection. Importantly, RG adhesion to endothelial cells via N-cadherin depends on birth timing; preterm birth disrupts this, impairing NSC morphology and reducing stemness in adulthood.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97125">Cingulate cortex shapes early postnatal development of social vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                The social dynamics of vocal behavior have major implications for social development in humans. We asked whether early life damage to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is closely associated with socioemotional regulation more broadly, impacts the normal development of vocal expression. The common marmoset provides a unique opportunity to study the developmental trajectory of vocal behavior and to track the consequences of early brain damage on aspects of social vocalizations. We created ACC lesions in neonatal marmosets and compared their pattern of vocalization to that of age-matched controls throughout the first 6 weeks of life. We found that while early life ACC lesions had little influence on the production of vocal calls, developmental changes to the quality of social contact calls and their associated sequential and acoustic characteristics were compromised. These animals made fewer social contact calls, and when they did, they were short, loud, and monotonic. We further determined that damage to ACC in infancy results in a permanent alteration in downstream brain areas known to be involved in social vocalizations, such as the amygdala and periaqueductal gray. Namely, in the adult, these structures exhibited diminished GABA immunoreactivity relative to control animals, likely reflecting disruption of the normal inhibitory balance following ACC deafferentation. Together, these data indicate that the normal development of social vocal behavior depends on the ACC and its interaction with other areas in the vocal network during early life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106284">Neocortical layer-5 tLTD relies on non-ionotropic presynaptic NMDA receptor signaling</a></h4>

              
                In the textbook view, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) act as coincidence detectors in Hebbian plasticity by fluxing Ca<sup>2+</sup> when simultaneously depolarized and glutamate bound. Hebbian coincidence detection requires that NMDARs be located postsynaptically, but enigmatic presynaptic NMDARs (preNMDARs) also exist. It is known that preNMDARs regulate neurotransmitter release, but precisely how remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that NMDARs can also signal non-ionotropically, without the need for Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. At synapses between developing visual cortex layer-5 (L5) pyramidal cells (PCs), preNMDARs rely on Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Rab3-interacting molecule 1αβ (RIM1αβ) to regulate evoked release during periods of high-frequency firing, but they signal non-ionotropically via c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) to regulate spontaneous release regardless of frequency. At the same synapses, timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) depends on preNMDARs but not on frequency. We, therefore, tested in juvenile mouse visual cortex if tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling. We found that tLTD at L5 PC→PC synapses was abolished by pre- but not postsynaptic NMDAR deletion, cementing the view that tLTD requires preNMDARs. In agreement with non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling, tLTD prevailed after channel pore blockade with MK-801, unlike tLTP. Homozygous RIM1αβ deletion did not affect tLTD, but wash-in of the JNK2 blocker SP600125 abolished tLTD. Consistent with a presynaptic need for JNK2, a peptide blocking the interaction between JNK2 and Syntaxin-1a (STX1a) abolished tLTD if loaded pre- but not postsynaptically, regardless of frequency. Finally, low-frequency tLTD was not blocked by the channel pore blocker MK-801, nor by 7-CK, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist at the co-agonist site. We conclude that neocortical L5 PC→PC tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling via JNK2/STX1a. Our study brings closure to long-standing controversy surrounding preNMDARs and highlights how the textbook view of NMDARs as ionotropic coincidence detectors in plasticity needs to be reassessed.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101327">A SMARTTR workflow for multi-ensemble atlas mapping and brain-wide network analysis</a></h4>

              
                In the last decade, activity-dependent strategies for labeling multiple immediate early gene ensembles in mice have generated unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval. However, few strategies exist for brain-wide mapping of multiple ensembles, including their overlapping population, and none incorporate capabilities for downstream network analysis. Here, we introduce a scalable workflow to analyze traditionally coronally sectioned datasets produced by activity-dependent tagging systems. Intrinsic to this pipeline is simple multi-ensemble atlas registration and statistical testing in R (SMARTTR), an R package which wraps mapping capabilities with functions for statistical analysis and network visualization, and support for import of external datasets. We demonstrate the versatility of SMARTTR by mapping the ensembles underlying the acquisition and expression of learned helplessness (LH), a robust stress model. Applying network analysis, we find that exposure to inescapable shock (IS), compared to context training, results in decreased centrality of regions engaged in spatial and contextual processing and higher influence of regions involved in somatosensory and affective processing. During LH expression, the substantia nigra emerges as a highly influential region that shows a functional reversal following IS, indicating a possible regulatory function of motor activity during helplessness. We also report that IS results in a robust decrease in reactivation activity across a number of cortical, hippocampal, and amygdalar regions, indicating suppression of ensemble reactivation may be a neurobiological signature of LH. These results highlight the emergent insights uniquely garnered by applying our analysis approach to multiple ensemble datasets and demonstrate the strength of our workflow as a hypothesis-generating toolkit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88598">Cell type-specific contributions to a persistent aggressive internal state in female Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Persistent internal states are important for maintaining survival-promoting behaviors, such as aggression. In female <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we have previously shown that individually activating either aIPg or pC1d cell types can induce aggression. Here we investigate further the individual roles of these cholinergic, sexually dimorphic cell types, and the reciprocal connections between them, in generating a persistent aggressive internal state. We find that a brief 30-second optogenetic stimulation of aIPg neurons was sufficient to promote an aggressive internal state lasting at least 10 minutes, whereas similar stimulation of pC1d neurons did not. While we previously showed that stimulation of pC1e alone does not evoke aggression, persistent behavior could be promoted through simultaneous stimulation of pC1d and pC1e, suggesting an unexpected synergy of these cell types in establishing a persistent aggressive state. Neither aIPg nor pC1d show persistent neuronal activity themselves, implying that the persistent internal state is maintained by other mechanisms. Moreover, inactivation of pC1d did not significantly reduce aIPg-evoked persistent aggression, arguing that the aggressive state did not depend on pC1d-aIPg recurrent connectivity. Our results suggest the need for alternative models to explain persistent female aggression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101526">No effect of additional education on long-term brain structure, a preregistered natural experiment in thousands of individuals</a></h4>

              
                Education is related to a wide variety of beneficial health, behavioral, and societal outcomes. However, whether education causes long-term structural changes in the brain remains unclear. A pressing challenge is that individuals self-select into continued education, thereby introducing a wide variety of environmental and genetic confounders. Fortunately, natural experiments allow us to isolate the causal impact of increased education from individual (and societal) characteristics. Here, we exploit a policy change in the UK (the 1972 ROSLA act) that increased the amount of mandatory schooling from 15 to 16 years of age to study the impact of education on long-term structural brain outcomes in the UK Biobank. Using regression discontinuity (RD) – a causal inference method – we find no evidence of an effect from an additional year of education on any structural neuroimaging outcomes. This null result is robust across modalities, regions, and analysis strategies. An additional year of education is a substantial cognitive intervention, yet we find no evidence for sustained experience-dependent plasticity. Our results provide a challenge for prominent accounts of cognitive or ‘brain reserve’ theories which identify education as a major protective factor to lessen adverse aging effects. Our preregistered findings are one of the first implementations of RD on neural data – opening the door for causal inference in population-based neuroimaging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106389">Population-level morphological analysis of paired CO2- and odor-sensing olfactory neurons in D. melanogaster via volume electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic morphology is a defining characteristic of neuronal subtypes. In <i>Drosophila</i>, heterotypic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing different receptors display diverse dendritic morphologies, but whether such diversity exists among homotypic ORNs remains unclear. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy on cryofixed tissues, we analyzed the majority of CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons (ab1C) and their odor-sensing neighbors (ab1D) in the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> antenna. Surprisingly, ab1C neurons featured flattened, sheet-like dendrites—distinct from the cylindrical branches typical of odor-sensing neurons—and displayed remarkable diversity, ranging from plain sheets to tube-like structures that enclose several neighboring dendrites, forming ‘dendrite-within-dendrite’ structures. Similarly, ab1D dendrites varied from simple, unbranched forms to numerously branched morphologies. These findings suggest that morphological heterogeneity is common even among homotypic ORNs, potentially expanding their functional adaptability and ranges of sensory physiological properties.

">Novel Gain of Function Mouse Model of KCNT1-Related Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                KCNT1-related epilepsy is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from de novo pathogenic variants in KCNT1 which encodes a sodium-gated potassium channel. These variants are associated with Epilepsy of Infancy with Migrating Focal Seizures (EIMFS) and Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (ADNFLE). At least 64 human KCNT1 variants have been reported, the majority are gain-of-function and each has unique electrophysiological and epileptic characteristics. A multi-disciplinary collaboration generated a novel mouse model (C57BL/6-Kcnt1em1Bryd) that carries the G269S variant corresponding to the human G288S variant located within the coding region of the channel pore. We characterized network excitability of cultured cortical neurons from all three genotypes, since many KCNT1 mouse models require homozygosity for seizure detection. Kcnt1+/G269S neurons exhibited sustained hyperexcitability and hypersynchronous bursting versus Kcnt1+/+ controls, while Kcnt1G269S/G269S neurons showed early excessive bursting followed by network collapse by 28 days-in-vitro, suggesting excitotoxicity. Therefore, behavioral comparisons were conducted between Kcnt1+/G269S and Kcnt1+/+ mice including developmental milestones, motor and cognitive abilities, respiratory physiology, and seizure susceptibility. Kcnt1+/G269S displayed no abnormal gross motor abilities, poor coordination, erratic breathing, and increased apneas, as functional outcome measures. Critically, Kcnt1+/G269S were more susceptible to thermal-induced seizures in early life. In summary, these data: (i) provide a novel mouse model of KCNT1-related epilepsy, (ii) provide strong in vitro evidence of neuronal hyperexcitability, (iii) illustrate early-life seizures as a functional outcome measure, and (iv) lay the groundwork for future analysis of neural activity in vivo and modeling circuit level dynamics in vitro, in vivo, and in silico.

">High-density, Identified Cell Recordings from Motor Cortex of Awake Behaving Macaques using 1024-channel SiNAPS-NHP Probes</a></h4>

              
                Objective/Background: Acquiring bioelectric signals from many single neurons in primate brain remains challenging. Chronic implants offer a reasonable channel count (~100) but sample only a small, fixed region of the cortex. Acutely inserted electrodes can sample from a wider region by making new penetrations each day. The aim of this study was to develop an active dense CMOS probe and experimental procedures to demonstrate acute large-scale single unit recordings from behaving monkeys. Methods: A single-shank CMOS probe was specifically designed for intracortical macaque recordings. The device is based on SiNAPS technology, with additional multiplexing circuits to minimize output lines. Synchronous sampling at 20 kHz/channel from >2k electrode-pixels is achieved with multiple probe systems. Experiments were performed in behaving macaques, achieving multiple day insertions in the motor cortex. Methods were developed to extract spontaneous spiking times of antidromically-identified neurons. Results: The probe (10.7 mm in length, 158 m in width, 50 m in thickness) provides a regular array of 1024 electrodes (14 x 14 m^2) arranged in 4 columns with an interelectrode pitch of 30 m. Dural penetration is eased by a small pilot hole; the optimized insertion procedure allows recordings from many different sites. Some cells were identified by antidromic activation as pyramidal tract neurons, which project to the spinal cord. Conclusion: This probe configuration can reach the anterior bank of the central sulcus, which contains many corticospinal cells that connect directly to motoneurons. Significance: This study is an important advance in the toolkit of primate neurophysiology.

">Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of post-mortem brain tissue reveals specific amino acid profile dysregulation in Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease patients</a></h4>

              
                Background: Combined metabolomic and HPLC-based analyses have identified significant metabolic alterations in serum and plasma amino acid levels of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, underscoring their potential as biomarkers. However, it remains unclear whether these biochemical changes also manifest within the central nervous system or are confined to peripheral metabolism, reflecting systemic metabolic disturbances. Methods: To address this issue, here we measured the levels of 44 different amino acids in post-mortem brain samples from MPTP-intoxicated, L-DOPA-treated monkeys and PD patients at different Braak Lewy body (LB) stages, compared to their respective controls, through targeted Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Results: In MPTP-intoxicated monkeys, UPLC-MS revealed significant elevations in GABA, citrulline, threonine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, glycine, and serine in the putamen, whereas we failed to detect alterations in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). In PD patients, caudate-putamen (CPu) analysis demonstrated consistent serine upregulation across Braak LB stages 3-4 and 6, with stage 6 specifically showing additional proline increases and phosphoethanolamine decreases. Notably, serine was the sole amino acid significantly altered in both the putamen of MPTP-intoxicated monkeys and the CPu of PD patients. No significant amino acid alterations were observed in the SFG of PD patients, mirroring the findings in monkeys. In contrast, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient SFG samples showed significant increases in tryptophan, phenylalanine, threonine, tyrosine, and methionine relative to controls. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that cerebral amino acid alterations in PD are region-specific and primarily localized to brain areas receiving nigrostriatal dopaminergic innervation. Moreover, the cortical amino acid profile in AD differs substantially from that in PD, suggesting disease-specific metabolic signatures in distinct neurodegenerative conditions.

">A thalamic circuit mechanism for stress-dependent modulation of REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is stress-sensitive and linked to cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex. Yet, the neuronal mechanisms connecting stress, REM sleep and cortical operations remain unclear. Here, we reveal that prefrontal cortical- and nucleus accumbens-projecting paraventricular thalamic neurons (PVTNAc) exhibit sleep-stage dependent activity and modulate cortical REM oscillation in response to stress. We found that PVTNAc bidirectionally modulate the REM-promoting medullary GABAergic signal, and thus, cortical theta oscillation during REM sleep in an activity-dependent manner, along with the excitation-inhibition balance observed during natural sleep stage transitions. While acute stress enhances REM sleep, repeated stress suppresses it through progressively increased PVTNAc activation. Notably, acute and chronic stimulation of PVTNAc recapitulates stress-induced bidirectional changes in REM sleep. Thus, PVTNAc neurons, by integrating stress and REM signals into forebrain activity, dynamically shape sleep architecture. Persistent elevation in this pathway disrupts REM sleep, thereby providing a mechanism through which stress alters prefrontal cortical processing and, ultimately, cognitive functions.

">A Semi-Automated, Parallelized, and Flexible Spatial Navigation Task for Rats</a></h4>

              
                Spatial navigation tasks for rodents have been an extremely useful tool for studying cognitive processes for decades, but are often laborious to administer, inefficient, and sensitive to experimenter-induced variability. To address these limitations, we have developed a parallelized maze system which runs four highly flexible maze environments simultaneously with automated reward delivery to reduce experimenter involvement, increase throughput, and streamline data collection. Further, our software tracks subject performance and manages the progression through a pre-set curriculum as subjects learn, reducing experimenter error and ensuring comparable learning curves across cohorts. Equipped with IR beam-break based reward ports, peristaltic pumps for liquid reward delivery, and overhead video tracking, our current maze accessories can be flexibly reconfigured to enable a vast array of behavioral tasks and support a wide range of important experimental questions. A pilot cohort of young (4-8 month) and aged (28-32 month) male rats demonstrates that this task enables the efficient training of a series of increasingly difficult visually cued and memory-dependent spatial navigation tasks which are likely to be sensitive to age-related changes.

">Volumetric Differences of Thalamic Nuclei are Associated with Post-Trauma Psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Previous investigations of whole thalamus and thalamic nuclei volumes in post-trauma psychopathology have been sparse, limited in scope, and yielded inconsistent results. To address this, volumetric estimates of whole thalamus and thalamic nuclei were obtained from structural brain MRI scans from 2,058 participants across 20 worldwide sites in the ENIGMA PTSD working group. Thalamic volumes were compared between trauma-exposed participants with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=238), major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=184), comorbid PTSD+MDD (n=618), and trauma-exposed control participants (n=1,018). PTSD and MDD symptom severity, PTSD symptom clusters, and childhood trauma were similarly examined for associations with thalamic volume. Participants with PTSD only compared to controls had smaller thalamic nuclei volumes in sensorimotor nuclei, including the parafascicular (Pf), ventral anterior magnocellular (VAmc), medial pulvinar (PuM), and anterior pulvinar (PuA) nuclei of the thalamus. MDD only and comorbid PTSD+MDD participants exhibited smaller mediodorsal thalamus volumes compared to controls. Overall PTSD and MDD symptom severity negatively correlated with the volume of the mediodorsal thalamus. A significant interaction between PTSD and MDD severity was found, such that MDD severity was positively associated with thalamic volume only among individuals with high PTSD severity. Avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD were positively associated with thalamic volume, while re-experiencing and negative mood/cognition symptoms were negatively associated with thalamic volume. Childhood physical and emotional abuse were positively and negatively associated with thalamic volume, respectively. Whole thalamus volume and volumes of the sensorimotor and limbic thalamus may play an important role in the development of PTSD and MDD in the aftermath of trauma exposure. The interaction between PTSD and MDD symptoms and contrasting effects across PTSD symptom clusters and types of childhood adversity suggests multiple neurobiological mechanisms are involved in shaping thalamic volume post-trauma.

">From Family Relationship to Regulation: Parent-Child Amygdala Activation Similarity is Linked to Prefrontal Recruitment and Youth Emotional Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Extensive research highlights the importance of parent-child similarity at psychological, behavioral, and physiological levels in fostering children's adaptation. While emerging studies have begun to explore neural similarity, little is known about the factors that influence parent-child neural similarity during adolescence or how such similarity may support youth emotional adaptation when coping with heightened uncertainty. The current study investigated the relations among family relationship quality, parent-youth neural similarity, and youth emotional adaptation using task-based fMRI. With 50 participants (25 parent-youth dyads; parent: Mage = 43.88 years, 72% female; youths: Mage = 11.16 years, 44% female), we found that higher parent-youth neural similarity in the amygdala activation patterns during emotionally uncertain situations was associated with better youths' emotional adaptation, as indicated by lower levels of anxiety and depression and higher resilience. This neural similarity mediated the beneficial effects of positive family relationships on youths' emotional adaptation. Additionally, amygdala activation similarity was associated with amygdala to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) connectivity during uncertainty in youth, revealed by generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses. This amygdala-dlPFC connectivity, in turn, was linked to better emotional adaptation in youth. Importantly, these findings were specific to uncertainty-related bottom-up processing, rather than effortful top-down regulation processing or responses to certain aversive stimuli. These findings offer new insight into how relational and neural factors jointly shape youth emotional adaptation, and suggest that parent-child neural similarity in the amygdala may serve as a mechanism for supporting implicit emotion regulation, helping youth cope with uncertain situations.

">Pain Expectations: the neural representations of predicted pain in self and others</a></h4>

              
                Predicting another's pain is a challenging decision. Predictive coding explains individual pain via top-down modulation, but its extension to vicarious pain is unknown. We tested neural representations of expected pain, uncertainty (risk), and their related errors for self versus other to assess predictive coding's explanatory power in decisions on another's pain. We hypothesized that the brain encodes expected pain, risk, and prediction errors for others, mirroring self-pain mechanisms within a predictive coding framework. Using model-based fMRI (n=33), individuals in dyads gambled on risky or certain pain relief; priced their choices; experienced or witnessed corollary pain, and rated the latter's intensity, alternating between deciding for themselves or another. Behaviorally, prosocial biases emerged in the form of greater risk aversion, higher pain relief valuation, and inflated ratings for others. Neurally, expected other-pain showed a graded representation (absent for self). Pain risk activated the dorsal striatum for both self and other, but more so for others. Pain surprise, but not signed prediction errors, elicited anterior insula activity in both targets. These findings show that predictive coding can characterize vicarious pain, suggesting that top-down priors influence decisions on another's expected and experienced pain. Importantly, the observed prosocial biases and enhanced neural processing of risk for others highlight that uncertainty exerts a stronger influence in other-regarding decision-making compared to self-regarding choice. These findings lead to significant implications for social interactions and clinical contexts involving surrogate decision-makers.

">High-intensity cardiovascular exercise facilitates online motor skill learning, with no effect of BDNF genotype</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have demonstrated that exercise can influence motor skill learning. However, the specific components of learning primed by exercise remain unclear. This study examined the effect of a preceding bout of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on the acquisition of a novel motor skill. The investigation focused on whether improvement in skill across the session was attributable to online gains during active practice or offline rest periods between practice blocks. There was also exploration as to whether common polymorphisms of the BDNF and DRD2/ANKK1 genes that regulate plasticity, learning, and memory, influenced the relationship between exercise and motor learning. It was demonstrated that HIIT enhanced skill acquisition, but that the effects of HIIT priming were not specifically attributable to within-session online or offline learning processes. Contrary to research on overnight consolidation, there was no interaction between BDNF, nor DRD2/ANKK1 genotype, with exercise primed skill learning.

">Non-invasive brain stimulation protects cognitive impairment in i.c.v.STZ injected rats: role of adult neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer like dementia, neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction is known to the critical player in explaining the cognitive impairment. Adult neurogenesis, normally a chronic and quite process is explained to have potential in the field of Alzheimer therapy. Previous research on the non-invasive brain stimulation showed that controlling pattern of stimulation externally we can regulate/ entrain neuronal activity, possibly altering the structural changes in the circuit level. However, literature investigating if non-invasive brain stimulation could hold any potential to initiate process of adult neurogenesis are scarce. In the present study, with the use of behavioural, microscopic and biochemical tools we found that extremely low frequency magnetic field at an intensity of 17.96{micro}T with sinusoidal wave of 50Hz for 2hr daily for a period of two week in streptozotocin induced animal model of sporadic Alzheimer disease can cause improvement in spatial and reference memory, influencing their swimming strategy in water maze. Which is caused by stimulation in immature neural pluripotent stem cells, with additional redox balance and mitigation of glial aggravation in brain areas like olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These changes were accompanied by neuroprotection as observed in the granular layer of dentate gyrus. Taken together, present study explains plausible mechanism of action on protection of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease through non-invasive brain stimulation.

">MARK2 in glial cells suppresses inflammatory responses and mitigates tau toxicity</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. However, signaling molecules that regulate glial activation status are not fully understood. Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) has been implicated in both immune responses and AD pathology. Here, we report that MARK2 negatively regulates glial immune responses, which protects against neurodegeneration. We found that MARK2 knockdown in the BV2 murine microglial cell line enhanced IL-6 expression in response to LPS. MARK2 knockdown enhanced IL-6 expression induced by TLR7 agonist but not stimulation of RLR pathways and cGAS-STING. In the brains of PS19 tauopathy mice, MARK2 was elevated in homeostatic microglia but reduced in activated microglia. In Drosophila expressing human tau in the retina, expression of AMP downstream of the Toll pathway in the pigment glia enhances degeneration of photoreceptor neurons. Glial knockdown of Par-1, the Drosophila ortholog of MARK2, enhanced Toll-mediated AMP expression and neurodegeneration, whereas overexpression of Par-1 in the pigment glia suppressed them. These results suggest that MARK2/Par-1 in glia negatively regulates Toll pathway-driven inflammation and protects against tau-induced neurodegeneration. These findings provide insight into the molecular underpinnings of glial inflammation in neurodegenerative conditions and highlight MARK2 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammatory responses.

">Beta Desynchronization Mediates The Impact Of Internally Directed Attention In A Dual-Task Working Memory Paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Internally directed attention (IDA), whether spontaneous or intentional, has been associated with impaired performance on externally directed cognitive tasks. Yet, the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning this disruption remain poorly understood. In the present study, we characterized the neural correlates of IDA and identified how they impact performance in a color-recall working memory task using electroencephalography (EEG). Participants performed a novel dual-task paradigm involving either self-referential (IDA) or perceptual processing of adjectives, involving externally directed attention (EDA), followed by a color recall task. IDA enhanced late positive potentials (LPP) in EEG over medial-frontal electrodes as a marker of sustained affective and self-referential engagement. Time frequency analyses further revealed increased event-related desynchronization in alpha and beta bands during stimulus encoding in the IDA condition, as well as increased alpha synchronization during the delay period, consistent with internal attention maintenance. To capture trial-level variability in task performance, we applied conditional quantile regression on the single-trial data. Results showed that beta desynchronization in interaction with condition type during encoding influenced performance significantly in trials with low errors, whereas trials with high errors in color recall were better explained by increased reaction times. These findings provide converging electrophysiological evidence for distinct neural signatures of internally directed attention and highlight their behavioral consequences in working memory performance.

">TRAMFIX: TRavelling Across Melbourne for FIXel-based analysis (a reproducibility study)</a></h4>

              
                Fixel-based analysis (FBA) has gained substantial interest for its ability to probe fibre-specific changes in the brain's white matter from diffusion-weighted imaging data. However, the reproducibility and reliability of fixel-based measures across different scanners remains largely unknown. In this work, we present TRAMFIX: a multisite dataset of travelling participants (n=10 healthy adults) scanned across four 3T MRI scanners using a harmonised multi-shell DWI protocol. DWI data were processed using two pipelines that can adopted when performing multi-site FBA studies (site-specific versus pooled processing). We extracted fixel-based measures of fibre density (FD), fibre cross-section (FC), and fibre density and cross-section (FDC), as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from the harmonised protocol. Within-subject coefficients of variation (CVws) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of FBA and DTI measures were computed at multiple resolutions of computation and analysis: (i) the whole-brain averaged level, (ii) tract-level, and (iii) fixel- or voxel-level. Fixel-based metrics demonstrated high reproducibility and reliability at the whole-brain level (CVws ranging between 0.51 % to 1.57 % and ICC between 0.93 and 0.996). While reproducibility and reliability remained high for tract-averaged FBA measures (particularly the FC and FDC metrics), some tracts exhibited lower ICC values < 0.8 for the FD measure. When examining fixel-level reliability and reproducibility clear spatial patterns emerged, with lower ICC across subcortical and cerebellar regions, and higher CVws at the cortical boundaries. Across all levels, tensor-based metrics demonstrated slightly lower reproducibility and reliability metrics than FBA measures, suggesting that FBA metrics are just as, if not more, reproducible than DTI metrics across scanners when using identical protocols. Our findings provide support for the reproducibility and reliability of fixel-based measures, highlighting their potential for use in multi-site FBA studies. Future work examining protocol-related differences, as well as appropriate harmonisation strategies when pooling data across sites and scanners, will be valuable.

">Central Amygdala Neuronal Ensembles Coordinate Visceral Pain and Its Affective Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Visceral pain and its affective component associated with cystitis remain poorly understood. Here, we delineate the role of central amygdala (CeA) neuronal ensembles in encoding and modulating cystitis-induced bladder pain and its affective components. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach combining behavioral assays, optogenetic manipulations, whole-cell electrophysiology, and activity-dependent genetic labeling, we identified functionally discrete CeA subpopulations that are selectively recruited during bladder inflammation. Bidirectional optogenetic modulation of these ensembles produced opposing effects on nocifensive and anxiety-like behaviors, indicating their causal involvement. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of FosTRAP-labeled neurons revealed distinct transcriptional signatures associated with inflammatory activation. Integrating electrophysiological and transcriptomic data, we demonstrate that cystitis drives cell type specific adaptations in CeA circuits. These findings provide mechanistic insight and uncover a molecularly and functionally defined CeA ensemble that orchestrates the sensory and affective dimensions of visceral pain.

">Individual differences in perceptual capacity depend on aperiodic slope, not alpha oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Visual processing is subject to strict capacity limitations that restrict the number of stimuli that can be individuated, that is, distinguished as separate objects, to around 3-4 items at a time. The neural mechanisms that give rise to this 'subitizing' limit are unclear. Here, we tested an account of the subitizing limit that attributes it to the amount of information that can be processed within one cycle of the 8-14 Hz alpha oscillation. This account proposes that the subitizing limit should be correlated with an individual's alpha oscillation frequency. We pitted this account against one based on neural excitatory:inhibitory balance, as indexed by the slope of the aperiodic component of the electrophysiological power spectrum. To test these accounts, we had human participants (N=51; 37 females) complete a visual enumeration task while we measured their brain activity with electroencephalography (EEG). We extracted aperiodic and alpha-band activity from the pre-stimulus period and correlated these with model-based estimates of individuals' subitizing capacity. Alpha oscillations were not correlated with subitizing capacity within-participants or as individual differences, but they were associated with other elements of enumeration performance, including baseline reaction times and the slope of the performance decrement outside the subitizing range. By contrast, individual differences in aperiodic slope reliably predicted individuals' subitizing capacity. These results suggest that differences in neural excitatory:inhibitory balance are the source of individuation-related capacity limits, not alpha-frequency sampling.

">Maternal sucrose intake during pregnancy alone disrupts testosterone and allopregnanolone levels in the fetal brain of rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intake of added sugars, such as sucrose, is high globally. In rats, a maternal high-sucrose diet (HSD) from 10 wk before pregnancy to embryonic day (E)19.5 has widespread impacts on maternal, placental, and fetal blood and brain steroid levels, including glucocorticoids, androgens, and aldosterone. Objectives: This study examined whether maternal HSD during pregnancy alone is sufficient to alter maternal, placental, and fetal steroids. Methods: Pregnant rats received either a control diet (1% kcal sucrose) or an isocaloric, nutrient-matched HSD (26% kcal sucrose) between E0.5-19.5. On E19.5, we collected maternal serum, placenta, fetal blood and brain, and amniotic fluid. We microdissected the placenta and fetal brain and measured 14 steroids using highly sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (n=12-15/diet/sex). Results: Maternal HSD during pregnancy alone did not alter maternal food intake, maternal body mass, and litter size (all p values [&ge;] 0.29, Student's t-test) but increased the percentage of males in a litter (p = 0.03, Student's t-test). Maternal HSD did not alter steroids in the maternal serum (all p values [&ge;] 0.21, Student's t-test), placenta (all p values [&ge;] 0.07, 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)), and fetal blood (all p values [&ge;] 0.13, 2-way ANOVA). Nonetheless, maternal HSD increased testosterone in the fetal nucleus accumbens (p = 0.04, 2-way ANOVA), decreased allopregnanolone in the fetal amygdala (p = 0.01, 2-way ANOVA), and decreased 11-dehydrocorticosterone in the amniotic fluid (p = 0.05, 2-way ANOVA). Conclusion: Maternal HSD during pregnancy alone does not affect steroid levels in the maternal serum, placenta, or fetal blood, but disrupts testosterone and allopregnanolone levels in critical regions of the fetal brain that regulate reward-seeking and emotion. Thus, while a long-term maternal HSD is necessary for widespread endocrine effects, the fetal brain is sensitive to short-term increases in maternal sucrose consumption during pregnancy.

">A spatial gene expression signature of the mouse brain post-injury at the focal point of contusion</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results from a primary injury that impacts the brain in a spatially-dependent manner. Here we investigated the topographical relationship of early transcriptional responses to a single, focal TBI in mice by controlled cortical impact (CCI). Guided by the presence of the anterior commissure (AC) in coronal sections at the rostro-caudal point of impact, we compared gene expression changes in the neocortex (CTX) and corpus callosum-external capsule (CC-EC), striatum (STR) and AC. Injury-induced gene expression changes were detected in the CTX, CC-EC and STR but not AC and were principally segregated based on cytoarchitecture, and secondarily by proximity to the site of impact. Additionally, unbiased spatial clustering revealed a positive relationship between proximity to the impact and the number of acutely differentially expressed genes within the laminar CTX. Gene pathways for interferon gamma response and for leukocyte-mediated migration and immunity were acutely enhanced across the injured CTX, CC-EC and STR. Within 1-week post-injury, transcriptional responses to injury in the CTX and CC-EC included gene pathways for adaptive T- and B-cell mediated immunity, whereas gene expression changes in the STR were largely resolved. Next, we examined the effects of systemic depletion of neutrophils and monocytes on spatial gene expression changes in the injured brain. This led to the upregulation of gene pathways functioning in synaptic transmission and an alternating down- and then upregulation of genes functioning in ribosomal messenger RNA translation and aerobic metabolism in mitochondria. These data suggest infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes play an evolving, multifaceted role in modulating the metabolic, transcriptional, and synaptic activity of brain tissue post-injury.

">An open-source pipeline for calcium imaging and all-optical physiology in human stem cell-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                High-throughput profiling of neuronal activity at single-cell resolution is essential for advancing our understanding of brain function, enabling large-scale functional screens, and modeling neurological disorders. However, existing approaches are limited by scalability, manual data processing, and variability, thus restricting their ability to detect disease-associated phenotypes. Here, we present a scalable, open-source platform that integrates optogenetic stimulation, calcium imaging, automated data acquisition, and a fully integrated analysis pipeline. By combining spontaneous and evoked activity profiling, the system enables robust quantification of dynamic neuronal responses across hundreds of stem cell-derived human neurons and multiple timepoints, facilitating phenotyping at both cellular and network levels. We validated the platform by recapitulating established activity phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders including CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder and SSADH deficiency. In addition, we generated CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines stably expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s to model network dysfunction in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Using this system, we further demonstrated functional rescue of the altered neuronal activity observed in the TSC following pharmacological intervention. By linking single-cell dynamics to population-level phenotypes, this framework provides a powerful and broadly applicable tool for disease modeling, mechanistic studies, and therapeutic screening across a range of neurological disorders.

">Neural dynamics underlying the persistence of perseverative thought in depression and anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Depression and anxiety are characterized by transdiagnostic symptoms, including perseverative thought: a class of thoughts such as rumination and worry that are negative, repetitive, and difficult to control. These thoughts contribute to substantial distress, poor treatment response, and increased risk of relapse. What makes perseverative thoughts persevere? Using task-based fMRI, we compared how adults with no lifetime psychopathology and adults with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or both, engaged top-down control processes to switch from personally-relevant perseverative or neutral thought to a working memory task. For only adults with clinical depression or anxiety, stopping perseverative thought was associated with more probable frontoparietal deactivation and more frequent default-mode activation versus stopping neutral thought. Using network control theory, we identified key control points that lead to these activity dynamics. We found that clinical perseverative thought elicited less controlled activity in the anterior cingulate cortex relative to thoughts in adults with no lifetime psychopathology, and lower control energy correlated with greater depression severity. The occipital-temporal, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortices also used less control energy in clinical perseverative thought. Low energy is characteristic of attractor states in dynamical systems theory, deep channels wherein the flow of activity naturally settles, analogous to how a ball needs little energy to roll to the bottom of a bowl yet more energy to leave it. Entrenchment in attractors provides a computational perspective on why top-down control signals relate to the persistence of clinical perseverative thought. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of perseverative thought, paving the way for novel interventions for depression and anxiety.

">Nerve injury promotes glial immune responses through a Draper/Ninjurin A pathway</a></h4>

              
                Degenerating neurons elicit striking immune reactions from glial cells, including directed invasion of injury sites and engulfment of neuronal debris. While these conserved glial immune responses are neuroprotective, our mechanistic understanding of glial immunity in the damaged and diseased brain is still incomplete. Here, using an in vivo nerve injury assay in the adult Drosophila olfactory system, we characterize a novel role for the transmembrane adhesion molecule Ninjurin A (NijA). We show that NijA is transcriptionally upregulated in neuropil ensheathing glia, but not local astrocytes, within hours after olfactory nerve transection. In NijA mutants, glia fail to properly infiltrate areas that contain severed olfactory nerves, and degenerating axonal debris is not cleared from the CNS. One well-defined signaling cascade critical for ensheathing glial clearance of damaged olfactory axons is the conserved MEGF10/Draper pathway, which includes the engulfment receptor Draper, downstream transcriptional complex AP-1, and known gene target MMP-1. We show that injury-induced transcription of NijA in responding glia requires the Draper receptor but is independent of MMP-1, suggesting a parallel signaling cascade is activated downstream of Draper in responding glia. Our findings reveal an essential role for the glial adhesion factor NijA in morphological and phagocytic responses to CNS damage, highlighting this conserved molecule as a new potential glial therapeutic target for neurodegenerative conditions.

">Neuronal normalization in monkey MT is an intensity-weighted average</a></h4>

              
                Normalization is a ubiquitous neuronal computation that is important for safeguarding stimulus selectivity. However, normalization strength has been found to vary greatly across neurons. Here, we show that the normalization of responses by neurons in the macaque middle temporal visual area (MT) is profoundly affected by the receptive field responsivity at each stimulus location. An intensity-weighted normalization model, in which intensity is defined as the product of stimulus contrast and a location-specific receptive field weight, explains most of the previously observed variability in normalization across neurons. It furthermore explains systematic changes in the semi-saturation contrast of contrast response functions at different receptive field locations. Finally, intensity-weighted normalization reveals that spontaneous activity can be viewed as unknown excitatory drive that has measurable intensity and contributes to normalization equivalently to experimental stimuli.

">Distinct effects of nonselective Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil and selective Rho-kinase 2 inhibitor KD025 on serotonin and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of mice</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have indicated that the Rho GTPase family and Rho-kinases are associated with psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. Rho-kinases have two subtypes, Rho-kinases 1 and 2 that regulate actin dynamics and mediate neurite outgrowth, spine morphology in neurons, and neurotransmitter release in vitro and ex vivo. However, the precise role of Rho-kinases in neurotransmitter release in vivo remains unclear. To clarify the role of Rho-kinases 1 and 2 in serotonin and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice in vivo, we investigated the effect of a nonselective Rho-kinase inhibitor, fasudil, and a selective Rho-kinase 2 inhibitor, KD025, using an in vivo microdialysis technique. Fasudil perfusion (1-20 M) into the NAc increased the basal extracellular serotonin level but did not affect dopamine levels, whereas KD025 (10-20 M) had little effect on basal serotonin and dopamine levels. Notably, fasudil perfusion into the NAc suppressed depolarization-induced serotonin and dopamine release in a dose-dependent manner, whereas KD025 selectively suppressed depolarization-induced serotonin release. Our results suggested that Rho-kinases 1 and 2 are associated with dopamine and serotonin release, respectively, and that both may have significant but distinct roles in the regulation of serotonin and dopamine release in the NAc.

">Exploring Auditory Category Distinctions in Perception and Imagery</a></h4>

              
                Imagery, the ability to generate perceptual experiences in the absence of external stimuli, is used every day when remembering a past event or imagining a novel situation. While most previous research on imagery has focused on the visual domain, the present study presents an investigation of auditory imagery. The perception of different categories of sound has been shown to evoke different neural responses. Further, the neural processes underlying auditory imagery and perception have been shown to be similar. Therefore, we hypothesized that auditory imagery would rely on similar categorical processing. Participants learned shape-sound associations and were then asked to imagine the matching sound when presented with the associated shape. We chose two example stimuli from two maximally different sound categories (human speech sounds and nonhuman environmental sounds) to investigate our hypothesis. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded while participants listened to and imagined the sounds. The mean voltage in the P2 event-related potential time window (180-280 ms) was significantly larger for perception of the speech sounds than the environmental sounds, and the late positive event-related potential complex (LPC, 350-500 ms) associated with imagery was significantly smaller for imagery of the speech sounds than the environmental sounds. This suggests that, as in perception, the neural processing of imagined sounds is categorical.

">Longitudinal Characterization of Compound Action Potentials in Chronic Vagus Nerve Recordings in Mice</a></h4>

              
                The vagus nerve (VN) mediates bidirectional communication between the body and brain to maintain physiological homeostasis; likewise, alterations in ongoing vagal signaling may be indicators of disease and/or contribute to disease pathogenesis. Even though extensively documented in acute experiments, ongoing vagal activity has not been characterized longitudinally, over days or weeks, in mice, a preferred preclinical model. In addition, even though many VN recordings in mice occur during anesthesia, the effects of anesthesia on vagal signaling are unknown. This study uses a chronic implant mouse model to record vagal activity in anesthetized and awake, behaving animals for an average of 10 weeks and up to 6 months. Individual compound action potentials (CAPs) are tracked across multiple days by quantifying comparisons in features, including firing rates, waveform shape, inter-CAP interval histograms, and phase-locking to cardiac and respiratory signals while demonstrating long-term electrode-nerve interface viability and stable signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, cytokine challenge experiments produced detectable CAP responses up to 3 months after electrode implantation. Lastly, awake recordings incorporated video analysis to identify and remove motion artifacts to preserve and extract neural and cardiac recordings during behavior. Results reveal diverse CAP populations with diverse physiological coupling and firing rates modulated by anesthesia. This work highlights the potential of chronic VN recordings to assess long-term changes in vagal activity in health and disease, with implications in discovery of autonomic markers of disease and closed-loop VNS stimulation strategies.

">Rapid decoding of neural information representation from ultra-fast functional magnetic resonance imaging signals</a></h4>

              
                High spatio-temporal resolution is crucial for neuroimaging techniques to improve our understanding of human brain function. While the fMRI signal is slow and shows a spread in latencies over space, the precision of hemodynamic response latency for each voxel is preserved and has been shown to be able to detect oscillatory hemodynamic changes approaching 1 Hz, suggesting its potential to reveal rapid neural dynamics. To examine how fast neural information can be derived from fMRI signals, we performed experiments that acquire high-field (7T) fMRI signals at an ultra-fast sampling rate (TR = 125 ms) from the visual cortex while participants observed naturalistic object stimuli. We applied multivariate pattern decoders to extract presented object-category information from the acquired signals at each sampling time after stimulus onset. Results showed that decoding accuracy rose above statistical significance less than 2 s after signal onset, faster than the peak latency of the hemodynamic response. The peak latency of the decoding accuracy was independent of variations in the hemodynamic latency of voxels used for decoding. The application of sparse decoders further revealed that rapid and accurate decoding was possible by pruning vein-rich voxels off from the multivariate voxel input to the decoders. These results suggest that a combination of ultra-fast sampling and multivariate decoding allows fast and temporally precise analysis of neural activity using fMRI signals.

">Transcriptional Regulation of Microglial Metabolic and Activation States by P2RY12</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS. Under homeostatic conditions, Microglia play critical roles orchestrating synaptic pruning, debris clearance and dead cells removals. In disease, they are powerful mediators of neuroinflammation, as they rapidly respond to injury or infection within the CNS by altering their morphology, proliferating, and releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules. Understanding the molecular pathways involved in microglial function is pivotal for advancing neurobiological research and developing effective strategies for CNS disorders. In this context, P2RY12 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is uniquely enriched in microglia in the parenchyma and a canonical marker of homeostatic, ramified microglia. However, P2RY12 is downregulated in activated microglia and in neurological conditions. The consequences of P2RY12 downregulation in disease-associated microglia and how they influence microglial activation remain poorly understood. In this study, we apply transcriptional and histological methods to explore the changes to microglia upon a genetic P2RY12 loss. Our findings reveal that P2RY12-deficient microglia experience alterations in distinct metabolic pathways while preserving overall homeostatic microglial transcriptional identity. Lack of P2RY12 alters signature genes involved in homeostatic iron metabolism. Importantly, the genes encoding proteins in the Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (Gpx4)-Glutathione (GSH) antioxidant pathway related to ferroptosis susceptibility are impaired upon microglial activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. These results highlight the critical role of P2RY12 in regulating microglial immune and metabolic transcriptional responses under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, providing insights into its involvement in CNS pathophysiology.

                <p>Neuroimaging data reveal that a functional locus ceruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system is critical in maintaining cognitive performance during aging. However, older adults show reduced LC integrity and altered functional connectivity, demonstrating both structural declines and dysfunction. The LC-NA system mediates mechanisms of attention processing and eye tracking studies have shown that older adults are slower and more distractible compared with young adults in visual search tasks. Prior studies have shown that mindfulness meditation modulates LC noradrenergic activity, increases gray matter volume in the brainstem, and improves attentional control. Thus, in a preregistered longitudinal study, we investigated whether 30&nbsp;d of guided mindfulness meditation using a mobile application improved attentional control measured with eye movements. We hypothesized that older adults would show greater benefits from the mindfulness intervention compared with young adults. In two oculomotor search tasks, we identified that guided mindfulness practice improved saccadic reaction times, but that other longitudinal benefits in goal-directed attentional control or distractibility by task-irrelevant salient stimuli may be from repeated practice. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for age differences in response to the mindfulness intervention between young, middle-aged, and older adults, nor among scores on mindfulness questionnaires. Our findings show that short-term mindfulness practice can modulate cognition, specifically with the speed of overt orienting of attention that may not be observable in self-report measures. This study is the first to show the utility of mindfulness on cognition using a highly reliable measure in eye movements and suggests future longer-term intervention studies may be warranted.</p>

                <p>Neuroscientists are increasingly initiating large-scale collaborations which bring together tens to hundreds of researchers. At this scale, such projects can tackle big challenges and engage diverse participants. Inspired by projects in mathematics, we set out to test the feasibility of widening access to such projects even further, by running a massively collaborative project in computational neuroscience. The key difference, with prior neuroscientific efforts, being that our entire project (code, results, and writing) was public from the outset, and that anyone could participate. To achieve this, we launched a public Git repository, with code for training spiking neural networks to solve a sound localization task via surrogate gradient descent. We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchronously through Git and synchronously at online workshops. Our hope was that the resulting range of participants would allow us to make discoveries that a single team would have been unlikely to find. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biological parameters, from time delays to membrane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localization in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. While our scientific results were not groundbreaking, our project demonstrates the potential for massively collaborative projects to transform neuroscience.</p>

                <p>by Hanne Zillmer, Dirk Walther</p>

With the availability of reliably predicted 3D-structures for essentially all known proteins, characterizing the entirety of compound-binding sites (binding pockets on proteins) has become a possibility. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze all compound-binding sites, i.e., the pocketomes, of eleven species from different kingdoms of life to discern evolutionary trends as well as to arrive at a global cross-species view of the pocketome universe. Computational binding site prediction was performed on all protein structures in each species as available from the AlphaFold database. The resulting set of potential binding sites was inspected for overlaps with known pockets and annotated with regard to the protein domains in which they are located. 2D-projection plots of all pockets embedded in a 128-dimensional feature space, and characterizing them with regard to selected physicochemical properties, provide informative, global pocketome maps that unveil differentiating features between pockets. Our study revealed a sub-linear scaling law of the number of unique binding sites relative to the number of unique protein structures per species. Thus, as proteome size increased during evolution and therefore potentially diversified, the number of distinct binding sites, reflecting potentially diversifying functions, grew less than proportionally. We discuss the biological significance of this finding as well as identify critical and unmet algorithmic challenges.

Mechanistic models of dynamic, interacting cell populations have yielded many insights into the growth and resolution of immune responses. Historically these models have described the behavior of pre-defined cell types based on small numbers of phenotypic markers. The ubiquity of deep phenotyping therefore presents a new challenge; how do we confront tractable and interpretable mathematical models with high-dimensional data? To tackle this problem, we studied the development and persistence of lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (TRM) in mice infected with influenza virus. We developed an approach in which dynamical model parameters and the population structure are inferred simultaneously. This method uses deep learning and stochastic variational inference and is trained on the single-cell flow-cytometry data directly, rather than on the kinetics of pre-identified clusters. We show that during the resolution phase of the immune response, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lung are phenotypically diverse, with subsets exhibiting highly distinct and time-dependent dynamics. TRM heterogeneity is maintained long-term by ongoing differentiation of relatively persistent Bcl-2<sup>hi</sup> CD4 and CD8 TRM subsets which resolve into distinct functional populations. Our approach yields new insights into the dynamics of tissue-localized immune memory, and is a novel basis for interpreting time series of high-dimensional data, broadly applicable to diverse biological systems.

Bacteria live in diverse communities, forming complex networks of interacting species. A central question in bacterial ecology is whether species engage in cooperative or competitive interactions. But this question often neglects the role of the environment. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic networks from two different open-access collections (AGORA and CarveMe) to assess pairwise interactions of different microbes in varying environmental conditions (provision of different environmental compounds). By computationally simulating thousands of environments for 10,000 pairs of bacteria from each collection, we found that most pairs were able to both compete and cooperate depending on the availability of environmental resources. This modeling approach allowed us to determine commonalities between environments that could facilitate the potential for cooperation or competition between a pair of species. Namely, cooperative interactions, especially obligate, were most common in less diverse environments. Further, as compounds were removed from the environment, we found interactions tended to degrade towards obligacy. However, we also found that on average at least one compound could be removed from an environment to switch the interaction from competition to facultative cooperation or vice versa. Together our approach indicates a high degree of plasticity in microbial interactions in response to the availability of environmental resources.

                <p>by De-fei Xiong, Yi-yang Zhang, Zhi-chao Wang, Yuan-ming Zheng, Han-qing Zhang, Gang Wang</p>

The detection of cytosolic viral nucleic acids via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) activates multiple signaling pathways, leading to the production of interferons (IFNs), which are essential for host survival during viral infection. Precise control of PRR gene expression is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. Here, we showed that Mediator complex subunit 23 (Med23) is required for the precise production of the innate immune receptor RIG-I in response to RNA virus infection. Med23 deficiency markedly enhances the production of IFN-I, proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both multiple cell lines (MEFs, RAW264.7 cells, and HeLa cells) and mouse primary macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] and peritoneal macrophages [PEMs]) infected with RNA virus VSV or stimulated with poly(I:C). Myeloid-specific Med23 knockout mice were generated to test the critical role of Med23 in host resistance to VSV infection in vivo. Mechanistically, Med23 interacts with the transcription factor forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) to negatively regulate RIG-I, thereby modulating IFN-I signaling. Collectively, these findings elucidate a previously unrecognized role of Med23 as a gatekeeper of the RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response and suggest a potential target for controlling viral infection.

Working memory (WM) is a fundamental cognitive function crucial adaptive behavior. The intricate interplay between the frontal cortex and striatum in governing WM maintenance and updating remains a central question. In this study, we employed optogenetics to demonstrate that inhibiting both dorsomedial striatum (DMS) D<sub>1</sub>R- and D<sub>2</sub>R-neurons enhances WM, while their activation impairs it across T-maze- and operant-based delayed-non-match-to-place (DNMTP) paradigms in mice. Notably, these neurons selectively modulate WM maintenance and retrieval, with no impact on encoding. Analysis through signal detection theory (SDT) revealed specific regulation of WM signal detection sensitivity, with no alterations in motivational or motor states during the operant DNMTP task. Interestingly, DMS D<sub>2</sub>R-neurons govern WM regulation under low cognitive load, switching to D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons as cognitive load increases. Activation of DMS D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons during the delay phase severely impairs WM under high cognitive load, a deficit rescued by optogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), or dopaminergic terminals in DMS. Additionally, treatment with the D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SCH39166, but not the D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist Sulpiride mitigates these impairments. Collectively, our findings propose a “relay” model wherein cognitive load-dependent WM control switches from DMS D<sub>2</sub>R- to D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons, offering nuanced, complementary, and inhibitory regulation of WM maintenance and retrieval. This study suggests potential strategies to enhance WM by promoting a suppressive state in DMS and to increase WM capacity through specific modulation of DMS D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons.

                <p>by Jeremy Mo, Hanyun Zhang, Alexander Swarbrick</p>

Cancer treatments often fall short of durable cures, yet most therapeutic strategies neglect the tumor stroma. A concerted effort is needed to understand, model, target and reprogram the tumor ‘soil’, recognizing its profound influence on cancer from tumorigenesis to therapy resistance.

Current anti-cancer treatments often neglect the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in resistance and progression. In this Perspective, the authors argue that better preclinical models, understanding of stromal heterogeneity and integration of TME assessments into drug development are needed to improve treatment efficacy.

                <p>by Ha Neul Lee, Julia C. Hardy, Emily H. Pool, Jin-Fan Zhang, Su Hyun Kim, William F. Buhl, Jessica G.H. Bruystens, Sohum Mehta, Susan S. Taylor, Jin Zhang</p>

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a ubiquitous second messenger, regulates a variety of cellular functions with high specificity. We previously showed that the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), RIα, undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate spatial compartmentalization of cAMP. However, how RIα LLPS regulates cellular function is largely unknown. Here, we identify the formation of RIα condensates in MIN6 β cells and reveal key roles for RIα LLPS in regulating β cell function. By combining CRISPR-based RIα knockout with an RIα mutant (Y122A) that exhibits defective cAMP-induced LLPS, we demonstrate that RIα LLPS drives cAMP compartmentalization to tune β cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP oscillation frequency, control insulin secretion, regulate CREB-mediated gene expression and prevent uncontrolled proliferation. Our data establish the Y122A mutant as a selective molecular tool for studying RIα LLPS and expand our understanding of the functional impact of LLPS-driven protein assemblies.

     alt="The Role of the Amygdala in Nonbreeding Aggression in Male Green Anole Lizards, Anolis carolinensis"/>
<p>During the non-breeding season, male green anoles display aggression that is regulated by the amygdala. Lesioning the amygdala led to a decrease in aggression, which was not observed in animals where the amygdala was missed or in saline controls. Also, plasma testosterone levels did not influence aggression in these males. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Aggression is a set of hostile behaviors expressed to defend and/or obtain resources. Although a social behavior network (SBN) has been postulated to explain the neural mechanisms underlying aggression, the extent of behavioral modulation by specific brain regions remains unclear. Additionally, the regulation of the SBN during the nonbreeding season (NBS) in seasonal breeders that express territorial aggression is still unknown. Thus, we aimed to study the role of one node of the SBN, the amygdala, in green anole lizards as this species displays dynamic changes in aggression, reduced testosterone levels, and increased number of neurons in the amygdala during the NBS compared to the breeding season. Male lizards were placed in a stereotactic apparatus and injected with either a neurotoxin (staurosporine) to damage the amygdala or saline as a control. These focal male lizards were also exposed to size-matched conspecifics before and 3 days after surgery to quantify aggressive behaviors. We found that partly damaging the amygdala significantly reduced aggression levels but did not affect their latency to initiate aggressive behaviors, providing support for the idea that the amygdala mediates aggression but not motivation in this species. Additionally, there was no relationship between aggression and plasma testosterone levels, suggesting that the nonbreeding aggression we measured was independent of plasma testosterone levels. These results indicate that the amygdala might play a significant role in the SBN to regulate NBS aggression and is not dependent on plasma testosterone levels.</p>

     alt="Spatial Distribution and Morphology of CaMKII-Expressing Amacrine Cells in Marmoset, Macaque, and Human Retina"/>
<p>The study shows that amacrine cells expressing the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) make up subpopulations of conventional and displaced amacrine cells. They include ON but not OFF starburst amacrine cells and multiple types of wide-field presumed GABAergic amacrine cells.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over 30 types of amacrine cells have been described in the primate retina, yet few are well characterized. Here, we investigated amacrine cells expressing the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the retinas of human, macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis, Macaca nemestrina</i>), and marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) monkeys using immunohistochemistry and intracellular injections, with a focus on displaced amacrine cells (dACs) in the ganglion cell layer. The spatial density of CaMKII-positive dACs decreases with the distance from the fovea, but in the peripheral temporal retina, the density of CaMKII-positive dACs nevertheless exceeds the density of retinal ganglion cells. In all species, CaMKII-positive dACs include cells expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) cells, but in the human retina, only 60% of the ON ChAT population is CaMKII-positive. Conversely, in the marmoset and the macaque, about 80% of ON ChAT cells co-express CaMKII, but only 55% of ON ChAT cells in humans do so. Intracellular injections of CaMKII-positive dACs with the lipophilic dye DiI revealed ON starburst and semilunar Type 3 cells in all three species, but in the human retina, at least three additional types were detected. In the inner nuclear layer, CaMKII is expressed by multiple populations of amacrine cells, which are distinguished based on their soma size and staining intensity, but OFF ChAT cells do not co-express CaMKII. We conclude that ON- and OFF-ChAT cells show distinct patterns of CaMKII expression and that the diversity of CaMKII-expressing dACs in humans is greater than that in marmoset or macaque retina.</p>

<p>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed injury-induced changes in neuronal metabolites in the primary motor cortex and lumbar cord enlargement of patients with spinal cord injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts spinal tracts and neuronal pathways, including those in the primary motor cortex (M1) and the lumbar cord enlargement (LCE) involved in motor control. This study sought to determine whether metabolite concentrations deviate between SCI and healthy controls (HC) in M1 and LCE using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and structural MRI, and if these correlate with clinical impairment. Sixteen chronic SCI (mean age: 54.7 ± 14.8y) and 19 HCs (mean age: 53.2 ± 18.8y) underwent <sup>1</sup>H-MRS to quantify metabolites along with T<sub>1</sub>- and T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted MRI to assess tissue structural changes. Associations between metabolic and structural changes and clinical impairment were also assessed. Patients showed significant atrophy in both white matter of the LCE (HC: 37.7 ± 4.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, SCI: 33.9 ± 3.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, Δ = −10.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.015) and gray matter (HC: 20.9 ± 2.1 mm<sup>2</sup>, SCI: 19.4 ± 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, Δ = −7.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.022). Total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) with respect to total creatine (tCr) was reduced in M1 of SCI (HC: 1.94 ± 0.21, SCI: 1.77 ± 0.14, ∆ = −8.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.006) and in the LCE (HC: 2.48 ± 0.76, SCI: 1.81 ± 0.80, ∆ = −27.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In conclusion, reduced tNAA/tCr in both the atrophied LCE and M1 suggests widespread neuronal changes including cell atrophy and/or cell loss after injury. These findings provide in vivo evidence for retrograde and trans-synaptic neurodegeneration, which may underline the atrophy observed in the motor system in SCI. Ultimately, this highlights the potential for metabolic and structural biomarkers to improve the monitoring of subtle neurodegeneration following SCI and to enhance future regenerative treatment strategies.</p>

                As a step toward human translation, Wang et al. demonstrate, without using contrast agents, the ability to map fine-scale cerebrovasculature (intracortical arterioles and venules) in vivo in primates using a human 7 T MRI scanner. This introduces a primate model for studying cerebral vascular architecture and hemodynamics in health and disease.

                Trinh et al. identify RNF13 as a pH- and Ca2+-dependent regulator of lysosomal positioning via ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ARL8B. They show that starvation or alkaline extracellular pH enhances RNF13 activity, while acidic intracellular pH suppresses it. This reveals a mechanism by which Ca2+ signaling and pH dynamics regulate lysosomal transport.

Neutrophil-derived serine proteases and IL-36R-dependent NETosis exacerbate lung pathogenesis, which can be ameliorated with protease inhibitors and IL-36R blockade.

                Macartney et al. characterize how male dietary macronutrients influence the proteome of brown adipose tissue, including inter-generational effects. The two clusters of proteins are correlated with BAT weight, including proteasome proteins and UCP1. Paternal dietary protein is inversely related to basigin expression in daughters, a protein important for normal BAT function.

                Xu et al. reveal a non-canonical mechanism that transduces the membrane-to-nucleus signal of auxin independent of the TIR1 pathway, uncovering a new layer of regulation in auxin signaling. Auxin promotes the GLP1-PTRE1 interaction, leading to PTRE1 retention at the plasma membrane and suppression of nuclear proteasome activity, thereby stabilizing Aux/IAA repressors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101151">Contraction-induced endocardial id2b plays a dual role in regulating myocardial contractility and valve formation</a></h4>

              
                Biomechanical cues play an essential role in sculpting organ formation. Comprehending how cardiac cells perceive and respond to biomechanical forces is a biological process with significant medical implications that remains poorly understood. Here, we show that biomechanical forces activate endocardial <i>id2b</i> (inhibitor of DNA-binding 2b) expression, thereby promoting cardiac contractility and valve formation in zebrafish. Taking advantage of the unique strengths of zebrafish, particularly the viability of embryos lacking heartbeats, we systematically compared the transcriptomes of hearts with impaired contractility to those of control hearts. This comparison identified <i>id2b</i> as a gene sensitive to blood flow. By generating a knock-in reporter line, our results unveiled the presence of <i>id2b</i> in the endocardium, and its expression is sensitive to both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. Furthermore, <i>id2b</i> loss-of-function resulted in progressive heart malformation and early lethality. Combining RNA-seq analysis, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography, we discovered profound impairment in atrioventricular (AV) valve formation and defective excitation-contraction coupling in <i>id2b</i> mutants. Mechanistically, deletion of <i>id2b</i> reduced AV endocardial cell proliferation and led to a progressive increase in retrograde blood flow. In the myocardium, <i>id2b</i> directly interacted with the bHLH component <i>tcf3b</i> (transcription factor 3b) to restrict its activity. Inactivating <i>id2b</i> unleashed its inhibition on <i>tcf3b</i>, resulting in enhanced repressor activity of <i>tcf3b</i>, which subsequently suppressed the expression of <i>nrg1</i> (neuregulin 1), an essential mitogen for heart development. Overall, our findings identify <i>id2b</i> as an endocardial cell-specific, biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene, which mediates intercellular communications between endocardium and myocardium to sculpt heart morphogenesis and function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98903">Phosphodiesterase 1A physically interacts with YTHDF2 and reinforces the progression of non-small cell lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer, and the prognosis is poor due to distant metastasis. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) in NSCLC. The RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, messenger RNA (mRNA) stability assay, and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. PDE1A has been shown to promote metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpressed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of the YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating the STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting RNAs and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated the STAT3 pathway. Mechanistic data uncover a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 axis driving NSCLC metastasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for metastatic disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104295">Meioc-Piwil1 complexes regulate rRNA transcription for differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Ribosome biogenesis is vital for sustaining stem cell properties, yet its regulatory mechanisms are obscure. Herein, we show unique properties of zebrafish <i>meioc</i> mutants in which spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) do not differentiate or upregulate rRNAs. Meioc colocalized with Piwil1 in perinuclear germ granules, but Meioc depletion resulted in Piwil1 accumulation in nucleoli. Nucleolar Piwil1 interacted with 45S pre-rRNA. <i>piwil1<sup>+/-</sup></i> spermatogonia with reduced Piwil1 upregulated rRNAs, and <i>piwil1<sup>+/-</sup>;meioc<sup>-/-</sup></i> spermatogonia recovered differentiation later than those in <i>meioc<sup>-/-</sup></i>. Further, Piwil1 interacted with Setdb1 and HP1α, and <i>meioc<sup>-/-</sup></i> spermatogonia exhibited high levels of H3K9me3 and methylated CpG in the 45S-rDNA region. These results indicate that zebrafish SSCs maintain low levels of rRNA transcription with repressive marks similar to <i>Drosophila</i> piRNA targets of RNA polymerase II, and that Meioc has a unique function on preventing localization of Piwil1 in nucleoli to upregulate rRNA transcripts and to promote SSC differentiation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102794">Rho-ROCK liberates sequestered claudin for rapid de novo tight junction formation</a></h4>

              
                The epithelial cell sheet maintains its integrity as a barrier while undergoing turnover of constituent cells. To sustain the barrier continuously, it’s essential to preserve the ‘old’ tight junctions (TJs) between cells being excluded from the sheet and their neighbors while simultaneously forming de novo TJs between newly adjacent cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of de novo TJs remain largely unknown. This study investigates two scenarios: the formation of de novo TJs during the removal of apoptotic cells from mouse monolayer epithelial sheets and during the differentiation of the granular layer in mouse stratified epidermis. We revealed that rapid claudin assembly is achieved by actively regulating the dissociation of the EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex in both situations. Furthermore, we found that the Rho-ROCK pathway initiates the activation of matriptase, which cleaves EpCAM/TROP2, resulting in the supply of polymerizable claudin from the stockpiled EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex at the plasma membrane to induce rapid de novo TJ formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103748">Social rank-order stability of mice revealed by a novel food competition paradigm in combination with available space competition paradigms</a></h4>

              
                Psychological, behavioral, and biological studies on social organization and competition with animal models are boosting. The mouse has been recognized as a valuable and economic model animal for biomedical research in social behaviors; however, currently available food competition paradigms for mice remain limited. Discrepant paradigms involving different competitive factors, such as physical strength vs psychological features, muscular confrontation vs threat perception, and boldness vs timidity, may produce task-specific win-or-lose outcomes and lead to inconsistent ranking results. Here, we developed a food competition apparatus for mice, in which contenders were a pair of mice eager to take over the same food pellet placed under a movable block in the middle of a narrow chamber where they were separated to either the right or left side. This food pellet competition test (FPCT) was designed to (1) provide researchers with a choice of new food competition paradigm and (2) expose psychological factors influencing the establishment and/or expression of social status in mice by avoiding direct physical competition between contenders. Meanwhile, we wanted to evaluate the consistency of social ranking results between FPCT and typically available space competition paradigms—tube test and warm spot test (WST). We hypothesized inconsistency of rankings of mice tested by FPCT, tube test, and WST as they possess different targets for mice to compete and different factors determining competitiveness. Interestingly, application of FPCT in combination with tube test and WST discovered unexpected consistency of mouse social competitivity and rankings in a grouped male or female mice that were housed in either a two- or three-member cage, most likely indicating that the status sense of animals is part of a comprehensive identity of self-recognition of individuals in an established social colony. Furthermore, the FPCT may facilitate research on social organization and competition, given its reliability, validity, and ease of use.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95062">Rapid and inducible mislocalization of endogenous TDP43 in a novel human model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) proteinopathy, characterized by the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP43, is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In this study, we describe the development of a new model of TDP43 proteinopathy using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Utilizing a genome engineering approach, we induced the mislocalization of endogenous TDP43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm without mutating the TDP43 gene or using chemical stressors. Our model successfully recapitulates key early and late pathological features of TDP43 proteinopathy, including neuronal loss, reduced neurite complexity, and cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation of TDP43. Concurrently, the loss of nuclear TDP43 leads to splicing defects, while its cytoplasmic gain adversely affects microRNA expression. Strikingly, our observations suggest that TDP43 is capable of sustaining its own mislocalization, thereby perpetuating and further aggravating the proteinopathy. This innovative model provides a valuable tool for the in-depth investigation of the consequences of TDP43 proteinopathy. It offers a clinically relevant platform that will accelerate the identification of potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TDP43-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including sporadic ALS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102027">Coordinated Tbx3/Tbx5 transcriptional control of the adult ventricular conduction system</a></h4>

              
                The cardiac conduction system (CCS) orchestrates the electrical impulses that enable coordinated contraction of the cardiac chambers. The T-box transcription factors <i>TBX3</i> and <i>TBX5</i> are required for CCS development and associated with overlapping and distinct human CCS diseases. We evaluated the coordinated role of <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> in the murine ventricular conduction system (VCS). We engineered a compound <i>Tbx3:Tbx5</i> conditional knockout allele for both genes located in cis on mouse chromosome 5. Conditional deletion of both T-box transcriptional factors in the VCS, using the VCS-specific <i>MinK<sup>CreERT2</sup></i>, caused loss of VCS function and molecular identity. Combined <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> deficiency in the adult VCS led to conduction defects, including prolonged PR and QRS intervals and elevated susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia. These electrophysiological defects occurred prior to detectable alterations in cardiac contractility or histologic morphology, indicative of a primary conduction system defect. <i>Tbx3:Tbx5</i> double-knockout VCS cardiomyocytes revealed a transcriptional shift toward non-CCS-specialized working myocardium, indicating a change to their cellular identity. Furthermore, optical mapping revealed a loss of VCS-specific conduction system propagation. Collectively, these findings indicate that <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> coordinate to control VCS molecular fate and function, with implications for understanding cardiac conduction disorders in humans.
