              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08831">Neural encoding of real world face perception</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social perception unfolds as we freely interact with people around us. We investigated the neural basis of real world face perception using multi electrode intracranial recordings in humans during spontaneous interactions with friends, family, and others. Computational models reconstructed the faces participants looked at during natural interactions, including facial expressions and motion, from brain activity alone. The results highlighted a critical role for the social vision pathway, a network of areas spanning parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. This network was more sharply tuned to subtle expressions compared to intense expressions, which was confirmed with controlled psychophysical experiments. These findings reveal that the human social vision pathway encodes facial expressions and motion as deviations from a neutral expression prototype during natural social interactions in real life.

                arXiv:2505.09199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework to systematically explore the propagation properties of a class of continuous in time nonlinear neural network models comprising a hierarchy of processing areas, mutually connected according to the principles of predictive coding. We precisely determine the conditions under which upward propagation, downward propagation or even propagation failure can occur in both bi-infinite and semi-infinite idealizations of the model. We also study the long-time behavior of the system when either a fixed external input is constantly presented at the first layer of the network or when this external input consists in the presentation of constant input with large amplitude for a fixed time window followed by a reset to a down state of the network for all later times. In both cases, we numerically demonstrate the existence of threshold behavior for the amplitude of the external input characterizing whether or not a full propagation within the network can occur. Our theoretical results are consistent with predictive coding theories and allow us to identify regions of parameters that could be associated with dysfunctional perceptions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09600">Phase transitions in in vivo or in vitro populations of spiking neurons belong to different universality classes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2301.09600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "critical brain hypothesis" posits that neural circuitry may be tuned close to a "critical point" or "phase transition" -- a boundary between different operating regimes of the circuit. The renormalization group and theory of critical phenomena explain how systems tuned to a critical point display scale invariance due to fluctuations in activity spanning a wide range of time or spatial scales. In the brain this scale invariance has been hypothesized to have several computational benefits, including increased collective sensitivity to changes in input and robust propagation of information across a circuit. However, our theoretical understanding of critical phenomena in neural circuitry is limited because standard renormalization group methods apply to systems with either highly organized or completely random connections. Connections between neurons lie between these extremes, and may be either excitatory (positive) or inhibitory (negative), but not both. In this work we develop a renormalization group method that applies to models of spiking neural populations with some realistic biological constraints on connectivity, and derive a scaling theory for the statistics of neural activity when the population is tuned to a critical point. We show that the scaling theories differ for models of in vitro versus in vivo circuits -- they belong to different "universality classes" -- and that both may exhibit "anomalous" scaling at a critical balance of inhibition and excitation. We verify our theoretical results on simulations of neural activity data, and discuss how our scaling theory can be further extended and applied to real neural data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10078">Spurious reconstruction from brain activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.10078v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in brain decoding, particularly visual image reconstruction, have sparked discussions about the societal implications and ethical considerations of neurotechnology. As these methods aim to recover visual experiences from brain activity and achieve prediction beyond training samples (zero-shot prediction), it is crucial to assess their capabilities and limitations to inform public expectations and regulations. Our case study of recent text-guided reconstruction methods, which leverage a large-scale dataset (Natural Scene Dataset, NSD) and text-to-image diffusion models, reveals limitations in their generalizability. We found poor performance when applying these methods to a different dataset designed to prevent category overlaps between training and test sets. UMAP visualization of the text features with NSD images showed a limited diversity of semantic and visual clusters, with overlap between training and test sets. Formal analysis and simulations demonstrated that clustered training samples can lead to "output dimension collapse," restricting predictable output feature dimensions. Simulations further showed that diversifying the training set improved generalizability. However, text features alone are insufficient for mapping to the visual space. We argue that recent realistic reconstructions may primarily be a blend of classification into trained categories and generation of inauthentic images through text-to-image diffusion (hallucination). Diverse datasets and compositional representations spanning the image space are essential for genuine zero-shot prediction. Interdisciplinary discussions grounded in understanding the current capabilities and limitations, as well as ethical considerations, of the technology are crucial for its responsible development.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08254">Efficient, simulation-free estimators of firing rates with Markovian surrogates</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.08254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are powerful mathematical models that integrate the biological details of neural systems, but their complexity often makes them computationally expensive and analytically untractable. The firing rate of an SNN is a crucial first-order statistic to characterize network activity. However, estimating firing rates analytically from even simplified SNN models is challenging due to 1) the intricate dependence between the nonlinear network dynamics and parameters, and 2) the singularity and irreversibility of spikes. In this Letter, we propose a class of computationally efficient, simulation-free estimators of firing rates. This is based on a hierarchy of Markovian approximations that reduces the complexity of SNN dynamics. We show that while considering firing rates alone is insufficient for accurate estimations of themselves, the information of spiking synchrony dramatically improves the estimator's accuracy. This approach provides a practical tool for brain modelers, directly mapping biological parameters to firing rate.

                arXiv:2501.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to human vision, locust visual systems excel at rapid and precise collision detection, despite relying on only hundreds of thousands of neurons organized through a few neuropils. This efficiency makes them an attractive model system for developing artificial collision-detecting systems. Specifically, researchers have identified collision-selective neurons in the locust's optic lobe, called lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs), which respond specifically to approaching objects. Research upon LGMD neurons began in the early 1970s. Initially, due to their large size, these neurons were identified as motion detectors, but their role as looming detectors was recognized over time. Since then, progress in neuroscience, computational modeling of LGMD's visual neural circuits, and LGMD-based robotics have advanced in tandem, each field supporting and driving the others. Today, with a deeper understanding of LGMD neurons, LGMD-based models have significantly improved collision-free navigation in mobile robots including ground and aerial robots. This review highlights recent developments in LGMD research from the perspectives of neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. It emphasizes a biologically plausible research paradigm, where insights from neuroscience inform real-world applications, which would in turn validate and advance neuroscience. With strong support from extensive research and growing application demand, this paradigm has reached a mature stage and demonstrates versatility across different areas of neuroscience research, thereby enhancing our understanding of the interconnections between neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. Furthermore, this paradigm would shed light upon the modeling and robotic research into other motion-sensitive neurons or neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09233">A Standardized Benchmark Set of Clustering Problem Instances for Comparing Black-Box Optimizers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One key challenge in optimization is the selection of a suitable set of benchmark problems. A common goal is to find functions which are representative of a class of real-world optimization problems in order to ensure findings on the benchmarks will translate to relevant problem domains. While some problem characteristics are well-covered by popular benchmarking suites, others are often overlooked. One example of such a problem characteristic is permutation invariance, where the search space consists of a set of symmetrical search regions. This type of problem occurs e.g. when a set of solutions has to be found, but the ordering within this set does not matter. The data clustering problem, often seen in machine learning contexts, is a clear example of such an optimization landscape, and has thus been proposed as a base from which optimization benchmarks can be created. In addition to the symmetry aspect, these clustering problems also contain potential regions of neutrality, which can provide an additional challenge to optimization algorithms. In this paper, we present a standardized benchmark suite for the evaluation of continuous black-box optimization algorithms, based on data clustering problems. To gain insight into the diversity of the benchmark set, both internally and in comparison to existing suites, we perform a benchmarking study of a set of modular CMA-ES configurations, as well as an analysis using exploratory landscape analysis. Our benchmark set is open-source and integrated with the IOHprofiler benchmarking framework to encourage its use in future research.

                arXiv:2505.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of electrical energy faces global challenges, such as increasing demand, the integration of distributed generation, high energy losses, and the need to improve service quality. In particular, load imbalance-where loads are not evenly distributed across the circuit phase-can reduce efficiency, shorten equipment lifespan, and increase susceptibility to service interruptions. While methods that involve shifting loads from one phase to another can be costly, they are effective when smart meters are available and implemented efficiently. This work proposes the use of genetic algorithms to optimally identify which loads should be reassigned in order to improve both phase balance and voltage quality at the end nodes of the network while minimizing the number of required changes. The algorithm was evaluated through simulations using PandaPower, a power flow analysis tool, modeling simple networks based on real-world characteristics of the electrical system in Tucum\'an.

                arXiv:2505.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Countless new machine learning models are published every year and are reported to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in \emph{top-n} recommendation. However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20525">Comparing Quantum Annealing and Spiking Neuromorphic Computing for Sampling Binary Sparse Coding QUBO Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.20525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a sparse binary representation of an image. To be precise, given an image and an overcomplete, non-orthonormal basis, we aim to find a sparse binary vector indicating the minimal set of basis vectors that when added together best reconstruct the given input. We formulate this problem with an $L_2$ loss on the reconstruction error, and an $L_0$ (or, equivalently, an $L_1$) loss on the binary vector enforcing sparsity. This yields a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO), whose optimal solution(s) in general is NP-hard to find. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we solve the sparse representation QUBOs by solving them both on a D-Wave quantum annealer with Pegasus chip connectivity via minor embedding, as well as on the Intel Loihi 2 spiking neuromorphic processor using a stochastic Non-equilibrium Boltzmann Machine (NEBM). Second, we deploy Quantum Evolution Monte Carlo with Reverse Annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2 to evolve the solution quality from the respective machines. The solutions are benchmarked against simulated annealing, a classical heuristic, and the optimal solutions are computed using CPLEX. Iterated reverse quantum annealing performs similarly to simulated annealing, although simulated annealing is always able to sample the optimal solution whereas quantum annealing was not always able to. The Loihi 2 solutions that are sampled are on average more sparse than the solutions from any of the other methods. We demonstrate that both quantum annealing and neuromorphic computing are suitable for binary sparse coding QUBOs, and that Loihi 2 outperforms a D-Wave quantum annealer standard linear-schedule anneal, while iterated reverse quantum annealing performs much better than both unmodified linear-schedule quantum annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2.

                <p>The mammalian circadian system regulates all biological processes, thereby ensuring optimal function at the appropriate times of day. Animal studies that examine neurobehavioral processes at different times of day, including during the animal's active phase, may provide important new biomedical insights. A logistical problem for the study of nocturnal laboratory rodents is the potential confounding influence of nighttime light exposure, which may cause circadian disruption and alteration of behavior. The historical solution has been to use red light illumination, which is widely believed to be undetected by the rodent visual system. However, some recent studies have questioned this belief. We, therefore, tested the effects of nighttime exposure to commonly used red light conditions on the circadian non-image forming and the image forming visual systems of female and male laboratory rodents. We found that brief dim red light exposure to a range of red light wavelengths produces strong activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus master clock, rapid suppression of melatonin secretion, and a subsequent phase shift in daily activity onsets. We also found in an operant behavioral task that rats are able to detect long wavelengths of red light, but not near-infrared light. Thus, both the non-image and image forming visual systems of laboratory rodents are responsive to red light conditions that are often used in animal research. The use of red light for laboratory rodent research and animal care should be carefully considered in terms of its possible confounding influences on research objectives.</p>

                <p>Recently discovered constituents of the brain waves&mdash;the <I>oscillons</I>&mdash;provide a high-resolution representation of the extracellular field dynamics. Here, we study the most robust, highest-amplitude oscillons recorded in actively behaving male rats, which underlie the traditional <I></I>-waves. The resemblances between <I></I>-oscillons and the conventional <I></I>-waves are manifested primarily at the ballpark level&mdash;mean frequencies, mean amplitudes, and bandwidths. In addition, both hippocampal and cortical oscillons exhibit a number of intricate, behavior-attuned, transient properties that suggest a new vantage point for understanding the <I></I>-rhythms&rsquo; structure, origins and functions. In particular, we demonstrate that oscillons are frequency-modulated waves, with speed-controlled parameters, embedded into a weak noise background. We also use a basic model of neuronal synchronization to contextualize and to interpret the oscillons. The results suggest that the synchronicity levels in physiological networks are fairly low and are modulated by the animal&rsquo;s physiological state.</p>

                <p>The striatum is thought to switch flexibly between multiple converging inputs to support adaptive behavior. The "communication through coherence" (CTC) hypothesis is a potential mechanism to implement such a flexible switching. For CTC to work in the striatum, striatal excitability must show rhythmic fluctuations, such as those related to the phase of the striatal local field potential (LFP). To test this fundamental requirement, we delivered a constant input stimulus to ChR2-expressing striatal fast-spiking PV+ interneurons (FSIs) in head-fixed awake mice (PV-Cre:Ai-32, <I>n</I> = 18, 9 female) and determined whether the response to this stimulus varied with LFP phase. We found that approximately one-third (41.2%) of FSIs exhibited significant phase-dependent excitability in at least one LFP frequency band. Phase-dependent excitability was most prominent in the delta (2&ndash;5&nbsp;Hz) frequency band, both in terms of prevalence (23.5% of FSIs sampled) and magnitude (phase modulation strength: 22% of average response). The most excitable phase tended to align with endogenous phase-locking, again most clearly in the delta band. These results bolster the functional relevance of the striatal field potential and spike-field relationships and provide proof-of-principle support for the possibility of CTC in the striatum.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e0601242025?rss=1">A Role for {delta} Subunit-Containing GABAA Receptors on Parvalbumin-Positive Neurons in Maintaining Electrocortical Signatures of Sleep States</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors containing  subunits have been shown to mediate tonic/slow inhibition in the CNS. These receptors are typically found extrasynaptically and are activated by relatively low levels of ambient GABA in the extracellular space. In the mouse neocortex,  subunits are expressed by some pyramidal cells as well as on parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons. An important function of PV+ interneurons is the organization of coordinated network activity that can be measured by EEG. However, it remains unclear what role tonic/slow inhibitory control of PV+ neurons may play in shaping oscillatory activity. After validating expected functional loss of -associated current in cortex of PV cKO mice of both sexes, we performed EEG recordings to survey network activity across wake and sleep states. PV cKO mice showed altered spectral content of EEG during NREM and REM sleep that was a result of increased oscillatory activity in NREM and the emergence of transient high-amplitude bursts of theta-frequency activity during REM. Viral reintroduction of <I>Gabrd</I> to PV+ interneurons in PV cKO mice rescued REM EEG phenotypes, supporting an important role for  subunit-mediated inhibition of PV+ interneurons for maintaining normal REM cortical oscillations.</p>

                <p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a crucial role in value-based decisions. While much is known about how OFC neurons represent values, far less is known about information encoded in OFC local field potentials (LFPs). LFPs are important because they can reflect subthreshold activity not directly coupled to spiking and because they are potential targets for less invasive forms of brain&ndash;machine interface (BMI). We recorded neural activity in the OFC of male macaques performing a two-option value-based decision task. We compared the value- and decision-coding properties of high-gamma LFPs (HG, 50&ndash;150&nbsp;Hz) to the coding properties of spiking multiunit activity (MUA) recorded concurrently on the same electrodes. HG and MUA both represented the values of decision targets, but HG signals had value-coding features that were distinct from concurrently measured MUA. On average HG amplitude increased monotonically with value, whereas in MUA the value encoding was net neutral on average. HG encoded a signal consistent with a comparison between target values, a signal which was negligible in MUA. In individual channels, HG could predict choice outcomes more accurately than MUA; however, when channels were combined in a population-based decoder, MUA was more accurate than HG. In summary, HG signals reveal value-coding features in OFC that could not be observed from spiking activity, including representation of value comparisons and more accurate behavioral predictions. These results have implications for the role of OFC in value-based decisions and suggest that high-frequency LFPs may be a viable&mdash;or even preferable&mdash;target for BMIs to assist cognitive function.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior rests on predictions based on statistical regularities in the environment. Such regularities pertain to stimulus contents ("what") and timing ("when"), and both interactively modulate sensory processing. In speech streams, predictions can be formed at multiple hierarchical levels of contents (e.g., syllables vs words) and timing (faster vs slower time scales). Whether and how these hierarchies map onto each other remains unknown. Under one hypothesis, neural hierarchies may link "what" and "when" predictions within sensory processing areas: with lower versus higher cortical regions mediating interactions for smaller versus larger units (syllables vs words). Alternatively, interactions between "what" and "when" regularities might rest on a generic, sensory-independent mechanism. To address these questions, we manipulated "what" and "when" regularities at two levels&mdash;single syllables and disyllabic pseudowords&mdash;while recording neural activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy volunteers (<I>N</I> = 22). We studied how neural responses to syllable and/or pseudoword deviants are modulated by "when" regularity. "When" regularity modulated "what" mismatch responses with hierarchical specificity, such that responses to deviant pseudowords (vs syllables) were amplified by temporal regularity at slower (vs faster) time scales. However, both these interactive effects were source-localized to the same regions, including frontal and parietal cortices. Effective connectivity analysis showed that the integration of "what" and "when" regularity selectively modulated connectivity within regions, consistent with gain effects. This suggests that the brain integrates "what" and "when" predictions that are congruent with respect to their hierarchical level, but this integration is mediated by a shared and distributed cortical network.</p>

                <p>High-level perception results from interactions between hierarchical brain systems responsive to gradually increasing feature complexities. During reading, the initial evaluation of simple visual features in the early visual cortex (EVC) is followed by orthographic and lexical computations in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC). While similar visual regions are engaged in tactile Braille reading in congenitally blind people, it is unclear whether the visual network maintains or reorganizes its hierarchy for reading in this population. Combining fMRI and chronometric transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), our study revealed a clear correspondence between sighted and blind individuals (both male and female) on how their occipital cortices functionally supports reading and speech processing. Using fMRI, we first observed that vOTC, but not EVC, showed an enhanced response to lexical vs nonlexical information in both groups and sensory modalities. Using TMS, we further found that, in both groups, the processing of written words and pseudowords was disrupted by the EVC stimulation at both early and late time windows. In contrast, the vOTC stimulation disrupted the processing of these written stimuli only when applied at late time windows, again in both groups. In the speech domain, we observed TMS effects only for meaningful words and only in the blind participants. Overall, our results suggest that, while the responses in the deprived visual areas might extend their functional response to other sensory modalities, the computational gradients between early and higher-order occipital regions are retained, at least for reading.</p>

                <p>Aquatic animals need tightly choreographed movements to efficiently navigate through open waters. Radially symmetric animals, like jellyfish, face the additional challenge of having to respond to regionalized sensory stimuli at the margin of their bell with an orchestrated motor response that initiates predation or escape. The nerve net of hydrozoan jellyfish comprises a condensed ring of electrically coupled neurons, that process sensory input and control the motor output. Here, we aim to understand the coupling of neural activity and motor response by developing a biophysical computational model of the swimming-motor-net of a hydrozoan jellyfish and let it control a swimming jellyfish in a fluid simulation. We find that the neuron activity can synchronize while the signal travels around the ring, eventually triggering a bidirectional wave of activation in the muscles. This mechanism explains seemingly contradicting electrophysiological experiments and minimizes muscle contraction time. Hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that this setup enables symmetric movement even if neural input is highly asymmetric. We hypothesize that the development of this ring structure supports the jet propulsion by which hydrozoan jellyfish swim. These findings show the importance of considering whole body anatomy and movement when investigating neural design.</p>

                <p>Clinical trials with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) use weak electric fields that have yet to demonstrate measurable behavioral effects in animal models. We hypothesized that weak stimulation will produce sizable effects, provided it is applied concurrently with behavioral training and repeated over multiple sessions. We tested this in a rodent model of dexterous motor skill learning using a pellet-reaching task in <I>ad libitum</I> behaving rats. The task was automated to minimize experimenter bias. We measured field magnitudes intracranially to calibrate the stimulation current. Male rats were trained for 20&nbsp;min with concurrent epicranial tDCS over 10 daily sessions. We developed a new electrode montage that enabled stable stimulation over the 10 sessions with a field intensity of 2 V/m at the motor cortex. Behavior was recorded with high-speed video to quantify reaching dynamics. We also measured motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) bilaterally with epidural microstimulation. The number of successful reaches improved across days of training, and the rate of learning was higher in the anodal group as compared with sham-control animals (<I>F</I><SUB>(1)</SUB> = 7.12; <I>p</I> = 0.008; <I>N</I> = 24). MEPs were not systematically affected by tDCS. Post hoc analysis suggests that tDCS modulated motor learning only for right-pawed animals, improving success of reaching but limiting stereotypy in these animals. Repeated and concurrent anodal tDCS can boost motor skill learning at clinically relevant field intensities. In this animal model, the effect interacted with paw preference and was not associated with corticospinal excitability.</p>

                <p>The detection of temporally unpredictable visual targets depends on the preceding phase of alpha oscillations (~7&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz). In audition, however, such an effect seemed to be absent. Due to the transient nature of its input, the auditory system might be particularly vulnerable to information loss that occurs if relevant information coincides with the low-excitability phase of the oscillation. We therefore hypothesized that effects of oscillatory phase in audition will be restored if auditory events are made task irrelevant and information loss can be tolerated. To this end, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 29 human participants (21F) while they detected pure tones at one sound frequency and ignored others. Confirming our hypothesis, we found that the neural response to task-irrelevant but not to task-relevant tones depends on the prestimulus phase of neural oscillations. Alpha oscillations modulated early stages of stimulus processing, whereas theta oscillations (~3&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz) affected later components, possibly related to distractor inhibition. We also found evidence that alpha oscillations alternate between sound frequencies during divided attention. Together, our results suggest that the efficacy of auditory oscillations depends on the context they operate in and demonstrate how they can be employed in a system that heavily relies on information unfolding over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e1545242025?rss=1">The Administration of Ketamine Is Associated with Dose-Dependent Stabilization of Cortical Dynamics in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>During wakefulness, external stimuli elicit conscious experiences. In contrast, dreams and drug-induced dissociated states are characterized by vivid internally generated conscious experiences and reduced ability to perceive external stimuli. Understanding the physiological distinctions between normal wakefulness and dissociated states may therefore disambiguate signatures of responsiveness to external stimuli from those that underlie conscious experience. The hypothesis that conscious experiences are associated with brain criticality has received considerable theoretical and experimental support. Consistent with this hypothesis, statistical signatures of criticality are similar in normal wakefulness and dissociative states but are abolished in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia. Thus, while statistical measures of criticality are associated with the ability to have conscious experience, they do not readily distinguish between perception of the external world from internally generated percepts. Here, we investigate distinct, dynamical, signatures of criticality during escalating ketamine doses in high-density EEG in human male volunteers. We show that during normal wakefulness, EEG is found at a critical point between damped and exploding oscillations. With increasing doses of ketamine, as dissociative symptoms intensify, activity is progressively stabilized&mdash;most prominently at higher frequencies. We also show that stabilization is a more reliable marker of the effects of ketamine than conventional measures such as power spectra. These findings suggest that stabilization of cortical dynamics correlates with decreased ability to respond to and perceive external stimuli rather than the ability to have conscious experiences per se. Altogether, these results suggest that combining statistical and dynamical criticality measures may distinguish wakefulness, dissociation, and unconsciousness.</p>

                <p>The unfolding of neural population activity can be described as a dynamical system. Stability in the latent dynamics that characterize neural population activity has been linked with consistency in animal behavior, such as motor control or value-based decision-making. However, whether such characteristics of neural dynamics can explain visual perceptual behavior is not well understood. To study this, we recorded V4 populations in two male monkeys engaged in a non-match-to-sample visual change-detection task that required sustained engagement. We measured how the stability in the latent dynamics in V4 might affect monkeys&rsquo; perceptual behavior. Specifically, we reasoned that unstable sensory neural activity around dynamic attractor boundaries may make animals susceptible to taking incorrect actions when withholding action would have been correct ("false alarms"). We made three key discoveries: (1) greater stability was associated with longer trial sequences; (2) false alarm rate decreased (and response times slowed) when neural dynamics were more stable; and (3) low stability predicted false alarms on a single-trial level, and this relationship depended on the position of the neural activity within the state space, consistent with the latent neural state approaching an attractor boundary. Our results suggest the same outward false alarm behavior can be attributed to two different potential strategies that can be disambiguated by examining neural stability: (1) premeditated false alarms that might lead to greater stability in population dynamics and faster response time and (2) false alarms due to unstable sensory activity consistent with misperception.</p>

                <p>Leucine zipper protein 1 (LUZP1) functions in the maintenance and dynamics of the cytoskeleton by interacting with actin and microtubules. Deficiency or mutation of LUZP1 is associated with brain developmental disorders; however, its precise role in brain function remains unclear. We showed that LUZP1 localizes to actin and is highly expressed in CaMKII&alpha;-expressing neurons within the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus. Depletion of LUZP1 impedes dendritic spine maturation, which is characterized by excess immature filopodia and loss of mature mushroom spines both in vitro and in vivo. LUZP1 knockdown reduces spontaneous electrical activity and synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Conditional deletion of LUZP1 in CaMKII&alpha;-expressing neurons causes impaired learning and memory behavior in mice of both sexes. Mechanistically, LUZP1 control dendritic maturation by directly interacting with filamin A and modulating the Rac1-PAK1 signaling pathway. These findings shed light on the role of LUZP1 in regulating synaptic plasticity and brain function.</p>

                <p>Established models of motor skill learning posit that early stages of learning are dominated by an attentionally demanding, effortful mode of control supported by associative corticostriatal circuits involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). As skill develops, automatic and "effortless" performance coincides with a transition to a reliance on sensorimotor circuits that include primary motor cortex (M1). However, the dynamics of how control evolves during the transition from novice to expert are currently unclear. This lack of clarity is due, in part, to the fact that most motor learning studies comprise a limited number of training sessions and rely on correlative techniques such as neuroimaging. Here, we train human participants (both sexes) on a discrete motor sequencing task over the course of 6&nbsp;weeks, followed by an assessment of the causal roles of DLPFC and M1 at varying levels of expertise. We use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to transiently disrupt activity in these regions immediately prior to performance in separate sessions. Our results confirm the dissociable importance of DLPFC and M1 as training progresses. DLPFC stimulation leads to larger behavioral deficits for novice skills than more highly trained skills, while M1 stimulation leads to relatively larger deficits as training progresses. However, our results also reveal that prefrontal disruption causes performance deficits at all levels of training. These findings challenge existing models and indicate an evolving rather than a strictly diminishing role for DLPFC throughout learning.</p>

                <p>Lucid dreaming (LD) is a state of conscious awareness of the ongoing oneiric state, predominantly linked to REM sleep. Progress in understanding its neurobiological basis has been hindered by small sample sizes, diverse EEG setups, and artifacts like saccadic eye movements. To address these challenges in characterizing the electrophysiological correlates of LD, we introduced an adaptive multistage preprocessing pipeline, applied to human data (male and female) pooled across laboratories, allowing us to explore sensor- and source-level markers of LD. We observed that, while sensor-level differences between LD and nonlucid REM sleep were minimal, mixed-frequency analysis revealed broad low alpha to gamma power reductions during LD compared with wakefulness. Source-level analyses showed significant beta power (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) reductions in right central and parietal areas, including the temporoparietal junction, during LD. Moreover, functional connectivity in the alpha band (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) increased during LD compared with nonlucid REM sleep. During initial LD eye signaling compared with the baseline, source-level gamma1 power (30&ndash;36&nbsp;Hz) increased in right temporo-occipital regions, including the right precuneus. Finally, functional connectivity analysis revealed increased interhemispheric and inter-regional gamma1 connectivity during LD, reflecting widespread network engagement. These results suggest that distinct source-level power and connectivity patterns characterize the dynamic neural processes underlying LD, including shifts in network communication and regional activation that may underlie the specific changes in perception, memory processing, self-awareness, and cognitive control. Taken together, these findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of LD, laying the groundwork for decoding the mechanisms of this intriguing state of consciousness.</p>

                <p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method that has been used to treat various brain disorders. The modulatory effects of rTMS can be adjusted by changing the repetition patterns. Theta-burst magnetic stimulation (TBS) is a magnetic stimulation pattern that can induce long-lasting modulatory effects with a short stimulation period. However, its effects on auditory brain regions remain unclear because of a lack of animal studies in which invasive techniques allow for a detailed exploration of the underlying neural mechanisms. In the current study, we investigated the effects of TBS on the C57BL/6J mouse auditory cortex using a custom-built 7&nbsp;mm magnetic stimulation coil. Extracellular recordings were made before, during, and after the application of intermittent TBS (iTBS), continuous TBS (cTBS), or sham stimulation. Local field potential amplitudes were increased for 5&ndash;20&nbsp;min post-iTBS compared with the sham condition and were decreased at 10&nbsp;min post-cTBS compared with the sham condition. The bidirectional modulatory effects observed in our study are consistent with previous findings from other brain regions. Additionally, multiunit activities were significantly altered in cortical layers 2/3 and 4 but not layer 5, indicating that the modulatory effects were localized to the surface region of the auditory cortex. Interestingly, in the iTBS group, the amplitude of average spike waveforms increased with a 15&nbsp;min delay. Our findings provide physiological evidence of TBS modulation of the rodent auditory cortex and may guide future research seeking to optimize rTMS for modulating hearing abilities.</p>

                <p>Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is one of the most highly expressed HDACs in the brain shown to be a negative regulator of long-term memory formation. HDAC3 has also been shown to be involved in cocaine-associated behaviors, demonstrated by manipulations in the nucleus accumbens. Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of a dominant negative of a key HDAC3 target gene, nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2), in cholinergic neurons of the medial habenula (MHb) blocked reinstatement of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) as well as cue-induced intravenous self-administration (IVSA). Together, these findings suggested that HDAC3 would also be important for MHb-dependent reinstatement of CPP and IVSA, which we examined in this study. Contrary to our hypothesis, our results found that expression of an HDAC3 deacetylase dead point mutant within the cholinergic neurons of the mouse MHb had no effect on reinstatement or other cocaine-induced behaviors.</p>

                Introduction Oro-facial pain presents a significant diagnostic challenge due to its diverse etiologies, including dental, musculoskeletal, neurological, sinus-related, and mucosal conditions. The overlapping clinical symptoms often complicate the diagnostic process, especially in primary care settings. While traditional methods such as symptom evaluation and basic clinical tests are routinely used, the diagnostic accuracy of these approaches remains unclear across various conditions. This underscores the need for a comprehensive evidence synthesis to evaluate the performance of clinical signs, symptoms, and point-of-care (POC) tests. Protocol This protocol outlines a suite of eight systematic reviews and meta-analyses, each focused on a specific cause of oro-facial pain: pulpal/periapical pathology, periodontal disease, temporomandibular disorders, maxillary sinusitis, neuralgias, salivary gland disorders, bone-related pathologies, and mucosal conditions. The reviews will include cross-sectional, cohort, and diagnostic randomized controlled trials that compare one or more index tests to recognized reference standards such as histological evaluation, advanced imaging, or consensus-based clinical diagnosis. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted across multiple databases. Methodological quality will be assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and statistical analysis will include meta-analytic models (bivariate and HSROC) to synthesize diagnostic performance measures including sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios. Discussion This review suite aims to bridge the knowledge gap in diagnostic accuracy of clinical and POC tests used in the evaluation of oro-facial pain. By systematically appraising and synthesizing available evidence, the findings are expected to guide clinicians in selecting the most reliable diagnostic tools tailored to specific conditions. Ultimately, this work may support better diagnostic decision-making, reduce unnecessary interventions, and improve patient outcomes in both general and specialized dental care settings.

                Background Self-harm is a serious public health problem across the world, impacting not only people who self-harm but also their families and society as a whole through higher resource costs and productivity losses. This review was conducted among the general Saudi population to investigate the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and factors affecting it. Methods An electronic literature search of four major databases, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus Science Direct, and Google Scholar, was conducted to include eligible studies. All studies reporting NSSI or relevant to the subject were included. Results A total of five articles with 1758 participants were included. The lowest recorded NSSI prevalence was 0.47% while the highest was 10.2%, both in Al-Khobar city. Conclusion We recorded a relatively low but increasing prevalence of NSSI. The review also demonstrated that NSSI was more common among the female population and young people. Self-poisoning, including drug overdose, was the most prevalent method of self-harm. Interpersonal difficulties, marital problems, academic failure, and family and self-conflicts were common motivating factors of NSSI.

                Background Sushruta (600 B.C.) described a condition called “Vidari” linked with progressive narrowing of mouth, depigmentation of the oral mucosa, and pain on taking food, oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF). With an overall Indian prevalence rate of between 0.2–0.5%, OSMF is primarily found in India and Southeast Asia, according to global estimations. Patients with OSMF need regular follow-ups and to maintain this follow-up it is not always possible for the patient to visit a dental clinic. Hence developing a smartphone-based application for the follow-up of OSMF will be of great value to the patients. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone application on OSMF self-examination in the follow-up of patients. Methods There will be three phases of the research. The first phase will be the development of a smartphone-based application for the follow-up of patients with OSMF. The second phase will be distribution and training the patients regarding the usage of the application and the third phase will be evaluating the effectiveness of the smartphone application in maintaining the follow-up of the patients. Expected results The follow-up of patients with OSMF is expected to be better and feasible using a smartphone application as compared to regular Outpatient Department-based follow-up. Conclusions Designing a mobile application for the ease of users presents difficulties since it must take user-friendliness and accessibility into account, which influences how well the application is received by users. In addition to follow-up, the smartphone-based application promotes the awareness towards Self-examination and knowledge in OSMF patients. Thus, it will act as an educational tool providing information, to enhance OSMF screening practice. CTRI registration CTRI/2023/06/054514 (registration pending).

                <p>by Sneha Aenugu, John P. O’Doherty</p>

Extended goals necessitate extended commitment. We address how humans select between multiple goals in a temporally extended setting. We probe whether humans engage in prospective valuation of goals by estimating which goals are likely to yield future success and choosing those, or whether they rely on a less optimal retrospective strategy, favoring goals with greater accumulated progress even if less likely to result in success. To address this, we introduce a novel task in which goals need to be persistently selected until a set target is reached to earn an overall reward. In a series of experiments, we show that human goal selection involves a mix of prospective and retrospective influences, with an undue bias in favor of retrospective valuation. We show that a goal valuation model utilizing the concept of ‘momentum’, where progress accrued toward a goal builds value and persists across trials, successfully explains human behavior better than alternative frameworks. Our findings thus suggest an important role for momentum in explaining the valuation process underpinning human goal selection.

From the intimate realm of personal interactions to the sprawling arena of political discourse, discerning the trustworthy from the dubious is crucial. Here, we present a novel behavioral task and accompanying Bayesian models that allow us to study key aspects of this learning process in a tightly controlled setting. In our task, participants are confronted with several different types of (mis-)information sources, ranging from ones that lie to ones with biased reporting, and have to learn these attributes under varying degrees of feedback. We formalize inference in this setting as a doubly Bayesian learning process where agents simultaneously learn about the ground truth as well as the qualities of an information source reporting on this ground truth. Our model and detailed analyses reveal how participants can generally follow Bayesian learning dynamics, highlighting a basic human ability to learn about diverse information sources. This learning is also reflected in explicit trust reports about the sources. We additionally show how participants approached the inference problem with priors that held sources to be helpful. Finally, when outside feedback was noisier, participants still learned along Bayesian lines but struggled to pick up on biases in information. Our work pins down computationally the generally impressive human ability to learn the trustworthiness of information sources while revealing minor fault lines when it comes to noisier environments and news sources with a slant.

                <p>by Salwan Butrus, Hannah R. Monday, Christopher J. Yoo, Daniel E. Feldman, Karthik Shekhar</p>

Mouse whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) is a major model system to study the experience-dependent plasticity of cortical neuron physiology, morphology, and sensory coding. However, the role of sensory experience in regulating neuronal cell type development and gene expression in wS1 remains poorly understood. We assembled a transcriptomic atlas of wS1 during postnatal development comprising 45 molecularly distinct neuronal types that can be grouped into eight excitatory and four inhibitory neuron subclasses. Between postnatal day (P) 12, the onset of active whisking, and P22, when classical critical periods close, ~ 250 genes were regulated in a neuronal subclass-specific fashion when whisker experience was normal. At the resolution of neuronal types, only the composition of layer (L) 2/3 glutamatergic neurons, but not other neuronal types, changed substantially between P12 and P22. These postnatal compositional changes in L2/3 neuronal types resemble those observed previously in the primary visual cortex (V1), and the temporal gene expression changes were also highly conserved between the regions. Unlike V1, however, cell type maturation in wS1 is not substantially dependent on sensory experience, as 10-day full-face whisker deprivation from P12 to P22 did not influence the transcriptomic identity nor composition of L2/3 neuronal types. A one-day competitive whisker deprivation protocol from P21 to P22 also did not affect cell type identity but induced moderate changes in plasticity-related gene expression. Thus, developmental maturation of cell types is similar in V1 and wS1, but sensory deprivation minimally affects cell type development in wS1.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003163">Phosphatase-independent activity of smooth-muscle calcineurin orchestrates a gene expression program leading to hypertension</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paula Sofía Yunes-Leites, Yilin Sun, Sara Martínez-Martínez, Álvaro Alfayate, Marta Toral, María José Méndez-Olivares, Ángel Colmenar, Ana Isabel Torralbo, Dolores López-Maderuelo, Sergio Mateos-García, David N. Cornfield, Jesús Vázquez, Juan Miguel Redondo, Miguel R. Campanero</p>

Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) drives pathological vascular wall remodeling in hypertension and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Previous studies showed that the phosphatase activity of calcineurin (Cn) mediates Ang-II-induced AAA, but the cell type involved in the action of Cn in AAA formation remained unknown. Here, by employing newly created smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific and endothelial cell (EC)-specific Cn-deficient mice (SM-Cn<sup>−/−</sup> and EC-Cn<sup>−/−</sup> mice), we show that Cn expressed in SMCs, but not ECs, was required for Ang-II-induced AAA. Unexpectedly, SMC Cn also played a structural role in the early onset and maintenance of Ang-II-induced hypertension, independently of its known phosphatase activity. Among the signaling pathways activated by Ang-II, Cn signaling is essential in SMCs, as nearly 90% of the genes regulated by Ang-II in the aorta required Cn expression in SMCs. Cn orchestrated, independently of its enzymatic activity, the induction by Ang-II of a transcriptional program closely related to SMC contractility and hypertension. Cn deletion in SMCs, but not its pharmacological inhibition, impaired the regulation of arterial contractility. Among the genes whose regulation by Ang-II required Cn expression but not its phosphatase activity, we discovered that <i>Serpine1</i> was critical for Ang-II-induced hypertension. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1, the protein encoded by <i>Serpine1</i>, impaired SMCs contractility and readily regressed hypertension. Mechanistically, <i>Serpine1</i> induction was mediated by Smad2 activation via the structural role of Cn. These findings uncover an unexpected role for Cn in vascular pathophysiology and highlight PAI-1 as a potential therapeutic target for hypertension.

                Background There has been an increase in prescription drug misuse globally, with individuals using medications in ways other than prescribed. This can cause serious health risks, including death. Gender differences in prescription drug misuse have been observed with women misusing medication more than men. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to explore the extent of this problem providing preliminary findings for a larger study that will inform relevant interventions and health policy responses. We conducted 12 in-depth interviews, and four focus group discussions with young women and girls aged 17-25 years. Thematic content analysis was conducted. Results Our results indicated that family and peer influence contributed to prescription drug misuse, despite participants' negative attitudes toward this due to the associated health risks. Secondly, social and environmental factors such as easy access to prescription drugs within the community contributed to misuse. Conclusion Targeted awareness and intervention programs for young women and girls are needed to highlight the health risks and dangers associated with this problem.

                Background Inflammation is the key contributor to the development of atherosclerotic plague. This study aims to evaluate the protective and autophagy induction properties of pterostilbene and sitagliptin on modulating the degree of atherosclerosis in rabbit models treated with an atherogenic diet. Methods 80 rabbits were randomly placed into one of four study groups (20 in each group): normal control diet (NC) fed normal diet for eight weeks, atherogenic control (AC) fed atherogenic diet for eight weeks, pterostilbene treated group (PT) fed atherogenic diet with pterostilbene (at 10 mg/kg/day) orally daily for eight weeks, and sitagliptin treated group (ST) fed atherogenic diet with sitagliptin (at 12 mg/kg/day) orally daily for eight weeks. Results While serum lipids and F2-isoprostane were elevated significantly in the AC study cohort compared to NC study cohort, (P < 0.001), both pterostilbene and sitagliptin supplementations provided significant improvements in serum lipid parameters and F2-isoprostane in the PT study cohort and ST study cohort, respectively, when compared to the AC study cohort, (P<0.001). Total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels were significantly reduced among the PT and ST study cohorts as compared to the AC study cohort. This was coupled with a significant rise in LC3B levels (marker of tissue autophagy) among the PT study cohort and the ST study cohort, as compared to the AC study cohort, (P < 0.001). The RNA expression of mTORC1 was reduced significantly at both PT study cohort and ST study cohort, (P<0.001). Pterostilbene supplementation induced a significant reduction in tissue expression of PI3K and AKT, (P<0.01), while sitagliptin induced significant increase in 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels, (P<0.001). Conclusions The results indicate that pterostilbene and/or sitagliptin supplementation can significantly improve the outcome of atherosclerosis due to their effects on the inflammatory pathways which hinder the progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation.

                Background This study aimed to determine the accuracy of CYFRA 21-1 using urine creatinine correction (CYFRA/Cr) as a biomarker of endometriosis. Methods This study includes 73 patients from the Indonesian population, with 38 endometriosis and 35 non-endometriosis patients based on laparoscopy. Urine detection of CYFRA 21-1 was done by ELISA method and corrected by urine creatinine constant factor (CYFRA/Cr). Urine creatinine us detected using the ECLIA method. Results The CYFRA/Cr ratio was identified in the proliferative and secretory phases. CYFRA 21-1 and CYFRA/Cr levels were significantly higher in endometriosis and were higher in the proliferative phase compared to the secretory phase. The best accuracy was obtained in CYFRA which was corrected with urine creatinine in the proliferative phase with a sensitivity value, specificity, and cutoff value of 94.7%, 94.4%, and of 3,547.99 ng/gr, respectively, compared to CYFRA 21-1 urine levels without correction of creatinine. Conclusions The CYFRA to creatinine urine ratio detected in the proliferative phase showed the optimum sensitivity and specificity compared to CYFRA 21-1 spot urine. It has the potential to be a biomarker of endometriosis.

HSPA9 functions as a scaffold to enhance the interaction between USP14 and SLC7A11, facilitating USP14-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of SLC7A11. HSPA9, USP14, and SLC7A11 expression are positively correlated in MM patients.

                Costa et al. identified GATA3 as the main activator of the oncogenic TAL1 enhancer. By occupying tandem motifs at the neo-enhancer, GATA3 exerts an open chromatin state and cooperates with MYB and TAL1, thus stabilizing the GATA3/MYB/TAL1 complex and activating oncogenic TAL1 expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96704">Structure, function and assembly of soybean primary cell wall cellulose synthases</a></h4>

              
                Plant cell walls contain a meshwork of cellulose fibers embedded into a matrix of other carbohydrate and non-carbohydrate-based biopolymers. This composite material exhibits extraordinary properties, from stretchable and pliable cell boundaries to solid protective shells. Cellulose, a linear glucose polymer, is synthesized and secreted across the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase (CesA), of which plants express multiple isoforms. Different subsets of CesA isoforms are necessary for primary and secondary cell wall biogenesis. Here, we structurally and functionally characterize the <i>Glycine max</i> (soybean) primary cell wall CesAs CesA1, CesA3, and CesA6. The CesA isoforms exhibit robust in vitro catalytic activity. Cryo-electron microscopy analyses reveal their assembly into homotrimeric complexes in vitro in which each CesA protomer forms a cellulose-conducting transmembrane channel with a large lateral opening. Biochemical and co-purification analyses demonstrate that different CesA isoforms interact in vitro, leading to synergistic cellulose biosynthesis. Interactions between CesA trimers are only observed between different CesA isoforms and require the class-specific region (CSR). The CSR forms a hook-shaped extension of CesA’s catalytic domain at the cytosolic water-lipid interface. Negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy analyses of mixtures of different CesA isoform trimers reveal their side-by-side arrangement into loose clusters. Our data suggest a model by which CesA homotrimers of different isoforms assemble into cellulose synthase complexes to synthesize and secrete multiple cellulose chains for microfibril formation. Inter-trimer interactions are mediated by fuzzy interactions between their CSR extensions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88540">Trends in self-citation rates in high-impact neurology, neuroscience, and psychiatry journals</a></h4>

              
                Citation metrics influence academic reputation and career trajectories. Recent works have highlighted flaws in citation practices in the Neurosciences, such as the under-citation of women. However, self-citation rates—or how much authors cite themselves—have not yet been comprehensively investigated in the Neurosciences. This work characterizes self-citation rates in basic, translational, and clinical Neuroscience literature by collating 100,347 articles from 63 journals between the years 2000–2020. In analyzing over five million citations, we demonstrate four key findings: (1) increasing self-citation rates of Last Authors relative to First Authors, (2) lower self-citation rates in low- and middle-income countries, (3) gender differences in self-citation stemming from differences in the number of previously published papers, and (4) variations in self-citation rates by field. Our characterization of self-citation provides insight into citation practices that shape the perceived influence of authors in the Neurosciences, which in turn may impact what type of scientific research is done and who gets the opportunity to do it.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96868">Thymic dendritic cell-derived IL-27p28 promotes the establishment of functional bias against IFN-γ production in newly generated CD4+ T cells through STAT1-related epigenetic mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The newly generated CD4 single-positive (SP) T lymphocytes are featured by enhanced IL-4 but repressed IFN-γ production. The mechanisms underlying this functional bias remain elusive. Previous studies have reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice harboring dendritic cell (DC)-specific deletion of IL-27p28 display an increased capacity of IFN-γ production upon TCR stimulation. Here, we demonstrated that similarly altered functionality occurred in CD4SP thymocytes, recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), as well as naive T cells from either <i>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice or mice deficient in the α subunit of IL-27 receptor. Therefore, DC-derived IL-27p28-triggered, IL-27Rα-mediated signal is critically involved in the establishment of functional bias against IFN-γ production during their development in the thymus. Epigenetic analyses indicated reduced DNA methylation of the <i>Ifng</i> locus and increased trimethylation of H3K4 at both <i>Ifng</i> and <i>Tbx21</i> loci in CD4SP thymocytes from <i>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice. Transcriptome profiling demonstrated that <i>Il27p28</i> ablation resulted in the coordinated up-regulation of STAT1-activated genes. Concurrently, STAT1 was found to be constitutively activated. Moreover, we observed increased accumulation of STAT1 at the <i>Ifng</i> and <i>Tbx21</i> loci and a strong correlation between STAT1 binding and H3K4me3 modification of these loci. Of note, <i>Il27p28</i> deficiency exacerbated the autoimmune phenotype of <i>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Collectively, this study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the functional bias of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the potential relevance of such a bias in autoimmunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102659">Reprogramming of GM-CSF-dependent alveolar macrophages through GSK3 activity modulation</a></h4>

              
                Monocyte-derived macrophages recruited into inflamed tissues can acquire an array of functional states depending on the extracellular environment. Since the anti-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic macrophage profile is determined by MAFB, whose activity/protein levels are regulated by GSK3, we addressed the macrophage reprogramming potential of GSK3 modulation. GM-CSF-dependent (GM-MØ) and M-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages (M-MØ) exhibited distinct levels of inactive GSK3, and inhibiting GSK3 in GM-MØ led to the acquisition of transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional properties characteristic of M-MØ (enhanced expression of IL-10 and monocyte-recruiting factors, and higher efferocytosis). These reprogramming effects were also observed upon GSK3α/β knockdown and through GSK3 inhibition in ex vivo isolated human alveolar macrophages (AMØ). Notably, GSK3 downmodulation potentiated the transcriptional signature of interstitial macrophages (IMØ) while suppressing the AMØ-specific gene profile. Indeed, heightened levels of inactive GSK3 and MAFB-dependent proteins were observed in severe COVID-19 patients’ lung macrophages, highlighting the GSK3-MAFB axis as a therapeutic target for macrophage reprogramming.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93316">Adaptation of CD4 in gorillas and chimpanzees conveyed resistance to simian immunodeficiency viruses</a></h4>

              
                Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) comprise a large group of primate lentiviruses that endemically infect African monkeys. HIV-1 spilled over to humans from this viral reservoir, but the spillover did not occur directly from monkeys to humans. Instead, a key event was the introduction of SIVs into great apes, which then set the stage for infection of humans. Here, we investigate the role of the lentiviral entry receptor, CD4, in this key and fateful event in the history of SIV/HIV emergence. First, we reconstructed and tested ancient forms of CD4 at two important nodes in ape speciation, both prior to the infection of chimpanzees and gorillas with these viruses. These ancestral CD4s fully supported entry of diverse SIV isolates related to the viruses that made this initial jump to apes. In stark contrast, modern chimpanzee and gorilla CD4 orthologs are more resistant to these viruses. To investigate how this resistance in CD4 was gained, we acquired <i>CD4</i> gene sequences from 32 gorilla individuals of two species and identified alleles that encode 8 unique CD4 protein variants. Functional testing of these identified variant-specific differences in susceptibility to virus entry. By engineering single-point mutations from resistant gorilla CD4 variants into the permissive human CD4 receptor, we demonstrate that acquired substitutions in gorilla CD4 did convey resistance to virus entry. We provide a population genetic analysis to support the theory that selection is acting in favor of more and more resistant <i>CD4</i> alleles in ape species harboring SIV endemically (gorillas and chimpanzees), but not in other ape species that lack SIV infections (bonobos and orangutans). Taken together, our results show that SIV has placed intense selective pressure on ape <i>CD4</i>, acting to propagate SIV-resistant alleles in chimpanzee and gorilla populations.

">Selective Knockout of Murine Glutamic Acid-rich Protein 2 (GARP2) Significantly Alters Cellular Dark Noise in Rod Photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                GARP2, a glutamic-acid-rich protein found exclusively in rod photoreceptors, has been suggested to function as a structural protein, a modulator of the cGMP phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE6), and a gating inhibitor of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. GARP2 is a splice variant of the Cngb1 gene, which in the rods encodes the {beta}-subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel. Mutations in Cngb1 cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP45), and {beta}-subunit knockout mice are being studied as models of this disease. In this study, using ZFN-mediated gene editing, we have selectively eliminated GARP2 expression, while not affecting expression of the cyclic nucleotide gated cation channel {beta} -subunit, to determine its essential functions in mouse rods. The absence of GARP2 caused no consistent perturbations of retinal structure. Transiently, rod outer segment length was regionally greater than WT and infrequently misaligned, appearing parallel to the retinal pigment epithelium. Electroretinography of the knockout mice did reveal consistent functional alterations over time, seen as a reduction in the ERG response amplitudes in older mice, albeit with no significant alterations in sensitivity to light. Interestingly, single-cell patch-clamp recordings showed a significant reduction in rod photoreceptor dark noise consistent with a previously proposed role for GARP2 in binding to PDE6 and affecting its basal activity. Our results suggest a role for the GARP2-PDE6 interaction in stabilizing the PDE6 enzyme and controlling the turnover rate of cGMP in darkness, adjusting the level of dark noise and implicating an influence on the signal and noise properties of rod photoreceptors.

">Thyroid hormone promotes fetal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Maternal low thyroxine (T4) serum levels during the first trimester of pregnancy correlate with cerebral cortex volume and mental development of the progeny, but why neural cells during early fetal brain development are vulnerable to maternal T4 levels remains unknown. In this study, using iPSCs obtained from a boy with a loss-of-function mutation in MCT8, a transporter previously identified as critical for thyroid hormone uptake and action in neural cells, we demonstrate that thyroid hormones induce transcriptional changes that promote the progression of human neural precursor cells along the dorsal projection trajectory. Consistent with these findings, single-cell, spatial, and bulk transcriptomics from MCT8-deficient cerebral organoids and cultures of human neural precursor cells underscore the necessity for optimal thyroid hormone levels for these cells to differentiate into neurons. The controlled intracellular activation of T4 signaling occurs through the transient expression of the enzyme type 2 deiodinase, which converts T4 into its active form, T3, alongside the coordinated expression of thyroid hormone nuclear receptors. The intracellular activation of T4 in NPCs results in transcriptional changes important for their division mode and cell cycle progression. Thus, T4 is essential for fetal neurogenesis, highlighting the importance of adequate treatment for mothers with hypothyroidism.

">DCHS1 Modulates Forebrain Proportions in Modern Humans via a Glycosylation Change</a></h4>

              
                Comparative anatomical studies of primates and extinct hominins, including Neanderthals, show that the modern human brain is characterised by a disproportionately enlarged neocortex relative to the striatum. To explore the molecular basis of this difference, we screened for missense mutations that are unique to modern humans and occur at high frequency and that alter post-translational sites. One such mutation was identified in DCHS1, a protocadherin family gene, and it was found to disrupt an N-glycosylation site in modern humans. Using CRISPR/Cas9-editing we introduced into human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) this ancestral DCHS1 variant present in Neanderthals and other primates, representing the ancestral state before the modern human-specific substitution. Leveraging hiPSCs-derived neural organoids, we observed an expansion of striatal progenitors at the expense of the neocortex, mirroring the anatomical distribution seen in non-human primates. We further identify the ephrin receptor EPHA4 as a binding partner of DCHS1 and show that modern human-specific alterations in DCHS1 modulate EPHA4-ephrin signalling, contributing to a gradual shift in the neocortex-to-striatum ratio - a hallmark of brain organisation in our species.

">A Unique Role for the Hippocampus in Cue Integration During Human Spatial Navigation</a></h4>

              
                A central question in cognitive neuroscience is how the brain integrates distinct sensory and perceptual inputs to improve cognitive performance. This study investigated this question in the context of human spatial navigation by combining high-field 3T fMRI and desktop virtual reality. Participants encoded and retrieved spatial locations using either landmarks alone (landmark condition), visual self-motion cues alone (i.e., optic flow; self-motion condition), or both cues together (combination condition). Participants behaviorally benefited from cue integration. fMRI analyses revealed a cue integration effect in the hippocampus, which displayed positional coding only in the combination condition, and only in participants who showed behavioral benefits from cue integration. Furthermore, hippocampal positional coding was more strongly associated with actual than self-reported locations, indicating it integrates sensory-perceptual inputs from spatial cues. Our findings suggest that fundamental function of the hippocampus is to integrate diverse sensory-perceptual inputs to support memory-guided navigation, rather than representing space per se, thereby challenging the dominant cognitive map theory in spatial navigation.

">Quantifying cortical maturational aspects during different vigilance states in preterm infants by advanced EEG analysis</a></h4>

              
                Preterm birth is associated with numerous neurodevelopmental adverse outcomes, even in the absence of acquired lesions, as it occurs during a critical period of brain development. Clear organization of vigilance states can be recognized from 30-32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). In this study, we investigated whether spatial and temporal properties of neuronal oscillatory dynamics (i.e., phase synchronization, bistability, and cross-frequency coupling) during different vigilance states provide insights into cortical maturation in preterm infants born very low birth weight (VLBW) at low neurological risk and devoid of detectable brain lesions. We analyzed artifact-free video-polysomnographic data from 11 VLBW preterm infants (PMA at recording: 33.0 {+/-} 1.6 weeks) who underwent brain MRI at term-equivalent age. For each vigilance state, we computed the weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI), Bistability Index (BiS), and Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC), both globally and across anterior and posterior regions, and examined their correlation with PMA at recording. wPLI, BiS, and PAC showed specific trends across vigilance states. BiS and PAC exhibited posterior-to-anterior differences and correlated with PMA. Our study suggests that these electrophysiological markers, particularly BiS and PAC, may serve as indices to monitor aspects of cortical maturation in VLBW at low neurological risk.

">Habenula alterations in resting state functional connectivity among autistic individuals</a></h4>

              
                Background: The reward-based theoretical framework of autism suggests that altered reward circuitry contributes to core symptoms. Recent prior research has revealed autism-related structural alterations in the habenula, a small epithalamic structure associated with motivation and emotion; however, potential alterations in functional connectivity (FC) remain unexplored. Methods: Anatomical and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were accessed for 1,584 participants (N=705 autism; mean age: 16.26 plus-or-minus sign 8.15 years) in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). To investigate habenula alterations, we conducted a whole-brain resting state FC analysis, followed by regression analyses to explore age and brain-behavior interactions. Results: Across the entire sample, extensive habenula connectivity was observed within the midbrain dopaminergic reward system. Compared to neurotypical (NT) controls, autistic participants exhibited significantly increased habenular connectivity with the right middle temporal gyrus and bilateral superior temporal gyri. From childhood to early adulthood, habenula FC increased in autistic adolescents, and inversely decreased in NTs, with the left culmen and left parahippocampus. Between groups, habenula hyperconnectivity was inversely associated with behavioral scores for social motivation, executive functioning, and daily living skills, but not social communication. Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence of habenula connectivity alterations in autism, highlighting atypical FC with the auditory cortex. Further findings suggest that habenula circuitry develops differently among autistic adolescents, with links between habenula hyperconnectivity and motivation and adaptive behaviors. Taken together, these results contribute to emerging evidence that the dopaminergic reward system may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of autism.

">Lasting Increases in Neuronal Activity and Serotonergic Receptor Expression Following Gestational Chlorpyrifos Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Perinatal exposure to the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is associated with an increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. While these behavioral detriments have been modeled in rodents, the underlying functional alterations in the developing brain are largely unknown. Previous reports using a rat model have identified alterations to both inhibitory synaptic transmission and serotonergic (5-HT) receptor binding in the cortex following developmental CPF exposure. Here, we use a rat model of gestational CPF exposure to investigate whether this altered inhibitory activity is driven by increased spontaneous firing of inhibitory interneurons and altered 5-HT receptor expression. Using cell-attached ex vivo electrophysiology in young rats of both sexes, we identified a significant increase in the number of spontaneously firing neurons in the somatosensory cortex of CPF-exposed offspring. Analysis of action potential metrics identified a sub-set of these neurons as fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Immunohistochemical labeling of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activity, further revealed a pronounced increase in activity of neurons of the somatosensory cortex in both juvenile and adult rats that had been gestationally exposed to CPF. Finally, RNAscope in situ hybridization showed an increase in the expression of the inhibitory receptor 5-HT1B in PV neurons. The data here demonstrate that gestational exposure to CPF results in persistent hyper-excitation of the somatosensory cortex, potentially through increased expression of the receptor 5-HT1B and resulting disinhibition. These neurophysiological effects may contribute to the established behavioral outcomes resulting from gestational exposure to CPF and offer guidance for novel preventative interventions.

">Multivariate Bayesian Inversion for Classification and Regression</a></h4>

              
                We propose the statistical modelling approach to supervised learning (i.e. predicting labels from features) as an alternative to algorithmic machine learning (ML). The approach is demonstrated by employing a multivariate general linear model (MGLM) describing the effects of labels on features, possibly accounting for covariates of no interest, in combination with prior distributions on the model parameters. ML "training" is translated into estimating the MGLM parameters via Bayesian inference and ML "testing" or application is translated into Bayesian model comparison - a reciprocal relationship we refer to as multivariate Bayesian inversion (MBI). We devise MBI algorithms for the standard cases of supervised learning, discrete classification and continuous regression, derive novel classification rules and regression predictions, and use practical examples (simulated and real data) to illustrate the benefits of the statistical modelling approach: interpretability, incorporation of prior knowledge, and probabilistic predictions. We close by discussing further advantages, disadvantages and the future potential of MBI.

">Pain and touch differentially modulate corticospinal excitability, independent of afferent inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Pain can profoundly impact motor functioning to support self-preservation but is also associated with motor and somatosensory disturbances. Despite considerable research exploring the influence of pain and touch on motor and sensorimotor processes, the nature of this relationship remains elusive. Specifically, it is uncertain whether pain and touch modulate motor processes independently of each other or are interconnected. Across two experiments, an afferent inhibition (AI) paradigm was tested to probe the effects of tactile and nociceptive inputs on corticospinal processes and sensorimotor interactions. In Experiment 1 (N=20), the effect of electrocutaneous stimulation duration (0.2 vs. 0.4 ms) on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced corticospinal excitability (CSE) was assessed using a short and long-latency AI paradigm. A single electrocutanous stimulus was delivered to the left index finger before single pulse-TMS over the right-first dorsal interosseous (FDI) motor hotspot at one of five delays (15, 25, 35, 45, 60 or 160 ms). In Experiment 2 (N=20), the same paradigm was used to examine if this effect of sensorimotor interaction is changed when moderate tonic heat pain is delivered to the forearm. Significant AI was observed in both experiments at delays of 25, 35 and 160 ms, with afferent facilitation at 60 ms. This effect was not influenced by the duration of afferent stimulation (Experiment 1) nor by the presence of heat pain (Experiment 2). However, we found a significant reduction in CSE in painful compared to painless conditions, indicating that while tonic pain modulates CSE, tactile afferent inhibition remains unaffected. This supports the notion that pain has a direct (inhibitory) effect on motor output; however, in this context, tactile sensorimotor interactions remain unaltered.

                Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) offer great potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with neurological disorders or severe motor impairments. Among various neural recording modalities, electroencephalogram (EEG) is particularly favorable for BMIs due to its noninvasive nature, portability, and high temporal resolution. Existing EEG datasets for BMIs are often limited to experimental settings that fail to address subjects' freewill in decision making. We present a large EEG dataset, containing a total of 6808 trials, recorded from 23 healthy young adults (8 females and 15 males with an age range from 18 to 24 years) while performing reaching and grasping tasks, where the target object is freely chosen at their desired pace according to their own will. This EEG dataset provides a realistic representation of reaching and grasping movement, making it useful for developing practical BMIs.

">Alzheimer's subtypesA supervised, unsupervised, multimodal, multilayered embedded recursive (SUMMER) AI study</a></h4>

              
                Since Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disease, different subtypes may have distinct biological, genetic, and clinical characteristics, requiring tailored interventions. While several proposed subtypes of AD exist, there is still no clear consensus on a definitive classification. By leveraging complementary AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised learning, within a recursive pipeline (SUMMER) that integrates multimodal datasets encompassing MRI measurements, phenotypes, and genetic data, our goal was to generate robust scientific evidence for identifying AD subtypes. Data was downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and included neuroimaging data (MRI), genetics (SNPs), clinical diagnosis, and demographics. 1133 European American participants' images, aged 55-95, were included in this study. The analysis was multi-fold, where the first step involved applying an unsupervised application to a subset of the MRI sample (AD + cognitively normal (CN) aged matched groups, 100 men aged 68-85 years, and 76 women aged 68-85 years). The MRI brain gray matter was segmented into 44 regions of interest (ROIs) according to a standard atlas, and 618 features were extracted, including ROI voxel intensity measurements such as minimum, maximum, and histogram variables. Results identified a cluster of subtype AD men and a cluster of subtype AD women that were distinct from the rest of their respective samples. In the next step, the integrity of the identified subtype AD clusters was investigated using the XGBoost supervised machine learning application with genetic features (SNPs, N=36,724) and labels: the identified subtype AD cluster vs. the rest of the sample, stratified by sex. A significant AD subtype men model (accuracy=0.85, F1=0.72, AUC=0.83) and a significant women AD subtype model (accuracy=0.81, F1=0.81, AUC=0.81) were built, confirming the homogeneity of the isolated AD subtype clusters. Discriminative biomarkers were extracted from the significant models, including selected ROIs and SNPs. Finally, the subtype models were tested on an unseen subset of ADNI data. The genetic-based models identified clusters of AD subtype participants consisting of 34% of the men AD group and 47% of the women AD group. Phenotypic analysis indicates that lower body weight was associated with the women's AD subtype. Complex diseases like AD demand a sophisticated, multimodal approach for precise diagnosis. Effectively identifying disease subtypes enhances the potential for personalized treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

">Improved Source Localization of Auditory Evoked Fields using Reciprocal BEM-FMM</a></h4>

              
                We apply our recently introduced technique of reciprocal magnetoencephalographic (MEG) source estimation via the boundary element fast multipole method (reciprocal BEM-FMM) to localize auditory evoked fields (AEFs). We compare our results with the source estimates of MNE-Python against simulated N1m components of AEFs, as well as experimental data for a cohort of 7 participants subjected to binaural auditory stimulation. Previous comparisons of reciprocal BEM-FMM with MNE focused on evoked somatosensory fields, which produced results of similar quality. In this work we show that the localization of AEFs using high-resolution reciprocal BEM-FMM is significantly better in terms of accuracy and focality than those estimates of the low resolution 3-layer BEM of MNE. Our findings suggest that the use of high-resolution models plays a significant role in the quality of source estimates and that these may provide improvements in a wide range of applications.

">Cell-type-specific synaptic scaling mechanisms differentially contribute to associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Excitatory synaptic scaling regulates network dynamics by proportionally adjusting excitatory synaptic strengths after sensory perturbations. During associative learning, blocking excitatory scaling in conditioned taste aversion paradigms prolongs generalized aversive responses and delays memory specificity. Recent evidence also implicates inhibitory synaptic scaling in the regulation of network dynamics. Specifically, parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory neurons, targeting perisomatic regions of excitatory (E) pyramidal neurons, and somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons, targeting distal dendrites, exhibit distinct scaling responses. This leaves open the question of how complex plasticity mechanisms regulate recurrent excitatory-inhibitory circuit dynamics in associative learning. Using computational approaches, we demonstrate that Hebbian plasticity drives memory generalization to novel stimuli not presented during conditioning. Following conditioning, diverse synaptic scaling mechanisms progressively induce memory specificity, which can be regulated by top-down inputs. Our results reveal that, in the absence of excitatory scaling, PV-to-E scaling can effectively compensate and rescue memory specificity, highlighting the presence of degenerate mechanisms in the brain. Notably, in the process of establishing memory specificity, excitatory scaling and PV-to-E scaling function synergistically, while concurrently opposing SST-to-E scaling. The synergistic and antagonistic plasticity mechanisms are orchestrated to shape the temporal evolution of memory representations, from generalized to precise.

">Breaking Balance: Encoding local error signals in perturbations of excitation-inhibition balance</a></h4>

              
                Effective learning in neural circuits requires credit assignment, linking local synaptic changes at individual neurons to distant behavioral outcomes, a challenge not addressed by classic Hebbian plasticity. While machine learning models rely on explicit local error signals to guide weight updates, we do not understand the underlying feedback mechanisms in neurobiology. Here, we propose a simple and biologically plausible solution: local deviations from precise E/I balance encode error signals that instruct synaptic plasticity. Using a computational model derived from an adaptive control theory framework, we show that targeted feedback to inhibitory interneurons perturbing E/I balance can produce neuron or assembly-specific error signals that support credit assignment in multilayer networks. Simulations demonstrate that such a balance-controlled plasticity mechanism is consistent with phenomenological local plasticity models while enabling online learning in hierarchically organized networks. Further, we show this framework is consistent with key features of dis-inhibitory microcircuit dynamics during in-vivo learning experiments. These results suggest that the brain may exploit E/I balance not just for stability, but as a substrate for error-driven learning.

">Neural sampling from cognitive maps supportsgoal-directed planning and imagination</a></h4>

              
                Imagining plans for solving problems is a cornerstone of our higher cognition. We can even create plans for reaching goals that we never encountered before. However, the ways the brain addresses goal-directed imagination is largely unknown and current AI methods provide limited solutions to this problem. Here, we introduce a novel computational model -- the generative cognitive map learner (GCML) -- that successful addresses goal-directed imagination and provides a new hypothesis about the brain mechanisms supporting it. The GCML uses stochastic samples from learned cognitive maps -- data structures in which brains encode learned relations between actions and states -- to form trajectories towards both known and novel goals. In a series of simulations, we show that the GCML provides surprisingly effective heuristic solutions to spatial navigation tasks, generic problem solving tasks, and compositional tasks that require generating imagined trajectories to novel goals. The sampled trajectories capture key characteristics of hippocampal replay activity, which provide a candidate mechanism for goal-directed imagination in the brain. Since the GCML only requires simple biologically plausible local synaptic plasticity and shallow neural networks, it can be readily implemented in energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.

">Mapping Macaque to Human Cortex with Natural Scene Responses</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience has long relied on macaque studies to infer human brain function, yet identifying functionally corresponding brain regions across species and measurement modalities remains a fundamental challenge. This is especially true for higher-order cortex, where functional interpretations are constrained by narrow hypotheses and anatomical landmarks are often non-homologous. We present a data-driven approach for mapping functional correspondence across species using rich, naturalistic stimuli. By directly comparing macaque electrophysiology with human fMRI responses to 700 natural scenes, we identify fine-grained alignment based on response pattern similarity, without relying on predefined tuning concepts or hand-picked stimuli. As a test case, we examine the ventral face patch system, a well-studied but contested domain in cross-species alignment. Our approach resolves a longstanding ambiguity, yielding a correspondence consistent with full-brain anatomical warping but inconsistent with prior studies limited by narrow functional hypotheses. These findings show that natural image-evoked response patterns provide a robust foundation for cross-species functional alignment, supporting scalable comparisons as large-scale primate recordings become more widespread.

">Parallel morphological and functional development in the Xenopus retinotectal system</a></h4>

              
                The retinotectal projection in Xenopus laevis is topographically organized. During the early development of the Xenopus visual system, the optic tectum increases considerably in volume, and retinotectal axons and dendrites undergo extensive activity-dependent remodeling. We have previously observed marked changes in the three-dimensional layout of the tectal retinotopic functional map over the course of a few days. This raised the question of whether such functional reorganization might be attributable to the migration and structural remodeling of tectal neurons as the brain grows. To examine changes in map topography in the context of individual tectal neuron morphology and location, we performed calcium imaging in the optic tecta of GCaMP6s-expressing tadpoles in parallel with structural imaging of tectal cells that were sparsely labelled with Alexa 594-dextran dye. We performed functional and structural imaging of the optic tectum at two developmental time points, recording the morphology of the dextran-labelled cells and quantifying the changes in their positions and the spanning volume of their dendritic fields. Comparing anatomical growth to changes in the functional retinotopic map at these early stages, we found that dendritic arbor growth kept pace with the overall growth of the optic tectum, and that individual neurons continued to receive widespread visual field input, even as the tectal retinotopic map evolved markedly over time.

">Evaluating ultrastructural preservation quality in banked brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                The ultrastructural analysis of postmortem brain tissue can provide important insights into cellular architecture and disease-related changes. For example, connectomics studies offer a powerful emerging approach for understanding neural circuit organization. However, electron microscopy (EM) data is difficult to interpret when the preservation quality is imperfect, which is common in brain banking and may render it unsuitable for certain research applications. One common issue is that EM images of postmortem brain tissue can have an expansion of regions that appear to be made up of extracellular space and/or degraded cellular material, which we call ambiguous interstitial zones. In this study, we report a method to assess whether EM images have ambiguous interstitial zone artifacts in a cohort of 10 postmortem brains with samples from each of the cortex and thalamus. Next, in matched samples from the contralateral hemisphere of the same brains, we evaluate the structural preservation quality of light microscopy images, including immunostaining for cytoskeletal proteins. Through this analysis, we show that on light microscopy, cell membrane morphology can be largely maintained, and neurite trajectory visualized over micrometer distances, even in specimens for which there are ambiguous interstitial zone artifacts on EM. Taken together, our analysis may assist in maximizing the usefulness of donated brain tissue by informing tissue selection and preparation protocols for various research goals.

">Introducing PIGMO, a novel PIGmented MOuse model of Parkinson's disease (V1)</a></h4>

              
                There is a pressing need for the development, characterization, and standardization of anmal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) that properly mimic the cardinal features of this disorder, comprising both the motor phenotype and neuropathological signatures. In the past few years, animal modeling has moved from neurotoxin-based approaches toward viral vectors carrying a given genetic payload of interest. Here, to induce pigmentation of the mouse brain upon systemic delivery, we took advantage of a modified adeno-associated viral vector capsid engineered to bypass the blood-brain barrier and coding for the human tyrosinase gene (AAV9-P31-hTyr). Obtained results revealed an ongoing pigmentation of catecholaminergic centers related to the pathophysiology of PD, such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus. Moreover, pigmented dopaminergic neurons exhibited Lewy body-like intracytoplasmic inclusions, a progressive nigrostriatal degeneration, and a time-dependent motor phenotype. The bilateral pigmented mouse model of PD generated this way is highly reproducible, does not require stereotaxic surgery for viral vector deliveries, and opens unprecedented possibilities for preclinical testing of therapeutic candidates designed to reduce disease progression rates.

                Biallelic pathogenic variants in STRADA, an upstream regulator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, result in megalencephaly, drug-resistant epilepsy, and severe intellectual disability. This study explores how mTOR pathway hyperactivity alters cell fate specification in dorsal and ventral forebrain development using STRADA knock-out human stem cell derived brain organoids. In both dorsal and ventral forebrain STRADA knock-out organoids, neurogenesis is delayed, with a predilection for progenitor renewal and proliferation and an increase in outer radial glia. Ventrally, interneuron subtypes shift to an increase in neuropeptide-Y expressing cells. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway with rapamycin results in rescue for most phenotypes. When mTOR pathway variants are present in all cells of the developing brain, overproduction of interneurons and altered interneuron cell fate may underlie mechanisms of megalencephaly, epilepsy, and cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest mTOR inhibition during fetal brain development as a potential therapeutic strategy in STRADA deficiency.

">Predicting Neural Activity from Connectome Embedding Spaces</a></h4>

              
                Describing the relationship between activity and connectivity in neural circuits is fundamental to understanding brain function. The connectome of cortical networks is high-dimensional, whereas neuronal activity is often low-dimensional relative to the number of neurons. Consequently, only a small fraction of the information contained in the connectome is relevant to activity. Can this relevant information be identified? In this study, we propose that the activity of each excitatory neuron in the sensory cortex can be approximated as a point in an embedding space defined by its connectome. Using the MICrONS dataset, which provides millimeter-scale, nanometer-resolution data on proofread and coregistered neurons, we perform a correlation analysis and identify a statistically significant alignment between morphological and functional similarities. Topological analysis reveals that the structured representation spaces of both neuronal activity and connectome share a low-dimensional, hyperbolic geometry with exponential scalability. Based on these findings, we develop a simple linear model to reconstruct in vivo neuronal activity by embedding anatomical affinities using multidimensional scaling (MDS). This approach achieves an explanation ratio of $68%$ compared to directly using activity similarity, outperforming the $56%$ obtained using the full connectome. Our results highlight a clear and robust structure-function coupling: although geometry-compatible dimensionality reduction methods discard much of the connectome's detailed information, they prove more effective in predicting neuronal activity, suggesting that synaptic connections may encode an abstract low-dimensional organization.

">Information theoretic measures of neural and behavioural coupling predict representational drift</a></h4>

              
                In many parts of the brain, population tuning to stimuli and behaviour gradually changes over the course of days to weeks in a phenomenon known as representational drift. The tuning stability of individual cells varies over the population, and it remains unclear what drives this heterogeneity. We investigate how a neurons tuning stability relates to its shared variability with other neurons in the population using two published datasets from posterior parietal cortex and visual cortex. We quantified the contribution of pairwise interactions to behaviour or stimulus encoding by partial information decomposition, which breaks down the mutual information between the pairwise neural activity and the external variable into components uniquely provided by each neuron and by their interactions. Information shared by the two neurons is termed redundant and information requiring knowledge of the state of both neurons is termed synergistic. We found that a neurons tuning stability is positively correlated with the strength of its average pairwise redundancy with the population, and that these high-redundancy neurons also tend to show high average pairwise synergy. We hypothesize that subpopulations of neurons show greater stability because they are tuned to salient features common across multiple tasks. Regardless of the mechanistic implications of our work, the stability-redundancy relationship may support improved longitudinal neural decoding in technology that has to track population dynamics over time, such as brain-machine interfaces.

">Independent Generation of Amyloid-β via Novel APP Transcripts</a></h4>

              
                The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by multiple enzymes to generate biologically active peptides, including amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), which aggregates to form the hallmark pathology of Alzheimers disease (AD). A{beta} is produced through an initial {beta}-secretase cleavage of APP, generating a 99-amino acid C-terminal fragment (APP-C99). Subsequent cleavage of APP-C99 by {gamma}-secretase produces A{beta} peptides of varying lengths. To better understand the transcriptional regulation of A{beta} production, we employed long-read RNA sequencing and identified previously unannotated transcripts encoding APP-C99 with an additional methionine residue (APP-C100), generated independently of {beta}-secretase cleavage. These transcripts are expressed separately from full-length APP, and we observed that cells lacking full-length APP can still produce A{beta} through these shorter isoforms. Importantly, mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed peptides consistent with the methionine-extended A{beta} species, supporting the in vivo translation of these transcripts. Our findings reveal an alternative pathway for A{beta} generation and aggregation, highlighting a potential new target for modulating A{beta} accumulation in AD.

">Lifespan Trajectories of Alpha Rhythm: Dynamic Shifts in Neural Excitation-Inhibition Balance</a></h4>

              
                Alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz), a key neural oscillation in the brain, plays a significant role in cognitive functions and reflects the brain's excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance. This study investigates the dynamics of alpha rhythm across the lifespan, focusing on how E-I balance modulates alpha power and peak frequency, and exploring the distinct age-related and sex-specific patterns of alpha activity. Using a computational E-I model, we simulated the impact of different neuronal connections and E-I ratios on alpha rhythm characteristics. The results suggest that self-regulation primarily affects alpha power, while interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurons influences both alpha frequency and power. We applied this model to real EEG data from 3265 participants across a wide age range, revealing that alpha power and peak frequency exhibit an inverted U-shape across the lifespan, peaking in early adulthood and declining in old age. Significant sex differences in alpha activity were observed primarily during puberty and later in life. Decomposition of the alpha band into periodic and aperiodic components showed that periodic activity follows the inverted U-shape, while aperiodic activity declines exponentially with age. Our findings indicate that alpha rhythm is governed by complex E-I dynamics, with distinct contributions from periodic and non-periodic components, and highlight the role of alpha rhythm in age-related cognitive changes and sex differences in brain function.

">Genetic disruption of leucine rich repeat transmembrane protein 4 like 1 induces a pro-social behavioural phenotype in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social behaviour encompasses the wide range of interactions that occur between members of the same species. In humans, disruptions in social behaviour are characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, where both genetic risk factors and synaptic dysfunctions can contribute to the phenotype. Among the genes implicated in synaptic regulation, the synaptic adhesion protein leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein 4 (LRRTM4) has been identified as a key player in maintaining synaptic function and neuronal circuit integrity. Despite its established role in the nervous system, the potential involvement of LRRTM4 in modulating social behaviour and its contribution to social deficits has yet to be explored. Methods: In the current study, we used zebrafish to study how genetic deletion of lrrtm4l1, a zebrafish orthologue of LRRTM4, affects sociality. For this, the social behaviour of homozygous lrrtm4l1 knockout (KO) zebrafish was analysed in multiple behavioural assays and the brain transcriptome of mutant animals was investigated by RNAseq. Results: KO zebrafish displayed a pro-social phenotype in multiple behavioural assays. Groups of lrrtm4l1 KO zebrafish formed more cohesive shoals and KO individuals spent more time in the vicinity of conspecifics during a social interaction test. They were also less aggressive and in contrast to wild-type zebrafish did not differentiate in their interactions with known and unknown groups of fish. Neurotranscriptomic analysis revealed 560 differentially expressed genes including changes in glutamatergic neurotransmitter signalling, tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and synaptic plasticity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that lrrtm4l1 is an important regulator of social behaviour in zebrafish. In a translational perspective, LRRTM4 is a promising potential therapeutic target that warrants further investigation in the framework of neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by major social impairments.

">Cell-type-specific encoding of prediction and reward in cortical microcircuits during novelty detection</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits comprise diverse neuron types whose distinct activity patterns suggest specialized computational roles. Understanding how interneuron subtypes contribute to prediction and novelty detection is key to grounding theories like predictive coding in biological circuitry. We present a cortical microcircuit model that integrates energy-efficient predictive coding and reinforcement learning to explain novelty responses during a visual change detection task. By assigning algorithmic roles to specific interneuron populations, the model reproduces experimentally observed effects in excitatory neurons and in VIP and SST inhibitory subtypes, while offering a theory of how cell-type-specific computations implement predictive coding. Ablation analyses reveal a role for the canonical VIP-SST disinhibitory motif in balancing energy efficiency and representational capacity. We further show that adaptation and Hebbian learning explain contextual--but not absolute or omission--novelty effects, highlighting the importance of integrating these mechanistic models with our normative approach. Together, these findings provide a biologically plausible framework for understanding novelty encoding in cortical circuits.

">Perisynaptic astroglial response to in vivo long-term potentiation and concurrent long-term depression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.</a></h4>

              
                Perisynaptic astroglia provide critical molecular and structural support to regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in the nanodomain of the axon-spine interface. Three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM) was used to investigate relationships between perisynaptic astroglia and dendritic spine synapses undergoing plasticity in the hippocampus of awake adult male rats. Delta-burst stimulation (DBS) of the medial perforant pathway induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the middle molecular layer and concurrent long-term depression (cLTD) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The contralateral hippocampus received baseline stimulation as a within-animal control. Brains were obtained 30 minutes or 2 hours after DBS onset. An automated 3DEM pipeline was developed to enable unbiased quantification of astroglial coverage at the perimeter of the axon-spine interface. Under all conditions, >85% of synapses had perisynaptic astroglia processes within 120 nm of some portion of the perimeter. LTP broadened the distribution of spine sizes while reducing the presence and proximity of perisynaptic astroglia near the axon-spine interface of large spines. In contrast, cLTD transiently reduced the length of the axon-spine interface perimeter without substantially altering astroglial apposition. The postsynaptic density was discovered to be displaced from the center of the axon-spine interface, with this offset increasing during LTP and decreasing during cLTD. Astroglial access to the postsynaptic density was diminished during LTP and enhanced during cLTD, in parallel with changes in spine size. Thus, access of perisynaptic astroglia to synapses is dynamically modulated during LTP and cLTD alongside synaptic remodeling.

">Evaluation of hippocampal DLGAP2 overexpression on cognition, synaptic function, and dendritic spine structure in a translationally relevant AD mouse model</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION Developing effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) requires a better understanding of the molecular drivers of the disease. Our previous work nominated DLGAP2 as a modifier of age-related cognitive decline and risk for AD. We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of DLGAP2 in the hippocampus would protect against cognitive and synaptic deficits in a susceptible F1 5XFAD model. METHODS DLGAP2 was overexpressed in the hippocampus of F1 hybrid 5XFAD and nontransgenic littermates using a viral approach. Cognitive function, electrophysiological properties, and dendritic spine morphology were assessed at 6 and 14 months of age. RESULTS DLGAP2 overexpression impaired synaptic plasticity and exacerbated AD-related memory deficits but had minimal effect on spine structure or intrinsic neuronal properties. DISCUSSION We highlight the complex role of DLGAP2 in AD pathology. Targeted interventions involving postsynaptic proteins must consider potential adverse effects on synaptic integrity and cognitive performance, particularly in the context of AD.
