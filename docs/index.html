              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleus accumbens dopamine tracks aversive stimulus duration and prediction but not value or prediction error</a></h4>

              
                There is active debate on the role of dopamine in processing aversive stimuli, where inferred roles range from no involvement at all, to signaling an aversive prediction error (APE). Here, we systematically investigate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAC), which is closely linked to reward prediction errors, in rats exposed to white noise (WN, a versatile, underutilized, aversive stimulus) and its predictive cues. Both induced a negative dopamine ramp, followed by slow signal recovery upon stimulus cessation. In contrast to reward conditioning, this dopamine signal was unaffected by WN value, context valence, or probabilistic contingencies, and the WN dopamine response shifted only partially toward its predictive cue. However, unpredicted WN provoked slower post-stimulus signal recovery than predicted WN. Despite differing signal qualities, dopamine responses to simultaneous presentation of rewarding and aversive stimuli were additive. Together, our findings demonstrate that instead of an APE, NAC dopamine primarily tracks prediction and duration of aversive events.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Management of evidence and conflict of interest in guidelines on early childhood allergy prevention and child nutrition: study protocol of a systematic synthesis of guidelines and explorative network analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: With the rising prevalence of allergic diseases in children, prevention of childhood allergies becomes an important public health issue. Recently, a paradigm shift is taking place in the approach to preventing allergies, and clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) play an important role in providing practitioners with the latest evidence and reliable guidance. However, concern about the methodological quality of the development of FBDGs and CPGs, including limitations in the systematic reviews, lack of transparency and unmanaged conflicts of interest (COI), reduce the trust in these guidelines. Methods: We aim to synthesize the available guidance on early childhood allergy prevention (ECAP) through a systematic search for national and international CPGs and FBDGs concerning ECAP and child nutrition (CN) and to assess the quality of the guidelines and management of COI. Additionally, we will analyse the content and the evidence base of the recommendation statements. We aim to quantify the COI in guideline panellists and explore possible associations between COI and recommendations. Through a social network analysis, we expect to elucidate ties between panellists, researchers, institutions, industry and other sponsors. Guidelines are an important tool to inform healthcare practitioners with the newest evidence, but quality and reliability have to be high. This study will help identify potential for further improvement in the development of guidelines and the management of COI. If the social network analysis proves feasible and reveals more information on COI in comparison to disclosed COI from the previous analyses, the methodology can be developed further to identify undisclosed COIs in panellists. Ethics and dissemination: This research does not require ethical approval because no human subjects are involved. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed open access journals and via presentations at scientific conferences.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Visual Deprivation on Remodeling of Nodes of Ranvier in Optic Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, promote rapid action potential conduction along axons. Changes in the geometry of gaps between myelin segments, known as nodes of Ranvier, affect the conduction speed of neuronal impulses and can ultimately alter neural synchronization and circuit function. In contrast to synaptic plasticity, much less is known about how neural activity may affect node of Ranvier structure. Recently, perinodal astrocytes have been shown to remodel nodes of Ranvier by regulating thrombin proteolysis, but it is not known whether neural activity influences this process. To test this hypothesis, we used transgenic mice with astrocytic expression of a dominant-negative vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 ([gfap]dnVAMP2) to reduce exocytosis of thrombin inhibitors, modulating astrocytic regulation of paranodal loop attachment to induce nodal remodeling, under normal conditions and in adult mice maintained in darkness from postnatal day 40 (P40) to P70. This mechanism of nodal lengthening proceeded normally following binocular visual deprivation (BVD). The effect of BVD on nodal plasticity in animals with unimpaired astrocyte function has not been previously investigated. We find that when exocytosis from astrocytes was unimpaired, nodal gap length was not altered by BVD in adult mice. We conclude that if perinodal astrocytes participate in activity-dependent myelin remodeling through exocytosis, then, as with synaptic plasticity in the visual system, the process must be driven by alterations in neuronal firing other than those produced by BVD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Allocation of Visuospatial Attention Indexes Evidence Accumulation for Reach Decisions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visuospatial attention is a prerequisite for the performance of visually guided movements: perceptual discrimination is regularly enhanced at target locations before movement initiation. It is known that this attentional prioritization evolves over the time of movement preparation; however, it is not clear whether this build-up simply reflects a time requirement of attention formation or whether, instead, attention build-up reflects the emergence of the movement decision. To address this question, we combined behavioral experiments, psychophysics, and computational decision-making models to characterize the time course of attention build-up during motor preparation. Participants (<I>n</I> = 46, 29 female) executed center-out reaches to one of two potential target locations and reported the identity of a visual discrimination target (DT) that occurred concurrently at one of various time-points during movement preparation and execution. Visual discrimination increased simultaneously at the two potential target locations but was modulated by the experiment-wide probability that a given location would become the final goal. Attention increased further for the location that was then designated as the final goal location, with a time course closely related to movement initiation. A sequential sampling model of decision-making faithfully predicted key temporal characteristics of attentional allocation. Together, these findings provide evidence that visuospatial attentional prioritization during motor preparation does not simply reflect that a spatial location has been selected as movement goal, but rather indexes the time-extended, cumulative decision that leads to the selection, hence constituting a link between perceptual and motor aspects of sensorimotor decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors common to leading eye health conditions and major non-communicable diseases: a rapid review and commentary [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To gain an understanding of the intersection of risk factors between the most prevalent eye health conditions that are associated with vision impairment and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Methods: A series of rapid reviews of reviews reporting on non-modifiable risk factors, age and sex, and modifiable risk factors, including social determinants, were conducted for five common eye health conditions that are the leading causes of vision impairment globally (refractive error including uncorrected refractive error, cataract, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy) and five prevalent NCDs (cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, dementia, and depressive disorders). Articles published within approximately 5 years to the end of 2019 were identified through expert recommendation, PubMED, Ovid Medline, the Lancet Global Burden of Disease series, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and World Cancer Research Fund.    Results: Of 9,213 records identified, 320 records were eligible. Eye health conditions and NCDs share many risk factors. Increased age was found to be the most common shared risk factor, associated with increased risks of AMD, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, refractive error, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia. Other shared risk factors included smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption (mixed results), and physical activity was protective, though limited evidence was found for eye conditions. Social determinants are well documented as risk factors for NCDs. Conclusion: There is substantial overlap in common established risk factors for the most frequent vision impairing eye conditions and leading NCDs. Increasing efforts should be made to integrate preventative and risk reduction interventions to improve health, with greatest shared benefits for initiatives which aim to reduce smoking, improve diet, and promote physical activity.

     alt="Human cortical amygdala dendrites and spines morphology under open-source three-dimensional reconstruction procedures"/>
<p>Golgi-impregnated human neurons and dendritic spines were 3D reconstructed using opensource software. A pyramidal-like neuron from the human cortical amygdaloid complex with various spiny dendritic segments can be observed at different angles of rotation. Spines in a <i>continuum</i> of shapes and sizes were reconstructed using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm for image segmentation. They were classified as stubby (s), wide (w), thin (t), mushroom-like (m), ramified (r), or “atypical”/transitional ones (a).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visualizing nerve cells has been fundamental for the systematic description of brain structure and function in humans and other species. Different approaches aimed to unravel the morphological features of neuron types and diversity. The inherent complexity of the human nervous tissue and the need for proper histological processing have made studying human dendrites and spines challenging in postmortem samples. In this study, we used Golgi data and open-source software for 3D image reconstruction of human neurons from the cortical amygdaloid nucleus to show different dendrites and pleomorphic spines at different angles. Procedures required minimal equipment and generated high-quality images for differently shaped cells. We used the “single-section” Golgi method adapted for the human brain to engender 3D reconstructed images of the neuronal cell body and the dendritic ramification by adopting a neuronal tracing procedure. In addition, we elaborated 3D reconstructions to visualize heterogeneous dendritic spines using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm for image segmentation. These tools provided an additional upgrade and enhanced visual display of information related to the spatial orientation of dendritic branches and for dendritic spines of varied sizes and shapes in these human subcortical neurons. This same approach can be adapted for other techniques, areas of the central or peripheral nervous system, and comparative analysis between species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine as emergency antihypertension in severe preeclampsia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Preeclampsia is a highly prevalent disease among pregnant women. In the event of hypertensive emergency, nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine are assigned as first-line therapies in preeclampsia. Further studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of these drugs to find the most cost-effective drug with minimal side effects. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these drugs in lowering blood pressure during hypertensive emergencies in severe preeclampsia. Methods: 60 pregnant women with severe preeclampsia were recruited in this multiple centre double-blind randomized clinical trial from May 2021 to April 2022 in Indonesia. The patients were divided equally into three groups and treated with three doses of nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine, respectively within one hour with 20 minutes interval. The effectiveness was measured based on systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The observation was carried out until five hours post-third dose administration.   Results: The blood pressure was reduced significantly after the administration of the first to the third dose of each antihypertensive (p<0.05). A single dose administration, four, one, and three patients had 20% MAP reduction in nifedipine, labetalol, and hydralazine group. Three, seven, and one patient had a failure of reaching 20% MAP reduction even after receiving the third dose. The effectiveness of the drugs to achieve 20% reduction of MAP could be ranked as follows: nifedipine>labetalol>hydralazine (57.49%, 42.13%, and 40.87%, respectively) for single dose and hydralazine>nifedipine>labetalol (111.3%, 85.12%, and 90.04%, respectively) for triple dose. Conclusions: Nifedipine is the most effective drug to reduce the blood pressure when single dose administration is used, but requires more doses to further reduce the blood pressure. Hydralazine is the most effective when the drug administration is maxed up to three doses within 60 minutes with 20 minutes interval.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cost effectiveness of Electronic Gate Keeping (EGK) system on laboratory tests demand at a rural academic hospital in Eastern Cape, South Africa: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Monitoring laboratory expenditure is crucial to ensure that laboratory services remain sustainable and affordable. In South Africa, the National Department of Health (NDoH) and its partner, the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) collaborated to introduce Electronic Gate Keeping (EGK) systems across the country. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of EGK on laboratory tests requested at a rural academic hospital in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Methods: The methodological approach involved the use of a cross-sectional study design. For 24 months (June 2015 to May 2017), data on the number and types of laboratory tests initially requested along with those rejected because there were unnecessary was obtained. Data management and cost effectiveness analysis to estimate cost savings due to EGK on laboratory test demands were carried out using MS Excel and Stata software. There were 28 types of tests requested, of which 22 were chemical tests, two were haematological tests, and four were serological tests. Results: Out of 448 028 tests requested, 17,480 (3.9%) were rejected after being identified as unnecessary through the EGK system. This rejection rate of 3.9% generated cost savings of USD 51,967.07. The top three tests that generated the most savings were the c-reactive protein (USD 6,077.68), free thyroxine (USD 5,199.92) and hepatitis A IgM (USD 3,813.61). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that the introduction of EGK has positive spinoffs; it reduced costs, strengthened the dialogue between clinicians and pathologists allowing a platform for continuous education, teaching and learning.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of IL-6, ferritin, and coagulopathy in COVID-19 clinical progression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In COVID-19, the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in the cytokine storm, primarily interleukin-6 (IL-6), has been hypothesized to induce pulmonary intravascular coagulation. However, the relationship between IL-6 and coagulopathy remains unclear in COVID-19 progression. We aimed to investigate the correlation of IL-6 with D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), and ferritin. Furthermore, we also analyzed the effect of those parameters on the worsening of COVID-19 patients. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients from June 2020 to January 2021. A serial evaluation of IL-6, D-dimer, fibrinogen, ferritin, and PT was performed and correlated with the patient's condition at admission and on the 14th day. The outcomes (improvement, worsening, or discharged patients) were recorded during the study. Results Of 374 patients, 73 study subjects (61 severe and 12 moderate COVID-19) were included in this study. A total of 35 out of 61 severe and one out of 12 moderate illness subjects had experienced worsening. Spearman-rank correlation of IL-6 with with ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PT was 0.08 (p=0.5), −0.13 (p=0.27), 0.01 (p=0.91), and 0.03 (p=0.77), respectively. In ROC analysis, D-dimer (74,77%) and IL-6 (71,32%) were the highest among other variables (>60%). Conclusions In COVID-19 patients, there was a correlation between elevated IL-6 and D-dimer levels with disease deterioration. There was no correlation between elevated IL-6 levels with ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PT levels. Therefore, changes in IL-6 and D-dimer can predict worsening in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evidence of mitochondria origin of SARS-CoV-2 double-membrane vesicles: a review. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than 600 million people and killed more than 6 million people worldwide. This infection affects mainly certain groups of people that have high susceptibility to present severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises their health. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting health, economy, and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of viral replication cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several findings have unexpectedly discovered that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV). In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, discovered almost 15 years ago, comprise a subpopulation characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress, and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome and other findings link SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria and support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the morphological, biochemical, molecular, and cellular evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. In this scheme, some relevant questions are raised as pending topics for research that would help in the near future to test this hypothesis. The intention of this work is to provide a novel framework that could open new possibilities to tackle SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through mitochondria and DMV targeted therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 5; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products, mostly as food supplements. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to hydrolytic conversion of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 293 food products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 28 products (10%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC, with the safety of CBD itself currently being unclear with significant uncertainties regarding possible liver and reproductive toxicity. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

                Background   The postural abnormality, forward shoulder posture (FSP), is the most common cause of respiratory impairment in older individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study found that performing pectoral stretching and scapular strengthening exercises for eight weeks could reduce FSP in healthy participants. We aimed to determine the effects of pectoral stretching and scapular stabilizer strengthening exercises on FSP, chest wall mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in male patients with COPD.  Methods   This study was randomized clinical trial. Forty male COPD patients with FSP aged 60–90 years were included and randomly allocated to control (n=20) and exercise (n=20) groups. Following completion of the scapulothoracic exercises (three days/week, for eight weeks), respiratory functions were assessed by measuring the magnitude of FSP, chest mobility, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary functions.  Results   FSP and thoracic kyphosis angle significantly decreased compared to controls (p<0.001, p<0.001). Middle and lower chest mobility markedly increased (p<0.001, p<0.001) and the pectoralis minor index significantly improved (p<0.001). The strength of the lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles significantly increased at week eight of the exercise training (p<0.003, p<0.001). There was a marked increase in maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure (p<0.001, p<0.001).  Conclusions   The eight-week combined pectoral muscles self-stretching and serratus anterior and lower trapezius strengthening exercises could be an effective treatment and/or prevention strategy for FSP reduction, leading to improved respiratory function in male COPD patients.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Employing orexin-A immunohistochemistry, we describe the distribution, morphology, and nuclear parcellation of orexinergic neurons within the hypothalami of an Asiatic lion (<i>Panthera leo</i> subsp. <i>persica</i>), an African lion (<i>Panthera leo</i> subsp. <i>melanochaita</i>), and a Southeast African cheetah (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i> subsp. <i>jubatus</i>). In all three felids, the clustering of large, bipolar, and multipolar hypothalamic orexinergic neurons primarily follows the pattern observed in other mammals. The orexinergic neurons were found, primarily, to form three distinct clusters—the main, zona incerta, and optic tract clusters. In addition, large orexinergic neurons were observed in the ventromedial supraoptic region of the hypothalamus, where they are not typically observed in other species. As has been observed in cetartiodactyls and the African elephant, a cluster of small, multipolar orexinergic neurons, the parvocellular cluster, was observed in the medial zone of the hypothalamus in all three felids, although this parvocellular cluster has not been reported in other carnivores. In both subspecies of lions, but not the cheetah, potential orexin-immunopositive neurons were observed in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, the lateral part of the retrochiasmatic area, and the inner layer of the median eminence. The distribution and parcellation of orexinergic neurons in the hypothalami of the three felids studied appear to be more complex than observed in many other mammals and for the two subspecies of lion may be even more complex. These findings are discussed in terms of potential technical concerns, phylogenetic variations of this system, and potentially associated functional aspects of the orexinergic system.</p>

                Background: Dengue fever is still a public health issue in Indonesia, and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, integrated digital technology will be required for its control. This study aimed to identify the factors that influence attitudes toward dengue control concerning the potential application of digital technology. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey, with 515 people willing to fill out an online questionnaire. The analysis was conducted using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). There were 46 indicators used to assess attitudes toward dengue control, which are organized into six variables: the need for digital information systems, perceptions of being threatened with dengue, the benefits of dengue control programs, program constraints, environmental factors and attitudes in dengue control. Results:  The source of information needed for dengue control was mainly through social media. There was a positive relationship between perception of environmental factors to perception of dengue threat, perception of program constraints, perception of program benefits, and perception of digital technology needs. Perception of program benefits and threatened perception of dengue have a positive relationship with perception of digital technology needs. Conclusions: This model showed the variables perception of digital technology and perception of benefits had a positive association with attitude towards dengue control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Protein prediction models support widespread post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance by interacting partners</a></h4>

Protein and mRNA levels correlate only moderately. The availability of proteogenomics data sets with protein and transcript measurements from matching samples is providing new opportunities to assess the degree to which protein levels in a system can be predicted from mRNA information. Here we examined the contributions of input features in protein abundance prediction models. Using large proteogenomics data from 8 cancer types within the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) data set, we trained models to predict the abundance of over 13,000 proteins using matching transcriptome data from up to 958 tumor or normal adjacent tissue samples each, and compared predictive performances across algorithms, data set sizes, and input features. Over one-third of proteins (4,648) showed relatively poor predictability (elastic net r ≤ 0.3) from their cognate transcripts. Moreover, we found widespread occurrences where the abundance of a protein is considerably less well explained by its own cognate transcript level than that of one or more trans locus transcripts. The incorporation of additional trans-locus transcript abundance data as input features increasingly improved the ability to predict sample protein abundance. Transcripts that contribute to non-cognate protein abundance primarily involve those encoding known or predicted interaction partners of the protein of interest, including not only large multi-protein complexes as previously shown, but also small stable complexes in the proteome with only one or few stable interacting partners. Network analysis further shows a complex proteome-wide interdependency of protein abundance on the transcript levels of multiple interacting partners. The predictive model analysis here therefore supports that protein-protein interaction including in small protein complexes exert post-transcriptional influence on proteome compositions more broadly than previously recognized. Moreover, the results suggest mRNA and protein co-expression analysis may have utility for finding gene interactions and predicting expression changes in biological systems.

BIPS (Build Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing library) is a software that converts a list of proteins into a custom DNA oligonucleotide library for the PhIP-Seq system. The tool creates constant-length oligonucleotides with internal barcodes, while maintaining the original length of the peptide. This allows using large libraries, of hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotides, while saving on the costs of sequencing and maintaining the accuracy of oligonucleotide reads identification. BIPS is available under GNU public license from: https://github.com/kalkairis/BuildPhIPSeqLibrary.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Reproducibility efforts as a teaching tool: A pilot study</a></h4>

The “replication crisis” is a methodological problem in which many scientific research findings have been difficult or impossible to replicate. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential aspect of the scientific method, such failures endanger the credibility of theories based on them and possibly significant portions of scientific knowledge. An instance of the replication crisis, analytic replication, pertains to reproducing published results through computational reanalysis of the authors’ original data. However, direct replications are costly, time-consuming, and unrewarded in today’s publishing standards. We propose that bioinformatics and computational biology students replicate recent discoveries as part of their curriculum. Considering the above, we performed a pilot study in one of the graduate-level courses we developed and taught at our University. The course is entitled Intro to R Programming and is meant for students in our Master’s and PhD programs who have little to no programming skills. As the course emphasized real-world data analysis, we thought it would be an appropriate setting to carry out this study. The primary objective was to expose the students to real biological data analysis problems. These include locating and downloading the needed datasets, understanding any underlying conventions and annotations, understanding the analytical methods, and regenerating multiple graphs from their assigned article. The secondary goal was to determine whether the assigned articles contained sufficient information for a graduate-level student to replicate its figures. Overall, the students successfully reproduced 39% of the figures. The main obstacles were the need for more advanced programming skills and the incomplete documentation of the applied methods. Students were engaged, enthusiastic, and focused throughout the semester. We believe that this teaching approach will allow students to make fundamental scientific contributions under appropriate supervision. It will teach them about the scientific process, the importance of reporting standards, and the importance of openness.

As the number of observations submitted to the citizen science platform iNaturalist continues to grow, it is increasingly important that these observations can be identified to the finest taxonomic level, maximizing their value for biodiversity research. Here, we explore the benefits of acting as an identifier on iNaturalist.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel statistical method for long-term coronavirus modelling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Novel coronavirus disease has been recently a concern for worldwide public health. To determine epidemic rate probability at any time in any region of interest, one needs efficient bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-regional environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of novel coronavirus infection rate. Traditional statistical methods dealing with temporal observations of multi-regional processes do not have the multi-dimensionality advantage, that suggested methodology offers, namely dealing efficiently with multiple regions at the same time and accounting for cross-correlations between different regional observations. Methods: Modern multi-dimensional novel statistical method was directly applied to raw clinical data, able to deal with territorial mapping. Novel reliability method based on statistical extreme value theory has been suggested to deal with challenging epidemic forecast. Authors used MATLAB optimization software. Results: This paper described a novel bio-system reliability approach, particularly suitable for multi-country environmental and health systems, observed over a sufficient period of time, resulting in a reliable long-term forecast of extreme novel coronavirus death rate probability.  Namely, accurate maximum recorded patient numbers are predicted for the years to come for the analyzed provinces. Conclusions:  The suggested method performed well by supplying not only an estimate but 95% confidence interval as well.  Note that suggested methodology is not limited to any specific epidemics or any specific terrain, namely its truly general. The only assumption and limitation is bio-system stationarity, alternatively trend analysis should be performed first.  The suggested methodology can be used in various public health applications, based on their clinical survey data.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, viewed with transcranial ultrasound, is a risk marker for Parkinson's disease. We hypothesized that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy adults aged 50–70 years is associated with reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition in primary motor cortex, and that the reduced intracortical inhibition is associated with neurochemical markers of activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Short-interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation in primary motor cortex was assessed with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation in 23 healthy adults with normal (<i>n</i> = 14; 61 ± 7 yrs) or abnormally enlarged (hyperechogenic; <i>n</i> = 9; 60 ± 6 yrs) area of SN echogenicity. Thirteen of these participants (7 SN− and 6 SN+) also underwent brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate pre-SMA neurochemistry. There was no relationship between area of SN echogenicity and short-interval intracortical inhibition in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. There was a significant positive relationship, however, between area of echogenicity in the right SN and the magnitude of intracortical facilitation in the right (ipsilateral) primary motor cortex (<i>p</i> = .005; multivariate regression), evidenced by the amplitude of the conditioned motor evoked potential (MEP) at the 10–12 ms interstimulus interval. This relationship was not present on the left side. Pre-SMA glutamate did not predict primary motor cortex inhibition or facilitation. The results suggest that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy older adults may be associated with changes in excitability of motor cortical circuitry. The results advance understanding of brain changes in healthy older adults at risk of Parkinson's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systematic analysis of membrane contact sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae uncovers modulators of cellular lipid distribution</a></h4>

              
                Actively maintained close appositions between organelle membranes, also known as contact sites, enable the efficient transfer of biomolecules between cellular compartments. Several such sites have been described as well as their tethering machineries. Despite these advances we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of the function and regulation of most contact sites. To systematically characterize contact site proteomes, we established a high-throughput screening approach in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> based on co-localization imaging. We imaged split fluorescence reporters for six different contact sites, several of which are poorly characterized, on the background of 1165 strains expressing a mCherry-tagged yeast protein that has a cellular punctate distribution (a hallmark of contact sites), under regulation of the strong <i>TEF2</i> promoter. By scoring both co-localization events and effects on reporter size and abundance, we discovered over 100 new potential contact site residents and effectors in yeast. Focusing on several of the newly identified residents, we identified three homologs of Vps13 and Atg2 that are residents of multiple contact sites. These proteins share their lipid transport domain, thus expanding this family of lipid transporters. Analysis of another candidate, Ypr097w, which we now call Lec1 (<span class="underline">L</span>ipid-droplet <span class="underline">E</span>rgosterol <span class="underline">C</span>ortex 1), revealed that this previously uncharacterized protein dynamically shifts between lipid droplets and the cell cortex, and plays a role in regulation of ergosterol distribution in the cell. Overall, our analysis expands the universe of contact site residents and effectors and creates a rich database to mine for new functions, tethers, and regulators.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mcm2 promotes stem cell differentiation via its ability to bind H3-H4</a></h4>

              
                Mcm2, a subunit of the Mcm2-7 helicase best known for its role in DNA replication, contains a histone binding motif that facilitates the transfer of parental histones following DNA replication. Here we show that Mcm2 is important for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Mcm2-2A mutation defective in histone binding shows defects in silencing of pluripotent genes and the induction of lineage specific genes. The defects in the induction of lineage specific genes in the mutant cells are likely, at least in part, due to reduced binding to Asf1a, a histone chaperone that binds Mcm2 and is important for nucleosome disassembly at bivalent chromatin domains containing repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 modifications during differentiation. Mcm2 localizes at transcription starting sites and the binding of Mcm2 at gene promoters is disrupted in both Mcm2-2A ES cells and neuro-precursor cells (NPCs). Reduced Mcm2 binding at bivalent chromatin domains in Mcm2-2A ES cells correlates with decreased chromatin accessibility at corresponding sites in NPCs. Together, our studies reveal a novel function of Mcm2 in ES cell differentiation, likely through manipulating chromatin landscapes at bivalent chromatin domains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endosymbiotic selective pressure at the origin of eukaryotic cell biology</a></h4>

              
                The dichotomy that separates prokaryotic from eukaryotic cells runs deep. The transition from pro- to eukaryote evolution is poorly understood due to a lack of reliable intermediate forms and definitions regarding the nature of the first host that could no longer be considered a prokaryote, the first eukaryotic common ancestor, FECA. The last eukaryotic common ancestor, LECA, was a complex cell that united all traits characterising eukaryotic biology including a mitochondrion. The role of the endosymbiotic organelle in this radical transition towards complex life forms is, however, sometimes questioned. In particular the discovery of the asgard archaea has stimulated discussions regarding the pre-endosymbiotic complexity of FECA. Here we review differences and similarities among models that view eukaryotic traits as isolated coincidental events in asgard archaeal evolution or, on the contrary, as a result of and in response to endosymbiosis. Inspecting eukaryotic traits from the perspective of the endosymbiont uncovers that eukaryotic cell biology can be explained as having evolved as a solution to housing a semi-autonomous organelle and why the addition of another endosymbiont, the plastid, added no extra compartments. Mitochondria provided the selective pressures for the origin (and continued maintenance) of eukaryotic cell complexity. Moreover, they also provided the energetic benefit throughout eukaryogenesis for evolving thousands of gene families unique to eukaryotes. Hence, a synthesis of the current data lets us conclude that traits such as the Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, autophagosomes, and meiosis and sex evolved as a response to the selective pressures an endosymbiont imposes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robotic multi-probe single-actuator inchworm neural microdrive</a></h4>

              
                A wide range of techniques in neuroscience involve placing individual probes at precise locations in the brain. However, large-scale measurement and manipulation of the brain using such methods have been severely limited by the inability to miniaturize systems for probe positioning. Here, we present a fundamentally new, remote-controlled micropositioning approach composed of novel phase-change material-filled resistive heater micro-grippers arranged in an inchworm motor configuration. The microscopic dimensions, stability, gentle gripping action, individual electronic control, and high packing density of the grippers allow micrometer-precision independent positioning of many arbitrarily shaped probes using a single piezo actuator. This multi-probe single-actuator design significantly reduces the size and weight and allows for potential automation of microdrives. We demonstrate accurate placement of multiple electrodes into the rat hippocampus in vivo in acute and chronic preparations. Our robotic microdrive technology should therefore enable the scaling up of many types of multi-probe applications in neuroscience and other fields.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SRSF10 is essential for progenitor spermatogonia expansion by regulating alternative splicing</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing expands the transcriptome and proteome complexity and plays essential roles in tissue development and human diseases. However, how alternative splicing regulates spermatogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, using a germ cell-specific knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that the splicing factor <i>Srsf10</i> is essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility. In the absence of SRSF10, spermatogonial stem cells can be formed, but the expansion of Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger (PLZF)-positive undifferentiated progenitors was impaired, followed by the failure of spermatogonia differentiation (marked by KIT expression) and meiosis initiation. This was further evidenced by the decreased expression of progenitor cell markers in bulk RNA-seq, and much less progenitor and differentiating spermatogonia in single-cell RNA-seq data. Notably, SRSF10 directly binds thousands of genes in isolated THY<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia, and <i>Srsf10</i> depletion disturbed the alternative splicing of genes that are preferentially associated with germ cell development, cell cycle, and chromosome segregation, including <i>Nasp</i>, <i>Bclaf1</i>, <i>Rif1</i>, <i>Dazl</i>, <i>Kit</i>, <i>Ret,</i> and <i>Sycp1</i>. These data suggest that SRSF10 is critical for the expansion of undifferentiated progenitors by regulating alternative splicing, expanding our understanding of the mechanism underlying spermatogenesis.

                A major limitation of current reports on insect declines is the lack of standardized, long-term, and taxonomically broad time series. Here, we demonstrate the utility of environmental DNA from archived leaf material to characterize plant-associated arthropod communities. We base our work on several multi-decadal leaf time series from tree canopies in four land use types, which were sampled as part of a long-term environmental monitoring program across Germany. Using these highly standardized and well-preserved samples, we analyze temporal changes in communities of several thousand arthropod species belonging to 23 orders using metabarcoding and quantitative PCR. Our data do not support widespread declines of <i>α</i>-diversity or genetic variation within sites. Instead, we find a gradual community turnover, which results in temporal and spatial biotic homogenization, across all land use types and all arthropod orders. Our results suggest that insect decline is more complex than mere <i>α</i>-diversity loss, but can be driven by <i>β</i>-diversity decay across space and time.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An automated feeding system for the African killifish reveals effects of dietary restriction on lifespan and allows scalable assessment of associative learning</a></h4>

              
                The African turquoise killifish is an exciting new vertebrate model for aging studies. A significant challenge for any model organism is the control over its diet in space and time. To address this challenge, we created an automated and networked fish feeding system. Our automated feeder is designed to be open-source, easily transferable, and built from widely available components. Compared to manual feeding, our automated system is highly precise and flexible. As a proof-of-concept for the feeding flexibility of these automated feeders, we define a favorable regimen for growth and fertility for the African killifish and a dietary restriction regimen where both feeding time and quantity are reduced. We show that this dietary restriction regimen extends lifespan in males (but not in females) and impacts the transcriptomes of killifish livers in a sex-specific manner. Moreover, combining our automated feeding system with a video camera, we establish a quantitative associative learning assay to provide an integrative measure of cognitive performance for the killifish. The ability to precisely control food delivery in the killifish opens new areas to assess lifespan and cognitive behavior dynamics and to screen for dietary interventions and drugs in a scalable manner previously impossible with traditional vertebrate model organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal masking and rollover in the neural code for speech with and without hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Natural sounds, such as speech, are complex time-varying waveforms containing information critical to how we communicate with each other and navigate the external world. Hearing loss results in a breakdown of this information and causes distortions in the neural code. As a result, perception of complex sounds such as speech is compromised. This problem is further complicated by the fact that sound intensity varies in natural settings, both in quiet and in noisy backgrounds. Somewhat paradoxically, despite increased audibility at high sound intensities, perception and discrimination of speech is actually diminished, especially in the presence of background noise. This phenomenon is known as rollover of speech and its neural basis is poorly understood in both normal-hearing listeners and hearing-impaired listeners. Here we performed in-vivo electrophysiology in awake and anaesthetized Mongolian gerbils (Meriones Unguiculatus) to investigate how hearing loss affects the neural encoding of speech. We presented 22 Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV) syllables to the gerbil and recorded neural responses from the inferior colliculus (IC). We used a k-nearest neighbor neural classifier to investigate whether IC neurons could discriminate between different consonants in normal hearing (NH) and noise-exposed hearing-loss (HL) animals. We found that neural correlates of perceptual rollover were present in the IC and that performance in discrimination decreased when VCVs were presented in background noise when compared to in quiet. Furthermore, we found that forward masking played a prominent role in shaping neural responses and discrimination between various consonants in NH and HL animals. These results suggest there is a critical trade-off in listening between audibility and rollover mediated by temporal masking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time as a supervisor: temporal regularity and auditory object learning</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems appear to learn to transform incoming sensory information into perceptual representations that can inform and guide behavior, or objects, with minimal explicit supervision. Here, we propose that the auditory system can achieve this goal by using time as a supervisor, i.e., by learning features of a stimulus that are temporally regular. We will show that this procedure generates a feature space sufficient to support fundamental computations of auditory perception. In detail, we consider the problem of discriminating between instances of a prototypical class of natural auditory objects, i.e., rhesus macaque vocalizations. We test discrimination in two ethologically relevant tasks: discrimination in a cluttered acoustic background, and generalization to discriminate between novel exemplars. We show that an algorithm that learns these temporally regular features affords better or equivalent discrimination and generalization than a conventional feature-selection algorithm, i.e., principal component analysis. Our findings suggest that the slow temporal features of auditory stimuli may be sufficient for parsing auditory scenes, and that the auditory brain should utilize these slowly changing temporal features.

                In expert readers, a brain region known as the visual word form area (VWFA) is highly sensitive to written words, exhibiting a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasing sensitivity to orthographic stimuli whose statistics match those of real words. Using high-resolution 7T fMRI, we ask whether, in bilingual readers, distinct cortical patches specialize for different languages. In 21 English-French bilinguals, unsmoothed 1.2 mm fMRI revealed that the VWFA is actually composed of several small cortical patches highly selective for reading, with a posterior-to-anterior word similarity gradient, but with near-complete overlap between the two languages. In 10 English-Chinese bilinguals, however, while most word-specific patches exhibited similar reading specificity and word-similarity gradients for reading in Chinese and English, additional patches responded specifically to Chinese writing and, surprisingly, to faces. Our results show that the acquisition of multiple writing systems can indeed tune the visual cortex differently in bilinguals, sometimes leading to the emergence of cortical patches specialized for a single language.

                Encoding of visual information is a necessary requirement for most types of episodic memories. In search for a neural signature of memory formation, amplitude modulation of neural activity has been repeatedly shown to correlate with and suggested to be functionally involved in successful memory encoding. We here report a complementary view on why and how brain activity relates to memory, indicating a functional role of cortico-ocular interactions for episodic memory formation. Recording simultaneous magnetoencephalography and eye tracking in 35 human participants, we demonstrate that gaze variability and amplitude modulations of alpha/beta oscillations (10-20 Hz) in visual cortex covary and predict subsequent memory performance between and within participants. Amplitude variation during pre-stimulus baseline was associated with gaze direction variability, echoing the co-variation observed during scene encoding. We conclude that encoding of visual information engages unison coupling between oculomotor and visual areas in the service of memory formation.

                Chimeric RNAs have been found in both cancer and healthy human cells. They have regulatory effects on human stem/progenitor cell differentiation, stemness maintenance and central nervous system (CNS) development. However, their physiological functions in the retinal development remain unknown. Based on the human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-derived retinal organoids (ROs) spanning from day 0 to day 120, we present the expression atlas of chimeric RNAs throughout the developing ROs. We confirmed the existence of some common chimeric RNAs and also discovered many novel chimeric RNAs during retinal development. We focused on CTNNBIP1-CLSTN1 (CTCL) whose downregulation causes precocious neuronal differentiation and a marked reduction of neural progenitors in human cerebral organoids. Our study found that CTCL also plays a key role in human retinogenesis, CTCL loss-of-function obstructed RO differentiation but prompted the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) differentiation. Together, this work provides a landscape of chimeric RNAs and reveals evidence for their crucial roles in human retina development.

                A significant proportion of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients experience drug-resistant seizures associated with mesial temporal sclerosis, in which there is extensive cell loss in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields, with a relative sparing of dentate gyrus granule cells and the CA2 pyramidal neurons. A role for CA2 in seizure generation was suggested based on findings of a reduction in synaptic inhibition (Williamson & Spencer, 1994) and the presence of interictal-like spike activity in resected hippocampal tissue from TLE patients (Wittner et al., 2009). We recently found that in the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus mouse model of TLE there was an increase in CA2 intrinsic excitability associated with a loss of CA2 synaptic inhibition. Furthermore, chemogenetic silencing of CA2 significantly reduced seizure frequency, consistent with a role of CA2 in promoting seizure generation and/or propagation (Whitebirch et al., 2022). In the present study we explored the basis of this inhibitory deficit using immunohistochemical and electrophysiological approaches. We report a widespread decrease in the density of pro-cholecystokinin-immunopositive interneurons and a functional impairment of cholecystokinin-expressing interneuron-mediated inhibition of CA2 pyramidal neurons. We also found a decrease in the density of CA2 parvalbumin-immunopositive interneurons and disruption to the pyramidal neuron-associated perisomatic perineuronal net in the CA2 subfield. These data reveal a set of pathological alterations that may disrupt inhibition of CA2 pyramidal neurons and their downstream targets in epileptic mice.

                Postsynaptic plasticity is not accessible as a selection criterion for molecular identification of neurons by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). The currently available methods to find specific connection plasticity ex vivo have inherently low throughput. To overcome these limitations and pre-select neurons based on short-term postsynaptic plasticity for soma harvesting and subsequent scRNA-seq we created Voltage-Seq. First, we established all-optical voltage imaging and recorded the short-term postsynaptic plasticity of 6911 periaqueductal gray (PAG) neurons evoked by optogenetic activation of the ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) input. Postsynaptic response-types were classified and spatially resolved in the entire innervated PAG. Next, to browse and identify all-optical responses, we built a quick on-site analysis named VoltView which incorporated the a priori VMH-PAG connectome database as a classifier. VoltView targetedly identifies postsynaptic neurons for somatic harvesting. We demonstrated the agility of Voltage-Seq in locating GABAergic PAG neurons, guided by an all-optical connectivity map and on-site classification in VoltView.

                The human brain contains an extraordinarily diverse set of neuronal and glial cell types. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics have begun to delineate the cellular heterogeneity in different brain regions, but the transcriptional regulatory programs responsible for the identity and function of each brain cell type remain to be defined. Here, we carried out single nucleus ATAC-seq analysis to probe the open chromatin landscape from over 1.1 million cells in 42 brain regions of three neurotypical adult donors. Integrative analysis of the resulting data identified 107 distinct cell types and revealed the cell-type-specific usage of 544,735 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the human genome. Nearly 1/3 of them displayed sequence conservation as well as chromatin accessibility in the mouse brain. On the other hand, nearly 40% cCREs were human specific, with chromatin accessibility associated with species-restricted gene expression. Interestingly, these human specific cCREs were enriched for distinct families of retrotransposable elements, which displayed cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility. We uncovered strong associations between specific brain cell types and neuropsychiatric disorders. We futher developed deep learning models to predict regulatory function of non-coding disease risk variants.

                The electrophysiological technology having a high spatio-temporal resolution at the single-cell level, and noninvasive measurements of large areas provides insights on underlying neuronal function. Here, we used a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-microelectrode array (MEA) that uses 236,880 electrodes each with an electrode size of 11.22 x 11.22 {micro}m and 236,880 covering a wide area of 5.5 x 5.7 mm in presenting a detailed and single-cell-level neural activity analysis platform for brain slices, human iPS cell-derived cortical networks, peripheral neurons, and human brain organoids. Propagation pattern characteristics between brain regions changes the synaptic strength into compounds based on single-cell time-series patterns, classification based on single DRG neuron firing patterns and compound responses, axonal conduction characteristics and changes to anticancer drugs, and network activities and transition to compounds in brain organoids were extracted. This detailed analysis of neural activity at the single-cell level using our CMOS-MEA provides a new understanding the basic mechanisms of brain circuits in vitro and ex vivo, on human neurological diseases for drug discovery, and compound toxicity assessment.

                Our brain employs mechanisms to adapt to changing visual conditions. In addition to natural changes in our physiology and those in the environment, our brain is also capable of adapting to unnatural changes, such as inverted visual-inputs generated by inverting prisms. In this study, we examined the brains capability to adapt to hyperspaces. We generated four spatial-dimensional stimuli in virtual reality and tested the ability to distinguish between rigid and non-rigid motion. We found that observers are able to differentiate rigid and non-rigid motion of tesseracts (4D) with a performance comparable to that obtained using cubes (3D). Moreover, observers performance improved when they were provided with more immersive 3D experience but remained robust against increasing shape variations. At this juncture, we characterize our findings as 3[1/2]D perception since, while we show the ability to extract and use 4D information, we do not have yet evidence of a complete phenomenal 4D experience.

                N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors are essential for many brain functions. These receptors are heterotetramers typically comprising two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 subunits. The latter could alternate among four subtypes (N2A-N2D) and determine the functional diversity of NMDA receptors. For example, receptors containing N2C or N2D exhibit 50-fold lower channel open probability (Po) than those containing N2A. Structures of N2A- and N2B-containing receptors have been extensively characterized, providing molecular basis for understanding NMDA receptor function. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of N1-N2D and N1-N2C di-heterotetramers (di-receptors), and N1-N2A-N2C tri-heterotetramer (tri-receptor) at a resolution up to 3.0 angstroms. Structural analysis showed that the bilobate N-terminal domain (NTD) in N2D adopted an intrinsic closed conformation, leading to a compact NTD tetramer in N1-N2D receptor. Functional studies further demonstrated that, in di-receptors containing N2D but not N2A or N2B, crosslinking NTD at the tetrameric interface had no effect on channel activity, while crosslinking ligand-binding domain (LBD) of two N1 protomers significantly elevated Po. Surprisingly, we found that the N1-N2C di-receptors spontaneously oscillated between symmetric and asymmetric conformation. The later one occupied a predominant population, whereby two N2C protomers exhibited distinct conformation. This asymmetry, which was also found to a lesser extent in N1-N2A di-receptor, was further locked by the binding of an N2C-specific allosteric potentiator PYD-106 to a unique binding pocket between NTD and LBD in only one N2C protomer. Finally, N2A and N2C in the N1-N2A-N2C tri-receptor displayed the conformation close to that found in one protomer of N1-N2A and N1-N2C di-receptors, respectively. These findings provide a comprehensive structural understanding of diverse functional properties of major NMDA receptor subtypes.

	<p>Objective: Drug dependence has become a major global public health problem. This study aimed to investigate the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and neurological damage in methamphetamine (MA)-dependent individuals. Methods: MA-dependent individuals (all males) were recruited and randomly divided into MA exercise group (MAE) and MA control group (MAC) by using random number table method. The MAE group underwent 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, and the MAC group underwent conventional detoxification. The Neurofilament light chain (NfL), S100 calcium binding protein b (S100b), and Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) levels in the blood of MA-dependent individuals were measured before and after the exercise intervention. Results: After the exercise intervention was implemented, the amount of change in NfL in the plasma of the MAE (1.75 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.40) group was significantly different from that of the MAC (0.60 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.21) group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01); the amount of change in NSE in the serum of the MAE [&amp;amp;minus;1.51 (&amp;amp;minus;3.99~0.31)] group was significantly different from that of the MAC [0.03 (&amp;amp;minus;1.18~1.16)] group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); and the amount of change in S100b in the serum of the MAE [0.66 (0.40~0.95)] group was not significantly different from that of the MAC (0.60 (0.21~1.04)) group (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed that 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise treatment significantly promoted the recovery of blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and neurological damage in MA-dependent patients compared with conventional withdrawal.</p>

	<p>White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are commonly observed in older adults and are associated with cognitive impairment. Although previous studies have found abnormal functional connectivities in patients with WMHs based on static functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the topological properties in the context of brain dynamics remain relatively unexplored. Herein, we explored disrupted dynamic topological properties of functional network connectivity in patients with WMHs and its relationship with cognitive impairment. We included 36 healthy controls (HC) and 104 patients with mild WMHs (n = 39), moderate WMHs (n = 37), and severe (n = 28) WMHs. The fMRI data of all participants were analyzed using Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) and a sliding-window approach to generate dynamic functional connectivity matrics. Then, graph theory methods were applied to calculate the topological properties. Comprehensive neuropsychological scales were used to assess cognitive functions. Relationships between cognitive functions and abnormal dynamic topological properties were evaluated by Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation. We found that the patients with WMHs had higher temporal variability in regional properties, including betweenness centrality, nodal efficiencies, and nodal clustering coefficient. Furthermore, we found that the degree of centrality was related to executive function and memory, and the local coefficient correlated to executive function. Our results indicate that patients with WMHs have higher temporal variabilities in regional properties and are associated with executive and memory function.</p>

	<p>The clothing industry is one of the biggest polluters impacting the environment. Set in a sustainable environment, this study addresses whether certain ambient odors can influence the purchase of second-hand clothing. This study fulfilled three aims, increasing methodological, statistical, and theoretical rigor. First, replicating the finding that fresh laundry odor can boost purchasing behavior in a second-hand store&amp;amp;mdash;this time in a larger sample, using a fully counterbalanced design, in a pre-registered study. Second, assessing the effectiveness of another cleanliness priming control condition (citrus odor) unrelated to the products at hand, to test hypotheses from a hedonic vs. utilitarian model. Third, combining questionnaire data tapping into psychological processes with registered sales. The results (316 questionnaires, 6781 registered transactions) showed that fresh laundry odor significantly increased the amount of money spent by customers compared to the no smell condition, (replication) and compared to citrus odor (extension). Arguably, fresh laundry odor boosts the utilitarian value of the product at (second) hand by making it smell like non-used clothing, ultimately causing customers to purchase far greater amounts in this sustainable setting.</p>

	<p>Sleep and mental health can affect cognition and academic performance. The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between sleep, mental health, working memory, and academic performance. We collected demographic data from university students during the non-academic summer period and the academic term. We also measured academic performance (GPA), sleep (PSQI), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and disordered social media use (SMDS). Working memory was assessed by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). We assessed 83 students (42.2% male) with a mean age of 21 years. Compared to the non-academic summer period, students had significantly worse sleep and distress scores in the academic term. Anxiety, depression, and distress scores were significantly correlated with worse sleep quality. Despite worse mental health and sleep in the academic term, working memory improved compared to the non-academic summer period and was also correlated with a higher GPA. However, a higher GPA was significantly associated with longer sleep latency, increased sleep disturbances, and increased use of sleep medication. Students experiencing poor sleep suffered from poor mental health, although they maintained high GPA and working memory scores. Cognitive resilience, including higher working memory, may mask poor sleep quality and mental health among university students.</p>

	<p>Background: In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and the safety of flow diverter devices (FDD) in anterior communicating artery (ACoA) region aneurysms, focusing on anatomical factors that could affect the outcome, such as the location of the aneurysm along the ACoA (centered on ACoA or decentered on the A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction) and the anatomy of the ACoA region. Methods: Clinical, procedural and follow-up data were analyzed. Aneurysms were classified according to the location along the ACoA (centered or decentered on the A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction) and on the basis of the anatomical configuration of the ACoA region. Safety was assessed by recording intraprocedural, periprocedural and delayed complications to determine the morbidity and mortality rates. The functional outcome was evaluated with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) prior to and after the endovascular procedure. To assess the efficacy, midterm and long-term clinical, angiographic and cross-sectional imaging follow-ups were recorded. Subgroup analysis according to the different ACoA regional anatomical configurations and the ACoA aneurysm locations were performed. Results: 33 patients (17 males; 16 females) with ACoA region aneurysms were treated with FDDs. 27 aneurysms were located at the A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction (82%) while the remaining six aneurysms were centered on the ACoA. No mortality was recorded. The overall morbidity rate was 6% (2/33 procedures). Major complications occurred in 33% (2/6) of ACoA aneurysms and in the 0% of A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction aneurysms. Mid-term and long-term neuroimaging follow-ups showed the occlusion of the aneurysm in 28/33 cases (85%). Complete occlusion rates were 93% in the A1&amp;amp;ndash;A2 junction aneurysms and 50% in ACoA aneurysms. Conclusions: The FDD is a safe and effective tool that can be used in the treatment of selected cases of ACoA region aneurysms. The location of the aneurysm along the ACoA and the regional anatomy of the ACoA complex could affect the efficacy and safety.</p>

	<p>Background: Locked-In Syndrome (LIS) is a rare neurological condition in which patients&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to move, interact, and communicate is impaired despite their being conscious and awake. After assessing the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s needs, we developed a customized device for an LIS patient, as the commercial augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices could not be used. Methods: A 51-year-old woman with incomplete LIS for 15 years came to our laboratory seeking a communication tool. After excluding the available AAC devices, a careful evaluation led to the creation of a customized device (hardware + software). Two years later, we assessed the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s satisfaction with the device. Results: A switch-operated voice-scanning communicator, which the patient could control by residual movement of her thumb without seeing the computer screen, was implemented, together with postural strategies. The user and her family were generally satisfied with the customized device, with a top rating for its effectiveness: it fit well the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s communication needs. Conclusions: Using customized AAC and strategies provides greater opportunities for patients with LIS to resolve their communication problems. Moreover, listening to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s and family&amp;amp;rsquo;s needs can help increase the AAC&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential. The presented switch-operated voice-scanning communicator is available for free on request to the authors.</p>

	<p>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data can be used to develop computer-assisted diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases such as aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) and other lysosomal storage disorders. MR images contain features that are suitable for the classification and differentiation of affected individuals from healthy persons. Here, comparisons were made between MRI features extracted from different types of magnetic resonance images. Random forest classifiers were trained to classify AGU patients (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 24) using volumetric features extracted from T1-weighted MR images, the zone variance of gray level size zone matrix (GLSZM) calculated from magnitude susceptibility-weighted MR images, and the caudate&amp;amp;ndash;thalamus intensity ratio computed from T2-weighted MR images. The leave-one-out cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to compare different models. The left&amp;amp;ndash;right-averaged, normalized volumes of the 25 nuclei of the thalamus and the zone variance of the thalamus demonstrated equal and excellent performance as classifier features for binary organization between AGU patients and healthy controls. Our findings show that texture-based features of susceptibility-weighted images and thalamic volumes can differentiate AGU patients from healthy controls with a very low error rate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PD-L1 expression as predictor of immunotherapy eligibility in penile squamous cell carcinoma patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Penile cancer is a rare malignancy and potentially lethal disease with an incidence of 0,6-2,1 per 100.000. Squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) is the most commonly found penile malignancy. PD-L1 is a tumor marker that co-stimulates the receptor PD-1 to suppress T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study with a total sampling method. The slides taken from the biopsies of seventy-six male patients from Haji Adam Malik Hospital diagnosed with penile squamous cell carcinoma who have already undergone penile biopsy were re-examined for this study, and PD-L1 levels were measured accordingly. Statistical methods were used to assess the association between PD-L1 levels and with SqCC stage. Results: A total of 76 male patients are the subjects of this study. PD-L1 positivity is identified in 25 patients with +1 intensity in 10 patients (13,2%), +2 in 7 patients (9,2) and +3 intensity in 8 patients (10,5%). There are 36 patients (47,4%) diagnosed with stage T3 SqCC, 35 patients (46,1%) with stage N2 SqCC, and 10 patients (13,2%) with stage M1 SqCC. There is significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and metastasis (p=0,022). However, there is no significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and stage N tumor (p=0,167). Conclusions: PD-L1 highly expressed in advanced stage penile SqCC (32.9%), which is associated with the high-risk clinicopathologic features and poor clinical outcomes. These findings showed a potential usage of immunotherapy in advanced penile SqCC treatment.

                Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models are regarded as gold standard preclinical models in leukaemia research, especially in testing new drug combinations where typically 45-50 mice are used per assay. 9000 animal experiments are performed annually in the UK in leukaemia research with these expensive procedures being classed as moderate severity, meaning they cause significant pain, suffering and visible distress to animal’s state. Furthermore, not all clinical leukaemia samples engraft and when they do data turnaround time can be between 6-12 months. Heavy dependence on animal models is because clinical leukaemia samples do not proliferate in vitro. Alternative cell line models though popular for drug testing are not biomimetic – they are not dependent on the microenvironment for survival, growth and treatment response and being derived from relapse samples they do not capture the molecular complexity observed at disease presentation. Here we have developed an in vitro platform to rapidly establish co-cultures of patient-derived leukaemia cells with 3D bone marrow mesenchyme spheroids, BM-MSC-spheroids.  We optimise protocols for developing MSC-spheroid leukaemia co-culture using clinical samples and deliver drug response data within a week. Using three patient samples representing distinct cytogenetics we show that patient-derived-leukaemia cells show enhanced proliferation when co-cultured with MSC-spheroids. In addition, MSC-spheroids provided improved protection against treatment. This makes our spheroids suitable to model treatment resistance – a major hurdle in current day cancer management Given this 3Rs approach is 12 months faster (in delivering clinical data), is a human cell-based biomimetic model and uses 45-50 fewer animals/drug-response assay the anticipated target end-users would include academia and pharmaceutical industry. This animal replacement prototype would facilitate clinically translatable research to be performed with greater ethical, social and financial sustainability.

                Introduction This study examines how the Covid-19 economic impact and parental stress are moderated by family resilience to relate to the family quality of life (FQOL). Methods We modify the measure of FQOL, developed by Beach Center on Disability, by including only four domains (i.e., family interaction, parenting, emotional well-being, and material well-being) to adjust to our research context. Results Based on 169 participants, our CFA displays that all employed measures in the study are valid and reliable. Our regression analysis shows that there are significant direct relations of parental stress & family resilience with family quality of life. However, we find that family resilience only positively moderates the relation between the Covid-19 economic impact and family quality of life. Discussion This study presents a view on how the Covid-19 pandemic affects the way families live and hence, their quality of life.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms of Axon Growth and Regeneration: Moving between Development and Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Axons differ in their growth potential: whereas during development, axons rapidly grow to their targets, in the adult mammalian, CNS axons have lost their ability to grow and therefore fail to regenerate. Recent progress has enabled a better understanding of how developmental mechanisms direct axon regeneration. Focusing on neuronal polarization, where one neurite is singled out to become the axon, has uncovered the mechanisms initiating axon growth and growth restraint. This has helped to define the processes that need to be reactivated to induce axon regeneration: microtubule stabilization and actin dynamics. The molecular machinery underlying axon growth and axon regeneration is remarkably similar and includes the Rho-GTPases Cdc42, Rac-1, and RhoA, as well as the actin regulators cofilin and Myosin II. Importantly, neuron-intrinsic growth inhibitors in the adult nervous system, including the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit &alpha;22 and the presynaptic active zone protein Munc13, restrain dynamics while the components driving axon growth remain largely present. The identified molecules suggest that synaptic transmission and axon growth may be processes that exclude each other. As a result, axon regeneration may be hampered by synaptic transmission and, thus, by the maturation of the CNS. This research has led to several translational avenues to induce axon regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury and stroke; these include the drugs epothilones, gabapentinoids, and baclofen. Thus, the investigation of axon growth and regeneration side by side has been instrumental to coax the regenerative potential of the CNS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cerebellar Contributions to the Basal Ganglia Influence Motor Coordination, Reward Processing, and Movement Vigor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are known for their roles in motor control and motivated behavior. These two systems have been classically considered as independent structures that coordinate their contributions to behavior via separate cortico-thalamic loops. However, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of a rich set of direct connections between these two regions. Although there is strong evidence for connections in both directions, for brevity we limit our discussion to the better-characterized connections from the cerebellum to the basal ganglia. We review two sets of such connections: disynaptic projections through the thalamus and direct monosynaptic projections to the midbrain dopaminergic nuclei, the VTA and the SNc. In each case, we review the evidence for these pathways from anatomic tracing and physiological recordings, and discuss their potential functional roles. We present evidence that the disynaptic pathway through the thalamus is involved in motor coordination, and that its dysfunction contributes to motor deficits, such as dystonia. We then discuss how cerebellar projections to the VTA and SNc influence dopamine release in the respective targets of these nuclei: the NAc and the dorsal striatum. We argue that the cerebellar projections to the VTA may play a role in reward-based learning and therefore contribute to addictive behavior, whereas the projection to the SNc may contribute to movement vigor. Finally, we speculate how these projections may explain many of the observations that indicate a role for the cerebellum in mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Neurosurgical Functional Dissection of the Middle Precentral Gyrus during Speech Production</a></h4>

              
                <p>Classical models have traditionally focused on the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) as a key region for motor planning of speech production. However, converging evidence suggests that it is not critical for either speech motor planning or execution. Alternative cortical areas supporting high-level speech motor planning have yet to be defined. In this review, we focus on the precentral gyrus, whose role in speech production is often thought to be limited to lower-level articulatory muscle control. In particular, we highlight neurosurgical investigations that have shed light on a cortical region anatomically located near the midpoint of the precentral gyrus, hence called the middle precentral gyrus (midPrCG). The midPrCG is functionally located between dorsal hand and ventral orofacial cortical representations and exhibits unique sensorimotor and multisensory functions relevant for speech processing. This includes motor control of the larynx, auditory processing, as well as a role in reading and writing. Furthermore, direct electrical stimulation of midPrCG can evoke complex movements, such as vocalization, and selective injury can cause deficits in verbal fluency, such as pure apraxia of speech. Based on these findings, we propose that midPrCG is essential to phonological-motoric aspects of speech production, especially syllabic-level speech sequencing, a role traditionally ascribed to Broca's area. The midPrCG is a cortical brain area that should be included in contemporary models of speech production with a unique role in speech motor planning and execution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Better Inference in Neuroscience: Test Less, Estimate More</a></h4>

              
                <p>Null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has become the main tool of inference in neuroscience, and yet evidence suggests we do not use this tool well: tests are often planned poorly, conducted unfairly, and interpreted invalidly. This editorial makes the case that in addition to reforms to increase rigor we should test less, reserving NHST for clearly confirmatory contexts in which the researcher has derived a quantitative prediction, can provide the inputs needed to plan a quality test, and can specify the criteria not only for confirming their hypothesis but also for rejecting it. A reduction in testing would be accompanied by an expansion of the use of estimation [effect sizes and confidence intervals (CIs)]. Estimation is more suitable for exploratory research, provides the inputs needed to plan strong tests, and provides important contexts for properly interpreting tests.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroscience Needs to Test Both Statistical and Scientific Hypotheses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experimental neuroscience typically uses "<I>p</I>-valued" statistical testing procedures (null hypothesis significance testing; NHST) in evaluating its results. The rote, often misguided, application of NHST (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B13">Gigerenzer, 2008</cross-ref>) has led to errors and "questionable research practices." Although the problems could be avoided with better statistics training (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B23">Lakens, 2021</cross-ref>), there have been calls to abandon NHST altogether. One suggestion is to replace NHST with "estimation statistics" (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B10">Calin-Jageman and Cumming, 2019</cross-ref>). Estimation statistics emphasizes the uncertainty inherent in scientific investigations and uses metrics, e.g., confidence intervals (CIs), that draw attention to uncertainty. Besides procedural steps and methods, the Estimation Approach prefers expressing "quantitative," rather than "qualitative" conclusions and making generalizations, rather than testing scientific hypotheses. The Estimation Approach embodies a philosophy of science&mdash;its ultimate goals, experimental mindset, and specific aims&mdash;that diverges unhelpfully from what laboratory-based neuroscience needs. The Estimation Approach meshes naturally with, e.g., clinical neuroscience, drug development, human psychology, and social sciences. It fits less well with much of the neuroscience published in the <I>Journal of Neuroscience</I>, for example. In contrast, the philosophy behind NHST fits naturally with traditional, evaluative testing of scientific hypotheses. Finally, some Estimation Approach remedies, e.g., replication, ideally with "preregistration," are incompatible with much experimental neuroscience. This Dual Perspective essay argues that, while neuroscience can benefit from practical aspects of estimation statistics, entirely replacing conventional methods with the Estimation Approach would be a mistake. NHST testing should be retained and improved.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Experimental neuroscience relies on statistical procedures to assess the meaning and importance of its research findings. Optimal scientific communication demands a common set of assumptions for expressing and evaluating results. Problems arising from misuse of conventional significance testing methods have led to a proposal to replace significance testing with an Estimation Statistics Approach. Practical elements of the Estimation Approach can usefully be incorporated into conventional methods. However, the prevailing philosophy of the Estimation Approach does not address certain important needs of much experimental neuroscience. Neuroscience should adopt beneficial elements of the Estimation Approach without giving up the advantages of significance testing.</p>

                <p>Psychedelic drugs have reemerged as tools to treat several brain disorders. Cultural attitudes toward them are changing, and scientists are once again investigating the neural mechanisms through which these drugs impact brain function. The significance of this research direction is reflected by recent work, including work presented by these authors at the 2022 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. As of 2022, there were hundreds of clinical trials recruiting participants for testing the therapeutic effects of psychedelics. Emerging evidence suggests that psychedelic drugs may exert some of their long-lasting therapeutic effects by inducing structural and functional neural plasticity. Herein, basic and clinical research attempting to elucidate the mechanisms of these compounds is showcased. Topics covered include psychedelic receptor binding sites, effects of psychedelics on gene expression, and on dendrites, and psychedelic effects on microcircuitry and brain-wide circuits. We describe unmet clinical needs and the current state of translation to the clinic for psychedelics, as well as other unanswered basic neuroscience questions addressable with future studies.</p>

                <p>Since the discovery of conspicuously spatially tuned neurons in the hippocampal formation over 50 years ago, characterizing which, where, and how neurons encode navigationally relevant variables has been a major thrust of navigational neuroscience. While much of this effort has centered on the hippocampal formation and functionally-adjacent structures, recent work suggests that spatial codes, in some form or another, can be found throughout the brain, even in areas traditionally associated with sensation, movement, and executive function. In this review, we highlight these unexpected results, draw insights from comparison of these codes across contexts, regions, and species, and finally suggest an avenue for future work to make sense of these diverse and dynamic navigational codes.</p>

                <p>Dendrites receive the vast majority of a single neuron's inputs, and coordinate the transformation of these signals into neuronal output. <I>Ex vivo</I> and theoretical evidence has shown that dendrites possess powerful processing capabilities, yet little is known about how these mechanisms are engaged in the intact brain or how they influence circuit dynamics. New experimental and computational technologies have led to a surge in interest to unravel and harness their computational potential. This review highlights recent and emerging work that combines established and cutting-edge technologies to identify the role of dendrites in brain function. We discuss active dendritic mediation of sensory perception and learning in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Complementing these physiological findings, we present theoretical work that provides new insights into the underlying computations of single neurons and networks by using biologically plausible implementations of dendritic processes. Finally, we present a novel brain&ndash;computer interface task, which assays somatodendritic coupling to study the mechanisms of biological credit assignment. Together, these findings present exciting progress in understanding how dendrites are critical for <I>in vivo</I> learning and behavior, and highlight how subcellular processes can contribute to our understanding of both biological and artificial neural computation.</p>

Accordingly, perturbations of PFC inhibitory microcircuits are thought to underlie dysregulated cognition and behavior in numerous psychiatric diseases and relevant animal models. This review, based on a Mini-Symposium presented at the 2022 Society for Neuroscience Meeting, highlights recent studies providing novel insights into: (1) discrete medial PFC (mPFC) interneuron populations in the mouse brain; (2) mPFC interneuron connections with, and regulation of, long-range mPFC afferents; and (3) circuit-specific plasticity of mPFC interneurons. The contributions of such populations, pathways, and plasticity to rodent cognition are discussed in the context of stress, reward, motivational conflict, and genetic mutations relevant to psychiatric disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Mechanisms Mediating Sex Differences in Motivation for Reward: Cognitive Bias, Food, Gambling, and Drugs of Abuse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sex differences in motivation for food rewards, gambling, and drugs of abuse are modulated by multiple factors, including sensory stimuli, gonadal hormones, and cognitive bias. Cues, drugs of abuse, and a high-fat diet can significantly impact neural signaling in the reward system and functioning of neural systems that regulate executive functions differentially in males and females. Additionally, sex differences in risky decision-making, cognitive bias, and motivation for food and drugs of abuse are mediated by gonadal hormones in both sexes. As neuroscientists analyze data from both sexes, it is becoming apparent that these differences are not simply mediated by hormones in females, but involve sex differences in the specific neural responses to stimuli, including both external stimuli and internal hormonal signals. Understanding sex differences in the mechanisms underlying reward-seeking behaviors and the development of substance use disorders will help uncover potential therapies and treatments that will benefit both men and women. Based on these observations, it is essential that females are included in neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Super-Resolution Microscopy Opens New Doors to Life at the Nanoscale</a></h4>

              
                <p>Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy holds tremendous potential for discovery in neuroscience. Much of the molecular machinery and anatomic specializations that give rise to the unique and bewildering electrochemical activity of neurons are nanoscale by design, ranging somewhere between 1 nm and 1 &mu;m. It is at this scale where most of the unknown and exciting action is and where cell biologists flock to in their dreams, but it was off limits for light microscopy until recently. While the optical principles of super-resolution microscopy are firmly established by now, the technology continues to advance rapidly in many crucial areas, enhancing its performance and reliability, and making it more accessible and user-friendly, which is sorely needed. Indeed, super-resolution microscopy techniques are nowadays widely used for visualizing immunolabeled protein distributions in fixed or living cells. However, a great potential of super-resolution microscopy for neuroscience lies in shining light on the nanoscale structures and biochemical activities in live-tissue settings, which should be developed and harnessed much more fully. In this review, we will present several vivid examples based on STED and RESOLFT super-resolution microscopy, illustrating the possibilities and challenges of nano-imaging <I>in vivo</I> to pique the interest of tech-developers and neurobiologists alike. We will cover recent technical progress that is facilitating <I>in vivo</I> applications, and share new biological insights into the nanoscale mechanisms of cellular communication between neurons and glia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Music and Brain Circuitry: Strategies for Strengthening Evidence-Based Research for Music-Based Interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neuroscience of music and music-based interventions (MBIs) is a fascinating but challenging research field. While music is a ubiquitous component of every human society, MBIs may encompass listening to music, performing music, music-based movement, undergoing music education and training, or receiving treatment from music therapists. Unraveling the brain circuits activated and influenced by MBIs may help us gain better understanding of the therapeutic and educational values of MBIs by gathering strong research evidence. However, the complexity and variety of MBIs impose unique research challenges. This article reviews the recent endeavor led by the National Institutes of Health to support evidence-based research of MBIs and their impact on health and diseases. It also highlights fundamental challenges and strategies of MBI research with emphases on the utilization of animal models, human brain imaging and stimulation technologies, behavior and motion capturing tools, and computational approaches. It concludes with suggestions of basic requirements when studying MBIs and promising future directions to further strengthen evidence-based research on MBIs in connections with brain circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Music and music-based interventions (MBI) engage a wide range of brain circuits and hold promising therapeutic potentials for a variety of health conditions. Comparative studies using animal models have helped in uncovering brain circuit activities involved in rhythm perception, while human imaging, brain stimulation, and motion capture technologies have enabled neural circuit analysis underlying the effects of MBIs on motor, affective/reward, and cognitive function. Combining computational analysis, such as prediction method, with mechanistic studies in animal models and humans may unravel the complexity of MBIs and their effects on health and disease.</p>

                <p>Understanding the unique functions of different subregions of primate prefrontal cortex has been a longstanding goal in cognitive neuroscience. Yet, the anatomy and function of one of its largest subregions (the frontopolar cortex) remain enigmatic and underspecified. Our Society for Neuroscience minisymposium <I>Primate Frontopolar Cortex: From Circuits to Complex Behaviors</I> will comprise a range of new anatomic and functional approaches that have helped to clarify the basic circuit anatomy of the frontal pole, its functional involvement during performance of cognitively demanding behavioral paradigms in monkeys and humans, and its clinical potential as a target for noninvasive brain stimulation in patients with brain disorders. This review consolidates knowledge about the anatomy and connectivity of frontopolar cortex and provides an integrative summary of its function in primates. We aim to answer the question: what, if anything, does frontopolar cortex contribute to goal-directed cognition and action?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retrograde Axonal Autophagy and Endocytic Pathways Are Parallel and Separate in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Autophagy and endocytic trafficking are two key pathways that regulate the composition and integrity of the neuronal proteome. Alterations in these pathways are sufficient to cause neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, defining how autophagy and endocytic pathways are organized in neurons remains a key area of investigation. These pathways share many features and converge on lysosomes for cargo degradation, but what remains unclear is the degree to which the identity of each pathway is preserved in each compartment of the neuron. Here, we elucidate the degree of intersection between autophagic and endocytic pathways in axons of primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Using microfluidic chambers, we labeled newly-generated bulk endosomes and signaling endosomes in the distal axon, and systematically tracked their trajectories, molecular composition, and functional characteristics relative to autophagosomes. We find that newly-formed endosomes and autophagosomes both undergo retrograde transport in the axon, but as distinct organelle populations. Moreover, these pathways differ in their degree of acidification and association with molecular determinants of organelle maturation. These results suggest that the identity of autophagic and newly endocytosed organelles is preserved for the length of the axon. Lastly, we find that expression of a pathogenic form of &alpha;-synuclein, a protein enriched in presynaptic terminals, increases merging between autophagic and endocytic pathways. Thus, aberrant merging of these pathways may represent a mechanism contributing to neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related &alpha;-synucleinopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autophagy and endocytic trafficking are retrograde pathways in neuronal axons that fulfill critical degradative and signaling functions. These pathways share many features and converge on lysosomes for cargo degradation, but the extent to which the identity of each pathway is preserved in axons is unclear. We find that autophagosomes and endosomes formed in the distal axon undergo retrograde transport to the soma in parallel and separate pathways. These pathways also have distinct maturation profiles along the mid-axon, further highlighting differences in the potential fate of transported cargo. Strikingly, expression of a pathogenic variant of &alpha;-synuclein increases merging between autophagic and endocytic pathways, suggesting that mis-sorting of axonal cargo may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related &alpha;-synucleinopathies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Olig2 Ablation in Immature Oligodendrocytes Does Not Enhance CNS Myelination and Remyelination</a></h4>

              
                <p>The oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage transcription factor Olig2 is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is essential for oligodendroglial progenitor specification and differentiation. It was previously reported that deletion of <I>Olig2</I> enhanced the maturation and myelination of immature OLs and accelerated the remyelination process. However, by analyzing multiple <I>Olig2</I> conditional KO mouse lines (male and female), we conclude that Olig2 has the opposite effect and is required for OL maturation and remyelination. We found that deletion of <I>Olig2</I> in immature OLs driven by an immature OL-expressing <I>Plp1</I> promoter resulted in defects in OL maturation and myelination, and did not enhance remyelination after demyelination. Similarly, <I>Olig2</I> deletion during premyelinating stages in immature OLs using <I>Mobp</I> or <I>Mog</I> promoter-driven Cre lines also did not enhance OL maturation in the CNS. Further, we found that Olig2 was not required for myelin maintenance in mature OLs but was critical for remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelinating injury. Analysis of genomic occupancy in immature and mature OLs revealed that Olig2 targets the enhancers of key myelination-related genes for OL maturation from immature OLs. Together, by leveraging multiple immature OL-expressing Cre lines, these studies indicate that Olig2 is essential for differentiation and myelination of immature OLs and myelin repair. Our findings raise fundamental questions about the previously proposed role of Olig2 in opposing OL myelination and highlight the importance of using Cre-dependent reporter(s) for lineage tracing in studying cell state progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identification of the regulators that promote oligodendrocyte (OL) myelination and remyelination is important for promoting myelin repair in devastating demyelinating diseases. Olig2 is expressed throughout OL lineage development. Ablation of <I>Olig2</I> was reported to induce maturation, myelination, and remyelination from immature OLs. However, lineage-mapping analysis of <I>Olig2</I>-ablated cells was not conducted. Here, by leveraging multiple immature OL-expressing Cre lines, we observed no evidence that <I>Olig2</I> ablation promotes maturation or remyelination of immature OLs. Instead, we find that Olig2 is required for immature OL maturation, myelination, and myelin repair. These data raise fundamental questions about the proposed inhibitory role of Olig2 against OL maturation and remyelination. Our findings highlight the importance of validating genetic manipulation with cell lineage tracing in studying myelination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrating Visual Information into the Auditory Cortex Promotes Sound Discrimination through Choice-Related Multisensory Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>An increasing number of studies have shown that cross-modal interaction can occur in early sensory cortices. Yet, how neurons in sensory cortices integrate multisensory cues in perceptual tasks and to what extent this influences behavior is largely unclear. To investigate, we examined visual modulation of auditory responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in a two-alternative forced-choice task. During the task, male rats were required to make a behavioral choice based on the pure tone frequency (low vs high) of the self-triggered stimulus to get a water reward. The result showed that the presence of a noninformative visual cue did not uniformly influence auditory response, with frequently enhancing just one of them. Closely correlated with behavioral choice, the visual cue mainly enhanced responsiveness to the auditory cue indicating a movement direction contralateral to A1 being recorded. Operating in this fashion provided A1 neurons a superior capability to discriminate sound during multisensory trials. Concomitantly, behavioral data and decoding analysis revealed that visual cue presence could speed the process of sound discrimination. We also observed this differential multisensory integration effect in well-trained rats when tested with passive stimulation and under anesthesia, albeit to a much lesser extent. We did not see this differentially integrative effect while recording in A1 in another similar group of rats performing a free-choice task. These data suggest that auditory cortex can engage in meaningful audiovisual processing, and perceptual learning can modify its multisensory integration mechanism to meet task requirements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the natural environment, visual stimuli are frequently accompanied by auditory cues. Although multisensory integration has traditionally been seen as a feature of associational cortices, recent studies have shown that cross-modal inputs can also influence neuronal activity in primary sensory cortices. However, exactly how neurons in sensory cortices integrate multisensory cues to guide behavioral choice is still unclear. Here, we describe a novel model of multisensory integration used by A1 neurons to shape auditory representations when rats performed a cue-guided task. We found that a task-irrelevant visual cue could specifically enhance the response of neurons in sound guiding to the contralateral choice. This differentially integrative model facilitated sound discrimination and behavioral choice. This result indicates that task engagement can modulate multisensory integration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Theta Paradox: 4-8 Hz EEG Oscillations Reflect Both Sleep Pressure and Cognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations characterize specific behavioral and vigilance states. The frequency of these oscillations is typically sufficient to distinguish a given state; however, theta oscillations (4&ndash;8 Hz) have instead been found in near-opposite conditions of drowsiness during sleep deprivation and alert cognitive control. While the latter has been extensively studied and is often referred to as "frontal midline theta," (fmTheta) the former has been investigated far less but is considered a marker for sleep pressure during wake. In this study we investigated to what extent theta oscillations differed during cognitive tasks and sleep deprivation. We measured high-density EEG in 18 young healthy adults (nine female) performing six tasks under three levels of sleep deprivation. We found both cognitive load and sleep deprivation increased theta power in medial prefrontal cortical areas; however, sleep deprivation caused additional increases in theta in many other, predominantly frontal, areas. The sources of sleep deprivation theta (sdTheta) were task dependent, with a visual-spatial task and short-term memory (STM) task showing the most widespread effects. Notably, theta was highest in supplementary motor areas during passive music listening, and highest in the inferior temporal cortex (responsible for object recognition) during a spatial game. Furthermore, while changes in task performance were correlated with increases in theta during sleep deprivation, this relationship was not specific to the EEG of the same task and did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Altogether, these results suggest that both during sleep deprivation and cognition theta oscillations may preferentially occur in cortical areas not involved in ongoing behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Electroencephalographic (EEG) research in sleep has often remained separate from research in cognition. This has led to two incompatible interpretations of the function of theta brain oscillations (4&ndash;8 Hz): that they reflect local sleep events during sleep deprivation, or that they reflect cognitive processing during tasks. With this study, we found no fundamental differences between theta oscillations during cognition and theta during sleep deprivation that would suggest different functions. Instead, our results indicate that in both cases, theta oscillations are generated by cortical areas not required for ongoing behavior. Therefore, at least in humans, theta may reflect either cortical disengagement or inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrity of Neuronal Size in the Entorhinal Cortex Is a Biological Substrate of Exceptional Cognitive Aging</a></h4>

              
                <p>Average aging is associated with a gradual decline of memory capacity. SuperAgers are humans &ge;80 years of age who show exceptional episodic memory at least as good as individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior. This study investigated whether neuronal integrity in the entorhinal cortex (ERC), an area critical for memory and selectively vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration, differentiated SuperAgers from cognitively healthy younger individuals, cognitively average peers ("Normal Elderly"), and individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Postmortem sections of the ERC were stained with cresyl violet to visualize neurons and immunostained with mouse monoclonal antibody PHF-1 to visualize neurofibrillary tangles. The cross-sectional area (i.e., size) of layer II and layer III/V ERC neurons were quantified. Two-thirds of total participants were female. Unbiased stereology was used to quantitate tangles in a subgroup of SuperAgers and Normal Elderly. Linear mixed-effect models were used to determine differences across groups. Quantitative measurements found that the soma size of layer II ERC neurons in postmortem brain specimens were significantly larger in SuperAgers compared with all groups (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05)&mdash;including younger individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.005). SuperAgers had significantly fewer stereologically quantified Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary tangles in layer II ERC than Normal Elderly (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). This difference in tangle burden in layer II between SuperAgers and Normal Elderly suggests that tangle-bearing neurons may be prone to shrinkage during aging. The finding that SuperAgers show ERC layer II neurons that are substantially larger even compared with individuals 20&ndash;30 years younger is remarkable, suggesting that layer II ERC integrity is a biological substrate of exceptional memory in old age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Average aging is associated with a gradual decline of memory. Previous research shows that an area critical for memory, the entorhinal cortex (ERC), is susceptible to the early formation of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, even during average (or typical) trajectories of aging. The Northwestern University SuperAging Research Program studies unique individuals known as SuperAgers, individuals &ge;80 years old who show exceptional memory that is at least as good as individuals 20&ndash;30 years their junior. In this study, we show that SuperAgers harbor larger, healthier neurons in the ERC compared with their cognitively average same-aged peers, those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and &ndash; remarkably &ndash; even compared with individuals 20&ndash;30 years younger. We conclude that larger ERC neurons are a biological signature of the SuperAging trajectory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Distribution Features and Potential Effects of Serotonin in the Cerebrum of SOD1 G93A Transgenic Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Serotonin (5-HT) participates in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but its effects have not been completely clarified. Therefore, we observed the distribution features and potential effects of 5-HT in the cerebrum of G93A SOD1 transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice by fluorescence immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, ELISA, as well as motor function measurements. Both 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) were mainly present in the limbic systems of the cerebrum, such as the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, cingulate, fimbria of the hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus, lateral hypothalamus area, dorsal raphe nucleus, and piriform cortex. TPH2 and 5-HT were expressed in cell bodies in the dorsal raphe nucleus and piriform cortex, while in other regions they were distributed as filaments and clump shapes in axons. The TPH2 distribution in the cerebrum of TG was significantly lower than that in WT in preset, onset, and progression stages. TPH2 expression in the fimbria of the hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus and lateral hypothalamus area was increased in the onset stage and decreased in the progression stage, gradually decreased in the cingulate with disease progression and significantly decreased in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and nucleus accumbens in the onset stage in TG. The number of mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 in the subventricular zone (SVZ) in TG was significantly lower than that in WT, which was correlated with the TPH2 distribution. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that TPH2, mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 and 5-HT were mainly expressed in neurons but rarely expressed in microglia or astrocytes in the piriform cortex. The relative fluorescence density of TPH2 in the cingulate region was negatively correlated with the disease severity. Our findings suggest that 5-HT plays a protective role in ALS, likely by regulating neural stem cells in the subventricular zone that might be involved in neuron development in the piriform cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Context Binding in Visual Working Memory Is Reflected in Bilateral Event-Related Potentials, But Not in Contralateral Delay Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Successful retrieval of a specific item from visual working memory (VWM) depends on the binding of that item to its unique context. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of VWM manipulating memory set homogeneity have identified an important role for the intraparietal sulcus in context binding, independent of any role in representing stimulus identity. The current study explored whether the contralateral delay activity (CDA), which is an event-related potential (ERP) component derived from posterior electrodes that tracks the amount of information held in VWM, might also be sensitive to context-binding demands. In experiment 1, human participants performed lateralized delayed recognition with memory sets containing one, three, or five items that were drawn from the same category (orientations: "homogeneous") or from different categories (orientation, color, and luminance: "heterogeneous"). Because the location and identity of the memory probe indicated the item to be retrieved, homogeneous trials placed higher context-binding demands. VWM capacity was higher in heterogeneous trials. ERPs contralateral (contra) and ipsilateral (ipsi) to the remembered stimuli were higher for homogeneous trials, but these differences were removed in the contra &ndash; ipsi subtraction that produced the CDA. In experiment 2, human participants performed lateralized delayed recall with memory sets of one or three items (homogeneous or heterogeneous). Behavior was superior for three-item heterogeneous trials than for homogeneous trials, with modeling revealing context-binding errors in the latter. Bilateral ERPs and CDA results replicated experiment 1. These results support that the CDA tracks the number of object files engaged by VWM and establish that it is not sensitive to context-binding demands.</p>

                Background: The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is used for diagnosis in inflammatory processes, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affecting our population. To determine the values of ESR in the evolution of patients with COVID-19 undergoing treatment at the CLAS Health Center in Nuevo Lurín. Methods: Our research applied a quantitative-observational, descriptive, and longitudinal approach. The sample consisted of 26 male and 19 female patients treated at the study site between February and June 2021, none of whom were in critical condition. To collect all the necessary information, the Capillary or Wintrobe method was used to determine the values of ESR in the evolution of the COVID-19 patients, obtaining different values for the 45 patients seen at the study site. The normal ESR value was 0 - 15mm/h for males and 0 - 20mm/h for females.  Results: The initial ESR test in patients positive for COVID-19 showed that only two cases (0.04%) had slightly elevated ESR ranges, while in the rest of the values (95.56%) remained within the normal range. Conclusions:  From the results of the capillary velocity of sedimentation method, it can be concluded that patients with COVID-19 in Peru showed no signs of inflammation within their bodies due to the virus.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AvP: A software package for automatic phylogenetic detection of candidate horizontal gene transfers</a></h4>

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the transfer of genes between species outside the transmission from parent to offspring. Due to their impact on the genome and biology of various species, HGTs have gained broader attention, but high-throughput methods to robustly identify them are lacking. One rapid method to identify HGT candidates is to calculate the difference in similarity between the most similar gene in closely related species and the most similar gene in distantly related species. Although metrics on similarity associated with taxonomic information can rapidly detect putative HGTs, these methods are hampered by false positives that are difficult to track. Furthermore, they do not inform on the evolutionary trajectory and events such as duplications. Hence, phylogenetic analysis is necessary to confirm HGT candidates and provide a more comprehensive view of their origin and evolutionary history. However, phylogenetic reconstruction requires several time-consuming manual steps to retrieve the homologous sequences, produce a multiple alignment, construct the phylogeny and analyze the topology to assess whether it supports the HGT hypothesis. Here, we present <i>AvP</i> which automatically performs all these steps and detects candidate HGTs within a phylogenetic framework.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">OrganoID: A versatile deep learning platform for tracking and analysis of single-organoid dynamics</a></h4>

Organoids have immense potential as <i>ex vivo</i> disease models for drug discovery and personalized drug screening. Dynamic changes in individual organoid morphology, number, and size can indicate important drug responses. However, these metrics are difficult and labor-intensive to obtain for high-throughput image datasets. Here, we present OrganoID, a robust image analysis platform that automatically recognizes, labels, and tracks single organoids, pixel-by-pixel, in brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy experiments. The platform was trained on images of pancreatic cancer organoids and validated on separate images of pancreatic, lung, colon, and adenoid cystic carcinoma organoids, which showed excellent agreement with manual measurements of organoid count (95%) and size (97%) without any parameter adjustments. Single-organoid tracking accuracy remained above 89% over a four-day time-lapse microscopy study. Automated single-organoid morphology analysis of a chemotherapy dose-response experiment identified strong dose effect sizes on organoid circularity, solidity, and eccentricity. OrganoID enables straightforward, detailed, and accurate image analysis to accelerate the use of organoids in high-throughput, data-intensive biomedical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Host circadian behaviors exert only weak selective pressure on the gut microbiome under stable conditions but are critical for recovery from antibiotic treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chi Zhao, Kevin Kelly, Maria Luísa Jabbur, Marcell Paguaga, Megan Behringer, Carl Hirschie Johnson</p>

The circadian rhythms of hosts dictate an approximately 24 h transformation in the environment experienced by their gut microbiome. The consequences of this cyclic environment on the intestinal microbiota are barely understood and are likely to have medical ramifications. Can daily rhythmicity in the gut act as a selective pressure that shapes the microbial community? Moreover, given that several bacterial species have been reported to exhibit circadian rhythms themselves, we test here whether a rhythmic environment is a selective pressure that favors clock-harboring bacteria that can anticipate and prepare for consistent daily changes in the environment. We observed that the daily rhythmicity of the mouse gut environment is a stabilizing influence that facilitates microbiotal recovery from antibiotic perturbation. The composition of the microbiome recovers to pretreatment conditions when exposed to consistent daily rhythmicity, whereas in hosts whose feeding and activity patterns are temporally disrupted, microbiotal recovery is incomplete and allows potentially unhealthy opportunists to exploit the temporal disarray. Unexpectedly, we found that in the absence of antibiotic perturbation, the gut microbiome is stable to rhythmic versus disrupted feeding and activity patterns. Comparison of our results with those of other studies reveals an intriguing correlation that a stable microbiome may be resilient to one perturbation alone (e.g., disruption of the daily timing of host behavior and feeding), but not to multiple perturbations in combination. However, after a perturbation of the stable microbiome, a regular daily pattern of host behavior/feeding appears to be essential for the microbiome to recover to the original steady state. Given the inconsistency of daily rhythms in modern human life (e.g., shiftwork, social jet-lag, irregular eating habits), these results emphasize the importance of consistent daily rhythmicity to optimal health not only directly to the host, but also indirectly by preserving the host’s microbiome in the face of perturbations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Horizontal gene transfer and ecological interactions jointly control microbiome stability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katharine Z. Coyte, Cagla Stevenson, Christopher G. Knight, Ellie Harrison, James P. J. Hall, Michael A. Brockhurst</p>

Genes encoding resistance to stressors, such as antibiotics or environmental pollutants, are widespread across microbiomes, often encoded on mobile genetic elements. Yet, despite their prevalence, the impact of resistance genes and their mobility upon the dynamics of microbial communities remains largely unknown. Here we develop eco-evolutionary theory to explore how resistance genes alter the stability of diverse microbiomes in response to stressors. We show that adding resistance genes to a microbiome typically increases its overall stability, particularly for genes on mobile genetic elements with high transfer rates that efficiently spread resistance throughout the community. However, the impact of resistance genes upon the stability of individual taxa varies dramatically depending upon the identity of individual taxa, the mobility of the resistance gene, and the network of ecological interactions within the community. Nonmobile resistance genes can benefit susceptible taxa in cooperative communities yet damage those in competitive communities. Moreover, while the transfer of mobile resistance genes generally increases the stability of previously susceptible recipient taxa to perturbation, it can decrease the stability of the originally resistant donor taxon. We confirmed key theoretical predictions experimentally using competitive soil microcosm communities. Here the stability of a susceptible microbial community to perturbation was increased by adding mobile resistance genes encoded on conjugative plasmids but was decreased when these same genes were encoded on the chromosome. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the interplay between ecological interactions and horizontal gene transfer in driving the eco-evolutionary dynamics of diverse microbiomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany – cross-sectional  lecturer-side evaluation for the application of digital teaching concepts [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant restrictions on dental teaching. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the attitudes of faculty members towards digital teaching formats and the effort creating digital lectures. We hypothesized that on the lecturer side there is no difference between the various digital teaching concepts in terms of workload and effort and that there is no increase in workload and effort when switching to digital teaching concepts. Methods: All German dental faculties were invited to the online survey by an anonymous voluntary questionnaire from January to April 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions that could be answered with a visual analog scale, free text answers, or with fixed answer options. Data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and an exploratory data analysis (α=0.05). Results: Before the pandemic, 24.8% of the participating lecturers were using digital teaching and 64.4% had no previous experience. After the outbreak of the pandemic 100% of the dental teaching was initially held online. More than 80% of the lecturers stated that they offer online lectures (86.1%), online seminars (81.2%), and/or online bedside teaching (33.7%). 88.1% see face-to-face teaching as the preferred teaching format. The lecturers also see the greatest opportunities for interaction in the area of analog teaching and significantly worse in synchronous and asynchronous digital teaching. In the course of the pandemic, respondents' attitudes towards online teaching improved in the median of 24.0 to a median of 50.0. Conclusions: Faculty members have positively changed their attitudes towards online teaching formats over the course of the pandemic. Although they see the greatest learning success in conventional face-to-face teaching formats and the creation of digital lectures is associated with a higher effort, they want more online lessons in the future.

                Background: In the past 30–40 years, conflicts over limited conventional energy sources and the negative climate change caused by them have attracted researchers and analysts to new, clean, and green energy technologies. Thereby reducing the consumption of conventional fuel and the negative impact on the climate. The production of alternative energy in the form of thermal energy storage using phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the techniques that not only reduces the gap between the supply and demand of energy but also increases the stability of the energy supply. The tendency of PCMs to melt and solidify over a wide temperature range makes them more attractive for use in many applications. The effective and efficient storage of solar energy by PCM has the potential to significantly advance the use of renewable energy. Methods: Organic non-paraffin compound beeswax (BW) mixed with other non-paraffin compounds stearic acid (SA), Palmitic acid (PA), Myristic acid (MA), and Lauric acid (LA) in different compositions with the help of magnetic stirrer at 50–60°C for 3–4 hours to prepare BWSA, BWPA, BWMA, and BWLA eutectic PCM. Results: Prepared eutectics melt and solidify in the temperature range 36–56°C and with latent heat in the range of 155–211 kJ/Kg. Conclusions: Due to suitable temperature and good latent heat storage range, it is a good choice as thermal energy storage, for solar drying applications.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The laterodorsal tegmentum and seizure regulation: Revisiting the evidence</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now a routine treatment option for patients suffering from medically refractory epilepsy. DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has proven to be effective but, despite its success, few patients experience complete cessation of seizure activity. However, improving the therapy is challenging because the mechanism underlying its action remains largely unknown. One angle on improving the effectiveness of ANT stimulation is to better understand the various anatomic regions that send projections to and through this area. Here, the authors utilized a connectomic atlas of the mouse brain to better understand the regions projecting to the ANT and were particularly interested by the presence of robust cholinergic projections from the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). A subsequent review of the literature resulted in limited studies, which presented convincing evidence supporting this region's role in seizure control present in acute rodent models of epilepsy. It is thus the purpose of this paper to encourage further research into the role of the LDT on seizure mitigation, with mechanistic effects likely stemming from its cholinergic projections to the ANT. While previous studies have laid a firm foundation supporting the role of this region in modulation of seizure activity, modern scientific methodology has yet to be applied to further elucidate the mechanisms and potential benefits associated with LDT stimulation in the epileptic population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Fewer COVID‐19 Neurological Complications with Dexamethasone and Remdesivir</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the impact of treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both on neurological complications in acute coronavirus diease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used observational data from the International Severe Acute and emerging Respiratory Infection Consortium World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterization Protocol, United Kingdom. Hospital inpatients aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted between January 31, 2020, and June 29, 2021, were included. Treatment allocation was non-blinded and performed by reporting clinicians. A propensity scoring methodology was used to minimize confounding. Treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, or both was assessed against the standard of care. The primary outcome was a neurological complication occurring at the point of death, discharge, or resolution of the COVID-19 clinical episode.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Out of 89,297 hospital inpatients, 64,088 had severe COVID-19 and 25,209 had non-hypoxic COVID-19. Neurological complications developed in 4.8% and 4.5%, respectively. In both groups, neurological complications were associated with increased mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, worse self-care on discharge, and time to recovery. In patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with dexamethasone (n = 21,129), remdesivir (n = 1,428), and both combined (n = 10,846) were associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications: OR = 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69–0.83), OR = 0.69 (95% CI = 0.51–0.90), and OR = 0.54 (95% CI = 0.47–0.61), respectively. In patients with non-hypoxic COVID-19, dexamethasone (n = 2,580) was associated with less neurological complications (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.62–0.97), whereas the dexamethasone/remdesivir combination (n = 460) showed a similar trend (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.31–1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir, or both in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications in an additive manner, such that the greatest benefit was observed in patients who received both drugs together.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to explore the gene expression profile of primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain specimens of 4 patients with granulomatous vasculitis (GV), 5 with lymphocytic vasculitis (LV), 4 with amyloid β-related angiitis (ABRA), and 4 normal controls were studied. RNA-sequencing was performed using the Illumina Hiseq-4,000 platform and the Illumina TruSeq Total-RNA library. Student <i>t</i> test and false discovery rate tests were performed for each of the differentially expressed transcripts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for the pathway expression analysis. CIBERSORT was used to estimate the abundances of different immune cell subsets in the tissues based on gene expression data.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Transcripts differentially expressed between PCNSV and normal brain indicated that endosomal, mitochondrial, and ribosome dysfunction, alterations in protein synthesis, and noncoding RNAs might be involved in PCNSV. Pathway analysis revealed the activation of dendritic cell maturation and antigen processing as well as neuroinflammation in PCNSV versus normal brain, whereas oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited. CIBERSORT estimation of immune cell subsets suggested that activated NK cells, M1 macrophages, memory B cells, and follicular helper T cells were likely to be more prevalent in PCNSV samples. Naïve CD4 T cells and monocytes were mainly estimated to be present in GV and ABRA. Plasma cell and γδ T-cell signatures were mainly found in LV and normal brain. GV showed higher levels of genes associated with macrophage activities and T cells. ABRA showed higher levels of long noncoding RNAs and miR-616. LV showed higher levels of genes encoding immunoglobulins.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RNA sequencing confirmed PCNSV heterogeneity. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling single-cell phenotypes links yeast stress acclimation to transcriptional repression and pre-stress cellular states</a></h4>

              
                Stress defense and cell growth are inversely related in bulk culture analyses; however, these studies miss substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, thus obscuring true phenotypic relationships. Here, we devised a microfluidics system to characterize multiple phenotypes in single yeast cells over time before, during, and after salt stress. The system measured cell and colony size, growth rate, and cell-cycle phase along with nuclear trans-localization of two transcription factors: stress-activated Msn2 that regulates defense genes and Dot6 that represses ribosome biogenesis genes during an active stress response. By tracking cells dynamically, we discovered unexpected discordance between Msn2 and Dot6 behavior that revealed subpopulations of cells with distinct growth properties. Surprisingly, post-stress growth recovery was positively corelated with activation of the Dot6 repressor. In contrast, cells lacking Dot6 displayed slower growth acclimation, even though they grow normally in the absence of stress. We show that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 response display faster production of Msn2-regulated Ctt1 protein, separable from the contribution of Msn2. These results are consistent with the model that transcriptional repression during acute stress in yeast provides a protective response, likely by redirecting translational capacity to induced transcripts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergence of two global regulators to coordinate expression of essential virulence determinants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is known to function as a global regulator of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> gene expression. Sequence-based transcriptomic profiling identified the mycobacterial regulon controlled by the cAMP receptor protein, CRP. In this study, we identified a new subset of CRP-associated genes including virulence determinants which are also under the control of a major regulator, PhoP. Our results suggest that PhoP as a DNA binding transcription factor, impacts expression of these genes, and phosphorylated PhoP promotes CRP recruitment at the target promoters. Further, we uncover a distinct regulatory mechanism showing that activation of these genes requires direct recruitment of both PhoP and CRP at their target promoters. The most fundamental biological insight is derived from the inhibition of CRP binding at the regulatory regions in a PhoP-deleted strain owing to CRP-PhoP protein-protein interactions. Based on these results, a model is proposed suggesting how CRP and PhoP function as co-activators of the essential pathogenic determinants. Taken together, these results uncover a novel mode of regulation where a complex of two interacting virulence factors impact expression of virulence determinants. These results have significant implications on TB pathogenesis.

                Cells convert electrical signals into chemical outputs to facilitate the active transport of information across larger distances. This electrical-to-chemical conversion requires a tightly regulated expression of ion channels. Alterations of ion channel expression provide landmarks of numerous pathological diseases, such as cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, or cancer. Although the activity of ion channels can be locally regulated by external light or chemical stimulus, it remains challenging to coordinate the expression of ion channels on extended spatial-temporal scales. Here, we engineered yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to read and convert chemical concentrations into a dynamic potassium channel expression. A synthetic dual-feedback circuit controls the expression of engineered potassium channels through phytohormones auxin and salicylate to produce a macroscopically coordinated pulses of the plasma membrane potential (PMP). Our study provides a compact experimental model to control electrical activity through gene expression in eukaryotic cell populations setting grounds for various cellular engineering, synthetic biology, and potential therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phage resistance profiling identifies new genes required for biogenesis and modification of the corynebacterial cell envelope</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria of the order <i>Corynebacteriales</i> including pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosi </i> and <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i> are characterized by their complex, multi-layered envelope. In addition to a peptidoglycan layer, these organisms possess an additional polysaccharide layer made of arabinogalactan and an outer membrane layer composed predominantly of long-chain fatty acids called mycolic acids. This so-called mycolata envelope structure is both a potent barrier against antibiotic entry into cells and a target of several antibacterial therapeutics. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mycolata envelope assembly therefore promises to reveal new ways of disrupting this unique structure for the development of antibiotics and antibiotic potentiators. Because they engage with receptors on the cell surface during infection, bacteriophages have long been used as tools to uncover important aspects of host envelope assembly. However, surprisingly little is known about the interactions between <i>Corynebacteriales </i>phages and their hosts. We therefore made use of the phages Cog and CL31 that infect <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> (<i>Cglu</i>), a model member of the <i>Corynebacteriales</i>, to discover host factors important for phage infection. A high-density transposon library of <i>Cglu</i> was challenged with these phages followed by transposon sequencing to identify resistance loci. The analysis identified an important role for mycomembrane proteins in phage infection as well as components of the arabinogalactan and mycolic acid synthesis pathways. Importantly, the approach also implicated a new gene (<i>cgp_0396</i>) in the process of arabinogalactan modification and identified a conserved new factor (AhfA, Cpg_0475) required for mycolic acid synthesis in <i>Cglu</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning-related contraction of grey matter in rodent sensorimotor cortex is associated with adaptive myelination</a></h4>

              
                From observations in rodents, it has been suggested that the cellular basis of learning-dependent changes, detected using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be increased dendritic spine density, alterations in astrocyte volume, and adaptations within intracortical myelin. Myelin plasticity is crucial for neurological function and active myelination is required for learning and memory. However, the dynamics of myelin plasticity and how it relates to morphometric-based measurements of structural plasticity remains unknown. We used a motor skill learning paradigm in male mice to evaluate experience-dependent brain plasticity by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in longitudinal MRI, combined with a cross-sectional immunohistochemical investigation. Whole brain VBM revealed non-linear decreases in grey matter volume (GMV) juxtaposed to non-linear increases in white matter volume (WMV) within GM that were best modelled by an asymptotic time course. Using an atlas-based cortical mask, we found non-linear changes with learning in primary and secondary motor areas and in somatosensory cortex. Analysis of cross-sectional myelin immunoreactivity in forelimb somatosensory cortex confirmed an increase in myelin immunoreactivity followed by a return towards baseline levels. Further investigations using quantitative confocal microscopy confirmed these changes specifically to the length density of myelinated axons. The absence of significant histological changes in cortical thickness suggests that non-linear morphometric changes are likely due to changes in intracortical myelin for which morphometric WMV in somatosensory cortex significantly correlated with myelin immunoreactivity. Together, these observations indicate a non-linear increase of intracortical myelin during learning and support the hypothesis that myelin is a component of structural changes observed by VBM during learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">T cell receptor convergence is an indicator of antigen-specific T cell response in cancer immunotherapies</a></h4>

              
                T cells are potent at eliminating pathogens and playing a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. T cell receptor (TCR) convergence describes T cells that share identical TCRs with the same amino acid sequences but have different DNA sequences due to codon degeneracy. We conducted a systematic investigation of TCR convergence using single-cell immune profiling and bulk TCRβ-sequence (TCR-seq) data obtained from both mouse and human samples, and uncovered a strong link between antigen-specificity and convergence. This association was stronger than T cell expansion, a putative indicator of antigen-specific T cells. By using flow sorted tetramer<sup>+</sup> single T cell data, we discovered that convergent T cells were enriched for a neoantigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> effector phenotype in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, TCR convergence demonstrated better prediction accuracy for immunotherapy response than the existing TCR repertoire indexes. In conclusion, convergent T cells are likely to be antigen-specific and might be a novel prognostic biomarker for anti-cancer immunotherapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Insular cortex to ventral striatum synapses encode valence of social interaction</a></h4>

              
                The decision to approach or avoid a conspecific is fundamental for survival. Affiliative (prosocial) interactions favor approach behaviors, while antagonistic (aggressive) contacts trigger avoidance. Here we ask how the brain encodes the valence of social interaction. We focused on the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in social reward processing. We observed that social interactions activate D1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) regardless of their valence. However, afferent D1- expressing neurons of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) exhibited distinct activity patterns coding for prosocial and aggressive social interaction, respectively. As a result, distinct forms of synaptic plasticity were elicited at the AIC to NAc synapses. Thus, the valence of social interaction induces distinct neural activity in the AIC, which teaches the animal to approach and avoid conspecifics in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The locus coeruleus broadcasts prediction errors across the cortex to promote sensorimotor plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Prediction errors are differences between expected and actual sensory input and are thought to be key computational signals that drive learning related plasticity. One way that prediction errors could drive learning is by activating neuromodulatory systems to gate plasticity. The catecholaminergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a major neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice exploring a virtual environment, we found that the activity of LC axons in the cortex correlated with the magnitude of unsigned visuomotor prediction errors. LC response profiles were similar in both motor and visual cortical areas, indicating that LC axons broadcast prediction errors throughout the dorsal cortex. While imaging calcium activity in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex, we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC axons facilitated learning of a stimulus-specific suppression of visual responses during locomotion. This plasticity, induced by minutes of LC axon stimulation, recapitulated the effect of visuomotor learning on a scale that is normally observed during visuomotor development across days. We conclude that prediction errors drive LC activity, and that LC activity facilitates sensorimotor plasticity in the cortex, consistent with a role in modulating learning rates.

                Birdsong is a complex and volitionally produced skilled behavior that, like speech and language, is dependent on forebrain circuits for its fluent production. The well delineated neural circuits associated with song provide a powerful system in which to study how synaptically linked networks of neurons control a natural and complex behavior. The premotor cortical analog HVC is necessary for song production and for song learning. Although the main input and output pathways of HVC have in most cases been known for decades, we still lack a detailed synaptic wiring diagram of this core circuit. Here we report our progress in building this wiring diagram. HVC has at least three non-overlapping classes of projection neurons and receives input from at least five song associated regions, totaling 15 potential synaptic pathways. Combining optogenetic stimulation of axon terminals from HVCs different afferent pathways with targeted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of HVC projection neurons, we now provide an initial synaptic connectivity map of 12 of these potential pathways. We report on 435 whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the 3 classes of HVC projection neurons, examining 4 different input pathways, from NIf, Uva, mMAN, Av, and mapping the polysynaptic and monosynaptic connections in each pathway. We find that the synaptic connectivity of HVCs input-output pathways is complex. Each class of projection neuron receives monosynaptic input from three of the four afferents and all in different combinations. At this stage, only one input pathway, NIf, appears to monosynaptically project onto all three classes of HVC projection neurons. We provide this initial synaptic mapping as an update for the field and will build on this wiring diagram, by updating this bioRxiv manuscript, as more data is collected, and additional pathways are characterized.

                Only some individuals using drugs recreationally eventually become addicted, and persist in drug seeking and taking despite adverse consequences. The neurobehavioral determinants of this individual vulnerability have not been fully elucidated. We report that in drug naive rats the future tendency to develop compulsive cocaine seeking is characterised by behavioral stickiness-related functional hypoconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex and posterior dorsomedial striatum in combination with impulsivity-related structural alterations in the infralimbic cortex, anterior insula and nucleus accumbens. These findings show that the vulnerability to develop compulsive cocaine seeking behavior stems from pre-existing structural or functional changes in two distinct cortico-striatal systems that underlie deficits in impulse control and goal-directed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modular, cement-free, customized headpost and connector-chamber implants for macaques</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neurophysiological studies with awake monkeys typically require chronic cranial implants. Headpost and connector-chamber implants are used to allow head stabilization and to house connectors of chronically implanted electrodes, respectively. New Method: We present long-lasting, modular, cement-free headpost implants made of titanium that consist of two pieces: a baseplate and a top-part. The baseplate is implanted first, covered by muscle and skin and allowed to heal and osseointegrate for several weeks to months. The percutaneous part is added in a second, brief surgery. Using a punch tool, a perfectly round skin cut is achieved providing a tight fit around the implant without any sutures. We describe the design, planning and production of manually bent and CNC-milled baseplates. We also developed a remote headposting technique that increases handling safety. Finally, we present a modular, footless connector chamber that is implanted in a similar two-step approach and achieves a minimized footprint on the skull. Results: Twelve monkeys were successfully implanted with a headpost and one with the connector chamber. To date, we report no implant failure, great headpost stability and implant condition, in four cases even more than 9 years post-implantation. Comparison with Existing Methods: The methods presented here build on several related previous methods and provide additional refinements to further increase implant longevity and handling safety. Conclusions: Optimized implants can remain stable and healthy for at least 9 years and thereby exceed the typical experiment durations. This minimizes implant-related complications and corrective surgeries and thereby significantly improves animal welfare.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bell Jar: A Semi-Automated Registration and Cell Counting Tool for Mouse Neurohistology Analysis</a></h4>

              
                To investigate the anatomical organization of neural circuits across the whole brain, it is essential to register the experimental brain tissues to a reference atlas accurately. This procedure is also a prerequisite to quantify the locations and numbers of cells of interest in specific regions. However, it remains challenging to do registration on experimental tissue due to the intrinsic variation among the specimens, tissue deformation introduced by histological processing, and the potential inconsistency in the judgment of the experimenter during manual annotation. Here, we introduce Bell Jar, a multi-platform analysis tool with semi-automated affine warping of atlas maps onto microscopic images of brain slices and machine learning-based cell detection. Bell Jar's intuitive GUI and internal dependency management enable users of all skill levels to obtain accurate results without programming expertise. To compare the performance of Bell Jar with previously published methods, we labeled neurons in the mouse visual cortex with either an engineered rabies virus or an adeno-associated virus (AAV) for neural circuit tracing and quantified Bell Jar's performance at each step of the pipeline for image alignment, segmentation, and cell counting. We demonstrated that Bell Jar's output is as reliable as manual counting by an expert; it is more accurate than currently available techniques even with noisy data and takes less time with fewer user interventions. Bell Jar is an easy-to-navigate application that provides a reproducible, automated analysis workflow to facilitate the precise mapping of histological images of the mouse brain to the reference atlas and the quantification of cellular signals it is trained to recognize.

                Cortical activity patterns occupy a small subset of possible network states. If this is due to intrinsic network properties, microstimulation of cortex should evoke activity patterns resembling those observed during natural sensory input. Here, we use optical microstimulation of virally transfected layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex to compare artificially evoked activity with natural activity evoked by whisker touch and movement ('whisking'). We find that photostimulation engages touch but not whisking responsive neurons more than expected by chance. Neurons that respond to photostimulation and touch or to touch alone exhibit higher spontaneous pairwise correlations than purely photoresponsive neurons. Exposure to several days of simultaneous touch and optogenetic stimulation raises both overlap and spontaneous activity correlations among touch and photoresponsive neurons. We thus find that cortical microstimulation engages existing cortical representations and that repeated co-presentation of natural and artificial stimulation enhances this effect.

                Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) share genetic etiology and are frequently co-morbid with epilepsy, but the biological basis of this shared risk remains poorly understood. The 16p11.2 microduplication (16p11.2dup/+) is a highly pleiotropic copy number variant (CNV) conferring risk for multiple NPDs including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and intellectual disability, and is associated with a high prevalence of seizures. We used a mouse model of the 16p11.2 duplication (16p11.2dup/+) to uncover molecular and circuit properties associated with this broad phenotypic spectrum, and examined genes within the locus capable of phenotype reversal. Quantitative proteomics of cortical membranes revealed alterations to synaptic protein networks and products of diverse NPD risk genes in 16p11.2dup/+ mice. Network analysis identified an epilepsy-associated protein subnetwork, which was dysregulated in 16p11.2dup/+ mice and proteomic datasets from human NPDs. We investigated circuit properties in 16p11.2dup/+ mice and found they exhibited hypersynchronous activity and enhanced network glutamate release, which increased susceptibility to seizures. We hypothesized that a regulator of the synaptic and epilepsy-associated protein network could have an important impact on pathophysiology. Human brain co-expression and interactome analysis revealed PRRT2 as a major hub in the dysregulated epilepsy subnetwork. Remarkably, restoring Prrt2 copy number to wild-type levels rescued aberrant circuit properties, seizure susceptibility and social interaction deficits in 16p11.2dup/+ mice. We show that proteomics and network biology can identify important disease hubs in multigenic CNVs, and reveal molecular and circuit phenotypes which may be relevant to the complex symptomatology of 16p11.2 duplication carriers.

                Post-learning sleep plays an important role in hippocampal memory processing, including contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation. Here, we used targeted recombination in activated populations (TRAP) to label context-encoding engram neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and assessed reactivation of these neurons during post-learning sleep. We find that post-learning sleep deprivation (SD), which impairs CFM consolidation, selectively disrupts reactivation in inferior blade DG engram neurons. This change was linked to more general suppression of neuronal activity markers in the inferior, but not superior, DG blade by SD. To further characterize how learning and subsequent sleep or SD affect these (and other) hippocampal subregions, we used subregion-specific spatial profiling of transcripts and proteins. We found that transcriptomic responses to sleep loss differed greatly between hippocampal regions CA1, CA3, and DG inferior blade, superior blade, and hilus. Critically, learning-driven transcriptomic changes, measured 6 h following contextual fear learning, were limited to the two DG blades, differed dramatically between the blades, and were absent from all other regions. Similarly, protein abundance in these hippocampal subregions were differentially impacted by sleep vs. SD and by prior learning, with the majority of alterations to protein expression restricted to DG. Together, these data suggest that the DG plays an essential role in the consolidation of hippocampal memories, and that the effects of sleep and sleep loss on the hippocampus are highly subregion-specific, even within the DG itself.

                Blind readers use a tactile reading systems consisting of raised dot arrays: braille. How does the human brain implement reading by touch? The current study looked for signatures of reading-specific orthographic processes in braille, separate from low-level somatosensory responses and semantic retrieval. Of specific interest were responses in posterior parietal cortices (PPC), because of their role in high-level tactile perception. Congenitally blind, proficient braille readers read real words and pseudowords by touch while undergoing fMRI. We leveraged the system of contractions in English braille, where one or more braille cells can represent combinations of English print letters (e.g., "ing" is represented with one braille cell, "one" with two), making it possible to separate physical and uncontracted letter-length. All words in the study consisted of 4 braille cells, but their corresponding Roman spellings varied from 4 to 7 letters (e.g., "concert" is represented with 4 cells: "con","c","er", and "t", so its contracted length is 4 cells, whereas the uncontracted length is 7 letters). We found that the bilateral supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in the PPC increased its activity as the uncontracted word length increased. By contrast, in the hand region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), activity increased as a function of a low-level somatosensory feature: dot-number per word. The PPC also showed greater response to pseudowords than real words and distinguished between real and pseudowords in multi-voxel-pattern analysis. Parieto-occipital, early visual and ventral occipito-temporal, as well as prefrontal cortices also showed sensitivity to the real-vs-pseudoword distinction. We conclude that PPC is involved in sublexical orthographic processing for braille, possibly due to braille's tactile modality.

                Sulcal width, defined as the physical distance between opposing sulcal banks, has shown promise as a biomarker. We present the first method to obtain a vertex-wise representation of this metric directly on the brain's cortical surface. The algorithm samples the surface at different depths and estimates the distances between the opposing sulcal banks. The method is validated against a simulated sulcus and compared to other sulcal width tools based on regions of interest, showing solid correlations between the proposed algorithm and two widely-used reference methods. A vertex-wise assessment of the sulcal width is carried out by evaluating the correlation between sulcal width and age in a sample of an aging population, revealing clusters in the central, cingulate, and temporal sulcus regions associating wider sulci for older participants. The results confirm that the algorithm is reliable for obtaining sulcal width maps, allowing for vertex-wise analyses, and providing aggregated measures similar to the existing methods. The present algorithm is publicly available via https://github.com/HGGM-LIM/SWiM.

                It is well known that both the movement of the hand itself and the mental representation of it lead to event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG recorded over the corresponding motor areas of the cerebral cortex. Similarly, in somatosensory cortical areas, ERD occurs upon tactile stimulation of the hand, but whether this effect is caused by mental representation of sensations from tactile stimulation remains poorly understood. In the present study, the effects on the EEG of imaginary vibrotactile sensations on the right hand were compared with the effects of real vibrotactile stimulation. Both actual vibrotactile stimulation and mental representation of it have been found to elicit contralateral ERD patterns, particularly prominent in the -band and most pronounced in the C3 region. The paper discusses tactile imagery as a part of the complex sensorimotor mental image and its prospects for using EEG patterns of imagery-induced tactile sensations as control signals in BCI circuits independently and when combined with ERD based on movement imagination to improve the efficiency of neurointerface technologies in rehabilitation medicine, in particular, to restore movements after a stroke and neurotrauma.

                Goal-directed navigation requires integrating information from a variety of internal and external spatial cues, representing them internally, planning, and executing motor actions sequentially. However, a comprehensive computational account of how these processes interact in an ambiguous, uncertain, and noisy environment giving rise to biases and variability observed in navigation behavior is currently unavailable. In this paper, we introduce an optimal control under uncertainty model, which provides a computational-level explanation of how landmarks and path integration interact and are combined to reduce variability in navigation. We apply our model to trajectory and end-point data from three previously published studies that employ a variant of the triangle completion task with landmarks. Contrary to observer models, which attribute human endpoint variability to perceptual cue combination processes only, this dynamic Bayesian actor model provides a unifying account of a wide range of phenomena found in this task by considering variability in perception, action, and internal representations jointly. Taken together, these findings have wide-ranging implications for the analysis and interpretation of human navigation behavior, including resolution of seemingly contradictory results on cue integration in navigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on working memory and attention: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial</a></h4>

              
                {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in the central nervous system. Studies on both animals and humans show it has the pharmacological potential for reducing the impact of cognitive disorders, as well as enhancing cognitive functions and mood. However, its specific effects on human attention and working memory have not yet been extensively studied. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover trial, we tested whether the administration of 800 mg GABA, dissolved in a drink, acutely affected visual working memory maintenance, as well as temporal and spatial attention in healthy adults. The participants were 32 young adults (16 females and 16 males). Working memory recall precision, spatial attention and temporal attention were measured by a delayed match-to-sample task, a visual search task, and a speeded rapid serial visual presentation task, respectively. Participants completed two experimental sessions (GABA and Placebo) in randomized and counterbalanced order. In each session, forty-five minutes after administration of the drink, they completed the aforementioned cognitive tasks. Linear mixed model analysis results showed that GABA increased visual search time, compared to the placebo, but did not affect visual search accuracy, temporal attention, nor visual working memory precision. The results suggest that GABA increases visual search time but does not affect temporal attention and memory, and that previously reported effects on cognition might rely on other functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recurrent predictive coding models for associative memory employing covariance learning</a></h4>

              
                The computational principles adopted by the hippocampus in associative memory (AM) tasks have been one of the mostly studied topics in computational and theoretical neuroscience. Classical models of the hippocampal network assume that AM is performed via a form of covariance learning, where associations between memorized items are represented by entries in the learned covariance matrix encoded in the recurrent connections in the hippocampal subfield CA3. On the other hand, it has been recently proposed that AM in the hippocampus is achieved through predictive coding. Hierarchical predictive coding models following this theory perform AM, but fail to capture the recurrent hippocampal structure that encodes the covariance in the classical models. Such a dichotomy pose potential difficulties for developing a unitary theory of how memory is formed and recalled in the hippocampus. Earlier predictive coding models that learn the covariance information of inputs explicitly seem to be a solution to this dichotomy. Here, we show that although these models can perform AM, they do it in an implausible and numerically unstable way. Instead, we propose alternatives to these earlier covariance-learning predictive coding networks, which learn the covariance information implicitly and plausibly, and can use dendritic structures to encode prediction errors. We show analytically that our proposed models are perfectly equivalent to the earlier predictive coding model learning covariance explicitly, and encounter no numerical issues when performing AM tasks in practice. We further show that our models can be combined with hierarchical predictive coding networks to model the hippocampo-neocortical interactions. Our models provide a biologically plausible approach to modelling the hippocampal network, pointing to a potential computational mechanism employed by the hippocampus during memory formation and recall, which unifies predictive coding and covariance learning based on the recurrent network structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Demographic Reporting and Phenotypic Exclusion in fNIRS</a></h4>

              
                Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) promises to be a leading non-invasive neuroimaging method due to its portability and low cost. However, concerns are rising over its inclusivity of all skin tones and hair types (Parker and Ricard 2022, Webb et al 2022). Functional NIRS relies on direct contact of light-emitting optodes to the scalp, which can be blocked more by longer, darker, and especially curlier hair. Additionally, NIR light can be attenuated by melanin, which is accounted for in neither fNIRS hardware nor analysis methods. Recent work has shown that overlooking these considerations in other modalities like EEG leads to the disproportionate exclusion of individuals with these phenotypes - especially Black people - in both clinical and research literature (Bradford et al 2022, Choy 2020). In this article, we sought to determine if (1) biomedical optics developers and researchers report fNIRS performance variability between skin tones and hair textures, (2a) fNIRS neuroscience practitioners report phenotypic and demographic details in their articles, and thus, (2b) is a similar pattern of participant exclusion found in EEG also present in the fNIRS literature. We present a literature review of top Biomedical Optics and Human Neuroscience journals, showing that demographic and phenotypic reporting is unpopular in both fNIRS development and neuroscience applications. We conclude with a list of recommendations to the fNIRS community including examples of Black researchers addressing these issues head-on, inclusive best practices for fNIRS researchers, and recommendations to funding and regulatory bodies to achieve an inclusive neuroscience enterprise in fNIRS and beyond.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automatic brain categorization of discrete auditory emotion expressions</a></h4>

              
                Seamlessly extracting emotional information from voices is crucial for efficient interpersonal communication. However, it remains unclear how the brain categorizes vocal expressions of emotion beyond the processing of their acoustic features. In our study, we developed a new approach combining electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) in humans with an oddball frequency tagging paradigm to automatically tag neural responses to specific emotion expressions. Participants were presented with a periodic stream of heterogeneous non-verbal emotional vocalizations belonging to five emotion categories (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness) at 2.5 Hz. Importantly, unbeknown to the participant, a specific emotion category appeared at an oddball presentation rate at 0.83 Hz that would elicit an additional response in the EEG spectrum only if the brain discriminates the target emotion category from other emotion categories and generalizes across heterogeneous exemplars of the target emotion category. Stimuli were matched across emotion categories for harmonicity-to-noise ratio, spectral center of gravity, pitch, envelope, and early auditory peripheral processing via the simulated output of the cochlea. Additionally, participants were presented with a scrambled version of the stimuli with identical spectral content and periodicity but disrupted intelligibility. We observed that in addition to the responses at the general presentation frequency (2.5 Hz) in both intact and scrambled sequences, a peak in the EEG spectrum at the oddball emotion presentation rate (0.83 Hz) and its harmonics emerged in the intact sequence only. The absence of response at the oddball frequency in the scrambled sequence in conjunction to our stimuli matching procedure suggests that the categorical brain response elicited by a specific emotion is at least partially independent from low-level acoustic features of the sounds. Further, different topographies were observed when fearful or happy sounds were presented as an oddball that supports the idea of different representations of distinct discrete emotions in the brain. Our paradigm revealed the ability of the brain to automatically categorize non-verbal vocal emotion expressions objectively (behavior-free), rapidly (in few minutes of recording time) and robustly (high signal-to-noise ratio), making it a useful tool to study vocal emotion processing and auditory categorization in general in populations where brain recordings are more challenging.

                Over the past decade, stereotactically placed electrodes have become the gold standard for deep brain recording and stimulation for a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Current electrodes, however, are limited in their spatial resolution and ability to record from small populations of neurons, let alone individual neurons. Here, we report on a novel, reconfigurable, monolithically integrated human-grade flexible depth electrode capable of recording from up to 128 channels and able to record at a depth of 10 cm in brain tissue. This thin, stylet-guided depth electrode is capable of recording local field potentials and single unit neuronal activity (action potentials), validated across species. This device represents a major new advance in manufacturing and design approaches which extends the capabilities of a mainstay technology in clinical neurology.

                The growing population of older adults emphasizes the need to develop interventions that prevent or delay some of the cognitive decline that accompanies aging. In particular, as memory impairment is the foremost cognitive deficit affecting older adults, it is vital to develop interventions that improve memory function. This study addressed the problem of false memories in aging by training older adults to use details of past events during memory retrieval to distinguish targets from related lures. We examined the neural basis of a retrieval-based monitoring strategy by assessing changes in univariate BOLD activity and discriminability of targets and lures pre and post training. Results showed training-related decreases in false memory rates with no alterations to hit rates. Training and practice were associated with altered recruitment of a frontoparietal monitoring network as well as benefits to neural discriminability within network regions. Participants with lower baseline neural discriminability between target and lure items exhibited the largest changes in neural discriminability. Collectively, our results highlight the benefits of training for reductions of false memories in aging. They also provide an understanding of the neural mechanisms that support these reductions.

                Subsensory noise stimulation targeting sensory receptors has been shown to improve balance control in healthy and impaired individuals. However, the potential for application of this technique in other contexts is still unknown. Gait control and adaptation rely heavily on the input from proprioceptive organs in the muscles and joints. Here we investigated the use of subsensory noise stimulation as a means to influence motor control by boosting proprioception during locomotor adaptations to forces delivered by a robot. The forces increase step length unilaterally and trigger an adaptive response that restores the original symmetry. Healthy participants performed two adaptation experiments, one with stimulation applied to the hamstring muscles and one without. We found that participants adapted faster but to a lesser extent when undergoing subsensory stimulation. We argue that this behaviour is due to the dual effect that the stimulation has on the afferents encoding position and velocity that are present in the muscle spindles.

                Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and play key roles in brain homeostasis. During anesthesia, microglia increase their dynamic process surveillance and interact more closely with neurons. However, the functional significance of microglial process dynamics and neuronal interaction has remained unclear. Using in vivo two-photon imaging in awake mice, we discover that microglia enhance neuronal activity after the cessation of general anesthesia. Hyperactive neuron somata are directly contacted by microglial processes, which specifically co-localize with GABAergic boutons. Electron microscopy-based synaptic reconstruction after two-photon imaging reveals that microglial processes enter into the synaptic cleft to shield GABAergic inputs. Microglial ablation or loss of microglial {beta}2- adrenergic receptors prevent post-anesthesia neuronal hyperactivity. Together, our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated function of microglial process dynamics, which allow microglia to transiently boost neuronal activity by physically shielding inhibitory inputs.

                Determining and decoding emotional brain processes under ecologically valid conditions remains a key challenge in affective neuroscience. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based emotion decoding studies are mainly based on brief and isolated episodes of emotion induction, while sustained emotional experience in naturalistic environments that mirror daily life experiences are scarce. Here we use 10-minute movie clips as ecologically valid emotion-evoking procedures in n=52 individuals to explore emotion-specific fMRI functional connectivity (FC) profiles on the whole-brain level at high spatial resolution (400 atlas based parcels). Employing machine-learning based decoding and cross validation procedures allowed to develop predictive FC profiles that can accurately distinguish sustained happiness and sadness and that generalize across movies and subjects. Both functional brain network-based and subnetwork-based emotion prediction results suggest that emotion manifests as distributed representation of multiple networks, rather than a single functional network or subnetwork. Further, the results show that the Visual Network (VN) and Default Mode Network (DMN) associated functional networks, especially VN-DMN, exhibit a strong contribution to emotion prediction. To further estimate the cumulative effect of naturalistic long-term movie-based video-evoking emotions, we divide the 10-min episode into three stages: early stimulation (1 ~ 200 s), middle stimulation (201 ~ 400 s), and late stimulation (401 ~ 600 s) and examine the emotion prediction performance at different stimulation stages. We found that the late stimulation has a stronger predictive ability (accuracy=85.32%, F1-score=85.62%) compared to early and middle stimulation stages, implying that continuous exposure to emotional stimulation can lead to more intense emotions and further enhance emotion-specific distinguishable representations. The present work demonstrates that sustained sadness and happiness under naturalistic conditions are presented in emotion-specific network profiles and these expressions may play different roles in the generation and modulation of emotions. These findings elucidate the importance of network level adaptations for sustained emotional experiences during naturalistic contexts and open new venues for imaging network level contributions under naturalistic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Environmental luminance impairs socio-sexual recognition memory through a succinct retina to supraoptic nucleus circuit</a></h4>

              
                Social memory between the same gender or even different gender is a complex and heavily modulated process in the nervous system. It is important for an individual to form social memory between the opposite sex to either increase mating opportunities with multiple partners or form monogamous pair bonding. Therefore, a specific neuronal circuit to regulate social sexual memory may enhance the mating opportunity for an individual. It has been shown that both the auditory and somatosensory systems could increase the activity of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus to regulate social behaviors. Although light exposure could influence various forms of memory, such as fear and object memory, how luminance signals modulate social recognition memory remains unclear. Here, we show that acute light exposure could impair the socio-sexual recognition memory (SSRM) in male mice. Contrary to sound and touch, light stimulation could inhibit oxytocin neurons in the SON (SONOT) through M1 SON-projecting ipRGCs and GABAergic neurons in the peri-SON (pSONGABA). Optogenetic activation of SONOT neurons with channelrhodopsin is sufficient to enhance the SSRM performance in male mice, even under light conditions. Our results show that the visual system could modulate SSRM through a succinct ipRGCs-pSONGABA-SONOT neuronal circuitry. Together, we demonstrate a dedicated neuronal circuit of how luminance affects memory formation for an individual toward different sex through the oxytocin system, a powerful modulatory neurohormone in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High sensitivity intrinsic optical signal imaging through flexible, low-cost adaptations of an upright microscope</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic optical signal imaging (IOSI) is a staple technique in modern neuroscience. Pioneered over thirty years ago, IOSI allows macroscopic mapping of neuronal activity throughout the cortex. The technique has been used to study sensory processing and experience-dependent plasticity, and is often used as an adjunctive procedure to localize cortical areas for subsequent targeting by other imaging or physiology techniques. Despite the ubiquity of IOSI in neuroscience there are few commercially available IOSI systems. As a result, investigators have typically resorted to building their own imaging systems. Over the years, simplified systems built on existing microscope platforms have been proposed. Still, these often require additional, sometimes costly, custom-built hardware, which presents challenges for investigators without significant experience in optics or microscopy design. Here we present a straightforward set of adaptations that can be applied to any standard upright microscope, using readily available, inexpensive, commercial parts for illumination, optics, and signal detection, that enables high sensitivity IOSI. Using these adaptations, we are able to readily map sensory-evoked signals across the somatosensory and visual cortex, including single-whisker barrel cortical activity maps in mice. We show that these IOSI maps are highly reproducible across animals and can be used to study plasticity mechanisms in the somatosensory cortex. We also provide open-source applications to control illumination and analyze raw data to generate activity maps. We anticipate these resources will be particularly useful for neuroscience investigators from broad technical backgrounds looking to add IOSI capabilities to an existing microscope on a budget.

                Human cortical interneurons have been challenging to study due to high diversity and lack of mature brain tissue platforms and genetic targeting tools. We employed rapid GABAergic neuron viral labeling plus unbiased Patch-seq sampling in brain slices to define the signature morpho-electric properties of GABAergic neurons in the human neocortex. Viral targeting greatly facilitated sampling of the SST subclass, including primate specialized double bouquet cells which mapped to two SST transcriptomic types. Multimodal analysis uncovered an SST neuron type with properties inconsistent with original subclass assignment; we instead propose reclassification into PVALB subclass. Our findings provide novel insights about functional properties of human cortical GABAergic neuron subclasses and types and highlight the essential role of multimodal annotation for refinement of emerging transcriptomic cell type taxonomies.

                Astrocytes are the most populous cell type of the human central nervous system and are essential for physiological brain function. Increasing evidence suggests multiple roles for astrocytes in Parkinson's disease (PD), nudging a shift in the research focus, which historically pivoted around the ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons (vmDANs). Studying human astrocytes and other cell types in vivo remains technically and ethically challenging. However, in vitro reprogrammed human stem cell-based models provide a promising alternative. Here, we describe a novel protocol for astrocyte differentiation from human stem cell-derived vmDANs-generating progenitors. This protocol simulates the regionalization, gliogenic switch, radial migration, and final differentiation that occur in the developing human brain. We have characterized the morphological, molecular, and functional features of these ventral midbrain astrocytes with a broad palette of techniques. In addition, we have developed a new pipeline for calcium imaging data analysis called deCLUTTER2+ (deconvolution of Ca2+ fluorescent patterns) that can be used to discover spontaneous or cue-dependent patterns of Ca2+ transients. Altogether, our protocol enables the characterization of the functional properties of human ventral midbrain astrocytes under physiological conditions and in PD.

                In neurodegenerative proteinopathies, intracellular inclusions are histopathologically and ultrastructurally heterogeneous but the significance of this heterogeneity is unclear. Patient- derived iPSC models, while promising for disease modeling, do not form analogous inclusions in a reasonable timeframe and suffer from limited tractability and scalability. Here, we developed an iPSC toolbox that utilizes piggyBac-based or targeted transgenes to rapidly induce CNS cells with concomitant expression of misfolding-prone proteins. The system is scalable and amenable to screening and longitudinal tracking at single-cell and single-inclusion resolution. For proof-of- principle, cortical neuron alpha-synuclein inclusionopathy models were engineered to form inclusions spontaneously or through exogenous seeding by alpha-synuclein fibrils. These models recapitulated known fibril- and lipid-rich inclusion subtypes in human brain, shedding light on their formation and consequences. Genetic-modifier and protein-interaction screens identified sequestered proteins in these inclusions, including RhoA, that were deleterious to cells when lost. This new iPSC platform should facilitate biological and drug discovery for neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Freedom from habits: the capacity for autonomous behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The capacity for autonomous behaviour is key to human intelligence, and fundamental to modern social life. However, experimental investigations of the cognitive bases of human autonomy are challenging, because experimental paradigms typically constrain behaviour using controlled contexts, and elicit behaviour by external triggers. In contrast, the sources of human autonomy and freedom are assumed to be endogenous. Here we propose a new theoretical construct of adaptive autonomy, meaning the capacity to make behavioural choices that are free from constraints of both immediate triggers and habitual responding. Participants played a competitive game in which they had to choose the right time to act, in the face of an opponent who punished (in separate blocks) either choice biases, habitual sequences of action timing across trials, or habitual responses to the effects of reinforcement. Adaptive autonomy with respect to each habit was measured by the ability to maintain performance against the opponent even when the corresponding habit was punished. We found that participants were able, under pressure from their opponent, to become free from habitual choices of when to act, but were not able to free themselves from win-stay, lose-shift patterns of reinforcement, even when these resulted in punishment. These results propose a new testing ground of autonomous behaviour as a flexible adaptation of more or less habitual behaviours that co-exist with different classes of external constraint.

                Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) has been proved to promote functional rehabilitation of brain lesions including ischemic stroke. However, the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation is limited by the low survival and differentiation rates of NSCs due to the harsh environment in the brain after ischemic stroke. Here, we employed NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) together with exosomes extracted from NSCs to treat cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in mice. The results showed that NSC-derived exosomes significantly reduced the inflammatory response, alleviated oxidative stress after NSC transplantation, and facilitated NSCs differentiation in vivo. The combination of NSCs with exosomes ameliorated the injury of brain tissue including cerebral infarct, neuronal death and glial scarring, and promoted the motor function recovery. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of NSC-derived exosomes and the potential downstream genes. Our study provided the rationale for the clinical application of NSC-derived exosomes as a supportive adjuvant for NSC transplantation after stroke.

                Mapping functional connectivity between neurons is an essential step towards probing the neural computations mediating behavior. The ability to consistently and robustly determine synaptic connectivity maps in large populations of interconnected neurons is a significant challenge in terms of yield, accuracy and experimental time. Here we developed a compressive sensing approach to reconstruct synaptic connectivity maps based on random two photon (2p) cell-targeted optogenetic stimulation and membrane voltage readout of many putative postsynaptic neurons. Using a biophysical network model of interconnected populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we found that the mapping can be achieved with far fewer measurements than the standard pairwise sequential approach. We characterized the recall and precision probabilities as a function of network observability, sparsity, number of neurons stimulated per trial, off-target stimulation, synaptic reliability, propagation latency and network topology. We found that that network sparsity and synaptic reliability were primary determinants of the performance. In particular, in a network with 10% probability of neuronal connectivity, functional connections were recovered with >85% recall and >80% precision in half the trials that would be required for single cell stimulation. Our results suggest a rapid and efficient method to reconstruct functional connectivity of brain networks where sparsity is predominantly present.

                Olfaction is the primary sensory modality by which most vertebrate species interpret environmental cues for appropriate behavioral outputs. The olfactory system is subdivided into main (MOS) and accessory (AOS) components which process volatile and non-volatile cues. While much is known regarding the molecular diversity of neurons that comprise the MOS, less is known about the AOS. Here, focusing on the AOS which is largely comprised of the peripheral vomeronasal organ (VNO), the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and the medial subnucleus of the amygdala (MeA), we studied the molecular diversity and neuronal subtype connectivity of this interconnected circuit. We show that populations of neurons of the AOS can be molecularly subdivided based on their current or prior expression of the transcription factors Foxp2 or Dbx1. We show that the majority of AOB neurons that project directly to the MeA are of the Foxp2-lineage. Using single cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we further reveal that in addition to sex-specific differences across lineage, the relative contributions of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to MeA Foxp2-lineage neurons differ between sexes. Together, this work uncovers a novel molecular diversity of AOS neurons and lineage- and sex-differences in patterns of connectivity.

                Mitochondria are the main suppliers of energy for cells and their bioenergetic function is regulated by mitochondrial dynamics: the constant changes in mitochondria size, shape, and cristae morphology to secure cell homeostasis. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a wide range of diseases, our understanding of mitochondrial function remains limited by the complexity of inferring these spatial features from 2D electron microscopical (EM) images of intact tissue. Here, we present a semi-automatic method for segmentation and 3D reconstruction of mitochondria, cristae, and intracristal spaces based on 2D EM images of the murine hippocampus. We show that our method provides a more accurate characterization of mitochondrial ultrastructure in 3D than common 2D approaches and propose an operational index of mitochondria's internal organization. We speculate that this tool may help increase our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics in health and disease.

                Private, subjective beliefs about uncertainty have been found to have idiosyncratic computational and neural substrates yet, humans share such beliefs seamlessly and cooperate successfully. Bringing together decision making under uncertainty and interpersonal alignment in communication, in a discovery plus pre-registered replication design, we examined the neuro-computational basis of the relationship between privately-held and socially-shared uncertainty. Examining confidence-speed-accuracy trade-off in uncertainty-ridden perceptual decisions under social vs isolated context, we found that shared (i.e., reported confidence) and subjective (inferred from pupillometry) uncertainty dynamically followed social information. An attractor neural network model incorporating social information as top-down additive input captured the observed behaviour and spontaneously demonstrated the emergence of social alignment in virtual dyadic simulations. Electroencephalography showed that social exchange of confidence modulated the neural signature of perceptual evidence accumulation in the central parietal cortex and produced a sustained top-down flow of information from prefrontal to parietal cortex. Our findings offer a neural population model for interpersonal alignment of shared beliefs.

	<p>Schizophrenia is the subject of many studies. There have been reports of taste disturbances in mental disorders. We found a possible relationship between deficit symptoms of schizophrenia and the dysgeusia of monosodium glutamate (MSG). Dysgeusia is a disorder that distorts the sense of taste. People describe all foods as tasting sweet, sour, bitter, or metallic. We aimed to verify whether the level of MSG taste perception may be related to the severity of deficit symptoms. MSG detection threshold was assessed via sublingual administration of three fluid samples containing MSG or water. The MSG samples had different concentrations in each sample. The task was to indicate which of the samples contained MSG, determine the intensity of the taste, and assess the taste as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. The study group included 200 patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10. We found a significant negative correlation between mean intensity of taste and the number of deficit symptoms. The symptoms of taste disturbances reported by the patient should be monitored by clinicians and differentiated between the actual deficits in the field of taste perception and the taste hallucinations as a symptom of psychosis. It is important to continue research in this area.</p>

	<p>Background: The characteristics associated with having family members going out for work among persons with schizophrenia in rural China are unknown. This study aimed to explore the characteristics of families with members going out for work and the risk factors among persons with schizophrenia in a rural area of China. Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional dataset from a mental health survey, using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), conducted among 152,776 people aged 15 years and older in Xinjin District, Chengdu, China, in 2015. Results: A total of 598 persons with schizophrenia were included in this study, and 20.4% (n = 122) of them had at least one family member who went out for work. Compared with those without family going out for work, participants with family going out for work had significantly larger numbers of family members, higher monthly incomes and lower percentages of social low-income insurance. Participants with family going out for work were more likely to be females, married and with higher levels of subjective and instrumental support. The statuses of families with members going out for work were significantly associated with larger numbers of family members and higher levels of instrumental support. Conclusions: Our findings indicate specific characteristics of families with members going out for work and factors associated with having family going out for work among persons with schizophrenia (number of family members and instrumental support). Culture-specific mental health policies and community-based services should be developed for persons with schizophrenia who have family going out for work in rural China.</p>
