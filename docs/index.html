              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10421">Deciphering SCN2A: A comprehensive review of rodent models of Scn2a dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SCN2A encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, which is involved in action potential initiation and backpropagation in glutamatergic neurons. Mutations in the gene lead to SCN2A-related disorders, which are highly heterogeneous and manifest in a variety of diagnoses, such as self-limited familial and non-familial infantile epilepsy (SeLFNIE, previously benign familial infantile seizures or BFNIS), epileptic encephalopathies (EE), infantile spasms, ataxia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), and schizophrenia. Researchers have attempted to elucidate the complexity of the SCN2A gene and Nav1.2 channel function through the use and development of non-human mammalian models. These models have been invaluable to uncovering the molecular underpinnings of why changes in SCN2A lead to such a heterogenous group of disorders. This review aims to evaluate and compare the published rodent models to consolidate findings, identify limitations, and highlight future research directions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09789">Can EEG resting state data benefit data-driven approaches for motor-imagery decoding?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.09789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resting-state EEG data in neuroscience research serve as reliable markers for user identification and reveal individual-specific traits. Despite this, the use of resting-state data in EEG classification models is limited. In this work, we propose a feature concatenation approach to enhance decoding models' generalization by integrating resting-state EEG, aiming to improve motor imagery BCI performance and develop a user-generalized model. Using feature concatenation, we combine the EEGNet model, a standard convolutional neural network for EEG signal classification, with functional connectivity measures derived from resting-state EEG data. The findings suggest that although grounded in neuroscience with data-driven learning, the concatenation approach has limited benefits for generalizing models in within-user and across-user scenarios. While an improvement in mean accuracy for within-user scenarios is observed on two datasets, concatenation doesn't benefit across-user scenarios when compared with random data concatenation. The findings indicate the necessity of further investigation on the model interpretability and the effect of random data concatenation on model robustness.

                arXiv:2407.19737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models of brain activity have been instrumental in testing hypothesized mechanisms underlying brain dynamics against experimental datasets. Beyond capturing the key mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain dynamics, these models hold an exciting potential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the dynamics evoked by targeted brain-stimulation techniques. This paper delves into this emerging application, using concepts from dynamical systems theory to argue that the stimulus-evoked dynamics in such experiments may be shaped by new types of mechanisms distinct from those that dominate spontaneous dynamics. We review and discuss: (i) the targeted experimental techniques across spatial scales that can both perturb the brain to novel states and resolve its relaxation trajectory back to spontaneous dynamics; and (ii) how we can understand these dynamics in terms of mechanisms using physiological, phenomenological, and data-driven models. A tight integration of targeted stimulation experiments with generative quantitative modeling provides an important opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of brain dynamics that are difficult to detect in spontaneous settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10047">Nonlinear Neural Dynamics and Classification Accuracy in Reservoir Computing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.10047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing - information processing based on untrained recurrent neural networks with random connections - is expected to depend on the nonlinear properties of the neurons and the resulting oscillatory, chaotic, or fixpoint dynamics of the network. However, the required degree of nonlinearity and the range of suitable dynamical regimes for a given task are not fully understood. To clarify these questions, we study the accuracy of a reservoir computer in artificial classification tasks of varying complexity, while tuning the neuron's degree of nonlinearity and the reservoir's dynamical regime. We find that, even for activation functions with extremely reduced nonlinearity, weak recurrent interactions and small input signals, the reservoir is able to compute useful representations, detectable only in higher order principal components, that render complex classificiation tasks linearly separable for the readout layer. When increasing the recurrent coupling, the reservoir develops spontaneous dynamical behavior. Nevertheless, the input-related computations can 'ride on top' of oscillatory or fixpoint attractors without much loss of accuracy, whereas chaotic dynamics reduces task performance more drastically. By tuning the system through the full range of dynamical phases, we find that the accuracy peaks both at the oscillatory/chaotic and at the chaotic/fixpoint phase boundaries, thus supporting the 'edge of chaos' hypothesis. Our results, in particular the robust weakly nonlinear operating regime, may offer new perspectives both for technical and biological neural networks with random connectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10017">Difficulties of the NSGA-II with the Many-Objective LeadingOnes Problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NSGA-II is the most prominent multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (cited more than 50,000 times). Very recently, a mathematical runtime analysis has proven that this algorithm can have enormous difficulties when the number of objectives is larger than two (Zheng, Doerr. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation (2024)). However, this result was shown only for the OneMinMax benchmark problem, which has the particularity that all solutions are on the Pareto front, a fact heavily exploited in the proof of this result.
  In this work, we show a comparable result for the LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes benchmark. This popular benchmark problem appears more natural in that most of its solutions are not on the Pareto front. With a careful analysis of the population dynamics of the NGSA-II optimizing this benchmark, we manage to show that when the population grows on the Pareto front, then it does so much faster by creating known Pareto optima than by spreading out on the Pareto front. Consequently, already when still a constant fraction of the Pareto front is unexplored, the crowding distance becomes the crucial selection mechanism, and thus the same problems arise as in the optimization of OneMinMax. With these and some further arguments, we show that the NSGA-II, with a population size by at most a constant factor larger than the Pareto front, cannot compute the Pareto front in less than exponential time.

                arXiv:2411.09779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levels of selection and multilevel evolutionary processes are essential concepts in evolutionary theory, and yet there is a lack of common mathematical models for these core ideas. Here, we propose a unified mathematical framework for formulating and optimizing multilevel evolutionary processes and genetic algorithms over arbitrarily many levels based on concepts from category theory and population genetics. We formulate a multilevel version of the Wright-Fisher process using this approach, and we show that this model can be analyzed to clarify key features of multilevel selection. Particularly, we derive an extended multilevel probabilistic version of Price's Equation via the Kantorovich Monad, and we use this to characterize regimes of parameter space within which selection acts antagonistically or cooperatively across levels. Finally, we show how our framework can provide a unified setting for learning genetic algorithms (GAs), and we show how we can use a Variational Optimization and a multi-level analogue of coalescent analysis to fit multilevel GAs to simulated data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09933">JRadiEvo: A Japanese Radiology Report Generation Model Enhanced by Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational models (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most crucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort required for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent efforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through techniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical foundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field. Moreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their practicality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and patients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces additional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{J}apanese \textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by \textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the first attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the medical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We successfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from X-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data. This model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed leading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets. Additionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact foundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a practical solution for environments where APIs and other external services cannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.

                arXiv:2404.10296v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software development, shifting from task-specific codes (Software 1.0) to neural network-based approaches (Software 2.0). However, applying this transition in engineering software presents challenges, including low surrogate model accuracy, the curse of dimensionality in inverse design, and rising complexity in physical simulations. We introduce an interpolating neural network (INN), grounded in interpolation theory and tensor decomposition, to realize Engineering Software 2.0 by advancing data training, partial differential equation solving, and parameter calibration. INN offers orders of magnitude fewer trainable/solvable parameters for comparable model accuracy than traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). Demonstrated in metal additive manufacturing, INN rapidly constructs an accurate surrogate model of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) heat transfer simulation, achieving sub-10-micrometer resolution for a 10 mm path in under 15 minutes on a single GPU. This makes a transformative step forward across all domains essential to engineering software.

                arXiv:2407.11626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To effectively search for the optimal motion template in dynamic multidimensional space, this paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, Dynamic Dimension Wrapping (DDW).The algorithm combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Euclidean distance, and designs a fitness function that adapts to dynamic multidimensional space by establishing a time-data chain mapping across dimensions. This paper also proposes a novel update mechanism,Optimal Dimension Collection (ODC), combined with the search strategy of traditional optimization algorithms, enables DDW to adjust both the dimension values and the number of dimensions of the population individuals simultaneously. In this way, DDW significantly reduces computational complexity and improves search accuracy. Experimental results show that DDW performs excellently in dynamic multidimensional space, outperforming 31 traditional optimization algorithms. This algorithm provides a novel approach to solving dynamic multidimensional optimization problems and demonstrates broad application potential in fields such as motion data analysis.

	<p>Background: The aim of the present study was to analyse the association between neuroticism (one of the Big Five personality traits) and the most common secondary sensorimotor complications occurring in patients after spinal cord injury (SCI), i.e., muscle spasticity (hypertonia) and pain, and to investigate the associations between neuroticism and the effects of conventional rehabilitation (dynamic parapodium) and those using robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) in this group of patients. In addition, the association of neuroticism with self-efficacy, personal beliefs about pain control, and adopted coping strategies among SCI patients was analysed. These data can be used as a reference for designing effective forms of therapy and support dedicated to this group of patients. Methods and procedures: Quantitative analysis included 110 patients after SCI. The participants were divided by simple randomisation into a rehabilitation group with RAGT and a rehabilitation group with dynamic parapodium therapy (DPT). The following survey instruments were used for data collection: Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R); Ashworth Scale; the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM III); the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI-II); the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS); the Pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire&amp;amp;mdash;CSQ; and the Beliefs about Pain Control Questionnaire&amp;amp;mdash;BPCQ. Outcomes and results: analyses showed a positive association between neuroticism and spastic tension (rho = 0.39; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions and implications: the study showed that a high level of neuroticism correlates with a higher level of spasticity, but no such correlation was observed for pain. Additionally, the study did not show a significant correlation between neuroticism and rehabilitation outcome depending on the rehabilitation modality (RAGT vs. DPT). The results underline the importance of carrying out a psychological diagnosis of patients to provide therapeutic support in the rehabilitation process.</p>

">Glutamate receptor-dependent cytosolic acidification in hippocampal neurons involves passive flux of protons from the extracellular space</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate receptor-dependent cytosolic acidification can be induced in hippocampal neurons by pharmacological or seizure-like stimulation. This acidification is thought to arise from Ca2+ and metabolism-related processes, however, the exact underlying mechanism as well as its functional role remains uncertain. To reassess the mechanism of cytosolic acidification in excitatory hippocampal neurons and address the physiological relevance of the phenomenon, we combined pH/Ca2+ biosensors to study activity-induced pH dynamics in hippocampal neurons. First, we addressed cytosolic acidification in relation to LTP at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. Using hippocampal slices from adult rats of both sexes, we show that LTP-inducing stimulation at the Schaffer collaterals evokes transient cytosolic acidification in hippocampal CA1 neurons. This highlights neuronal pH shifts as a trait of general hippocampal neurotransmission rather than a marker of excitotoxicity, possibly serving as a secondary messenger. Moreover, using dissociated hippocampal neurons from rat embryos, we show that glutamate receptor agonists typically induce larger cytosolic acid shifts compared to simple depolarization or spontaneous activity, suggesting that glutamate receptor-mediated acidification involves several separate mechanisms; pyruvate-dependent dampening of neuronal acidification may reflect a direct inhibition of NMDA receptors rather than reduced glycolytic activity, questioning the previously reported involvement of metabolism in cytosolic acidification; and whereas acid shifts induced by simple depolarization show exclusive dependence on cytosolic Ca2+, AMPA-induced acidification depends both on cytosolic Ca2+ and on an inward electrochemical driving force for protons. These results suggest that glutamate receptor-induced cytosolic acidification relies both on cytosolic Ca2+ and on a passive proton influx, possibly mediated by the receptor itself.

">Biophysical network modeling of temporal and stereotyped sequence propagation of neural activity in the premotor nucleus HVC</a></h4>

              
                Stereotyped neural sequences are often exhibited in the brain, yet the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Birdsong is a prominent model to study such behavior particularly because juvenile songbirds progressively learn from their tutors and by adulthood are able to sing stereotyped song patterns. The songbird premotor nucleus HVC coordinate motor and auditory activity responsible for learned vocalizations. The HVC comprises three neural populations that has distinct in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological responses. Typically, models that explain HVCs network either rely on intrinsic HVC circuitry to propagate sequential activity, rely on extrinsic feedback to advance the sequence or rely on both. Here, we developed a physiologically realistic neural network model incorporating the three classes of HVC neurons based on the ion channels and the synaptic currents that had been pharmacologically identified. Our model is based on a feedforward chain of microcircuits that encode for the different sub-syllabic segments (SSSs) and that interact with each other through structured feedback inhibition. The network reproduced the in vivo activity patterns of each class of HVC neurons, and unveiled key intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms that govern the sequential propagation of neural activity by highlighting important roles for the T-type Ca2+ current, Ca2+-dependent K+ current, A-type K+ current, hyperpolarization activated inward current, as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. The result is a biophysically realistic model that suggests an improved characterization of the HVC network responsible for song production in the songbird.

">Individual brain activity patterns during task are predicted by distinct resting-state networks that may reflect local neurobiological features</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how individual cortical features shape functional brain organization offers a promising framework for examining the principles of cognitive specialization in the human brain. This study explores the relationship between various cortical characteristics--i.e resting-state functional connectivity, structural connectivity, microstructure, morphology, and geometry--and the layout of task-specific functional activations. We employ linear models to predict the functional layout of the cortex at the individual level from each of these feature modalities. Our findings demonstrate that resting-state component loadings predict individual task activations, consistently across hemispheres and independent datasets. Whereas the first few components provide a common space for functional activations across tasks, predictive higher-order component loadings demonstrated task-specificity. Cortical microstructure/morphology was notably predictive of activation strength in the occipital cortex, highlighting its relevance for cortical functional specialization. By relating resting state components to a set of reference maps of cortical organization, we identify associations that suggest possible neurobiological underpinnings of specific cognitive functions. The remaining feature modalities were only predictive of group-level functional activations. These results advance our understanding of how distinct cortical features may contribute to functional specialization, guiding future inquiry into the organization of cognitive functions on the cortex.

">Regulation of Fentanyl Reward in Male and Female Mice by the Circadian Transcription Factor NPAS2</a></h4>

              
                Synthetic opioids like fentanyl are highly potent and prevalent in the illicit drug market, leading to tolerance, dependence, and opioid use disorder (OUD). Chronic opioid use disrupts sleep and circadian rhythms, which persist even during treatment and abstinence, increasing the risk of relapse. The bodys molecular clock, regulated by transcriptional and translational feedback loops, controls various physiological processes, including the expression of endogenous opioids and their receptors. The circadian transcription factor NPAS2, highly expressed in the nucleus accumbens, may have a crucial role in opioid-related behaviors. Our study found a role for NPAS2 in fentanyl reward behaviors in male and female mice. NPAS2 also had sex-specific effects on fentanyl seeking and craving behaviors. We also identified specific cell types and transcriptional targets in the nucleus accumbens by which NPAS2 may mediate the impact of fentanyl on the brain and opioid reward-related behaviors.

">Visual training induced occipital fast sleep spindle clustering in humans revealed by full-night HD-EEG recordings</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the impact of extensive visual procedural training on the temporal organisation of sleep spindles in healthy young adults. We selected 39 participants aged 16-20 and employed high-density electroencephalography to assess spindle characteristics during two full nights of sleep, with daytime practising in a contour integration task in between the two nights. We utilised linear mixed models to comprehensively analyse the effects of age and training on basic, clustering- and rhythmicity-related spindle parameters. Our findings indicate no significant age effects in this age-range, and no significant change between the two nights with respect to slow spindles. Fast spindles demonstrated a significant increase in density after training, and we observed significant changes in spindle clustering and rhythmicity parameters as well. Local spindle density, train density, and the ratio of clustered spindles have increased, and inter-train interval decreased by the second night. These results contribute to the growing literature on sleep-dependent memory consolidation by demonstrating that spindle reorganisation occurs not only in motor tasks but also in visual learning contexts. The absence of age-related differences further highlights the robustness of these mechanisms across developmental stages. Our study emphasises the importance of spindle dynamics in procedural learning and suggests promising possibilities for future research into the neurophysiological basis of memory consolidation. By revealing the relationship between training and sleep spindle characteristics, our findings provide valuable insights into how sleep supports learning and memory processes in young adults, potentially informing interventions aimed at enhancing memory performance through sleep-related strategies.

">Comparative fMRI reveals differences in the functional organization of the visual cortex for animacy perception in dogs and humans</a></h4>

              
                The animate-inanimate category distinction is one of the general organizing principles in the primate high-level visual cortex. Much less is known about the visual cortical representations of animacy in non-primate mammals with a different evolutionary trajectory of visual capacities. To compare the functional organization underlying animacy perception of a non-primate to a primate species, here we performed an fMRI study in dogs and humans, investigating how animacy structures neural responses in the visual cortex of the two species. Univariate analyses identified animate-sensitive bilateral occipital and temporal regions, non-overlapping with early visual areas, in both species. Multivariate tests confirmed the categorical representations of animate stimuli in these regions. Regions sensitive to different animate stimulus classes (dog, human, cat) overlapped less in dog than in human brains. Together, these findings reveal that the importance of animate-inanimate distinction is reflected in the organization of higher-level visual cortex, also beyond primates. But a key species difference, that neural representations for animate stimuli are less concentrated in dogs than in humans suggests that certain underlying organizing principles that support the visual perception of animacy in primates may not play a similarly important role in other mammals.

">Cerebellar white matter development is regulated by fractalkine-dependent microglia phagocytosis of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Complex neurodevelopmental disorders involve motor as well as cognitive dysfunction and these impairments are associated with both cerebral and cerebellar maturity. A network of connections between these two brain regions is proposed to underlie neurodevelopmental impairments. The cerebellar gray matter has a protracted developmental timeline compared to the cerebral cortex, however, making the association of these relay pathways unclear for neurodevelopmental disabilities. We show that a population of amoeboid microglia infiltrate the cerebellar white matter through the fourth ventricular zone during early postnatal development. This infiltration is synchronized with the emergence of amoeboid microglia in the ventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and appearance in cerebral white matter. Amoeboid microglia phagocytosed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the cerebellar white matter during a restricted early postnatal time window before transitioning to a ramified morphology. Modulating fractalkine receptor signaling, shown to be involved in microglial pruning of synapses, significantly reduced microglial engulfment of OPCs resulting in increased numbers of OLs and altered myelin formation. Variants in the fractalkine receptor are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia and autism where myelin perturbations have been documented. Overall, these data support that white matter refinement by amoeboid microglia is coordinated in both cerebral and cerebellar development with important implications for altered circuit function in neurodevelopmental disabilities.

">Neural correlates of unconscious and conscious visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Postdictive effects, where later events influence the perception of earlier ones, suggest that conscious perception is not a continuous stream but occurs at discrete moments, preceded by extended periods of unconscious processing. This is evident in the Sequential Metacontrast Paradigm (SQM), where a stream of lines and vernier offsets is unconsciously integrated over several hundred milliseconds before conscious perception emerges: regardless of whether one or multiple verniers are shown, only a single offset is perceived from the first to the last line. Postdictive phenomena offer a unique opportunity to study the neural correlates of unconscious and conscious stages of perception because unconscious and conscious processing are well separated in time. Using EEG recordings during the SQM, we identified two distinct stages of neural activity. Early occipital EEG activity patterns (~200 ms after the initial vernier presentation) capture unconscious processing, while later centro-parietal EEG patterns (~400-600 ms after the onset of the stimulus stream) are associated with conscious perception, aligning closely with behavioral reports. We propose that the transition between these distinct neural topographies reflects the discrete moments when conscious perception emerges.

">Upregulating ANKHD1 in PS19 mice reduces Tau phosphorylation and mitigates Tau-toxicity-induced cognitive deficits</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal accumulation of Tau protein in the brain disrupts normal cellular function and leads to neuronal death linked with many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. An attractive approach to mitigate Tau-induced neurodegeneration is to enhance the clearance of toxic Tau aggregates. We previously showed that upregulation of the fly gene mask protects against FUS- and Tau-induced photoreceptor degeneration in fly disease models. Here we have generated a transgenic mouse line carrying Cre-inducible ANKHD1, the mouse homolog of mask, to determine whether the protective role of mask is conserved from flies to mammals. Utilizing the TauP301S-PS19 mouse model for Tau-related dementia, we observed that ANKHD1 significantly reduced hyperphosphorylated human Tau in 6-month-old mice. Additionally, there was a notable trend towards reduced gliosis levels in these mice, suggesting a protective role of ANKHD1 against TauP301S-linked degeneration. Further analysis of 9-month-old mice revealed a similar trend of effects. Moreover, we found that ANKHD1 also suppresses the cognitive defect of 9-month-old PS19 female mice in novel object recognition (NOR) behavioral assay. Unlike previous therapeutic strategies that primarily focus on inhibiting Tau phosphorylation or directly clearing aggregates, this study highlights the novel role of ANKHD1 in promoting autophagy as a means to mitigate Tau pathology. This novel mechanism not only underscores ANKHD1's potential as a unique therapeutic target for tauopathies but also provides new insights into autophagy-based interventions for neurodegenerative diseases.

                Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) is a critical transcription factor for cellular proteostasis, but its role in sleep regulation remains unexplored. We demonstrate that nuclear HSF1 levels in the mouse brain fluctuate with sleep-wake cycles, increasing during extended wakefulness and decreasing during sleep. Using CUT&RUN and RNA-seq, we identified HSF1-regulated transcriptional changes involved in synaptic organization, expanding its known functions beyond traditional heat shock responses. Both systemic and brain-specific Hsf1 knockout mice exhibit altered sleep homeostasis, including increased delta power after sleep deprivation and upregulation of sleep-related genes. However, these knockouts struggle to maintain sleep due to disrupted synaptic organization. In Drosophila, knockout of HSF1's ortholog results in fragmented sleep patterns, suggesting a conserved role for HSF1 in sleep regulation across species. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying sleep regulation and offer potential therapeutic targets for sleep disturbances.

">Right posterior theta reflects human parahippocampal phase resetting by salient cues during goal-directed navigation</a></h4>

              
                Animal and computational work indicate that phase resetting of theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) by salient events (e.g., reward, landmarks) facilitates the encoding of goal-oriented information during navigation. Although well-studied in animals, this mechanism has not been empirically substantiated in humans. In the present article, we present data from two studies (Study 1: asynchronous EEG-MEG | Study 2: simultaneous EEG-fMRI) to investigate theta phase resetting and its relationship to PHG BOLD activation in healthy adults (aged 18-34 years old) navigating a virtual T-maze to find rewards. In the first experiment, both EEG and MEG data revealed a burst of theta power over right-posterior scalp locations following feedback onset (termed right-posterior theta, RPT), and RPT power and measures of phase resetting were sensitive to the subject's spatial trajectory. In Experiment 2, we used probabilistic tractography data from the human connectome project to segment the anterior and posterior PHG based on differential connectivity profiles to other brain regions. This analysis resulted in a PHG subdivision consisting of four distinct anterior and two posterior PHG clusters. Next, a series of linear mixed effects models based on simultaneous EEG-fMRI data revealed that single-trial RPT peak power significantly predicted single-trial hemodynamic responses in two clusters within the posterior PHG and one in the anterior PHG. This coupling between RPT power and PHG BOLD was exclusive to trials performed during maze navigation, and not during a similar task devoid of the spatial context of the maze. These findings highlight a role of PHG theta phase resetting for the purpose of encoding salient information during goal-directed spatial navigation. Taken together, RPT during virtual navigation integrates experimental, computational, and theoretical research of PHG function in animals with human cognitive electrophysiology studies and clinical research on memory-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

">Combining NeuroPainting with transcriptomics reveals cell-type-specific morphological and molecular signatures of the 22q11.2 deletion</a></h4>

              
                Neuropsychiatric conditions pose substantial challenges for therapeutic development due to their complex and poorly understood underlying mechanisms. High-throughput, unbiased phenotypic assays present a promising path for advancing therapeutic discovery, especially within disease-relevant neural tissues. Here, we introduce NeuroPainting, a novel adaptation of the Cell Painting assay, optimized for high-dimensional morphological phenotyping of neural cell types, including neurons, neuronal progenitor cells, and astrocytes derived from human stem cells. Using NeuroPainting, we quantified cell structure and organelle behavior across various brain cell types, creating a public dataset of over 4,000 cellular traits. This extensive dataset not only sets a new benchmark for phenotypic screening in neuropsychiatric research but also serves as a gold standard for the research community, enabling comparisons and validation of results. We then applied NeuroPainting to identify morphological signatures associated with the 22q11.2 deletion, a major genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. We observed profound cell-type-specific effects of the 22q11.2 deletion, with significant alterations in mitochondrial structure, endoplasmic reticulum organization, and cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in astrocytes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reduced expression of cell adhesion genes in 22q11.2 deletion astrocytes, consistent with recent post-mortem findings. Integrating the RNA sequencing data and morphological profiles uncovered a novel biological link between altered expression of specific cell adhesion molecules and observed changes in mitochondrial morphology in 22q11.2 deletion astrocytes. These findings underscore the power of combined phenomic and transcriptomic analyses to reveal mechanistic insights associated with human genetic variants of neuropsychiatric conditions.

">ASAP: An automatic sustained attention prediction method for infants and toddlers using wearable device signals</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention (SA) is a critical cognitive ability that emerges in infancy. The recent development of wearable technology for infants enables the collection of large-scale multimodal data in the natural environment, including physiological signals. To capitalize on these new technologies, psychologists need methods to efficiently extract valid and robust SA measures from large datasets. In this study, we present an innovative automatic sustained attention prediction (ASAP) method that harnesses electrocardiogram (ECG) and accelerometer (Acc) signals recorded with wearable sensors from 75 infants (6-, 9-, 12-, 24- and 36-months). Infants undertook various naturalistic tasks similar to those encountered in their natural environment, including free play with their caregivers. Annotated SA was validated by fixation signals from eye-tracking. ASAP was trained on temporal and spectral features derived from the ECG and Acc signals to detect attention periods, and tested against human-coded SA. ASAP's performance is similar across all age groups, demonstrating its suitability for studying development. We also investigated the relationship between attention periods and low-level perceptual features (visual saliency, visual clutter) extracted from the egocentric videos recorded during caregiver-infant free play. Saliency increased during attention vs inattention periods and decreased with age for attention (but not inattention) periods. Crucially, there was no observable difference in results from ASAP attention detection relative to the human-coded attention. Our results demonstrate that ASAP is a powerful tool for detecting infant SA elicited in natural environments. Alongside the available wearable sensors, ASAP provides unprecedented opportunities for studying infant development in the "wild".

">Whole-brain causal connectivity during decoded neurofeedback: a meta study</a></h4>

              
                Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) represents a pioneering approach in human neuroscience that enables modulation of brain activity patterns without subjective conscious awareness through the combination of real-time fMRI with multivariate pattern analysis. While this technique holds significant potential for clinical and cognitive applications, the causal mechanisms underlying successful DecNef regulation and the neural dynamics that distinguish successful learners from those who struggle remain poorly understood. To address this question, we conducted a meta-study across functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from five DecNef experiments, each with multiple fMRI sessions, to reveal causal network dynamics associated with individual differences in neurofeedback performance. Using the newly proposed CaLLTiF causal discovery method, we computed causal maps to identify causal network patterns that distinguish DecNef regulation from baseline and account for variations in neurofeedback success. We found that enhanced connectivity within the bilateral control network--particularly stronger connections involving the posterior cingulate and precuneus cortex--predicted neurofeedback success across all five studies. Whole-brain causal connectivity during DecNef further exhibited distinct network reorganizations, characterized by reduced average path lengths and increased right-limbic nodal degrees. Further, comparisons across cognition- and perception-targeted DecNef revealed a remarkable separation in connections to and from the somatomotor network, where connections between somatomotor and control-default-attention networks are larger during cognitive neurofeedback while causal effects between somatomotor and subcortical-visual-limbic networks are larger during perceptive DecNef. This is despite the fact that none of the involved studies targeted or involved motor activity. Overall, our results demonstrated the key role of bilateral medial control network in successful DecNef regulation regardless of the DecNef targets, a clear separation in somatomotor involvement between cognitive and perceptive DecNef, and general promise of whole-brain causal discovery in understanding complex neural processes such as decoded neurofeedback.

">Clock genes period and timeless control synaptogenesis in Drosophila motor terminals</a></h4>

              
                Some neurons undergo rhythmic morphological changes that persist in constant darkness and require the expression of clock genes. Flight motoneuron MN5, one of the best studied neurons of Drosophila melanogaster exhibits several examples of this type of circadian structural plasticity. During the morning, when the fly is active, synaptic boutons are larger than during the night when the fly is resting though more synaptic boutons and synapses are observed. Here, by comparing bouton numbers at different timepoints in normal flies and in flies carrying loss-of-function mutations in clock genes timeless (tim) or period (per), we investigate whether the rhythmic changes in numbers of boutons and synapses require the expression of these genes. Absence of tim expression abolished the rhythm in bouton number whereas absence of per expression appeared to increase the rhythm's amplitude. This indicates that in normal flies TIM protein is necessary to drive the normal rhythm of bouton number and PER probably has a damping effect on it. In addition, it appears that tim and per expression normally act as inhibitor of synaptogenesis because their loss-of-function mutations caused over-proliferation of synapses. Unexpectedly, TIM and PER were expressed in different cells. TIM was found in the glial sheath wrapping the motoneuron's axon and PER was predominantly found along the axon, suggesting that the control of the rhythmic change in bouton and synapse numbers requires interactions between different cell types.

">Integration of cortical inputs in the lateral hypothalamus is dominated by the medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a critical brain region orchestrating survival behaviours including feeding. Its sparse intrinsic synaptic connectivity allows long-range projections to modulate its activity. Some of these projections arise from the cerebral cortex, which is known to influence feeding. However, the functional and anatomical organization of cortico-hypothalamic pathways have remained poorly studied. We used anatomical and optogenetic mapping to show that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is the strongest cortical input source to the LH, followed by a lateral associative region including the insular cortex (IC), and the ventral subiculum. Input from the mPFC and IC had markedly different synaptic dynamics and were integrated supralinearly. IC input surpassed that of the mPFC in a subpopulation of highly excitable dorsal LH neurons which had a strong h-current. Input from the mPFC showed selective targeting to LH neurons which project back to the mPFC, suggesting the existence of a direct feedback loop. Overall, these results identify a direct prefrontal hypothalamic pathway which is poised to dominate rapid cortical control of hypothalamic activity.

">Activation of hypothalamic-pontine-spinal pathway promotes locomotor initiation and functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamus is critical for regulating behaviors essential for survival and locomotion, but how it integrates internal needs and transmits locomotion commands to the spinal cord (SC) remains unclear. We found that glutamatergic neurons in lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) are essential for regulating motivated locomotor activity. Using single-neuron projectome analysis, trans-synaptic tracing, and optogenetic manipulation, we showed that LHA facilitates motivated locomotion during food seeking via pontine oral part (PnO) projection neurons, rather than direct SC projections or indirect stress signaling via medial septum and diagonal band. Activating PnO-SC projection neurons also initiated locomotion. Importantly, LHA-PnO projection neurons were crucial for regulating locomotor recovery following mouse spinal cord injury (SCI). Closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) of LHA via gating by motor cortex signals markedly promoted long-term restoration of hindlimb motor functions after SCI. Thus, we have identified a hypothalamic-pontine-spinal pathway and the stimulation paradigm for potential therapeutic intervention after SCI.

">Modality-Specific and Amodal Language Processing by Single Neurons</a></h4>

              
                According to psycholinguistic theories, during language processing, spoken and written words are first encoded along independent phonological and orthographic dimensions, then enter into modality-independent syntactic and semantic codes. Non-invasive brain imaging has isolated several cortical regions putatively associated with those processing stages, but lacks the resolution to identify the corresponding neural codes. Here, we describe the firing responses of over 1000 neurons, and mesoscale field potentials from over 1400 microwires and 1500 iEEG contacts in 21 awake neurosurgical patients with implanted electrodes during written and spoken sentence comprehension. Using forward modeling of temporal receptive fields, we determined which sensory or abstract dimensions are encoded. We observed a double dissociation between superior temporal neurons sensitive to phonemes and phonological features and previously unreported ventral occipito-temporal neurons sensitive to letters and orthographic features. We also discovered novel neurons, primarily located in middle temporal and inferior frontal areas, which are modality-independent and show responsiveness to higher linguistic features. Overall, these findings show how language processing can be linked to neural dynamics, across multiple brain regions at various resolutions and down to the level of single neurons.

">Social and Contextual Memory Impairments Induced by Amyloid-β Oligomers are Rescued by Sigma-1 Receptor Activation</a></h4>

              
                Sigma-1 receptors (S1Rs) are widely expressed throughout the central nervous system and modulate neuron intracellular calcium levels, leading to changes in neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity. They also interact with various proteins and signaling pathways, playing a key role in regulating synaptic plasticity in brain areas such as the hippocampus, thereby influencing learning and memory processes. This opens a research avenue to explore S1R modulation as a potential therapeutic target in diseases involving hippocampal synaptic alterations and compromised cognitive processes, such as Alzheimer s disease (AD). Here, we hypothesize that pharmacological activation of S1R could counteract synaptic plasticity deficits and hippocampal-dependent cognitive alterations in an early-stage amyloidosis model of Alzheimer s disease, induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of A{beta}1-42 oligomers (oA{beta}1-42). For that purpose, we investigate ex vivo CA3-CA1 synaptic plasticity, while in vivo, we performed open field habituation and social recognition tasks to assess contextual and social memory, respectively. Our data show that pharmacological activation of S1Rs with the selective agonist PRE-084 counteract oA{beta}1-42 deleterious effects on CA3-CA1 long-term synaptic plasticity (LTP), and hippocampal-dependent contextual and social memory, without alterations of spontaneous behaviors. Together, these results provide evidence for the role of S1Rs in ameliorating hippocampal synaptic and contextual memory dysfunctions and, for the first time, in early amyloid-induced social memory deficits, highlighting their potential in the development of comprehensive treatments for early AD. Also, the absence of adverse behavioral outcomes associated with PRE-084 treatment accentuates its safety profile, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic agent.

                Background: The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders is higher in women than men. The severity of hallmark symptoms including hypervigilance and fear reactivity to unpredictable threats varies with sex and reproductive cycle, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTDL) as a potential nexus for the influence of biological sex and reproductive cycle on fear- and anxiety-related behaviors. Methods: 103 male and 132 cycle-monitored female CRF-Cre rats were used. BNSTDL-CRF neuron excitability and synaptic activity was recorded with slice electrophysiology. Chemogenetic inhibition of BNSTDL-CRF neurons was performed before elevated-plus maze, predator odor exposure, shock-induced startle sensitization, and anxiety-potentiated startle (APS) following unpredictable fear conditioning. Results: BNSTDL-CRF neurons in females exhibit higher excitability (cycle-independent) and lower sensitivity to excitatory synaptic inputs (proestrus and diestrus) compared to males. BNSTDL-CRF neuron inhibition reduces open-arm time in estrous females but not males, suggesting that BNSTDL-CRF neurons reduce anxiety during sexual receptivity. In the APS, BNSTDL-CRF neuron inhibition attenuates short-term startle potentiation in males, whereas it causes persistent APS in diestrous females. Conclusions: Unpredictable fear conditioning elicits sex- and estrous phase-specific APS, differentially regulated by BNSTDL-CRF neurons. Persistent APS in females align with hormonal phases marked by low reproductive hormones, mirroring human PTSD findings. Our findings underscore the sex- and hormone-specific role of BNSTDL-CRF neurons in APS. Widely used in human studies, APS may bridge animal and human research, supporting biomarker development and more effective pharmacotherapies.

">Brain-region-specific changes and dysregulation of activity regulated genes in Gria3 mutant mice, a genetic animal model of schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Protein-truncating variants in GRIA3 (encoding the GluA3/GluR3 subunit of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors) are associated with substantially increased risk of schizophrenia (SCZ). Here we characterized Gria3 mutant mice carrying a protein-truncating mutation that mimics a SCZ-associated variant. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that activity-regulated genes are downregulated in cortical regions, while immune and glia-related pathways exhibit brain-region-specific changes. The transcriptomic changes in Gria3 mutant mice are remarkably different from those in Grin2a mutant mice, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, even though both encode glutamate receptors and are associated with SCZ risk. Proteomic analysis further demonstrated that loss-of-function of Gria3 profoundly alters the protein composition of synapses. These findings in a genetic mouse model provide potential insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SCZ.

                Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) allow optical recording of membrane potential from targeted cells in vivo. However, red GEVIs that are compatible with two-photon microscopy and that can be multiplexed in vivo with green reporters like GCaMP, are currently lacking. To address this gap, we explored diverse rhodopsin proteins as GEVIs and engineered a novel GEVI, 2Photron, based on a rhodopsin from the green algae Klebsormidium nitens. 2Photron, combined with two photon ultrafast local volume excitation (ULoVE), enabled multiplexed readout of spiking and subthreshold voltage simultaneously with GCaMP calcium signals in visual cortical neurons of awake, behaving mice. These recordings revealed the cell-specific relationship of spiking and subthreshold voltage dynamics with GCaMP responses, highlighting the challenges of extracting underlying spike trains from calcium imaging.

">Uncovering dynamic human brain phase coherence networks</a></h4>

              
                Complex behavioral and cognitive processes emerge from coordinated communication between sometimes disparate brain regions, implying a systems-level dynamic synchronization of underlying neural signals. This study presents approaches to multivariate mixture modeling of functional brain imaging data for analyzing phase coherence networks for human brain macroscale dynamic functional connectivity. We show that 1) the complex domain is required to analyze phase coherence in its entirety, 2) statistical models for complex-valued phase coherence, particularly the complex angular central gaussian (ACG) distribution, greatly exceeds performance over models for time-series data, rank-2 cosine phase coherence maps, or the leading eigenvector of cosine phase coherence maps (i.e., LEiDA), 3) methods should account for the inherent anisotropy of the brain's interconnections. We emphasize the need to utilize models that account for the manifold on which the data reside, and show that the proposed models provide valuable information about intrinsic functional connectivity networks and can easily distinguish task-related brain function. We provide an open-source, Python-based toolbox ("Phase Coherence Mixture Modeling" (PCMM): github.com/anders-s-olsen/PCMM) to facilitate and promote implementation of these models.

">Postnatal maturation of serotonergic modulation of spinal RORβ interneurons in the medial deep dorsal horn</a></h4>

              
                Proprioceptive input is essential for coordinated locomotion and this input must be properly gated to ensure smooth and effective movement. Presynaptic inhibition mediated by GABAergic interneurons provides regulation of sensory afferent feedback. Serotonin not only promotes locomotion, but also modulates feedback from sensory afferents, both directly and indirectly, potentially by acting on the GABAergic interneurons that mediate presynaptic inhibition. Developmental disruptions in presynaptic inhibition can produce deficits in sensorimotor processing. Importantly, both presynaptic inhibition of proprioceptive afferents and serotonergic innervation of the spinal cord become mature and functional after the first postnatal week. However, little is known about the serotonergic receptors involved in the modulation of interneurons mediating presynaptic inhibition and when developmentally their actions mature. Here, we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings in lumbar spinal slices from neonatal and juvenile mice to assess the intrinsic properties and serotonergic modulation of deep dorsal horn GABAergic ROR{beta} interneurons previously shown to mediate presynaptic inhibition of proprioceptive afferents. ROR{beta} interneurons from juvenile cords displayed more mature membrane properties. Further, serotonin increased the excitability of ROR{beta} interneurons via actions at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B/2C, and 5-HT7 receptors in juvenile but not early neonatal spinal cords. Our findings indicate that deep dorsal horn ROR{beta} interneurons undergo postnatal maturation in both their intrinsic excitability and ability to respond to serotonin, concurrent with the maturation of serotonergic innervation of the dorsal horn. This information can prompt future targeted studies testing relationships between impairments of serotonergic development, proprioceptive processing disorders, and presynaptic inhibition mediated by ROR{beta} interneurons.

">Rarely categorical, always high-dimensional: how the neural code changes along the cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                The brain is highly structured both at anatomical and functional levels. However, within individual brain areas, neurons often exhibit very diverse and seemingly disorganized responses. A more careful analysis shows that these neurons can sometimes be grouped together into specialized subpopulations (categorical representations). Organization can also be found at the level of the representational geometry in the activity space, typically in the form of low-dimensional structures. It is still unclear how the geometry in the activity space and the structure of the response profiles of individual neurons are related. Here, we systematically analyzed the geometric and selectivity structure of the neural population from 40+ cortical regions in mice performing a decision-making task (IBL public Brainwide Map data set). We used a reduced-rank regression approach to quantify the selectivity profiles of single neurons and multiple measures of dimensionality to characterize the representational geometry of task variables. We then related these measures within single areas to the position of each area in the sensory-cognitive cortical hierarchy. Our findings reveal that only a few regions (in primary sensory areas) are categorical. When multiple brain areas are considered, we observe clustering that reflects the brain's large-scale organization. The representational geometry of task variables also changed along the cortical hierarchy, with higher dimensionality in cognitive regions. These trends were explained by analytical computations linking the maximum dimensionality of representational geometry to the clustering of selectivity at the single neuron level. Finally, we computed the shattering dimensionality (SD), a measure of the linear separability of neural activity vectors; remarkably, the SD remained near maximal across all regions, suggesting that the observed variability in the selectivity profiles allows neural populations to maintain high computational flexibility. These results provide a new mathematical and empirical perspective on selectivity and representation geometry in the cortical neural code.

">Somatosensory high frequency oscillations across            the human central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Sensory information processing in the central nervous system (CNS) requires both post-synaptic responses and spiking activity, with human electroencephalography (EEG) research largely focused on the former. However, EEG data also contain high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), which have been linked to cortical spike bursts in animal models, thus providing a non-invasive macroscopic marker of population spiking in humans. Here, we go beyond cortical processing and demonstrate that it is possible to simultaneously record HFOs to somatosensory stimulation across the entire human CNS - from spinal cord over subcortical to cortical processing stages. Using multivariate spatial filtering approaches in two independent datasets, we identify replicable and generalizable HFOs across the CNS and obtain a detailed characterization of these signals at each processing level. Finally, we provide evidence at the between- and within-individual level that low and high frequency electrophysiological responses represent at least partly independent information across the CNS. Taken together, our approach offers the first evidence that it is possible to detect and characterise HFOs simultaneously across the CNS, providing a unique non-invasive and multi-level window into human neurophysiology in health and disease.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Previous research has suggested that Western musicians, who generally demonstrate proficiency in reading musical scores, exhibit superior performance in visuospatial working memory tasks compared to non-musicians. Evidence indicates brain activation in regions such as the left inferior parietal lobe and the right posterior fusiform gyrus during music reading, which are associated with visuospatial processing. This study aimed to explore how musical training influences spatial working memory and to examine the relationship between self-assessment accuracy and cognitive performance. Methods: A visuospatial working memory test, the Corsi block-tapping test (CBT), was administered to 70 participants, including 35 musicians with experience in music reading and 35 non-musicians. CBT performances were compared between groups, controlling for sex and age differences using analysis of covariance. Participants were also asked to self-assess their visuospatial capabilities. Results: Musicians performed significantly better than non-musicians in the CBT and demonstrated greater metacognitive accuracy in evaluating their visuospatial memory capacities. A total of 46.34% of musicians who claimed good performance on the CBT did in fact perform well, in comparison with 14.63% of non-musicians. Sex influenced the outcomes of spatial working memory, while age did not significantly affect performance. Conclusions: This self-awareness of visuospatial capabilities reflects a form of metacompetence, encompassing reflective thinking and the ability to assess one&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive skills. Furthermore, while differences in spatial working memory between musicians and non-musicians appear to be related to executive functions associated with general music practice, further investigation is needed to explore other potential influences beyond musical experience.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Dementia involves the loss of cognitive abilities and impairs functional abilities in daily life. In motor imagery (MI) techniques, motor acts are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements. The purpose of the randomized controlled trial was to examine the effects of MI on the motor function of older adults with dementia. Methods: Overall, 160 participants (43 men, 117 women, MMSE M = 23.20, SD = 0.15) from an Athens Day Care Center of the Alzheimer Association were randomized to (a) the MI and exercise group (experimental group) (n = 55), (b) the only exercise group (1st control group) (n = 52) and (c) the neither MI nor exercise group (2nd control group) (n = 53). The exercise session comprised 24 physiotherapy exercise sessions, lasting 45 min each, twice a week for 12 weeks. The exercises were selected from the Otago Exercise Program. Three assessments were performed: (a) one week prior to the program, (b) at one and a half months and (c) after the program. The experimental group performed a 30-minute MI with exercise program content after the end of every physiotherapy exercise session. The Multidirectional Reach Test, Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) were used to assess participants&amp;amp;rsquo; balance and functional status. Results: In the intention to treat analysis (18 participants dropped out), the 3 &amp;amp;times; 3 repeated measures ANOVA indicated statistically significant results between the three groups on (a) the TUG (F = 3.06, df (2), p = 0.04), (b) the FTSST (F = 3.00, df (2), p = 0.05), (c) the forward direction test (F = 4.14 df (2), p = 0.02), the lateral right and the lateral left direction tests (F = 3.90, df (2), p = 0.02 and F = 7.87, df (2), p = 0.00, respectively), and (d) the FGA (F = 4.35, df (2), p = 0.01). The Friedman test showed significant statistical significant differences among the three groups for BBS (X2 = 7.62, df = 2, p = 0.22), and an effect size of partial &amp;amp;eta;2 coefficient for F-tests was found. Post hoc comparisons using a Bonferroni test for ANOVA and Wilcoxon test for Friedman indicated that the mean scores for the experimental group and the 1st control were significantly better than the 2rd control group in many dependent variables. Conclusions: The study showed a positive effect of MI on balance and the functional status of older adults with early stages of dementia with possible beneficial effects on maintaining independence and reducing physical decline.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify biochemical changes in individuals at higher risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) via <i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) heterozygosity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional observational study of 48 asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers, 39 asymptomatic non-carrier controls, 19 people with sporadic ALS, 10 with <i>C9orf72</i> ALS, 14 with sporadic FTD, and 10 with <i>C9orf72</i> FTD. Relative abundance of 30 pre-defined cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of ALS and FTD were compared in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers and age-matched non-carrier controls. Differential abundance of these proteins was quantified using data independent acquisition mass spectrometry or electro chemiluminescent assay for neurofilament light chain. Unbiased analysis of the entire cerebrospinal fluid proteome was then carried out.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels were higher in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers compared with age-matched non-carriers (log<sub>2</sub>fold change 0.20, FDR-adjusted <i>p</i>-value = 0.034), whereas neurofilament light chain levels did not significantly differ. Ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels remained elevated after matching of groups by neurofilament levels (<i>p</i> = 0.011), and after adjusting for age, sex, and neurofilament levels. A significant difference was also observed when restricting analysis to younger participants (&lt;37) matched by neurofilament level (<i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated cerebrospinal fluid ubiquitin carboxyl-hydrolase isozyme L1 levels in <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carriers can occur in the absence of increased neurofilament levels, potentially reflecting either compensatory or pathogenic mechanisms preceding rapid neuronal loss. This brings forward the window on changes associated with the <i>C9orf72</i> HRE carrier state, with potential to inform understanding of penetrance and approaches to prevention.

<p>Parkinson patients with mild cognitive impairment do not only show established motor (e.g., tremor and rigor) and nonmotor (e.g., depression and global cognitive impairment) symptoms. They also show deficits in some basic numerical functions: (non-) symbolic magnitude comparison and number line estimation In contrast, auditory and written transcoding skills were preserved.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have a huge impact on patients, caregivers, and the health care system. Until now, diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments in PD has been established based on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention, or working memory. However, specific numerical deficits observed in clinical practice have not yet been systematically investigated. PD-immanent deterioration of domain-general functions and domain-specific numerical areas suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary dyscalculia. The current study systematically investigated basic number processing performance in PD patients for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of numerosity and the influence of domain-general factors. The overall sample consisted of patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to consensus guidelines, and healthy controls. PD patients were stratified into patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) or mild cognitive impairment (level I-PD-MCI based on cognitive screening). Basic number processing was assessed using transcoding, number line estimation, and (non-) symbolic number magnitude comparison tasks. Discriminant analysis was employed to assess whether basic number processing tasks can differentiate between a healthy control group and both PD groups. All participants were subjected to a comprehensive numerical and a neuropsychological test battery, as well as sociodemographic and clinical measures. Results indicate a profile of preserved (verbal representation) and impaired (magnitude representation, place × value activation) function in PD-MCI, hinting at basal ganglia dysfunction affecting numerical cognition in PD. Numerical deficits could not be explained by domain-general cognitive impairments, so that future research needs to incorporate domain-specific tasks of sufficient difficulty.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Psychiatric disorders are multifactorial conditions without clear biomarkers, influenced by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Understanding these disorders requires identifying specific endophenotypes that help break down their complexity. Here, we undertake an in-depth analysis of one such endophenotype, namely imbalanced approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), reviewing its significant dependency on the hippocampus. Imbalanced AAC is a transdiagnostic endophenotype, being a feature of many psychiatric conditions in humans. However, it is predominantly examined in preclinical research through paradigms that subject rodents to conflict-laden scenarios. This review offers an original perspective by discussing the AAC through three distinct lights: optogenetic modulation of the AAC, which updates our understanding of the hippocampal contribution to behavioral inhibition; the impact of environmental stress, which exacerbates conflict and strengthens the stress-psychopathology axis; and inherent epigenetic aspects, which uncover crucial molecular underpinnings of environmental (mal) adaptation. By integrating these perspectives, in this review we aim to underline a cross-species causal nexus between heightened hippocampal activity and avoidance behavior. In addition, we suggest a rationale to explore epigenetic pharmacology as a potential strategy to tackle AAC-related psychopathology. This review assumes greater significance when viewed through the lens of advancing AAC-centric diagnostics in human subjects. Unlike traditional questionnaires, which struggle to accurately measure individual differences in AAC-related dimensions, new approaches using virtual reality and computer games show promise in better focusing the magnitude of AAC contribution to psychopathology.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The discovery of adult-born granule cells (aDGCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus has raised questions regarding how they develop, incorporate into the hippocampal circuitry, and contribute to learning and memory. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of mouse aDGCs as they matured, enabled by using a tamoxifen-induced genetic label to birth date the aDGCs at different animal ages. Importantly, we also undertook immunofluorescence studies of the expression of the immediate early gene Egr1 and compared these findings with the electrophysiology data in the same animals. We examined two groups of animals, with aDGC birthdating when the mice were 2 months and at 7–9 months of age. In both groups, cells 4 weeks old had lower thresholds for current-evoked action potentials than older cells but fired fewer spikes during long current pulses and responded more poorly to synaptic activation. aDGCs born in both 2 and 7–9-month-old mice matured in their intrinsic excitability and synaptic properties from 4–12 weeks postgenesis, but this occurred more slowly for the older age animals. Interestingly, this pattern of intrinsic excitability changes did not correlate with the pattern of Egr1 expression. Instead, the development of Egr1 expression was correlated with the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that in order for aDGCs to fully participate in hippocampal circuitry, as indicated by Egr1 expression, they must have developed enough synaptic input, in spite of the greater input resistance and reduced firing threshold that characterizes young aDGCs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23648?af=R">Distinct Ventral Hippocampus Network Properties in Dissociated Cultures</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Extensive research has been focused in the past century on structural, physiological, and molecular attributes of the hippocampus. This interest was created by the unique involvement of the hippocampus in cognitive and affective functions of the brain. Functional analysis revealed that the hippocampus has divergent properties along its axial dimension to the extent that the dorsal sector (dorsal hippocampus, DH) has different connections with the rest of the brain than those of the ventral sector (VH). Still, longitudinal pathways connect the DH with the VH and dampen the functional differences between the sectors. To be able to identify the intrinsic functional difference between the DH and VH, we produced dissociated monolayer cultures from prenatal DH and VH and examined their properties at 10–20 days after plating by imaging the spontaneous activity of the network using Fluo-2 AM, a calcium indicator. Surprisingly, while DH and VH sectors produced dissociated cultures with similar morphological attributes, VH cultures were more active spontaneously than DH cultures. Furthermore, when stimulated to produce action potentials, VH neurons triggered network bursts in postsynaptic neurons more often than DH cultures. Finally, in both DH and VH cultures, electrical stimulation of single cells produced network bursts in response to a burst of action potentials rather than to single spikes. These experiments indicate that even in dissociated cultures, neurons of the VH are more excitable and sensitive to electrical stimulation than DH; hence, they are more likely to generate network bursts and epileptic seizures, as suggested for in vivo brains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23641?af=R">Comparable Theta Phase Coding Dynamics Along the Transverse Axis of CA1</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Topographical projection patterns from the entorhinal cortex to area CA1 of the hippocampus have led to a hypothesis that proximal CA1 (pCA1, closer to CA2) is spatially more selective than distal CA1 (dCA1, closer to the subiculum). While earlier studies have shown evidence supporting this hypothesis, we recently showed that this difference does not hold true under all experimental conditions. In a complex environment with distinct local texture cues on a circular track and global visual cues, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable spatial selectivity. Correlated with the spatial selectivity differences, the earlier studies also showed differences in theta phase coding dynamics between pCA1 and dCA1 neurons. Here we show that there are no differences in theta phase coding dynamics between neurons in these two regions under the experimental conditions where pCA1 and dCA1 neurons are equally spatially selective. These findings challenge the established notion of dCA1 being inherently less spatially selective and theta modulated than pCA1 and suggest further experiments to understand theta-mediated activation of the CA1 sub-networks to represent space.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HC) is recognized for its pivotal role in memory-related plasticity and facilitating adaptive behavioral responses to reward shifts. However, the nature of its involvement in the response to reward downshifts remains to be determined. To bridge this knowledge gap, we explored the HC's function through a series of experiments in various tasks involving reward downshifts and using several neural manipulations in rats. In Experiment 1, complete excitotoxic lesions of the HC impaired choice performance in a modified T-maze after reducing the quantity of sugar pellet rewards. In Experiment 2, chemogenetic inhibition of the dorsal HC (dHC) disrupted anticipatory behavior following a food-pellet reward reduction. Experiments 3–5 impaired HC function by using peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. This treatment, which induces peripheral inflammation affecting HC function, significantly increased cytokine levels in the dHC (Experiment 3) and impaired anticipatory choice behavior (Experiment 4). None of these dorsal hippocampal manipulations affected consummatory responses in animals experiencing sucrose downshifts. Accordingly, we found no evidence of increased neural activation in either the dorsal or ventral HC, as measured by c-Fos expression, after a sucrose downshift task involving consummatory suppression (Experiment 6). The results highlight the HC's pivotal role in adaptively modulating anticipatory behavior in response to a variety of situations involving frustrative nonreward, while having no effect on adjustments on consummatory behavior. The data supporting this conclusion were obtained under heterogeneous experimental conditions derived from a multi-laboratory collaboration, ensuring the robustness and high reproducibility of our findings. Spatial orientation, memory update, choice of reward signals of different values, and anticipatory versus consummatory adjustments to reward downshift are discussed as potential mechanisms that could account for the specific effects observed from HC manipulations.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is important for social behavior and exhibits unusual structural plasticity in the form of continued production of new granule neurons throughout adulthood, but it is unclear how adult neurogenesis contributes to social interactions. In the present study, we suppressed neurogenesis using a pharmacogenetic mouse model and examined social investigation and aggression in adult male mice to investigate the role of hippocampal adult-born neurons in the expression of aggressive behavior. In simultaneous choice tests with stimulus mice placed in corrals, mice with complete suppression of adult neurogenesis in adulthood (TK mice) exhibited normal social investigation behaviors, indicating that new neurons are not required for social interest, social memory, or detection of and response to social olfactory signals. However, mice with suppressed neurogenesis displayed decreased offensive and defensive aggression in a resident-intruder paradigm, and less resistance in a social dominance test, relative to neurogenesis-intact controls, when paired with weight and strain-matched (CD-1) mice. During aggression tests, TK mice were frequently attacked by the CD-1 intruder mice, which never occurred with WTs, and normal CD-1 male mice investigated TK mice less than controls when corralled in the social investigation test. Importantly, TK mice showed normal aggression toward prey (crickets) and smaller, nonaggressive (olfactory bulbectomized) C57BL/6J intruders, suggesting that mice lacking adult neurogenesis do not avoid aggressive social interactions if they are much larger than their opponent and will clearly win. Taken together, our findings show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in the instigation of intermale aggression, possibly by weighting a cost–benefit analysis against confrontation in cases where the outcome of the fight is not clear.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the hippocampus (HPC), has been implicated through theta oscillations in various brain functions ranging from locomotion to learning and memory. While the indispensable role of the SuM in HPC theta generation in anesthetized animals is well-characterized, the SuM is not always necessary for HPC theta in awake animals. This raises questions on the precise behavioral relevance of SuM theta activity and its interaction with HPC theta activity. We used simultaneously recorded SuM and HPC local field potentials (LFPs) in a one-day water maze (WM) learning paradigm in rats (<i>n</i> = 8), to show that theta activities recorded from the SuM itself were not positively correlated with locomotor (swimming) speed nor acceleration, but the individual relationship between acceleration and SuM theta frequency is correlated with WM learning rates. In contrast, we found that SuM-HPC theta phase coherence is strongly correlated with swimming speed and acceleration, but these do not relate to WM learning. SuM-HPC-directed coherence analysis demonstrated no swimming kinetics nor learning rate associations, but revealed that periods of high SuM-HPC theta phase coherence are driven by the SuM at relatively low (~6.2 Hz) frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that the SuM and the HPC also engage in non-random, non-coherent phase coupling modes where either structure preferentially displays a ± 2 Hz difference with the other. Our data indicate SuM theta LFPs do not appear to be related to either speed coding or spatial learning in swimming rats and display non-random out-of-phase theta frequency coupling with the HPC.</p>

">PrP turnover in vivo and the time to effect of prion disease therapeutics</a></h4>

              
                PrP lowering is effective against prion disease in animal models and is being tested clinically. Therapies in the current pipeline lower PrP production, leaving pre-existing PrP to be cleared according to its own half-life. We hypothesized that PrPs half-life may be a rate-limiting factor for the time to effect of PrP-lowering drugs, and one reason why late treatment of prion-infected mice is not as effective as early treatment. Using isotopically labeled chow with targeted mass spectrometry, as well as antisense oligonucleotide treatment followed by timed PrP measurement, we estimate a half-life of 5-6 days for PrP in the brain. PrP turnover is not affected by over- or under-expression. Mouse PrP and human PrP have similar turnover rates measured in wild-type or humanized knock-in mice. CSF PrP appears to mirror brain PrP in real time in rats. PrP is more readily quantifiable in colon than in other peripheral organs, and appears to have a shorter half-life in colon than in brain. Our data may inform the design of both preclinical and clinical studies of PrP-lowering drugs.

">Impact of adolescent high-fat diet and psychosocial stress on neuroendocrine stress responses and binge eating behavior in adult male Lewis rats</a></h4>

              
                Childhood obesity is a multifactorial disease affecting more than 160 million adolescents worldwide. Adolescent exposure to obesogenic environments, characterized by access to high-fat diets and stress, precipitates maladaptive eating habits in adulthood such as binge eating. Evidence suggests a strong association between Western-like high-saturated-fat (WD) food consumption and dysregulated hormone fluctuations. However, few studies have explored the long-term impact of adolescent WD and psychosocial stress on brain and behavior. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate the impact of adolescent exposure to an obesogenic diet on stress resiliency and increased susceptibility for binge-like eating behaviors. Adolescent male Lewis rats were given WD (41% fat; n=40) or control diet (CD, 16% fat; n=38) for 4 weeks before undergoing a stress paradigm of predator exposure and social instability (CDE, WDE, CDU, WDU; n=16/group). Subjects were provided intermittent WD access (24 h/week) to evaluate binge eating-like behavior in adulthood. Fecal corticosterone and testosterone were measured at four timepoints throughout adolescence and adulthood. WD rats exhibited increased body weight (p = 0.0217) and elevated testosterone in mid-adolescence (p=0.0312) and blunted stress-induced corticosterone response in mid-late adolescence (CDE:WDE, p=0.028). Adolescent hormone levels were negatively correlated with bingeing and explained the variability between adult rats expressing hyperphagic and hypophagic behaviors. These results demonstrate that exposure to WD in adolescence disrupts hormone fluctuations and stress responsivity, with effects persisting into adulthood. This underscores the importance of addressing obesogenic environments early to mitigate their lasting impact on hormone regulation and stress responsiveness.

">Chemogenetic Breakdown of the Dentate Gate Causes Seizures and Spatial Memory Deficits</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus has often been posited to act as a gate that dampens highly active afferent input into the hippocampus. Effective gating is thought to prevent seizure initiation and propagation in the hippocampus and support learning and memory processes. Pathological changes to DG circuitry that occur in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can increase DG excitability and impair its gating ability which can contribute to seizures and cognitive deficits. There is evidence that TLE pathologies and seizures may independently contribute to learning and memory deficits in TLE through distinct mechanisms. These two factors are difficult to untangle since TLE pathologies can drive seizures, and seizures can worsen TLE pathologies. Here we assessed whether chemogenetically increasing dentate granule cell (DGC) excitability was enough to break down the dentate gate in the absence of TLE pathologies. We found that increasing excitability specifically in DGCs caused seizures in non-epileptic mice. Importantly, due to the modulatory nature of DREADD effects, seizures were driven by intrinsic circuit activity rather than direct activation of DGCs. These seizures resulted in a spatial memory deficit when induced after training in the spatial object recognition task and showed stereotypical patterns of activity in miniscope calcium recordings. Our results provide direct support for the dentate gate hypothesis since seizures could be induced in non-epileptic animals by artificially degrading the dentate gate with chemogenetics in the absence of epilepsy pathologies.

">Heat Acclimation in Mice Requires Preoptic BDNF Neurons and Postsynaptic Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Heat acclimation (HA) is a key adaptive response in mammals to repeated heat exposure, essential for fitness and survival1-3. HA improves cardiovascular function, thermal comfort, and exercise capacity4, 5. However, the lack of a genetically tractable model has hindered understanding of the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying HA. Here, we show that 10 days of daily 38{degrees}C exposure lowers core body temperature (Tcore) and reduces anxiety during subsequent heat exposures in mice. HA increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the medial preoptic area (MPO). BDNF-expressing MPO neurons (MPOBDNF) show increased intrinsic heat sensitivity after HA. These neurons orchestrate downstream targets in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa) to mediate HA effects. BDNF, acting through its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in the DMH, facilitates the anxiolytic effect of HA by enhancing excitatory synaptic connections between MPOBDNF and DMH neurons. This study provides new insights into HA mechanisms, setting the stage for future research on heat stress reduction and exercise optimization.

	<p>Background: Hypofunction of the glutamate system in the brain is one of the pathophysiological hypotheses for schizophrenia. Accumulating animal and clinical studies show that sarcosine (N-methylglycine), a glycine transporter-1 inhibitor, is effective in ameliorating the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were to observe the effects of sarcosine on neuronal activity in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) hippocampal neurons within an NMDA receptor hypofunction model induced by MK801. Methods: We applied in vivo calcium imaging to observe the dynamics of fluorescence from the dCA1 hippocampal neurons when the mice were exploring in an open field. Using this tool, we directly measured and compared neuronal properties between sarcosine-treated and untreated mice. At the same time, the physiological function of the neurons was also quantified by measuring their place fields. Results: Our data demonstrated that MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) diminished the fluorescence intensity of dCA1 neurons that had been genetically modified with a calcium indicator. MK-801 also significantly increased the correlation coefficient between the fluorescence dynamics of pairs of cells, a feature that may be linked to the symptom of disorganization in human patients with schizophrenia. The spatial correlations of place fields in the mice were impaired by MK-801 as well. Injected sarcosine (500 mg or 1000 mg/kg) significantly alleviated the abovementioned abnormalities. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence to support the use of sarcosine to alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia, especially hippocampus-related functions.</p>

	<p>Background. To investigate the behavior of spiking neural networks (SNNs), the sensitivity of input perturbation serves as an effective metric for assessing the influence on the network output. However, existing methods fall short in evaluating the sensitivity of SNNs featuring biologically plausible leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons due to the intricate neuronal dynamics during the feedforward process. Methods. This paper first defines the sensitivity of a temporal-coded spiking neuron (SN) as the deviation between the perturbed and unperturbed output under a given input perturbation with respect to overall inputs. Then, the sensitivity algorithm of an entire SNN is derived iteratively from the sensitivity of each individual neuron. Instead of using the actual firing time, the desired firing time is employed to derive a more precise analytical expression of the sensitivity. Moreover, the expectation of the membrane potential difference is utilized to quantify the magnitude of the input deviation. Results/Conclusions. The theoretical results achieved with the proposed algorithm are in reasonable agreement with the simulation results obtained with extensive input data. The sensitivity also varies monotonically with changes in other parameters, except for the number of time steps, providing valuable insights for choosing appropriate values to construct the network. Nevertheless, the sensitivity exhibits a piecewise decreasing tendency with respect to the number of time steps, with the length and starting point of each piece contingent upon the specific parameter values of the neuron.</p>

	<p>Background: Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of vision, commonly caused by strabismus or anisometropia during early childhood. While studies demonstrated that perceptual learning improves visual acuity and stereopsis in adults with amblyopia, accompanying changes in visual cortical function remain unclear. Methods: We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses before and after perceptual learning in seven adults with amblyopia. Our learning tasks involved dichoptic high-attention-demand tasks that avoided V1 function-related tasks and required high-level cortical functions (e.g., intraparietal sulcus) to train the amblyopic eye. Results: Perceptual learning induced low-level visual cortical function changes, which were strongly associated with the etiology of amblyopia and visual function improvements. Anisometropic amblyopes showed functional improvements across all regions of interest (ROIs: V1, V2, V3, V3A, and hV4), along with improvements in visual acuity and stereoacuity. In contrast, strabismic amblyopes showed robust improvements in visual cortical functions only in individuals who experienced significant gains in visual acuity and stereoacuity. Notably, improvements in V1 functions were significantly correlated with the magnitude of visual acuity and stereoacuity improvements when combining both anisometropic and strabismic amblyopes. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that learning occurs in both high-level and low-level cortical processes. Our study suggests that early intervention to correct eye alignment (e.g., strabismus surgery) is critical for restoring both visual and cortical functions in strabismic amblyopia.</p>

Blood coagulation is a vital physiological process involving a complex network of biochemical reactions, which converge to form a blood clot that repairs vascular injury. This process unfolds in three phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. Coagulation begins when tissue factor (TF) is exposed on an injured vessel’s wall. The first step is when activated factor VII (VIIa) in the plasma binds to TF, forming complex TF:VIIa, which activates factor X. Activated factor X (Xa) is necessary for coagulation, so the regulation of its activation is crucial. Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is a critical regulator of the initiation phase as it inhibits the activation of factor X. While previous studies have proposed two pathways—direct and indirect binding—for TFPI’s inhibitory role, the specific biochemical reactions and their rates remain ambiguous. Many existing mathematical models only assume an indirect pathway, which may be less effective under physiological flow conditions. In this study, we revisit datasets from two experiments focused on activated factor X formation in the presence of TFPI. We employ an adaptive Metropolis method for parameter estimation to reinvestigate a previously proposed biochemical scheme and corresponding rates for both inhibition pathways. Our findings show that both pathways are essential to replicate the static experimental results. Previous studies have suggested that flow itself makes a significant contribution to the inhibition of factor X activation. We added flow to this model with our estimated parameters to determine the contribution of the two inhibition pathways under these conditions. We found that direct binding of TFPI is necessary for inhibition under flow. The indirect pathway has a weaker inhibitory effect due to removal of solution phase inhibitory complexes by flow.

Mosquitoes transmit medically important human pathogens, including viruses like dengue virus and parasites such as <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., the causative agent of malaria. Mosquito microbiomes are critically important for the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease-causing agents. However, while large collections of bacterial isolates and genomic data exist for vertebrate microbiomes, the vast majority of work in mosquitoes to date is based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon data that provides limited taxonomic resolution and no functional information. To address this gap and facilitate future studies using experimental microbiome manipulations, we generated a bacterial Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection (MosAIC) consisting of 392 bacterial isolates with extensive metadata and high-quality draft genome assemblies that are publicly available, both isolates and sequence data, for use by the scientific community. MosAIC encompasses 142 species spanning 29 bacterial families, with members of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> comprising 40% of the collection. Phylogenomic analysis of 3 genera, <i>Enterobacter</i>, <i>Serratia</i>, and <i>Elizabethkingia</i>, reveal lineages of mosquito-associated bacteria isolated from different mosquito species in multiple laboratories. Investigation into species’ pangenomes further reveals clusters of genes specific to these lineages, which are of interest for future work to test for functions connected to mosquito host association. Altogether, we describe the generation of a physical collection of mosquito-associated bacterial isolates, their genomic data, and analyses of selected groups in context of genome data from closely related isolates, providing a unique, highly valuable resource for research on bacterial colonisation and adaptation within mosquito hosts. Future efforts will expand the collection to include broader geographic and host species representation, especially from individuals collected from field populations, as well as other mosquito-associated microbes, including fungi, archaea, and protozoa.

                Background/Objective Weight stigma has significant psychological and social implications, yet studies on perspective-taking as an intervention strategy remain scarce. This study aimed to investigate the effect of perspective-taking on weight stigma among Chinese university students and examine the potential mediating role of common ingroup identity. Methods A randomized controlled experiment with 202 Chinese university students (experimental group, perspective-taking group: n = 102; control group: n = 100) was conducted. Weight stigma was measured pre- and post-intervention using the Anti-Fat Attitudes Test. The study employed a 2 × 2 mixed design with ANCOVA and mediation analysis. Results The experimental group showed significantly lower post-test weight stigma when controlling for pre-test scores (F(1, 199) = 25.69, p < .001). Perspective-taking engagement was significantly higher in the experimental group (t = 3.13, p = .002). Common ingroup identity negatively correlated with post-test weight stigma (r = -.28, p < .001) but did not significantly mediate the perspective-taking and weight stigma reduction relationship. Conclusion Perspective-taking effectively reduces weight stigma among Chinese university students, contributing to stigma reduction strategies in university settings. Further research on underlying mechanisms is warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1369/v1?src=rss">Financial inclusion and stability in Ethiopia using bank-level data: A two-step system GMM estimation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper examines the impact of financial inclusion on bank stability within Ethiopian context, using panel data from 17 commercial banks over the period 2015-2023. Given the scarcity of research focused on the relationship between financial inclusion and bank stability in Ethiopia, this paper seeks to address a crucial gap by analyzing both conventional and digital aspects of financial inclusion in relation with bank stability. Methods A two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to construct a composite financial inclusion index, integrating 10 conventional and 5 digital indicators. The study applied a two-step robust system generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine the effects of financial inclusion on bank stability, complemented by Granger causality testing to examine the directionality of this relationship. Results The result reveals a significant positive effect of financial inclusion on bank stability and Granger causality tests confirms a bi-directional relationship between financial inclusion and stability, indicating that improvements in financial inclusion foster greater stability and vice versa. Our results also highlight that while bank efficiency and GDP growth rate positively effect stability, total assets and income diversification exhibit detrimental effects. Conclusions It is essential to capitalize policy synergies to promote bank stability and to enhance financial inclusion through conventional and digital channels, while carefully managing the implications of risks associated with income diversification and asset distribution. Ensuring inclusive financial system is vital for maintaining bank stability, thus positioning it as a key priority for financial institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1368/v1?src=rss">Performance of Forensic Age Estimation by Aspartic Acid Racemization and DNA Methylation: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Forensic age estimation is not difficult when the body is found in good condition, but in cases of severe decomposition or damage, such as burnt or separated body parts, then the analysis can only be done with bones and teeth. There has been abundant research and development in the field of related biochemistry over the years. Various molecular changes occur in hard tissues and long-lived proteins, such as those in bones and teeth during the physiological process of aging. Aspartic acid racemization and DNA methylation are still the most frequently used age estimation methods because of their advantages in accuracy. Method This study aimed to compare the accuracy of DNA methylation and aspartic acid racemization methods for age estimation. Journal articles were searched in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar of 2017-2022 according to PRISMA guidelines. Result Twelve journal articles were eligible for review. The DNA methylation method is quite simple to use because of commercially available methylation kits. Furthermore, the results can be obtained relatively quickly without requiring many samples, and the method is less sensitive to thermal and other damage than the aspartic acid racemization method. Conclusion The aspartic acid racemization method for age estimation has high accuracy, especially in determining age at death. However, temperature and the condition of the teeth affect the racemization of aspartic acid. Given that DNA methylation is generally stable in a wide range of temperatures, it provides a better approach to determining the chronological age even from charred remains.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1367/v1?src=rss">“Unmasking the Uncommon”: A case series of multi-drug resistant Elizabethkingia meningoseptica causing late-onset sepsis and meningitis in preterm neonates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an uncommon nosocomial pathogen that causes meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis in neonates and in immunocompromised individuals. It exhibits resistance to many commonly employed first-line antibiotics used to treat gram-negative pathogens. Herein, we present three cases of late-onset sepsis with multi-drug resistant (MDR) Elizabethkingia meningoseptica in high-risk neonates. Case 1 was a one-day-old preterm low-birth-weight infant who presented with respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. The patient was intubated and administered empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents. Blood culture grew Candida krusei, hence Amphotericin B was initiated. Repeat blood culture on day 27 showed gram-negative bacilli, identified as Elizabethkingia meningoseptica by MALDI-TOF . Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) revealed resistance to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, but sensitivity to Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Minocycline. IV Vancomycin was administered, which resulted in clinical improvement and negative blood culture results. Case 2 was an eleven-day-old preterm, low-birth-weight baby who presented with fever. Initial investigations revealed normal complete blood counts (CBC) parameters and elevated CRP levels. Blood and CSF cultures isolated Elizabethkingia meningoseptica with a similar AST pattern. Intravenous Ciprofloxacin was initiated with clinical improvement and negative follow-up blood cultures. Case 3 was a one-day-old preterm baby, appropriate-to-gestational age, presenting with respiratory distress syndrome. The infant was intubated and started on inotropic support and intravenous antibiotics. Blood cultures on day 4 showed Elizabethkingia meningoseptica and Vancomycin was started. Follow-up cultures on days 6 and 14 grew Acinetobacter baumannii. A combination of Levofloxacin and Colistin was added, and blood cultures were negative after seven days, with clinical improvement. Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections, especially in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), leading to outbreaks. Clinicians must have a high degree of suspicion of E. meningoseptica for gram-negative bacilli causing sepsis and meningitis in high-risk patients. Recent technological advances have enabled accurate speciation to guide therapy and reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the most common pathology associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is not always visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), causing surgical delays and reduced postsurgical seizure-freedom. We developed an open-source software to characterize and localize HS to aid the presurgical evaluation of children and adults with suspected TLE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included a multicenter cohort of 365 participants (154 HS; 90 disease controls; 121 healthy controls). HippUnfold was used to extract morphological surface-based features and volumes of the hippocampus from T1-weighted MRI scans. We characterized pathological hippocampi in patients by comparing them to normative growth charts and analyzing within-subject feature asymmetries. Feature asymmetry scores were used to train a logistic regression classifier to detect and lateralize HS. The classifier was validated on an independent multicenter cohort of 275 patients with HS and 161 healthy and disease controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>HS was characterized by decreased volume, thickness, and gyrification alongside increased mean and intrinsic curvature. The classifier detected 90.1% of unilateral HS patients and lateralized lesions in 97.4%. In patients with MRI-negative histopathologically-confirmed HS, the classifier detected 79.2% (19/24) and lateralized 91.7% (22/24). The model achieved similar performances on the independent cohort, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new data. Individual patient reports contextualize a patient's hippocampal features in relation to normative growth trajectories, visualise feature asymmetries, and report classifier predictions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Automated and Interpretable Detection of Hippocampal Sclerosis (AID-HS) is an open-source pipeline for detecting and lateralizing HS and outputting clinically-relevant reports. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84359">Integration of overlapping sequences emerges with consolidation through medial prefrontal cortex neural ensembles and hippocampal–cortical connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation theories propose two mechanisms that enable the behavioral integration of related memories: coordinated reactivation between hippocampus and cortex, and the emergence of cortical traces that reflect overlap across memories. However, there is limited empirical evidence that links these mechanisms to the emergence of behavioral integration over time. In two experiments, participants implicitly encoded sequences of objects with overlapping structure. Assessment of behavioral integration showed that response times during a recognition task reflected behavioral priming between objects that never occurred together in time but belonged to overlapping sequences. This priming was consolidation-dependent and only emerged for sequences learned 24 hr prior to the test. Critically, behavioral integration was related to changes in neural pattern similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increases in post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and lateral occipital cortex. These findings suggest that memories with a shared predictive structure become behaviorally integrated through a consolidation-related restructuring of the learned sequences, providing insight into the relationship between different consolidation mechanisms that support behavioral integration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95672">Targeting resident astrocytes attenuates neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes derive from different lineages and play a critical role in neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI). Whether selectively eliminating these main origins of astrocytes in lumbar enlargement could attenuate SCI-induced neuropathic pain remains unclear. Through transgenic mice injected with an adeno-associated virus vector and diphtheria toxin, astrocytes in lumbar enlargement were lineage traced, targeted, and selectively eliminated. Pain-related behaviors were measured with an electronic von Frey apparatus and a cold/hot plate after SCI. RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, molecular experiment, and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the potential mechanisms after astrocyte elimination. Lineage tracing revealed that the resident astrocytes but not ependymal cells were the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain. SCI-induced mice to obtain significant pain symptoms and astrocyte activation in lumbar enlargement. Selective resident astrocyte elimination in lumbar enlargement could attenuate neuropathic pain and activate microglia. Interestingly, the type I interferons (IFNs) signal was significantly activated after astrocytes elimination, and the most activated Gene Ontology terms and pathways were associated with the type I IFNs signal which was mainly activated in microglia and further verified in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, different concentrations of interferon and Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist could activate the type I IFNs signal in microglia. These results elucidate that selectively eliminating resident astrocytes attenuated neuropathic pain associated with type I IFNs signal activation in microglia. Targeting type I IFNs signals is proven to be an effective strategy for neuropathic pain treatment after SCI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95720">Luminal epithelial cells integrate variable responses to aging into stereotypical changes that underlie breast cancer susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous, whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger &lt;30 (y)ears old and older &gt;55y women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as <i>SATB1</i>. Epithelial expression of gap junction protein <i>GJB6</i> increased with age, and modulation of <i>GJB6</i> expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>There is considerable interest in understanding the developmental origins and health implications of individual differences in brain structure and function. In this pre-registered study we demonstrate that a hidden subgroup within the general population—people with synesthesia (e.g. who “hear” colors)—show a distinctive behavioral phenotype and wide-ranging differences in brain structure and function. We assess the performance of 13 different brain-based biomarkers (structural and functional MRI) for classifying synesthetes against general population samples, using machine learning models. The features in these models were derived from subject-specific parcellations of the cortex using the Human Connectome Project approach. All biomarkers performed above chance with intracortical myelin being a particularly strong predictor that has not been implicated in synesthesia before. Resting state data show widespread changes in the functional connectome (including less hub-based connectivity). These brain-based individual differences <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the neurotypical population can be as large as those that differentiate neurotypical from clinical brain states.</span>

	<p>Introduction. Previous studies have shown that probiotics have positive effects on both motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Additionally, in preclinical settings, probiotics have demonstrated the ability to counteract neuronal loss and alpha-synuclein aggregation, important pathological hallmarks of PD. Notably, preliminary in vitro studies have revealed the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of probiotics on symptoms and peripheral cytokines levels in PD patients compared to placebo. Methods. Patients were enrolled and blindly randomized to receive either active probiotics (comprising Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BS01 LMG P-21384, Bifidobacterium longum BL03 DSM 16603, Bifidobacterium adolescentis BA02 DSM 18351, Fructo-oligosaccharides and Maltodextrin-Group A) or placebo (Maltodextrin-Group B). Clinical evaluations and plasma levels cytokines (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;, IL-6, and TGF-&amp;amp;beta;) were also assessed at enrollment and after 12 weeks. Anti-parkinsonian therapy remained stable throughout the study. Results. Forty PD patients were recruited. After 12 weeks, Group A showed significant improvement in motor symptoms (UPDRS III: 13.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.08 vs. 12.74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.57, p = 0.028) and non-motor symptoms (NMSS: 34.32 &amp;amp;plusmn; 21.41 vs. 30.11 &amp;amp;plusmn; 19.89, p = 0.041), with notable improvement in the gastrointestinal sub-item (3.79 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.14 vs. 1.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.54, p = 0.021). A reduction of IFN-&amp;amp;gamma; levels was observed in both groups, but group A also showed a significant decrease in IL-6 and a slight increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-&amp;amp;beta;. Conclusions. Our data suggest that probiotics may modulate peripheral cytokines levels and improve clinical symptoms in PD patients. Probiotics may, therefore, represent a valuable adjunctive therapy to conventional anti-parkinsonian drugs.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neuropathic pain is challenging to treat, often resistant to current therapies, and associated with significant side effects. Pregabalin, an anticonvulsant that modulates calcium channels, is effective but can impair mental and motor functions, especially in older patients. To improve patient outcomes, reducing the doses of pregabalin and combining it with other drugs targeting different neuropathic pain mechanisms may be beneficial. TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; blockers such as etanercept have shown potential in addressing neuropathic pain by affecting sodium channels, synaptic transmission, and neuroinflammation. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of combining low doses of etanercept and pregabalin in allodynia and nociceptive tests. Materials and Methods: Male C57/BL6 mice underwent chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve to induce neuropathic pain. They were divided into seven groups: sham control, CCI control, low and high doses of pregabalin, low and high doses of etanercept, and a combination of low doses of both drugs. Behavioral tests, including von Frey, hot-plate, and rotarod tests, were used to assess pain responses and motor activity. Results: The results indicated that a high dose of pregabalin significantly reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia but impaired motor function. Conversely, low doses of etanercept alone had no significant effect. However, the combination of low doses of etanercept (20 mg/kg) and pregabalin (5 mg/kg) effectively alleviated pain without compromising locomotor activity. Conclusions: These results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain, enhancing analgesic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Most of the rapid inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is mediated through activation of the &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA) receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel. GABAA receptor activation via GABA binding allows for an intracellular influx of Cl&amp;amp;minus; ions, thus inducing cellular hyperpolarization. Each GABAA receptor consists of a combination of five subunits, and several subunits have been proposed as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. Here, we show the expression of genes encoding &amp;amp;beta; subunits of the GABAA receptor, namely GABRB1, GABRB2, and GABRB3, across the four different molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma (MB), which is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. We also show the associations of GABAA receptor &amp;amp;beta; subunits with MB patients&amp;amp;rsquo; overall survival (OS). Methods: The expression of genes encoding GABAA receptor &amp;amp;beta; subunits was analyzed using a previously described dataset comprising 763 MB tumor samples. Patients were classified into high- and low-gene-expression groups, and the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier estimate was used to examine the relationship between gene expression levels and patient OS. Results: High GABRB1 expression was associated with better OS within each of the four molecular subgroups. The GABRB2 gene showed higher transcript levels in Group 3 MB compared to all other subgroups, and high expression was associated with better prognosis in Group 3 tumors. GABRB3 expression was significantly higher in Group 3 and Group 4 MB, and high expression of GABRB3 genes was associated with longer OS in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup. The high expression of GABRB1, GABRB2, and GABRB3 is associated with longer patient OS in a subgroup-specific manner. Conclusions: These results indicate a role for GABAA receptors containing &amp;amp;beta; subunits in influencing MB progression.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Stroke remains a major cause of disability and death, with survivors facing significant physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges. Rehabilitation is crucial for recovery, but outcomes can vary widely. Cognitive reserve (CR) has emerged as a factor influencing these outcomes. This systematic review evaluates the role of CR in post-stroke rehabilitation, examining whether higher CR is associated with better outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Studies examining social-behavior CR proxies (e.g., education, bilingualism) and their impact on post-stroke outcomes were included. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for NOn-Randomized Studies (MINORS) scale. Results: Among 3851 articles screened, 27 met the inclusion criteria. Higher education levels, bilingualism, and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities were associated with better cognitive outcomes and functional recovery. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) correlated with poorer outcomes. Early rehabilitation and dynamic CR proxies showed stronger associations with cognitive recovery than static ones. Conclusions: CR may predict post-stroke rehabilitation outcomes, with education, bilingualism, and active engagement in cognitive activities showing potential benefits. Future research should explore CR&amp;amp;rsquo;s role alongside factors like lesion location and severity in enhancing recovery.</p>

	<p>Background: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare and frequently misdiagnosed disorder characterized by a low volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by the leakage of CSF through the spinal dural membrane. Patients with Marfan Syndrome (MS) and other connective tissue disorders are at an increased risk for dural ectasia, which may predispose them to spontaneous CSF leaks due to the structural weakness of their dural membranes. The management of SIH in MS patients is debated. Conservative measures, an epidural blood patch (EBP), and surgical treatments are the options generally provided. Methods: Herein, we report on the case of a 52-year-old female affected by MS, genetically confirmed, with a two-month history of sudden-onset, &amp;amp;ldquo;thunderclap&amp;amp;rdquo; headache, worsened in an upright position and horizontal diplopia. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed a bilateral chronic subdural hematoma, slit ventricles, and a caudal descent of the brainstem without overt tonsillar herniation. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the whole spine revealed dural ectasia in the lumbosacral area and presacral perineural cyst without extradural CSF collection. The case was successfully managed with bed rest and high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Then, we discuss the pertinent literature, consisting of 25 papers dealing with the treatment of SIH in patients affected by MS. Results: The literature review yielded 25 papers dealing with SIH management in patients with MS, including 28 patients overall; 21 patients underwent EBP, of whom 7 patients had multiple procedures. Overall, in 23 cases (82%), the symptoms improved. In three cases, the patients were managed conservatively with bed rest. In three of these cases, there was an improvement. In one case, the surgical fenestration of two lumbar intradural spinal meningeal cysts was performed and the patient improved after the procedure. Our patient underwent 15 days of steroid therapy (dexamethasone iv 12 mg/day for 7 days, then reduced to 4 mg/day) and intravenous hydration (Ringer lactate 1500 mL/day). In ten days, the symptoms disappeared. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was in good clinical condition, and a CT scan showed an almost complete regression of the bilateral subdural hematoma. Conclusions: The management of SIH in MS patients is still challenging. Patients with connective tissue disorders such as MS are at an increased risk for SIH. Few studies have assessed the management of these patients and different strategies. Our case and the available literature provide further data for this type of case.</p>

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritus and skin barrier dysfunction. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Pelargonium graveolens (Geraniaceae) in managing AD symptoms through its essential oil. Methods The chemical composition of Pelargonium graveolens flower essential oil (PFEO) was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties were assessed, along with the inhibitory effects of PFEO on key enzymes involved in skin repair: tyrosinase, elastase, and collagenase. An in vivo evaluation of a gel formulation containing PFEO was also conducted to assess its anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Results GC-MS analysis identified major compounds in PFEO, including Geraniol (22.83%), beta-citronellol (19.51%), naphthalenemethanol (15.36%), and Geranyl tiglate (9.38%), with minor constituents such as linalool (3.81%) and neryl formate (1.31%). PFEO exhibited bacteriostatic activity against various bacterial and fungal strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Malassezia spp. The essential oil also demonstrated significant antioxidant properties and inhibited key enzymes linked to skin alterations in AD. Conclusions PFEO shows promising therapeutic potential for managing symptoms of atopic dermatitis due to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its analgesic effects. The findings support further exploration of PFEO as a natural alternative in the treatment of AD.

                Background Cytoscape is an open-source software to visualize and analyze networks. However, large networks, such as protein interaction networks, are still difficult to analyze as a whole. Methods Here, we propose Clust&See3.0, a novel version of a Cytoscape app that has been developed to identify, visualize and manipulate network clusters and modules. It is now enriched with functionalities allowing custom annotations of nodes and computation of their statistical enrichments. Results As the wealth of multi-omics data is growing, such functionalities are highly valuable for a better understanding of biological module composition, as illustrated by the presented use case. Conclusions In summary, the originality of Clust&See3.0 lies in providing users with a complete tool for network clusters analyses: from cluster identification, visualization, node and cluster annotations to annotation statistical analyses.

                Background This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the financial technologies (fintech) era on the performance in the banking sector, measured through non-performing loans (NPL) and their coverage by provisions for NPL. It is a question of knowing whether banking investment in fintech makes it possible to better evaluate the granting of credits, and therefore makes it possible to reduce overdue credits. Methods To this end, the method used consists of using a regression analysis and a Pearson correlation applied to the financial data of Moroccan banks observed during two distinct periods, namely 2007-2014, considered pre-fintech, and the period 2015-2022, considered as the fintech period. Results With the emergence of the fintech era, the Moroccan banking situation improved slightly compared to the pre-fintech period: bad debts did not increase despite the significant increase in net banking income and the size of banking assets during the fintech era. Conclusions The implementation of fintech has improved customer relationship management, credit risk analysis and loan monitoring services, which ultimately reduces non-performing loans and improves the coverage of non-performing loans by provisions. The main implication of the results allows us to deduce that the implementation of fintech makes it possible to have a positive impact on overdue credits, and they are also likely to serve as a lever for the inclusion of those excluded from banking services.

                <p>Visual working memory (VWM) requires precise feature binding. Previous studies have revealed a close relationship between the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and feature binding during VWM; this study further examined their causal relationship through three transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments. In Experiment 1 (<I>N</I> = 57), participants underwent three sessions of tDCS separately, including PPC stimulation, occipital cortex stimulation, and sham stimulation, and completed delayed estimation tasks for orientations before and after stimulation. Results showed that tDCS over PPC selectively prolonged recall response time (RT) and increased the probability of nontarget responses (a.k.a. failure of feature binding, <I>p</I>NT). In Experiment 2 (<I>N</I> = 29), combining metacognition estimation, we further investigated whether the effects of PPC stimulation were attributed to misbinding (i.e., participants self-reported "remembered" in nontarget responses) or informed guessing trials (participants self-reported "forgotten" in nontarget responses). We replicated the main findings in Experiment 1 and observed greater tDCS effects of PPC on RT in informed guessing trials while there are comparable effects on <I>p</I>NT in these two types of trials. In Experiment 3 (<I>N</I> = 28), we then examined whether the tDCS effects over PPC specifically influenced the memory retrieval process by using a change detection task. We found that PPC stimulation did not influence the recognition RT or accuracy. Together, this study provided direct causal evidence supporting the specific involvement of PPC in feature binding during VWM retrieval, from both aspects of speed and response preference, expanding our understanding of the neural basis of feature binding in VWM.</p>

                <p>Neurodevelopmental abnormalities are considered to be one of the important causes of schizophrenia. The offspring of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM)&ndash;exposed mice are recognized for the dysregulation of neurodevelopment and are well-characterized with schizophrenia-like phenotypes. However, the inhibition-related properties of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus throughout adolescence and adulthood have not been systematically elucidated. In this study, both 10 and 15&nbsp;mg/kg MAM-exposed mice exhibited schizophrenia-related phenotypes in both adolescence and adulthood, including spontaneous locomotion hyperactivity and deficits in prepulse inhibition. We observed that there was an obvious parvalbumin (PV) loss in the mPFC and hippocampus of MAM-exposed mice, extending from adolescence to adulthood. Moreover, the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pyramidal neurons at mPFC and hippocampus was significantly dampened in the 10 and 15&nbsp;mg/kg MAM-exposed mice. Furthermore, the firing rate of putative pyramidal neurons in mPFC and hippocampus was increased, while that of putative inhibitory neurons was decreased during both adolescence and adulthood. In conclusion, PV loss in mPFC and hippocampus of MAM-exposed mice may contribute to the impaired inhibitory function leading to the attenuation of inhibition in the brain both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

                Background Sustaining a ‘fit-for-purpose’ health workforce requires a better understanding of the health care worker cadres that are affected during pandemics and their outcomes. In hospitalized health care workers with confirmed COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2023 in Liberia, we determined the hospitalization and case fatality rates, type of health care worker cadres affected, their demographic and clinical characteristics and hospital exit outcomes. Methods This was a cohort study using routine data extracted from hospitalization forms for health care workers in 24 designated COVID-19 treatment facilities. Results Of the 424 health care workers with COVID-19, hospitalization rates progressively declined between 2020 and 2023, (P<0.001) with the highest rates in 2020 (24/1,000 health care workers) and 2021 (14/1,000 health care workers). Case fatality was 2% in both 2020 and 2021 with no deaths thereafter. Among those hospitalized, the highest proportions were nursing cadres with 191(45%), physicians with 63 (15%) and laboratory technicians with 42 (10%). The most frequent reported site for COVID-19 infection was the health facility (326, 89%). COVID-19 vaccination coverage in health care workers was 20%. The majority (91%) of hospitalizations were for mild symptomatic infections. Even in referral centres (n-52), 18 (35%) were for mild infections. Of the 424 who were hospitalized, 412 (97%) recovered, 9 (2%) died and 3 (1%) either left against medical advice or absconded. Of the nine deaths, none were vaccinated, seven had moderate-to-severe disease but were not referred to specialized COVID-19 treatment centers. Conclusions The hospitalized health care workers for COVID-19 were predominantly clinical and laboratory personnel who were mostly unvaccinated, and health facilities were hot-spots for contracting infections. The triage and referral system was weak with unnecessary hospitalization of mild infections. This study provides useful insights for outbreak preparedness including priority vaccination and improving health care worker safety in Liberia.

                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                Background Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common retinal condition with an increased risk of recurrence. Traditional approaches have made choroidal visualization challenging, but recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) innovation have permitted the collection of more accurate choroidal visualizations. This study aimed to measure choroidal thickness in eyes with active CSCR as well as in the unaffected opposite eyes of these same individuals. Methods This research was conducted at the ophthalmology division in Ghazi Al-Hariri Hospital from the 1st of October 2019 until the 31st of March 2020. A total of 49 people, corresponding to 65 eyes, were included in the study. Among these participants, 16 individuals presented with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), affecting a total of 32 eyes. The CSCR individuals were further split into two groups: “Group A” consisted of 20 eyes with active CSCR, and “Group B” encompassed the remaining 12 unaffected opposite eyes. Additionally, the right eyes of 33 individuals who were age and gender-matched served as controls assigned as “Group C”. Results The choroid exhibited a substantial rise in thickness across each of the nine sectors in group A as compared to group C. Similarly, group B showed a significant increase in choroidal thickness in relation to group C. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured as follows: 474.55μm, 437.5μm, and 292.03μm among groups A, B, and C, correspondingly. These differences were identified as clinically significant for both A vs. C and B vs. C. Conclusions This study’s findings indicate a thickening of the choroid in both eyes exhibiting active CSCR, as well as in the unaffected opposite eyes of those with the disease.

                Introduction Low and middle-income countries account for the largest proportion of women’s deaths as a result of pregnancy or childbirth-related complications. The sub-Saharan region is the most affected with approximately 70% (202 000) of maternal deaths between 2000 and 2020. These deaths could have been prevented if expectant mothers were prepared for childbirth. Birth preparedness is perceived as a better strategy that helps attain a substantial reduction in maternal mortality. This is achieved by attending early antenatal classes, receiving skilled care during childbirth, and care and support right after birth. The latest survey on antenatal class attendance conducted in South Africa provides an estimated 30.8% of expectant mothers in public healthcare facilities. Methods This study employed a qualitative approach to collect data, as a result, one focus group discussion with five (N=5) participants and two others with six (N=6) participants each (n=6X2=12) and twenty individual interviews were conducted. The study sought to explore and describe the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals regarding the birth preparedness of women in labour at selected hospitals in Durban KwaZulu-Natal. Results Expectant mothers were unprepared for both labour and postnatal care. The unprepared expectant mothers were uncooperative and made the task of midwives difficult to the extent of endangering the life of their expected newborn babies and their own. Factors such as finance, heterogeneity, staff shortage, language barrier, lack of family support, lack of interest, cultural beliefs, and confusion caused by various sources of information were responsible for birth unpreparedness. Conclusion The synergy between expectant mothers and midwives appears to be an important factor in achieving better birth preparedness.

                Digital and financial literacy are changing the landscape of the globe in terms of its approach to development. These two literacies also help to achieve women’s empowerment and, consequently, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) more quickly. This systematic literature review looks at the two literacies and their effects, focusing on women’s participation and showing how digital literacy not only increases women’s access to knowledge and connectivity but is also a door to women’s entrepreneurship and financial independence. Likewise, financial literacy, when coupled with digital skills, can be a breakthrough to the traditional socioeconomic barrier – poverty – by assisting women in making informed economic decisions, increasing their financial independence and resilience in the face of a global crisis. Empirical realities that still hinder women’s education, such as cultural norms, infrastructural deficiencies and educational gaps, still exist. However, the paper points out that to have a more equal world based on the SDGs, the double literacy strategy for women’s empowerment should not be negotiable.

                Background Studies have shown that perceived self-efficacy can influence teachers’ emotional state, thoughts and behaviours, and students’ learning. It’s also an important referential of professional satisfaction. In turn, teaching methodologies influence motor learning, as well as psychological, cognitive and social learning, with different impacts on human development and learning retention, levels of intrinsic motivation and continuity of practice in order to support a healthy lifestyle. Research on aquatic educators and teaching methodologies is scarce and at the same time necessary according to the view that aquatic literacy is an integral part of physical literacy and the only possibility of being more able to interact with this environment. Methods In this study we used an online questionnaire, aimed at aquatic professionals, which was answered voluntarily and anonymously to measure the prevalence of the use of different teaching methodologies, the comprehensive aquatic method and the perception of teacher self-efficacy. It has been deposited and can be consulted at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27316242.v1. Results All methods can generate a feeling of self-efficacy in teachers despite having different results, with the methodologies that involve students more actively (cognitivist and constructivist) being those that generate a greater feeling of self-efficacy in teachers. MAC is a method that is more closely related to methodologies focused on active student participation and, consequently, it is a method that generates a high perception of self-efficacy in teachers. Conclusions Levels of self-efficacy influence professional satisfaction, teacher physical, mental and emotional health, as well as student learning. Is recommended that aquatic professionals give prevalence to the cognitivist and constructivist teaching methodologies being MAC a privileged methodological approach for promoting active lifestyle habits throughout life.

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentless, fatal neurodegenerative disease. The progressive loss of voluntary muscle function, diagnostic delays, lack of effective treatments, and challenges accessing multidisciplinary care and resources have tremendous impact on quality of life. The congressionally directed ALS committee of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, in their 2024 report “Living with ALS,” recommends critical actions for specific United States stakeholders to make ALS a livable disease over the next decade. This review summarizes the context and recommendations of the report. Advocacy efforts are critical to make these recommendations a reality for the ALS community.

                <p>Slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) indicate a progressive pathological process. Whether SELs are present in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is unknown. We studied 19 children with POMS and 14 with MOGAD (median age 14.3 and 9.4 years, respectively) recruited to the Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study with: (1) ≥3 research scans 12 months apart; and (2) ≥1 T2-lesions on the earliest scan. A total of 70 SELs from 16 POMS participants and 1 SEL in the MOGAD group were detected. SELs are an early feature of POMS and essentially not a feature of MOGAD.

                <p>Cryptogenic new-onset refractory status epilepticus (cNORSE) is a devastating condition with unclear pathogenesis. Here, we analyzed the genetic underprints of 31 cNORSE patients from an autoimmune encephalitis observational cohort through whole-genome sequencing. Compared to their controls, cNORSE patients exhibited elevated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for traits associated with autoimmune diseases. The individual PRS against these diseases were correlated with specific clinical phenotypes of cNORSE. The variants were enriched in genes expressed in the central nervous system and lymphocytes. These results suggest a shared genetic framework between cNORSE and other autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, and its involvement in the disease pathogenesis.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the <i>C9orf72</i> gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A large body of evidence implicates dipeptide repeats (DPRs) proteins as one of the main drivers of neuronal injury in cell and animal models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pure repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD was generated. Embryonic and adult transgenic zebrafish lysates were investigated for the presence of RAN-translated DPR species and adult-onset motor deficits. Using C9orf72 cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish, hypothermic-therapeutic temperature management (TTM) was explored as a potential therapeutic option for C9orf72-ALS/FTD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we describe a pure RAN translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD that exhibits significant RAN-translated DPR pathology and progressive motor decline. We further demonstrate that hypothermic-TTM results in a profound reduction in DPR species in C9orf72-ALS/FTD cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The transgenic model detailed in this paper provides a medium throughput in vivo research tool to further investigate the role of RAN-translation in C9orf72-ALS/FTD and further understand the mechanisms that underpin neuroprotective strategies. Hypothermic-TTM presents a viable therapeutic avenue to explore in the context of C9orf72-ALS/FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1058–1069</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurofilament light chains (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains (pNfH), established as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cohorts, are now surrogate markers in clinical trials. This study extends their evaluation to a population level, with the aim of advancing their full establishment and assessing the transferability of biomarker findings from controlled cohorts to real-world ALS populations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured serum NfL and pNfH levels in all ALS patients (n = 790) and general population controls (n = 570) with available baseline samples participating in the epidemiological ALS Registry Swabia, providing platform-specific (ELLA™) reference data and Z-scores for controls, as well as reference data, disease-specific Z-scores and longitudinal data in ALS. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of neurofilaments and quantified the impact of ALS-related factors and non-ALS confounders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Neurofilaments showed high diagnostic and prognostic utility at the population level, with NfL superior to pNfH. The novel concept of a population-based ALS Z-score significantly improved the prognostic utility compared to absolute raw values. Both biomarkers increased more strongly with age in controls than in ALS, and age adjustment improved diagnostic accuracy. Our data show that disease progression rates, ALS phenotype, body mass index (BMI), and renal function need to be considered when interpreting neurofilament levels; longitudinal neurofilament levels were generally stable in individual patients, especially when adjusted for age and baseline levels.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Population-based assessment enhances the utility of particularly serum NfL as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in ALS and improves the translation of findings from controlled cohorts to real-world populations. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1040–1057</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is the most common neuronal heterotopia, frequently resulting in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Here, we characterize variables that predict good epilepsy outcomes following surgical intervention using stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) -informed magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective review of consecutive cases from a single high-volume epilepsy referral center identified patients who underwent SEEG evaluation for PVNH to characterize the intervention and outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty-nine patients underwent SEEG-guided MRgLITT of the seizure onset zone (SoZ) in PVNH and associated epileptic tissue. PVNH and polymicrogyria (PMG) were densely sampled with a mean of 16.5 (SD = 2)/209.4 (SD = 36.9) SEEG probes/recording contacts per patient. Ablation principally targeted just the PVNH and cortex that was abnormal on imaging was ablated (5 patients) only if implicated in the SoZ. Volumetric analyses revealed a high percentage of PVNH SoZ ablation (96.6%, SD = 5.3%) in unilateral and bilateral (92.9%, SD = 7.2%) cases. Mean follow-up duration was 31.4 months (SD = 20.9). Seizure freedom (ILAE 1) was excellent: unilateral PVNH without other imaging abnormalities, 80%; PVNH with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) or PMG, 63%; bilateral PVNH, 50%. SoZ ablation percentage significantly impacted surgical outcomes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PVNH plays a central role in seizure genesis as revealed by dense recordings and selective targeting by LITT. MRgLITT represents a transformative technological advance in PVNH-associated epilepsy with seizure control outcomes consistent with those seen in focal lesional epilepsies. In localized unilateral cases and otherwise normal imaging, PVNH ablation without invasive recordings may be considered, and this approach deserves to be explored further.

<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B due to GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (<i>FGF14</i>) gene has recently been recognized as a common cause of late-onset hereditary cerebellar ataxia. Here we present the first report of this disease in the US population, characterizing its clinical manifestations, disease progression, pathological abnormalities, and response to 4-aminopyridine in a cohort of 102 patients bearing GAA repeat expansions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compiled a series of patients with SCA27B, recruited from 5 academic centers across the United States. Clinical manifestations and patient demographics were collected retrospectively from clinical records in an unblinded approach using a standardized form. Post-mortem analysis was done on 4 brains of patients with genetically confirmed SCA27B.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In our cohort of 102 patients with SCA27B, we found that SCA27B was a late-onset (57 ± 12.5 years) slowly progressive ataxia with an episodic component in 51% of patients. Balance and gait impairment were almost always present at disease onset. The principal finding on post-mortem examination of 4 brain specimens was loss of Purkinje neurons that was most severe in the vermis most particularly in the anterior vermis. Similar to European populations, a high percent of patients 21/28 (75%) reported a positive treatment response with 4-aminopyridine.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further estimates prevalence and further expands the clinical, imaging and pathological features of SCA27B, while looking at treatment response, disease progression, and survival in patients with this disease. Testing for SCA27B should be considered in all undiagnosed ataxia patients, especially those with episodic onset. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1092–1103</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether arterial spin labeling perfusion images of healthy controls can enhance ictal single-photon emission computed tomography analysis and whether the acquisition of the interictal image can be omitted.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed 2 pipelines: The first uses ictal and interictal images and compares these to single-photon emission computed tomography and arterial spin labeling of healthy controls. The second pipeline uses only the ictal image and the analogous healthy controls. Both pipelines were compared to the gold standard analysis and evaluated on data of individuals with epilepsy who underwent ictal single-photon emission computed tomography imaging during presurgical evaluation between 2010 and 2022. Fifty healthy controls prospectively underwent arterial spin labeling imaging. The correspondence between the detected hyperperfusion and the postoperative resection cavity or the presumably affected lobe was assessed using Dice score and mean Euclidean distance. Additionally, the outcomes of the pipelines were automatically assigned to 1 of 5 concordance categories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria were met by 43 individuals who underwent epilepsy surgery and by 73 non-surgical individuals with epilepsy. Compared to the gold standard analysis, both pipelines resulted in significantly higher Dice scores and lower mean distances (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The combination of both provided localizing results in 85/116 cases, compared to 54/116 generated by the current gold standard analysis and the ictal image alone produced localizing results in 60/116 (52%) cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose a new ictal single-photon emission computed tomography protocol; it finds relevantly more ictal hyperperfusion, and halves the radiation dose in about half of the individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1160–1173</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The transcriptional heterogeneity at a single-nucleus level in human Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) dystrophic muscle has not been explored. Here, we aimed to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity associated with myonuclei, as well as other mononucleated cell types that underly BMD pathogenesis by performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We profiled single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of skeletal muscle samples from 7 BMD patients and 3 normal controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 17,216 nuclei (12,879 from BMD patients and 4,337 from controls) were classified into 13 known cell types, including 9 myogenic lineages and 4 non-myogenic lineages, and 1 unclassified nuclear type according to their cell identities. Among them, type IIx myonuclei were the first to degenerate in response to dystrophin reduction. Differential expression analysis revealed that the fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) population had the largest transcriptional changes among all cell types. Sub-clustering analysis identified a significantly compositional increase in the activated FAPs (aFAPs) subpopulation in BMD muscles. Pseudotime analysis, regulon inference, and deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data derived from 29 BMD patients revealed that the aFAPs subpopulation, a distinctive and previously unrecognized mononuclear subtype, was profibrogenic and expanded in BMD patients. Muscle quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of the aFAPs markers including <i>LUM</i>, <i>DCN</i>, and <i>COL1A1</i> in BMD patients were significantly higher than those in controls, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide insights into the transcriptional diversity of human BMD muscle at a single-nucleus resolution and new potential targets for anti-fibrosis therapies in BMD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1070–1085</p>

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion/deletions syndrome (MDDS) comprises a group of diseases caused by primary autosomal defects of mtDNA maintenance. Our objective was to study the etiology of MDDS in 4 patients who lack pathogenic variants in known genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing of the probands was performed to identify pathogenic variants. We validated the mitochondrial defect by analyzing mtDNA, mitochondrial dNTP pools, respiratory chain activities, and GUK1 activity. To confirm pathogenicity of GUK1 deficiency, we expressed 2 GUK1 isoforms in patient cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified biallelic <i>GUK1</i> pathogenic variants in all 4 probands who presented with ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and myopathic proximal limb weakness, as well as variable hepatopathy and altered T-lymphocyte profiles. Muscle biopsies from all probands showed mtDNA depletion, deletions, or both, as well as reduced activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. <i>GUK1</i> encodes guanylate kinase, originally identified as a cytosolic enzyme. Long and short isoforms of GUK1 exist. We observed that the long isoform is intramitochondrial and the short is cytosolic. In probands’ fibroblasts, we noted decreased GUK1 activity causing unbalanced mitochondrial dNTP pools and mtDNA depletion in both replicating and quiescent fibroblasts indicating that GUK1 deficiency impairs de novo and salvage nucleotide pathways. Proband fibroblasts treated with deoxyguanosine and/or forodesine, a purine phosphatase inhibitor, ameliorated mtDNA depletion, indicating potential pharmacological therapies.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Primary GUK1 deficiency is a new and potentially treatable cause of MDDS. The cytosolic isoform of GUK1 may contribute to the T-lymphocyte abnormality, which has not been observed in other MDDS disorders. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1209–1224</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study examines associations among fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) injury patterns, etiologies, and outcomes in fetal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study of IPH diagnosed on fetal MRI (1996–2022). IPH and associated abnormalities were categorized by 2 pediatric neuroradiologists; electronic medical records were reviewed by 2 pediatric neurologists to classify etiology and outcomes including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, developmental delay, and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-four fetuses with IPH were identified (34 singleton and 10 twin gestations) with MRI at median 24 weeks gestation (interquartile range [IQR] = 22–28 weeks). IPH was commonly supratentorial (84%) and focal (50%) or focal with diffuse injury (43%) and was often associated with germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH; 75%) and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 52%). An etiology was identified in 75%, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS, n = 10), COL4A1/2 variants (n = 8), or other fetal/maternal conditions (n = 15). COL4A1/2 variants were associated with focal IPH and the presence of hemorrhagic porencephaly, and intrauterine transfusion was associated with infratentorial hemorrhage. Twenty-two fetuses were liveborn, and 18 pregnancies were terminated. Among those with follow-up ≥ 12 months (median = 7 years), 12 of 13 had cerebral palsy, 6 of 13 had developmental delay, and 5 of 13 had epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>An etiology for fetal IPH with or without GMH-IVH is identified in most cases in our cohort and is commonly TTTS, COL4A1/2 variants, or other maternal/fetal comorbidities. Pattern of fetal IPH on MRI is associated with etiology. Cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental impairment were common in liveborn infants. Genetic studies should be considered in cases of fetal IPH without an otherwise apparent cause. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1137–1147</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27073?af=R">Comparison of Perfusion Imaging Definitions of the No‐Reflow Phenomenon after Thrombectomy—What Is the Best Perfusion Imaging Definition?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The no-reflow phenomenon is a potential contributor to poor outcome despite successful thrombectomy. There are multiple proposed imaging-based definitions of no-reflow leading to wide variations in reported prevalence. We investigated the agreement between existing imaging definitions and compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients identified as having no-reflow.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an external validation of 4 existing published definitions of no-reflow in thrombectomy patients with extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale 2c to 3 (eTICI2c-3) angiographic reperfusion who underwent 24-hour perfusion imaging from 2 international randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA TNK part-1 and 2) and a multicenter prospective observational study. Receiver-operating-characteristic and Bayesian-information-criterion (BIC) analyses were performed with the outcome variable being dependent-or-dead at 90-days (modified Rankin Score [mRS] ≥3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 131 patients analyzed, the prevalence of no-reflow significantly varied between definitions (0.8–22.1%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was poor agreement between definitions (kappa 5/6 comparisons &lt;0.212). Among patients with no-reflow according to at least 1 definition, there were significant differences between definitions in the intralesional interside differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF) (<i>p</i> = 0.006), cerebral blood volume (CBV) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and mean-transit-time (MTT) (<i>p</i> = 0.005). No-reflow defined by 3 definitions was associated with mRS ≥3 at 90 days. The definition of &gt;15% CBV or CBF asymmetry was the only definition that improved model fit on BIC analysis (ΔBIC = −8.105) and demonstrated an association between no-reflow and clinical outcome among patients with eTICI3 reperfusion.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Existing imaging definitions of no-reflow varied significantly in prevalence and post-treatment perfusion imaging profile, potentially explaining the variable prevalence of no-reflow reported in literature. The definition of &gt;15% CBV or CBF asymmetry best discriminated for functional outcome at 90 days, including patients with eTICI3 reperfusion. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1104–1114</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitochondria are implicated in regulation of the innate immune response. We hypothesized that abnormalities in interferon signaling may contribute to pathophysiology in patients with primary mitochondrial disease (PMD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in whole blood samples from a cohort of patients with PMD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Upregulated ISG expression was observed in a high proportion (41/55, 75%) of patients with PMD on at least 1 occasion, most frequently <i>IFI27</i> upregulation, seen in 50% of the samples. Some patients had extremely high <i>IFI27</i> levels, similar to those seen in patients with primary interferonopathies. A statistically significant correlation was observed between elevated <i>IFI27</i> gene expression and PMD, but not between <i>IFI27</i> and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that ISG upregulation is a biomarker of PMD. In some patients with PMD, ISG abnormalities persisted on repeat measurement over several years, indicative of ongoing chronic inflammation. Subgroup analyses suggested common ISG signatures in patients with similar mitochondrial disease mechanisms and positive correlations with disease severity among patients with identical genetic diagnoses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Dysregulated interferon signaling is frequently seen in patients with PMD suggesting that interferon dysregulation is a contributor to pathophysiology. This may indicate a role for repurposing of immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of PMDs by targeting interferon signaling. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1185–1200</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To determine the prevalence and distribution of intracranial vessel occlusion identified on computed tomography (CT) or magnet resonance (MR) angiography and to explore its association with functional outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive patients with AF with imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent CT- or MR-angiography on admission (2014–2022). Multivariable regression was used to explore the association between intracranial vessel occlusion and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3–6) at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 10,164 patients (median age 81.5 years, 47.8% female, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission 6; 14.7% on a vitamin K antagonist [VKA], 27.5% on a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC], 57.8% not receiving oral anticoagulation). Angiography showed intracranial vessel occlusion in 5,190 patients (51.1%), affecting the anterior cerebral circulation in 87.4%. Overall, 29.2% and 29.4% of patients received thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, respectively. The proportion of patients with poor functional outcome at 90 days was 60.6% and 42.7% in those with and without vessel occlusion, respectively. In multivariable analyses, vessel occlusion was associated with poor functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71–2.22) with consistent results in subgroups according to oral anticoagulation use (VKA, aOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.40–2.80; DOAC, aOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.83–3.03; none, aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.49–2.09).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Intracranial vessel occlusion is common in patients with AF with ischemic stroke, mainly affects the anterior circulation and is associated with poor functional outcome. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1115–1123</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sex differences in the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the incident all-cause dementia and the subtype Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk are unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants (n = 4,171, 54% women, aged 55 to 69 years) were included at baseline and followed up to 40 years. The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) was dichotomized into 2 levels (cutoff: 75th percentile of the FSRP z-scores). Cause-specific hazard models, with death as a competing event, and restricted mean survival time (RMST) model were used to analyze the association between FSRP levels and incident all-cause dementia and AD. Interactions between FSRP and sex were estimated, followed by a sex-stratified analysis to examine the sex modification effect.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>High FSRP was significantly associated with all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.25, robust 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21 to 1.29, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) and AD (HR = 1.58, robust 95% CI = 1.57 to 1.59, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) in cause-specific hazard models. High FSRP was significantly associated with incident dementia (HR = 2.81, robust 95% CI = 2.75 to 2.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and AD (HR = 2.96, robust 95% CI = 2.36 to 3.71, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in women, but not in men. Results were consistent in the RMST models. Current diabetes and high systolic blood pressure as FSRP components were significantly associated with dementia and AD in women but not in men.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>High FSRP in mid- to early late life is a critical risk factor for all-cause dementia and AD, particularly in women. Sex-specific interventions and further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms are warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1124–1134</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27078?af=R">Pro‐Ictal EEG Scheduling Improves the Yield of Epilepsy Monitoring: Validating the Use of Multiday Seizure Cycles to Optimize Video‐EEG Timing</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A significant challenge of video-electroencephalography (vEEG) in epilepsy diagnosis is timing monitoring sessions to capture epileptiform activity. In this study, we introduce and validate “pro-ictal EEG scheduling”, a method to schedule vEEG monitoring to coincide with periods of increased seizure likelihood as a low-risk approach to enhance the diagnostic yield.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A database of long-term ambulatory vEEG monitoring sessions (n = 5,038) of adults and children was examined. Data from linked electronic seizure diaries were extracted (minimum 10 self-reported events) to generate cycle-based estimates of seizure risk. In adults, vEEG monitoring sessions coinciding with periods of estimated high-risk were allocated to the high-risk group (n = 305) and compared to remaining studies (baseline: n = 3,586). Test of proportions and risk-ratios (RR) were applied to index differences in proportions and likelihood of capturing outcome measures (abnormal report, confirmed seizure, and diary event) during monitoring. The impact of clinical and demographic factors (age, sex, epilepsy-type, and medication) was also explored.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During vEEG monitoring, the high-risk group was significantly more likely to have an abnormal vEEG report (190/305:62% vs 1,790/3,586:50% [%change = 12%], RR = 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.137–1.370], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), present with a confirmed seizure (56/305:18% vs 424/3,586:11% [%change = 7%], RR = 1.63, 95% CI = [1.265–2.101], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and report an event (153/305:50% vs 1,267/3,586:35% (%change = 15%), RR = 1.420, 95% CI = [1.259:1.602], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Similar effects were observed across clinical and demographic features.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides the first large-scale validation of pro-ictal EEG scheduling in improving the yield of vEEG. This innovative approach offers a pragmatic and low-risk strategy to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of vEEG monitoring, significantly impacting epilepsy management.

                <p>by Lin Lin, Rachel L. Spreng, Kelly E. Seaton, S. Moses Dennison, Lindsay C. Dahora, Daniel J. Schuster, Sheetal Sawant, Peter B. Gilbert, Youyi Fong, Neville Kisalu, Andrew J. Pollard, Georgia D. Tomaras, Jia Li</p>

Despite significant progress in vaccine research, the level of protection provided by vaccination can vary significantly across individuals. As a result, understanding immunologic variation across individuals in response to vaccination is important for developing next-generation efficacious vaccines. Accurate outcome prediction and identification of predictive biomarkers would represent a significant step towards this goal. Moreover, in early phase vaccine clinical trials, small datasets are prevalent, raising the need and challenge of building a robust and explainable prediction model that can reveal heterogeneity in small datasets. We propose a new model named Generative Mixture of Logistic Regression (GeM-LR), which combines characteristics of both a generative and a discriminative model. In addition, we propose a set of model selection strategies to enhance the robustness and interpretability of the model. GeM-LR extends a linear classifier to a non-linear classifier without losing interpretability and empowers the notion of predictive clustering for characterizing data heterogeneity in connection with the outcome variable. We demonstrate the strengths and utility of GeM-LR by applying it to data from several studies. GeM-LR achieves better prediction results than other popular methods while providing interpretations at different levels.

                <p>by Medha Shekhar, Dobromir Rahnev</p>

Prior research has shown that manipulating stimulus energy by changing both stimulus contrast and variability results in confidence-accuracy dissociations in humans. Specifically, even when performance is matched, higher stimulus energy leads to higher confidence. The most common explanation for this effect, derived from cognitive modeling, is the positive evidence heuristic where confidence neglects evidence that disconfirms the choice. However, an alternative explanation is the signal-and-variance-increase hypothesis, according to which these dissociations arise from changes in the separation and variance of perceptual representations. Because artificial neural networks lack built-in confidence heuristics, they can serve as a test for the necessity of confidence heuristics in explaining confidence-accuracy dissociations. Therefore, we tested whether confidence-accuracy dissociations induced by stimulus energy manipulations emerge naturally in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We found that, across three different energy manipulations, CNNs produced confidence-accuracy dissociations similar to those found in humans. This effect was present for a range of CNN architectures from shallow 4-layer networks to very deep ones, such as VGG-19 and ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet. Further, we traced back the reason for the confidence-accuracy dissociations in all CNNs to the same signal-and-variance increase that has been proposed for humans: higher stimulus energy increased the separation and variance of evidence distributions in the CNNs’ output layer leading to higher confidence even for matched accuracy. These findings cast doubt on the necessity of the positive evidence heuristic to explain human confidence and establish CNNs as promising models for testing cognitive theories of human behavior.

                <p>by Michael Alexander Ramirez Sierra, Thomas R. Sokolowski</p>

Understanding how multicellular organisms reliably orchestrate cell-fate decisions is a central challenge in developmental biology, particularly in early mammalian development, where tissue-level differentiation arises from seemingly cell-autonomous mechanisms. In this study, we present a multi-scale, spatial-stochastic simulation framework for mouse embryogenesis, focusing on inner cell mass (ICM) differentiation into epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PRE) at the blastocyst stage. Our framework models key regulatory and tissue-scale interactions in a biophysically realistic fashion, capturing the inherent stochasticity of intracellular gene expression and intercellular signaling, while efficiently simulating these processes by advancing event-driven simulation techniques. Leveraging the power of Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) through the AI-driven Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) algorithm, we conduct a large-scale Bayesian inferential analysis to identify parameter sets that faithfully reproduce experimentally observed features of ICM specification. Our results reveal mechanistic insights into how the combined action of autocrine and paracrine FGF4 signaling coordinates stochastic gene expression at the cellular scale to achieve robust and reproducible ICM patterning at the tissue scale. We further demonstrate that the ICM exhibits a specific time window of sensitivity to exogenous FGF4, enabling lineage proportions to be adjusted based on timing and dosage, thereby extending current experimental findings and providing quantitative predictions for both mutant and wild-type ICM systems. Notably, FGF4 signaling not only ensures correct EPI-PRE lineage proportions but also enhances ICM resilience to perturbations, reducing fate-proportioning errors by 10-20% compared to a purely cell-autonomous system. Additionally, we uncover a surprising role for variability in intracellular initial conditions, showing that high gene-expression heterogeneity can improve both the accuracy and precision of cell-fate proportioning, which remains robust when fewer than 25% of the ICM population experiences perturbed initial conditions. Our work offers a comprehensive, spatial-stochastic description of the biochemical processes driving ICM differentiation and identifies the necessary conditions for its robust unfolding. It also provides a framework for future exploration of similar spatial-stochastic systems in developmental biology.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002877">Decrease in decision noise from adolescence into adulthood mediates an increase in more sophisticated choice behaviors and performance gain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vanessa Scholz, Maria Waltmann, Nadine Herzog, Annette Horstmann, Lorenz Deserno</p>

Learning and decision-making undergo substantial developmental changes, with adolescence being a particular vulnerable window of opportunity. In adolescents, developmental changes in specific choice behaviors have been observed (e.g., goal-directed behavior, motivational influences over choice). Elevated levels of decision noise, i.e., choosing suboptimal options, were reported consistently in adolescents. However, it remains unknown whether these observations, the development of specific and more sophisticated choice processes and higher decision noise, are independent or related. It is conceivable, but has not yet been investigated, that the development of specific choice processes might be impacted by age-dependent changes in decision noise. To answer this, we examined 93 participants (12 to 42 years) who completed 3 reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: a motivational Go/NoGo task assessing motivational influences over choices, a reversal learning task capturing adaptive decision-making in response to environmental changes, and a sequential choice task measuring goal-directed behavior. This allowed testing of (1) cross-task generalization of computational parameters focusing on decision noise; and (2) assessment of mediation effects of noise on specific choice behaviors. Firstly, we found only noise levels to be strongly correlated across RL tasks. Second, and critically, noise levels mediated age-dependent increases in more sophisticated choice behaviors and performance gain. Our findings provide novel insights into the computational processes underlying developmental changes in decision-making: namely a vital role of seemingly unspecific changes in noise in the specific development of more complex choice components. Studying the neurocomputational mechanisms of how varying levels of noise impact distinct aspects of learning and decision processes may also be key to better understand the developmental onset of psychiatric diseases.

                <p>by Michael Chimento, Gustavo Alarcón-Nieto, Lucy M. Aplin</p>

Longstanding theory predicts that strategic flexibility in when and how to use social information can help individuals make adaptive decisions, especially when environments are temporally or spatially variable. A short-term increase in reliance on social information under these conditions has been experimentally shown in primates, including humans, but whether this occurs in other taxa is unknown. We asked whether migration between spatially variable environments affected social information use with a large-scale cultural diffusion experiment with wild great tits (<i>Parus major</i>) in captivity, a small passerine bird that can socially learn novel behaviors. We simulated an immigration event where knowledgeable birds were exchanged between groups with opposing preferences for a socially learned foraging puzzle, living in similar or different environments. We found evidence that both immigrants and residents were influenced by social information and attended to the rewards that others received. Our analysis supported the use of a payoff-biased social learning by immigrants when both resources and habitat features were spatially variable. In contrast, immigrants relied more-so on individual learning when payoffs or the environment were unchanged. In summary, our results suggest that great tits assess the payoffs others receive and are more influenced by socially observed differences in payoffs when environmental cues differ in their new environment. Our results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that spatial variability is a strong driver for the evolution of social learning strategies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Subclinical vascular brain injury is an increasingly recognized risk factor for stroke and dementia. Despite well-established sex differences in vascular risk and disease prevalence, the impact of sex on drivers of subclinical vascular brain injury remains unclear, presenting a barrier to developing sex-specific prevention guidelines. We aimed to establish the extent to which sex moderates associations between vascular risk factors and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of subclinical brain injury in stroke-free older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We leveraged cross-sectional data from 1,579 stroke- and dementia-free Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants at exam 8 (age 65.7 ± 8.8 years, 53% women). Vascular risks were assessed using components of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). White matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), total cerebral brain volume (TBV), and covert brain infarcts were quantified using MRI. We examined whether vascular risk factors were associated with MRI measures across the combined cohort, and then determined whether sex modified these associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher FSRP and specifically systolic blood pressure (SBP) were associated with greater WMH. These associations were stronger in women and remained after adjusting for menopause age and hormone therapy use. By contrast, diabetes and lower DBP were associated with smaller TBV primarily in men. The DBP-atrophy relationship was only observed in men with declining DBP or prior hypertension.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight differential vulnerability to the impact of vascular risk factors on white matter health in women and global atrophy in men, supporting the development of sex-specific guidelines to better preserve vascular brain health in aging. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which capture patients' perspectives on the consequences of health and disease, are widely used in neurological care and research. However, it is unclear how PROMs relate to performance-rated impairments. Sociodemographic factors are known to affect PROMs. Direct damage to brain regions critical for self-awareness (i.e., parietal regions and the salience/ventral-attention network) may also impair self-report outcomes. This study examined the relationship between PROMs and performance-based measures in stroke survivors with arm motor impairments. We hypothesized that PROMs would be distinct from performance-based outcomes, influenced by sociodemographic factors, and linked to damage in brain circuits involved in self-perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed 54 stroke survivors using patient-reported and performance-rated measures at 4 timepoints. We used factor analysis to reveal the outcome battery's factorial structure. Linear regression examined the association between classes of measures and sociodemographics. Voxel-lesion-symptom-mapping, region-of-interest-based analysis, and voxel-lesion-network-mapping investigated the relationship between classes of outcomes and stroke-related injury.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Performance-based and patient-reported measures formed distinct factors, consistent across recovery phases. Higher education (β1 = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and income adequacy (β2 = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.05) were associated with patient-reported, but not performance-rated outcomes. Greater parietal lobe injury, irrespective of hemisphere, was associated with worse patient-reported outcomes; greater corticospinal tract injury related to worse performance-rated outcomes. Lesions with greater functional connectivity to the salience/ventral-attention network were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (<i>r</i> = −0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings reveal important differences between performance-rated and patient-reported outcomes, each with specific associated factors and anatomy post-stroke.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1362/v1?src=rss">The Demographic Profile of Colorectal Cancer Patients in Indonesia: Insights from a Single Center Experience and Exploration of Immune Response and Survival Outcomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Understanding the demographics, tumor characteristics, genetic mutations, and immune scores in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients may aid in tailoring treatment and predicting survival. Methods This retrospective cohort study assessed clinical parameters, immune scores, and their relationship with survival in patients with CRC. Results The study included 74 patients, mean age 53.7 years, mostly male (53.3%) and aged 41-70 (77.3%). Common comorbidities included cardiovascular diseases (29.3%) and hypertension (21.3%). Adenocarcinoma (74%) primarily affects the colon (73%). KRAS mutations and Microsatellite instability-High (MSI-H)/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) were found in 1.3% and 16% of patients, respectively. Stage IV (77.3%) and liver metastases (52.7%) were prevalent. Immune score was influenced by cancer stage (p = 0.04) and metastasis (p=0.05). The immune score was not associated with survival (p = 0.181). Patients with comorbidities had lower one- (p = 0.027) and two-year survival rates (p = 0.037) survival rates. Cardiovascular comorbidities negatively impacted one-year survival (p = 0.047) and two-year survival (p = 0.037). The mean survival time was shorter for males (2.047±0.288 vs. 2.781±0.195 years, p = 0.041), patients with comorbidities (1.772±0.371 vs. 2.702±0.188 years, p = 0.017), and cardiovascular comorbidities (1.558±0.316 vs. 2.685±0.207 years, p = 0.038). Comorbidities (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.948, p = 0.023) and cardiovascular comorbidities (unadjusted HR 2.695, p = 0.046) were initially associated with survival but lost significance after adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusions This study provides insights into CRC patient demographics and their interplay with the immune score and survival.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Harvey Jules Karten passed away on July 15, 2024. With his passing, the world lost a remarkable and energetic man who had made major contributions to neuroscience, in particular, resetting our understanding of the evolution of the forebrain and the evolution of intelligence. He left behind a legion of loyal colleagues with whom he had collaborated and shared ideas, students he had inspired and trained, and non-neuroscientist friends he had made in the passionate pursuit of his hobbies—sailing, skiing, and hiking.</p>

                The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial-prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) play a key role in decision-making and encode task states in addition to expected value. We review evidence suggesting a connection between value and state representations and argue that OFC / vmPFC integrate stimulus, context, and outcome information. Comparable encoding principles emerge in late layers of deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, where single nodes exhibit similar forms of mixed-selectivity, which enables flexible readout of relevant variables by downstream neurons. Based on these lines of evidence, we suggest that outcome-maximization leads to complex representational spaces that are insufficiently characterized by linear value signals that have been the focus of most prior research on the topic. Major outstanding questions concern the role of OFC/ vmPFC in learning across tasks, in encoding of task-irrelevant aspects, and the role of hippocampus–PFC interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93428">Structure of scavenger receptor SCARF1 and its interaction with lipoproteins</a></h4>

              
                SCARF1 (scavenger receptor class F member 1, SREC-1 or SR-F1) is a type I transmembrane protein that recognizes multiple endogenous and exogenous ligands such as modified low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and is important for maintaining homeostasis and immunity. But the structural information and the mechanisms of ligand recognition of SCARF1 are largely unavailable. Here, we solve the crystal structures of the N-terminal fragments of human SCARF1, which show that SCARF1 forms homodimers and its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains adopt a long-curved conformation. Then, we examine the interactions of SCARF1 with lipoproteins and are able to identify a region on SCARF1 for recognizing modified LDLs. The mutagenesis data show that the positively charged residues in the region are crucial for the interaction of SCARF1 with modified LDLs, which is confirmed by making chimeric molecules of SCARF1 and SCARF2. In addition, teichoic acids, a cell wall polymer expressed on the surface of gram-positive bacteria, are able to inhibit the interactions of modified LDLs with SCARF1, suggesting the ligand binding sites of SCARF1 might be shared for some of its scavenging targets. Overall, these results provide mechanistic insights into SCARF1 and its interactions with the ligands, which are important for understanding its physiological roles in homeostasis and the related diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93242">An antimicrobial drug recommender system using MALDI-TOF MS and dual-branch neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Timely and effective use of antimicrobial drugs can improve patient outcomes, as well as help safeguard against resistance development. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is currently routinely used in clinical diagnostics for rapid species identification. Mining additional data from said spectra in the form of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles is, therefore, highly promising. Such AMR profiles could serve as a drop-in solution for drastically improving treatment efficiency, effectiveness, and costs. This study endeavors to develop the first machine learning models capable of predicting AMR profiles for the whole repertoire of species and drugs encountered in clinical microbiology. The resulting models can be interpreted as drug recommender systems for infectious diseases. We find that our dual-branch method delivers considerably higher performance compared to previous approaches. In addition, experiments show that the models can be efficiently fine-tuned to data from other clinical laboratories. MALDI-TOF-based AMR recommender systems can, hence, greatly extend the value of MALDI-TOF MS for clinical diagnostics. All code supporting this study is distributed on PyPI and is packaged at https://github.com/gdewael/maldi-nn.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99809">Isobaric crosslinking mass spectrometry technology for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and complexes</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes play a central and ubiquitous role in the regulation of protein function, yet it is very challenging to study these changes, especially for large protein complexes, under physiological conditions. Here, we introduce a novel isobaric crosslinker, Qlinker, for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes using quantitative crosslinking mass spectrometry. Qlinkers are small and simple, amine-reactive molecules with an optimal extended distance of ~10 Å, which use MS2 reporter ions for relative quantification of Qlinker-modified peptides derived from different samples. We synthesized the 2-plex Q2linker and showed that the Q2linker can provide quantitative crosslinking data that pinpoints key conformational and structural changes in biosensors, binary and ternary complexes composed of the general transcription factors TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92025">Proteomic and functional comparison between human induced and embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have great potential to be used as alternatives to embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine and disease modelling. In this study, we characterise the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from independent donors and find that while they express a near-identical set of proteins, they show consistent quantitative differences in the abundance of a subset of proteins. hiPSCs have increased total protein content, while maintaining a comparable cell cycle profile to hESCs, with increased abundance of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins required to sustain high growth rates, including nutrient transporters and metabolic proteins. Prominent changes detected in proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism correlated with enhanced mitochondrial potential, shown using high-resolution respirometry. hiPSCs also produced higher levels of secreted proteins, including growth factors and proteins involved in the inhibition of the immune system. The data indicate that reprogramming of fibroblasts to hiPSCs produces important differences in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins compared to hESCs, with consequences affecting growth and metabolism. This study improves our understanding of the molecular differences between hiPSCs and hESCs, with implications for potential risks and benefits for their use in future disease modelling and therapeutic applications.
