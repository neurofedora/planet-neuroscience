                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Studies in animals have demonstrated a strong relationship between cortical and hippocampal activity, and autonomic tone. However, the extent, distribution, and nature of this relationship have not been investigated with intracranial recordings in humans during sleep. Cortical and hippocampal population neuronal firing was estimated from high  band activity (HG) from 70 to 110 Hz in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from 15 subjects (nine females) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Autonomic tone was estimated from heart rate variability (HRV). HG and HRV were significantly correlated in the hippocampus and multiple cortical sites in NREM stages N1&ndash;N3. The average correlation between HG and HRV could be positive or negative across patients given anatomic location and sleep stage and was most profound in lateral temporal lobe in N3, suggestive of greater cortical activity associated with sympathetic tone. Patient-wide correlation was related to  band activity (1&ndash;4 Hz), which is known to be correlated with high  activity during sleep. The percentage of statistically correlated channels was weaker in N1 and N2 as compared with N3, and was strongest in regions that have previously been associated with autonomic processes, such as anterior hippocampus and insula. The anatomic distribution of HRV-HG correlations during sleep did not reproduce those usually observed with positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during waking. This study aims to characterize the relationship between autonomic tone and neuronal firing rate during sleep and further studies are needed to investigate finer temporal resolutions, denser coverages, and different frequency bands in both waking and sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sharing Happy Stories Increases Interpersonal Closeness: Interpersonal Brain Synchronization as a Neural Indicator</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Our lives revolve around sharing emotional stories (i.e., happy and sad stories) with other people. Such emotional communication enhances the similarity of story comprehension and neural across speaker-listener pairs. The theory of Emotions as Social Information Model (EASI) suggests that such emotional communication may influence interpersonal closeness. However, few studies have examined speaker-listener interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) during emotional communication and whether it is associated with meaningful aspects of the speaker-listener interpersonal relationship. Here, one speaker watched emotional videos and communicated the content of the videos to 32 people as listeners (happy/sad/neutral group). Both speaker and listeners&rsquo; neural activities were recorded using EEG. After listening, we assessed the interpersonal closeness between the speaker and listeners. Compared with the sad group, sharing happy stories showed a better recall quality and a higher rating of interpersonal closeness. The happy group showed higher IBS in the frontal cortex and left temporoparietal cortex than the sad group. The relationship between frontal IBS and interpersonal closeness was moderated by sharing happy/sad stories. Exploratory analysis using support vector regression (SVR) showed that the IBS could also predict the ratings of interpersonal closeness. These results suggest that frontal IBS could serve as an indicator of whether sharing emotional stories facilitate interpersonal closeness. These findings improve our understanding of emotional communication among individuals that guides behaviors during interpersonal interactions.</p>

                <p>by Diego Barra Avila, Juan R. Melendez-Alvarez, Xiao-Jun Tian</p>

The Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway plays a critical role in tissue homeostasis, tumorigenesis, and degeneration disorders. The regulation of YAP/TAZ levels is controlled by a complex regulatory network, where several feedback loops have been identified. However, it remains elusive how these feedback loops contain the YAP/TAZ levels and maintain the system in a healthy physiological state or trap the system in pathological conditions. Here, a mathematical model was developed to represent the YAP/TAZ regulatory network. Through theoretical analyses, three distinct states that designate the one physiological and two pathological outcomes were found. The transition from the physiological state to the two pathological states is mechanistically controlled by coupled bidirectional bistable switches, which are robust to parametric variation and stochastic fluctuations at the molecular level. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the regulation and dysregulation of YAP/TAZ levels in tissue state transitions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Attractive internuclear force drives the collective behavior of nuclear arrays in Drosophila embryos</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiaoxuan Wu, Kakit Kong, Wenlei Xiao, Feng Liu</p>

The collective behavior of the nuclear array in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos during nuclear cycle (NC) 11 to NC14 is crucial in controlling cell size, establishing developmental patterns, and coordinating morphogenesis. After live imaging on <i>Drosophila</i> embryos with light sheet microscopy, we extract the nuclear trajectory, speed, and internuclear distance with an automatic nuclear tracing method. We find that the nuclear speed shows a period of standing waves along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis after each metaphase as the nuclei collectively migrate towards the embryo poles and partially move back. And the maximum nuclear speed dampens by 28%-45% in the second half of the standing wave. Moreover, the nuclear density is 22–42% lower in the pole region than the middle of the embryo during the interphase of NC12-NC14. To find mechanical rules controlling the collective motion and packing patterns of the nuclear array, we use a deep neural network (DNN) to learn the underlying force field from data. We apply the learned spatiotemporal attractive force field in the simulations with a particle-based model. And the simulations recapitulate nearly all the observed characteristic collective behaviors of nuclear arrays in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discriminative feature of cells characterizes cell populations of interest by a small subset of genes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takeru Fujii, Kazumitsu Maehara, Masatoshi Fujita, Yasuyuki Ohkawa</p>

Organisms are composed of various cell types with specific states. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the functions of organs and tissues, cell types have been classified and defined by identifying specific marker genes. Statistical tests are critical for identifying marker genes, which often involve evaluating differences in the mean expression levels of genes. Differentially expressed gene (DEG)-based analysis has been the most frequently used method of this kind. However, in association with increases in sample size such as in single-cell analysis, DEG-based analysis has faced difficulties associated with the inflation of P-values. Here, we propose the concept of discriminative feature of cells (DFC), an alternative to using DEG-based approaches. We implemented DFC using logistic regression with an adaptive LASSO penalty to perform binary classification for discriminating a population of interest and variable selection to obtain a small subset of defining genes. We demonstrated that DFC prioritized gene pairs with non-independent expression using artificial data and that DFC enabled characterization of the muscle satellite/progenitor cell population. The results revealed that DFC well captured cell-type-specific markers, specific gene expression patterns, and subcategories of this cell population. DFC may complement DEG-based methods for interpreting large data sets. DEG-based analysis uses lists of genes with differences in expression between groups, while DFC, which can be termed a discriminative approach, has potential applications in the task of cell characterization. Upon recent advances in the high-throughput analysis of single cells, methods of cell characterization such as scRNA-seq can be effectively subjected to the discriminative methods.

We present artificial neural networks as a feasible replacement for a mechanistic model of mosquito abundance. We develop a feed-forward neural network, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network, and a gated recurrent unit network. We evaluate the networks in their ability to replicate the spatiotemporal features of mosquito populations predicted by the mechanistic model, and discuss how augmenting the training data with time series that emphasize specific dynamical behaviors affects model performance. We conclude with an outlook on how such equation-free models may facilitate vector control or the estimation of disease risk at arbitrary spatial scales.

                The interactivity and ubiquity of digital technologies are exerting a significant impact on the knowledge creation in information technology (KC-IT) projects. According to the literature, the critical relevance of KC-IT is highly associated with digital innovation (DI) for organisational success. However, DI is not yet a fully-fledged research subject but is an evolving corpus of theory and practise that draws from a variety of social science fields. Given the preceding setting, this study explores the interaction of KC-IT with DI. This work provides a systemic literature review (SLR) to examine the literature in KC-IT and its connection to DI. A SLR of 527 papers from 2001 to 2021 was performed across six online databases. The review encompasses quantitative and qualitative studies on KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Three major gaps were found in the SLR. Firstly, only 57 (0.23%) papers were found to examine the association between KC and IT projects. These works were analysed for theories, type of papers, KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Secondly, the convergence reviews indicate that scarce research has examined TMS and trust in KC-IT as factors. Thirdly, only 0.02% (5) core papers appeared in the search relevant to KC in IT projects to accelerate DI. The majority of the papers examined were not linked to DI. A significant gap also exists in these areas. These findings warrant the attention of the research community.

                Introduction: Unauthorized access to data is one of the most significant privacy issues that hinder most industries from adopting big data technologies. Even though specific processes and structures have been put in place to deal with access authorization and identity management for large databases nonetheless, the scalability criteria are far beyond the capabilities of traditional databases. Hence, most researchers are looking into other solutions, such as big data management. Methods: In this paper, we firstly study the strengths and weaknesses of implementing cryptography and blockchain for identity management and authorization control in big data, focusing on the healthcare domain. Subsequently, we propose a decentralized data access and sharing system that preserves privacy to ensure adequate data access management under the blockchain. In addition, we designed a blockchain framework to resolve the decentralized data access and sharing system privacy issues, by implementing a public key infrastructure model, which utilizes a signature cryptography algorithm (elliptic curve and signcryption). Lastly, we compared the proposed blockchain model to previous techniques to see how well it performed. Results: We evaluated the blockchain on four performance metrics which include throughput, latency, scalability, and security. The proposed blockchain model was tested using a sample of 5000 patients and 500,000 observations. The performance evaluation results further showed that the proposed model achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to existing approaches when the workload varies up to 10,000 transactions. Discussion: This research reviews the importance of blockchains as they provide infinite possibilities to individuals, companies, and governments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Synchronous online learning during movement control order in higher education institutions: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Higher education institutions (HEI) are not spared from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The closure of campuses because of the movement control order (MCO) to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 has forced HEIs to adopt online learning, especially synchronous online learning (SOL). Although teaching and learning can be continued via SOL, retaining students’ interest and sustaining their engagement have not been sufficiently explored. This study presents a systematic review of the research pertaining to SOL associated with students’ interest and engagement in HEIs during the MCO environment. Methods: Five major online databases, i.e., EBSCOhost, Science Direct, Emerald, Scopus and Springer were searched to collect relevant papers published between 1st January 2010 to 15th June 2021 including conference proceedings, peer-reviewed papers and dissertations. Papers written in the English language, based in full-fledged universities, and with these five keywords: (i) synchronous online learning, (ii) engagement, (iii) interest, (iv) MCO/Covid-19 and (v) HEI, were included. Papers focussing on synchronous and asynchronous online learning in schools and colleges were excluded. Each paper was reviewed by two reviewers in order to confirm the eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: We found 31 papers of which six papers were related to SOL, engagement and interest in HEIs in the MCO environment. Our review presents three major findings: (i) limited research has been conducted on SOL associated with students’ engagement and interest, (ii) studies related to the context of HEIs in the MCO environment are limited, and (iii) the understanding of the new phenomena through qualitative research is insufficient. We highlight the SOL alignment with students’ engagement, interest, style preference, learner interaction effectiveness, behavior and academic performance. Conclusions: We believe that the findings of this study are timely and require attention from the research community.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neurobiology of the lateral septum: regulation of social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are essential for mammalian life and are regulated by evolutionary conserved neuronal mechanisms. An individual’s internal state, experiences, and the nature of the social stimulus are critical for determining apt responses to social situations. The lateral septum (LS) – a structure of the basal forebrain – integrates abundant cortical and subcortical inputs, and projects to multiple downstream regions to generate appropriate behavioral responses. Although incoming cognitive information is indispensable for contextualizing a social stimulus, neuromodulatory information related to the internal state of the organism significantly influences the behavioral outcome as well.

                The ability to predict the dynamics of objects, linking applied force to motion, underlies our capacity to perform many of the tasks we carry out on a daily basis. Thus, a fundamental question is how the dynamics of the myriad objects we interact with are organized in memory. Using a custom-built three-dimensional robotic interface that allowed us to simulate objects of varying appearance and weight, we examined how participants learned the weights of sets of objects that they repeatedly lifted. We find strong support for the novel hypothesis that motor memories of object dynamics are organized categorically, in terms of families, based on covariation in their visual and mechanical properties. A striking prediction of this hypothesis, supported by our findings and not predicted by standard associative map models, is that outlier objects with weights that deviate from the family-predicted weight will never be learned despite causing repeated lifting errors.

                Mutations or genetic variation in noncoding regions of the genome harbouring cis-regulatory elements (CREs), or enhancers, have been widely implicated in human disease and disease risk. However, our ability to assay the impact of these DNA sequence changes on enhancer activity is currently very limited because of the need to assay these elements in an appropriate biological context. Here, we describe a method for simultaneous quantitative assessment of the spatial and temporal activity of wild-type and disease-associated mutant human CRE alleles using live imaging in zebrafish embryonic development. We generated transgenic lines harbouring a dual-CRE dual-reporter cassette in a pre-defined neutral docking site in the zebrafish genome. The activity of each CRE allele is reported via expression of a specific fluorescent reporter, allowing simultaneous visualisation of where and when in development the wild-type allele is active and how this activity is altered by mutation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sex differences in learning from exploration</a></h4>

              
                Sex-based modulation of cognitive processes could set the stage for individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. While value-based decision making processes in particular have been proposed to be influenced by sex differences, the overall correct performance in decision making tasks often show variable or minimal differences across sexes. Computational tools allow us to uncover latent variables that define different decision making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance. Here, we quantify sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless 2-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, largely because they appeared to get 'stuck' in exploration once they had started. Female mice tended to explore less but learned more quickly during exploration. Together, these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Capping protein regulates endosomal trafficking by controlling F-actin density around endocytic vesicles and recruiting RAB5 effectors</a></h4>

              
                Actin filaments (F-actin) have been implicated in various steps of endosomal trafficking, and the length of F-actin is controlled by actin capping proteins, such as CapZ, which is a stable heterodimeric protein complex consisting of a and β subunits. However, the role of these capping proteins in endosomal trafficking remains elusive. Here, we found that CapZ docks to endocytic vesicles via its C-terminal actin-binding motif. CapZ knockout significantly increases the F-actin density around immature early endosomes, and this impedes fusion between these vesicles, manifested by the accumulation of small endocytic vesicles in CapZ-knockout cells. CapZ also recruits several RAB5 effectors, such as Rabaptin-5, to RAB5-positive early endosomes via its N-terminal domain, and this further activates RAB5. Collectively, our results indicate that CapZ regulates endosomal trafficking by controlling actin density around early endosomes and recruiting RAB5 effectors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enrichment of SARM1 alleles encoding variants with constitutively hyperactive NADase in patients with ALS and other motor nerve disorders</a></h4>

              
                SARM1, a protein with critical NADase activity, is a central executioner in a conserved programme of axon degeneration. We report seven rare missense or in-frame microdeletion human <i>SARM1</i> variant alleles in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other motor nerve disorders that alter the SARM1 auto-inhibitory ARM domain and constitutively hyperactivate SARM1 NADase activity. The constitutive NADase activity of these seven variants is similar to that of SARM1 lacking the entire ARM domain and greatly exceeds the activity of wild-type SARM1, even in the presence of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), its physiological activator. This rise in constitutive activity alone is enough to promote neuronal degeneration in response to otherwise non-harmful, mild stress. Importantly, these strong gain-of-function alleles are completely patient-specific in the cohorts studied and show a highly significant association with disease at the single gene level. These findings of disease-associated coding variants that alter SARM1 function build on previously reported genome-wide significant association with ALS for a neighbouring, more common <i>SARM1</i> intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to support a contributory role of SARM1 in these disorders. A broad phenotypic heterogeneity and variable age-of-onset of disease among patients with these alleles also raises intriguing questions about the pathogenic mechanism of hyperactive SARM1 variants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The critical role of the ventral temporal lobe in word retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in word retrieval are a hallmark of a variety of neurological illnesses spanning from dementia to traumatic injuries. The role of the dominant temporal lobe in fluent naming has been characterized by lesional analyses, functional imaging, and intracranial recordings, but limitations of each of these measures preclude a clear assessment of which specific constituent of the temporal lobe is critical for naming. We studied a large cohort of patients undergoing surgical resections or laser ablations of the dominant temporal lobe for medically intractable epilepsy (n=95). These techniques are exceedingly effective for seizure control but often result in language declines, particularly in confrontation naming, which can be socio-economically disabling. We used a multivariate voxel-based lesion symptom mapping analysis to localize brain regions significantly associated with visual object naming deficits. We observed that posterior inferior temporal regions, centered around the middle fusiform gyrus, were significantly associated with a decline in confrontation naming. Furthermore, we found that the posterior margin of anterior temporal lobectomies was linearly correlated to a decline in visual naming with a clinically significant decline occurring once the resection extended 6 cm from the anterior tip of the temporal lobe. We integrated these findings with electrocorticography during naming in a subset of this population and found that the majority of cortical regions whose resection was associated with a significant decline overlapped with regions that were functionally most active prior to articulation. Importantly, these loci coincide with the sites of susceptibility artifacts during echo-planar imaging, which explains why this region has not previously been implicated. Taken together, these data highlight the crucial contribution of the posterior ventral temporal cortex in lexical access and its important role in the pathophysiology of anomia following temporal lobe resections. Surgical strategies, including the use of laser ablation to target the medial temporal lobe as well as microsurgical approaches, should attempt to preserve this region to mitigate postoperative language deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spotlight of attention turns from rhythmic exploration-exploitation to a stable exploitation state</a></h4>

              
                While traditional studies claim that visuospatial attention stays fixed at one location at a time, recent research has rather shown that attention rhythmically fluctuates between different locations at rates of prominent brain rhythms. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of this fluctuation and, particularly, whether it changes over time. Thus, we addressed this question by investigating how visuospatial attention behaves over space and time. We recorded electroencephalographic activity of twenty-seven human participants while they performed a visuospatial cueing task, where attention was covertly oriented to the left or right visual field. In order to decode the spatial locus of attention from neural activity, we trained and tested a classifier on every timepoint of the orienting period, from the attentional cue to stimulus onset. This resulted in one temporal generalization matrix per participant, which was time-frequency decomposed to identify the sampling rhythm. Finally, a searchlight analysis was conducted to reveal the brain regions responsible for attention allocation. Our results show a dynamic evolution of the attentional spotlight, distinguishing between two states. In an early time window, attention explored both cued and uncued hemifield rhythmically at ~10 Hz. In a later time window attention focused on the cued hemifield. Classification was driven by occipital sources, while frontal regions exclusively became involved just before the spotlight settled onto the cued location. Together, our results define attentional sampling as a quasi-rhythmic dynamic process characterized by an initial rhythmic exploration-exploitation state, which is followed by a stable exploitation state.

                Background: Variation in the longitudinal course of childhood attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) coincides with neurodevelopmental maturation of brain structure and function. Prior work has attempted to determine how alterations in white matter (WM) relate to changes in symptom severity, but much of that work has been done in smaller cross-sectional samples using voxel-based analyses. Using standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods, we previously showed WM alterations were associated with ADHD symptom remission over time in a longitudinal sample of probands, siblings, and unaffected individuals. Here, we extend this work by further assessing the nature of these changes in WM microstructure by including an additional follow-up measurement (aged 18-34 years), and using the more physiologically informative fixel-based analysis (FBA). Methods: Data were obtained from 139 participants over 3 clinical and 2 follow-up DWI waves, and analyzed using FBA in regions-of-interest based on prior findings. We replicated previously reported significant models and extended them by adding another time-point, testing whether changes in combined and hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) continuous symptom scores are associated with fixel metrics at follow-up. Results: Clinical improvement in HI symptoms over time was associated with more fiber density at follow-up in the left corticospinal tract (lCST) (tmax=1.092, standardized effect[SE]=0.044, pFWE=0.016), and improvement in combined symptoms over time was associated with more fiber cross-section at follow-up in the lCST (tmax=3.775, SE=0.051, pFWE=0.019). Conclusions: Aberrant white matter development involves both lCST micro- and macrostructural alterations and its path may be moderated by preceding symptom trajectory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effortless integration of probabilistic visual input</a></h4>

              
                Prominent theories of perception suggest that the brain builds probabilistic models of the world, assessing the statistics of the visual input to inform this construction. However, the evidence for this idea is often based on simple impoverished stimuli, and the results have often been discarded as an illusion reflecting simple "summary statistics" of visual inputs. Here we show that the visual system represents probabilistic distributions of complex heterogeneous stimuli. Importantly, we show how these statistical representations are integrated with representations of other features and bound to locations, and can therefore serve as building blocks for object and scene processing. We uncover the organization of these representations at different spatial scales by showing how expectations for incoming features are biased by neighboring locations. We also show that there is not only a bias, but also a skew in the representations, arguing against accounts positing that probabilistic representations are discarded in favor of simplified summary statistics (e.g., mean and variance). In sum, our results reveal detailed probabilistic encoding of stimulus distributions, representations that are bound with other features and to particular locations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An insight into new glycotherapeutic in glial inflammation: Understanding the role of glycosylation from acute to chronic phase of inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Glycosylation plays a critical role during inflammation and glial scar formation upon spinal cord injury (SCI) disease progression. Astrocytes and microglia are involved in this cascade to modulate the inflammation and tissue remodelling from acute to chronic phases. Therefore, understating the glycan changes in these glial cells is paramount. Herein a lectin microarray was undertaken using a cytokine-driven inflammatory MGC model, revealing considerable differential glycosylation from the acute to the chronic phase in a cytokine-combination generated inflamed MGC model. It was found that several N- and O-linked glycans associated with glia during SCI were differentially regulated. Pearson's correlation hierarchical clustering showed that groups were separated into several clusters, illustrating the heterogenicity among the control, cytokine combination, and LPS treated groups and the day on which treatment was given. Control and LPS treatments were observed to be in dense clusters. This was further confirmed with lectin immunostaining in which GalNAc, GlcNAc, mannose, fucose and sialic acid-binding residues were detected in astrocytes and microglia. However, this modification (upregulation of sialic acid expression) was inhibited by the sialyltransferase inhibitor which indeed modulates the mitochondrial functions. The present study is the first functional investigation of glycosylation modulation in a MGC (MGC) model which elucidates the role of the glycome in neuroinflammation and identified potential therapeutic targets for future glycol- therapeutics in neuroinflammation

                In humans, ageing is characterized by decreased brain signal variability and increased behavioural variability. To understand how reduced brain variability segregates with increased behavioural variability, we investigated the association between reaction time variability, evoked brain responses and ongoing brain signal dynamics, in young (N = 36) and older adults (N = 39). We studied the electroencephalogram (EEG) and pupil size fluctuations to characterize the cortical and arousal responses elicited by a cued go/no-go task. Evoked responses were strongly modulated by slow (< 2 Hz) fluctuations of the ongoing signals, which presented reduced power in the older participants. Although variability of the evoked responses was lower in the older participants, once we adjusted for the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations, evoked responses were equally variable in both groups. Moreover, the modulation of the evoked responses caused by the ongoing signal fluctuations had no impact on reaction time, thereby explaining why although ongoing brain signal variability is decreased in older individuals, behavioural variability is not. Finally, we showed that adjusting for the effect of the ongoing signal was critical to unmask the link between neural responses and behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential replay for reward and punishment paths predicts approach and avoidance</a></h4>

              
                Planning is thought to involve neural replay, where states relevant to a task goal are rapidly reactivated in sequence. It remains unclear if, during planning, replay of a path relates to an actual prospective choice. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we studied participants while they planned to either approach or avoid an uncertain environment that contained paths leading to reward and to punishment. We show significant planning-related forward sequential replay with state-to-state transitions in the range of 20 to 90 ms. Replay of rewarding paths was boosted prior to a decision to avoid, and attenuated prior to a decision to approach. Crucially, a trial-by-trial bias in replaying punishing paths predicted an irrational choice to approach when a prospective environment was more risky, an effect that was particularly marked in more anxious participants. The findings reveal a coupling between the content of forwards replay and rational choice behaviour, such that replay prioritises an online representation of potential reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The influence of somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials on concurrent transcranial-magnetic stimulation electroencephalography recordings</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked potentials (TEPs) can be used to index cortical excitability. However, it remains unclear to what extent TEPs reflect somatosensory and auditory-evoked potentials which arise from the scalp sensation and click of the TMS coil, as opposed to transcranial stimulation of cortical circuits. Objectives: The present study had two aims; a) to determine the extent to which sensory potentials contaminate TEPs using a spatially matched sham condition, and b) to determine whether sensory potentials reflect auditory or somatosensory potentials alone, or a combination of the two. Methods: Twenty healthy participants received active or sham stimulation, with the latter consisting of the click of a sham coil combined with scalp electrical stimulation. Earplugs/headphones were used to suppress the TMS click noise. Two additional control conditions i) electrical stimulation alone and ii) auditory stimulation alone were included in a subset of 13 participants. Results: Signals from active and sham stimulation were correlated in spatial and temporal domains, especially >70ms post-stimulation. Relative to auditory or electrical stimulation alone, combined (sham) stimulation resulted in a) larger evoked responses b) stronger correlations with active stimulation and c) a signal that could not be explained by the linear sum of electrical and auditory stimulation alone. Conclusions: Sensory potentials can confound data interpretations of TEPs at timepoints >70ms post-TMS, while earlier timepoints appear reflective of cortical excitability. Furthermore, contamination of TEPs cannot be explained by auditory or somatosensory potentials alone, but instead reflects a non-linear interaction between both sources. Future studies may benefit from controlling for sensory contamination using sham conditions that are spatially matched to active TMS, and which consist of combined auditory and somatosensory stimulation.

                We report a novel subthreshold non-invasive brain stimulation approach that we refer to as kilohertz transcranial magnetic perturbation, or kTMP. kTMP is a magnetic induction method that delivers kHz-frequency cortical E-fields and, through amplitude modulation of the kHz carrier frequency, may mimic E-fields at physiological frequencies. To evaluate the efficacy of kTMP, we used suprathreshold TMS to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in a peripheral muscle, comparing the amplitude of the MEPs before and after kTMP stimulation. In Experiment 1, we used non-modulated kTMP with an E-field amplitude of 2 V/m over motor cortex. Ten minutes of kTMP stimulation resulted in an increase in cortical excitability in a frequency-specific manner. We replicated this effect in Experiment 2 and found that amplitude-modulation at 20 Hz produced an additional boost in cortical excitability. The only percept associated with kTMP is a faint auditory tone, making kTMP ideal for double-blind experimentation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trajectory of rich club properties in structural brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Many organizational principles of structural brain networks are established before birth and undergo considerable developmental changes afterwards. These include the topologically central hub regions and a densely connected rich club. While several studies have mapped developmental trajectories of brain connectivity and brain network organization across childhood and adolescence, comparatively little is known about subsequent development over the course of the lifespan. Here, we present a cross-sectional analysis of structural brain network development in N = 8,066 participants aged 5 to 80 years. Across all brain regions, structural connectivity strength followed an 'inverted-U'-shaped trajectory with vertex in the early 30s. Connectivity strength of hub regions showed a similar trajectory and the identity of hub regions remained stable across all age groups. While connectivity strength declined with advancing age, the organization of hub regions into a rich club did not only remain intact but became more pronounced, presumingly through a selected sparing of relevant connections from age-related connectivity loss. The stability of rich club organization in the face of overall age-related decline is consistent with a 'first come, last served' model of neurodevelopment, where the first principles to develop are the last to decline with age. Rich club organization has been shown to be highly beneficial for communicability and higher cognition. A resilient rich club might thus be protective of a functional loss in late adulthood and represent a neural reserve to sustain cognitive functioning in the aging brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired oligodendrocyte maturation is an early feature in SCA3 disease pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the most common dominantly inherited ataxia, is a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease for which there is no disease-modifying therapy. The polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene results in expression of a mutant form of the ATXN3 protein, a deubiquitinase that causes selective neurodegeneration despite being widely expressed. The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in SCA3 are unclear. Research to date, however, has focused almost exclusively on neurons. Here, using equal male and female age-matched transgenic mice expressing full-length human mutant ATXN3, we identified early and robust transcriptional changes in selectively vulnerable brain regions that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. We mapped transcriptional changes across early, mid, and late stages of disease in two selectively vulnerable brain regions, the cerebellum and brainstem. The most significant disease-associated module through weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed dysfunction in SCA3 oligodendrocyte maturation. These results reflect a toxic gain of function mechanism, as ATXN3 knockout mice do not exhibit any impairments in oligodendrocyte maturation. Genetic crosses to reporter mice revealed a marked reduction in mature oligodendrocytes in SCA3-disease vulnerable brain regions and ultrastructural microscopy confirmed abnormalities in axonal myelination. Further study of isolated oligodendrocyte precursor cells from SCA3 mice established that this impairment in oligodendrocyte maturation is a cell autonomous process. We conclude that SCA3 is not simply a disease of neurons and the search for therapeutic strategies and disease biomarkers will need to account for non-neuronal involvement in SCA3 pathogenesis.

                The hippocampus supports multiple cognitive functions including episodic memory. Recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. We leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the in-vivo human hippocampus. We first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, we characterised where, within the hippocampus, these cortical areas preferentially connect. Our results were striking in showing that different parts of the hippocampus preferentially connect with distinct cortical areas. Furthermore, we provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field by unveiling how specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs. Overall, our results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in-vivo and inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal dependent memory systems in the human brain. This detailed characterization of how specific portions of the hippocampus anatomically connect with cortical brain regions may promote a better understanding of its role in cognition and we emphasize the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure.

                Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification can rival and even exceed human-level performance. The relationships between internal representations learned by DCNNs and those of the primate face processing system are not well understood, especially in naturalistic settings. We developed the largest naturalistic dynamic face stimulus set in human neuroimaging research (700+ naturalistic video clips of unfamiliar faces) and used representational similarity analysis to investigate how well the representations learned by high-performing DCNNs match human brain representations across the entire distributed face processing system. DCNN representational geometries were strikingly consistent across diverse architectures and captured meaningful variance among faces. Similarly, representational geometries throughout the human face network were highly consistent across subjects. Nonetheless, correlations between DCNN and neural representations were very weak overall--DCNNs captured 3% of variance in the neural representational geometries at best. Intermediate DCNN layers better matched visual and face-selective cortices than the final fully-connected layers. Behavioral ratings of face similarity were highly correlated with intermediate layers of DCNNs, but also failed to capture representational geometry in the human brain. Our results suggest that the correspondence between intermediate DCNN layers and neural representations of naturalistic human face processing is weak at best, and diverges even further in the later fully-connected layers. This poor correspondence can be attributed, at least in part, to the dynamic and cognitive information that plays an essential role in human face processing but is not modeled by DCNNs. These mismatches indicate that current DCNNs have limited validity as in silico models of dynamic, naturalistic face processing in humans.

                The neocortex can be viewed as a tapestry consisting of variations of rather stereotypical local cortical microcircuits. Hence understanding how these microcircuits compute holds the key to understanding brain function. Intense research efforts over several decades have culminated in a detailed model of a generic cortical microcircuit in the primary visual cortex from the Allen Institute. We are presenting here methods and first results for understanding computational properties of this large-scale data-based model. We show that it can solve a standard image-change-detection task almost as well as the living brain. Furthermore, we unravel the computational strategy of the model and elucidate the computational role of diverse subtypes of neurons. Altogether this work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific potential of a methodology based on close interaction of detailed data and large-scale computer modelling for understanding brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hidden temporal structure of the ongoing task impacts detection strategy and is reflected in pupillary dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Estimating temporal regularities in incoming sensory inputs supports optimal decisions in noisy environments. In particular, inferred temporal structure can ease the detection of likely target events. Here we postulated that timely urgency signals can adapt subjects' decision-making to the ongoing task temporal structure, possibly through neuromodulatory tone. To test this hypothesis, we used an auditory change detection task in which targets followed a block-based temporal contingency, unbeknownst to participants. False alarm occurrences were driven by the distribution of target timings, indicating that participants adapted their behavior to the ongoing temporal structure. Task-evoked pupillary responses were larger for blocks with earliest target timings, and correlated with individual subjects' behavioral adaptation. Individual pupil responses matched an urgency signal extracted from a decision model fitted to behavior. This work demonstrates that internal temporal expectation can be tracked through pupillary dynamics, suggesting a role of neuromodulatory systems in context-dependent modulation of decision variable dynamics.

                Intracranial recordings from the human amygdala and the hippocampus during an emotional memory encoding and discrimination task reveal increased awake sharp-wave/ripples (aSWR) after encoding of emotional compared to neutral stimuli. Further, post-encoding aSWR-locked memory reinstatement in the amygdala and the hippocampus was predictive of later memory discrimination. These findings provide electrophysiological evidence that post-encoding aSWRs enhance memory for emotional events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sharing individualised template MRI data for MEG source reconstruction: a solution for open data while keeping subject confidentiality</a></h4>

              
                The increasing requirements for adoption of FAIR data management and sharing original research data from neuroimaging studies can be at odds with protecting the anonymity of the research participants due to the person-identifiable anatomical features in the data. We propose a solution to this dilemma for anatomical MRIs used in MEG source analysis. In MEG analysis, the channel-level data is reconstructed to the source-level using models derived from anatomical MRIs. Sharing data, therefore, requires sharing the anatomical MRI to replicate the analysis. The suggested solution is to replace the individual anatomical MRIs with individualised warped templates that can be used to carry out the MEG source analysis and that provide sufficient geometrical similarity to the original participants' MRIs. First, we demonstrate how the individualised template warping can be implemented with one of the leading open-source neuroimaging analysis toolboxes. Second, we compare results from four different MEG source reconstruction methods performed with an individualised warped template to those using the participant's original MRI. While the source reconstruction results are not numerically identical, there is a high similarity between the results for single dipole fits, dynamic imaging of coherent sources beamforming, and atlas-based virtual channel beamforming. There is a moderate similarity between minimum-norm estimates, as anticipated due to this method being anatomically constrained and dependent on the exact morphological features of the cortical sheet. We also compared the morphological features of the warped template to those of the original MRI. These showed a high similarity in grey matter volume and surface area, but a low similarity in the average cortical thickness and the mean folding index within cortical parcels. Taken together, this demonstrates that the results obtained by MEG source reconstruction can be preserved with the warped templates, whereas the anatomical and morphological fingerprint is sufficiently altered to protect the anonymity of research participants. In cases where participants consent to sharing anatomical MRI data, it remains preferable to share the original defaced data with an appropriate data use agreement. In cases where participants did not consent to share their MRIs, the individualised warped MRI template offers a good compromise in sharing data for reuse while retaining anonymity for those research participants.

                Social deficit is a major feature of neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined neuronal discharge characteristics in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of IRSp53-mutant mice, which show social deficits, during social approach. IRSp53-mutant excitatory mPFC neurons displayed an increase in baseline neuronal firing and decreases in variability and dynamic range of firing rates and burst firing during social and non-social target approaches compared to wild-type controls. As a consequence, their firing activity was less differential between social and non-social targets. In addition, there was a decrease in the proportion of excitatory mPFC neurons encoding social information but not that of those encoding non-social information. These results suggest that insufficient neuronal activity dynamics may underlie impaired cortical encoding of social information and social behaviors in IRSp53-mutant mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulus-induced narrow-band gamma oscillations in humans can be recorded using open-hardware low-cost EEG amplifier</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus-induced narrow-band gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) in human electro - encephalograph (EEG) have been linked to attentional and memory mechanisms and are abnormal in mental health conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. This suggests that gamma oscillations could be valuable both as a research tool and an inexpensive, non-invasive biomarker for disease evaluation. However, since the absolute power in EEG decreases rapidly with increasing frequency following a "1/f" power law, and the gamma band includes line noise frequency, these oscillations are highly susceptible to instrument noise. Previous studies that recorded stimulus-induced gamma oscillations used expensive research-grade EEG amplifiers to address this issue. While low-cost EEG amplifiers have become popular in Brain Computer Interface applications that mainly rely on low-frequency oscillations (<30 Hz) or steady-state-visually-evoked-potentials, whether they can also be used to measure stimulus-induced gamma oscillations is unknown. We recorded EEG signals using a low-cost, open-source amplifier (OpenBCI) and a traditional, research-grade amplifier (Brain Products GmbH) in male (N = 6) and female (N = 5) subjects (22-29 years) while they viewed full-screen static gratings that are known to induce gamma oscillations. OpenBCI recordings showed gamma response in almost all the subjects who showed a gamma response in Brain Products recordings, and the spectral and temporal profiles of these responses in alpha (8-13 Hz) and gamma bands were highly correlated between OpenBCI and Brain Products recordings. These results suggest that low-cost amplifiers can potentially be used in stimulus induced gamma response detection, making its research, and application in medicine more accessible.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Affinity Scores: An Individual-centric Fingerprinting Framework for Neuropsychiatric Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Background: Population-centric frameworks of biomarker identification for psychiatric disorders focus primarily on comparing averages between groups and assume that diagnostic groups are (1) mutually-exclusive, and (2) homogeneous. There is a paucity of individual-centric approaches capable of identifying individual-specific fingerprints across multiple domains. To address this, we propose a novel framework, combining a range of biopsychosocial markers, including brain structure, cognition, and clinical markers, into higher-level fingerprints, capable of capturing intra-illness heterogeneity and inter-illness overlap. Methods: A multivariate framework was implemented to identify individualised patterns of brain structure, cognition and clinical markers based on affinity to other participants in the database. First, individual-level affinity scores defined a neighbourhood for each participant across each measure based on variable-specific hop sizes. Next, diagnostic verification and classification algorithms were implemented based on multivariate affinity score profiles. To perform affinity-based classification, data were divided into training and test samples, and 5-fold nested cross-validation was performed on the training data. Affinity-based classification was compared to weighted K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classification. K-means clustering was used to create clusters based on multivariate affinity score profiles. The framework was applied to the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB) dataset. Results: Individualised affinity scores provided a fingerprint of brain structure, cognition, and clinical markers, which described the affinity of an individual to the representative groups in the dataset Diagnostic verification capability was moderate to high depending on the choice of multivariate affinity metric. Affinity score-based classification achieved a high degree of accuracy in the training, nested cross-validation and prediction steps, and outperformed KNN classification in the training and test datasets. Conclusion: Affinity scores demonstrate utility in two keys ways: (1) Early and accurate diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders, whereby an individual can be grouped within a diagnostic category/ies that best matches their fingerprint, and (2) identification of biopsychosocial factors that most strongly characterise individuals/disorders, and which may be most amenable to intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Micro-state-based neural decoding of speech categorization using Bayesian non-parametrics</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the many-to-many mapping between patterns of functional brain connectivity and discrete behavioral responses is critical for speech-language processing. We present a microstate-based analysis of EEG recordings to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics of neural activities that underly rapid speech categorization decisions. We implemented a data driven approach using Bayesian non-parametrics to capture the mapping between EEG and the speed of listeners phoneme identification [i.e., response time (RT)] during speech labeling tasks. Based on our empirical analyses, we show task-relevant events such as resting-state, stimulus coding, auditory-perceptual object (category) formation, and response selection can be explained using patterns of micro-state dwell-time and are decodable as unique time segments during speech perception. State-dependent activities localize to a fronto-temporo-parietal circuit (superior temporal, supramarginal, inferior frontal gyri) exposing a core decision brain network (DN) underlying rapid speech categorization. Furthermore, RTs were inversely proportional to the frequency of state transitions, such that the rate of change between brain microstates was higher for trials with slower compared to faster RTs. Our findings imply that during rapid speech perception, higher uncertainty producing prolonged RTs (slower decision-making) is associated with staying in the DN longer compared lower RTs (faster decisions). We also show that listeners perceptual RTs are highly sensitive to individual differences. Our computational method opens a new avenue in segmentation and dynamic brain connectivity for modeling neuroimaging data and understanding task-related cognitive events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The output of interneurons in the primary visual cortex is best reflected by pre-synaptic activity, not somatic activity</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in 2-photon calcium-imaging in awake mice have made it possible to study the effect of different behavioural states on cortical circuitry. Many studies assume that somatic activity can be used as a measure for neuronal output. We set out to test the validity of this assumption by comparing somatic activity with the pre-synaptic activity of VIP (Vasoactive intestinal peptide)- and SST (Somatostatin)-positive interneurons in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We used mice expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators in VIP/SST-interneurons across the whole cell (VIP/SST:GCaMP6f) or confined to pre-synapses (VIP/SST:SyGCaMP5). Mice were exposed to a full-field visual stimulation protocol consisting of 60-second-long presentations of moving Gabor gratings (0.04 cpd, 2 Hz) alternated by 30 seconds of grey screen. During imaging, mice were placed on an air-suspended Styrofoam ball, allowing them to run voluntarily. We compared neural activity during three 4-second time-windows: Before visual stimulation (-4 to 0 sec), during the initial onset (1 to 5 sec) and at the end of the stimulation (56 to 60 sec.). These were further compared while the mice were stationary and while they were voluntarily locomoting. Unlike VIP-somas, VIP-pre-synapses showed strong suppressive responses to the visual stimulus. Furthermore, VIP-somas were positively correlated with locomotion, whereas in VIP-synapses we observed a split between positive and negative correlations. In addition, a similar but weaker distinction was found between SST-somas and pre-synapses. The excitatory effect of locomotion in VIP-somas increased over the course of the visual stimulus but this property was only shared with the positively correlated VIP-pre-synapses. The remaining negatively correlated pre-synapses showed no relation to the overall activity of the Soma. Our results suggest that when making statements about the involvement of interneurons in V1 layer 2/3 circuitry it is crucial to measure from synaptic terminals as well as from somas.

                Feature-based attention supports the selection of goal-relevant stimuli by enhancing the visual processing of attended features. A defining property of feature-based attention is that it modulates visual processing beyond the focus of spatial attention. Previous work has reported such spatially-global effects for low-level features such as color and orientation, as well as for faces. Here, using fMRI, we provide evidence for spatially-global attentional modulation for human bodies. Participants were cued to search for one of six object categories in two vertically-aligned images. Two additional, horizontally-aligned, images were simultaneously presented but were never task-relevant across three experimental sessions. Analyses time-locked to the objects presented in these task-irrelevant images revealed that responses evoked by body silhouettes were modulated by the participants' top-down attentional set, becoming more body-selective when participants searched for bodies in the task-relevant images. These effects were observed both in univariate analyses of the body-selective cortex and in multivariate analyses of the object-selective visual cortex. Additional analyses showed that this modulation reflected response gain rather than a bias induced by the cues, and that it reflected enhancement of body responses rather than suppression of non-body responses. Finally, the features of early layers of a convolutional neural network trained for object recognition could not be used to accurately categorize body silhouettes, indicating that the fMRI results were unlikely to reflect selection based on low-level features. These findings provide the first evidence for spatially-global feature-based attention for human bodies, linking this modulation to body representations in high-level visual cortex.

                mGlu3 receptors control the sleep/wake architecture which plays a role in the glutamatergic pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Interestingly, mGlu3 receptors expression is decreased in the brain of schizophrenic patients. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating mGlu3 receptors at the cell membrane. Subcellular receptor localization is strongly dependent on protein-protein interactions. Here we show that mGlu3 interacts with PICK1 and that their binding is important for receptor surface expression and function. Disruption of their interaction via an mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide or an inhibitor of the PDZ domain of PICK1 altered the functional expression of mGlu3 receptors. Consequently, we investigated whether disruption of the mGlu3-PICK1 interaction affects hippocampal theta oscillations in vitro and in vivo. We found a decreased frequency of theta oscillations in organotypic hippocampal slices, similar to what previously observed in mGlu3 -/- mice. In addition, hippocampal theta power was reduced during REM sleep, NREM sleep and wake states after intra-ventricular administration of the mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide. Targeting the mGlu3-PICK1 complex could thus be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetrical choice-related ensemble activity in direct and indirect-pathway striatal neurons drives perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Action selection during decision-making depends on the basal ganglia circuits that comprise the direct and indirect pathways known to oppositely control movement. However, the mechanism for coordinating these opponent pathways during decision-making remains unclear. We address this by employing deep-brain two-photon imaging and optogenetic manipulations of the direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) in the posterior striatum during an auditory decision-making behavior. We show that while dSPNs and iSPNs play opposite causal roles during decision-making, each subtype contains divergent ensembles preferring different choices. The ensembles in dSPNs show stronger contralateral dominance than those in iSPNs manifested by higher-level activation and synchronization. Consistent with this asymmetrical contralateral dominance, optogenetic disinhibition of both pathways promoted contralateral choices. A computational model incorporating the striatal ensemble asymmetry recapitulated the causal behavioral effects. Our results uncover the asymmetry between opponent SPN ensembles as a circuit mechanism for action selection during decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lonely in the dark: trauma memory and sex-specific dysregulation of amygdala reactivity to fear signals</a></h4>

              
                Loneliness exacerbates psychological distress and increases the risk of psychopathology after trauma exposure. The prevalence of trauma-associated disorders varies substantially between sexes, and accumulating evidence indicates sex-specific effects of loneliness. However, it is still unclear whether a lack of social connectedness affects trauma-induced intrusions and the neural processing of fear signals. Moreover, it is uncertain, whether loneliness plays a different role in women and men. We used a prestratification strategy and recruited n=47 (n=20 women) healthy individuals with high loneliness and n=35 controls (n=18 women). Participants were exposed to an experimental trauma and evoked intrusive thoughts in daily life were monitored for three consecutive days. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural habituation to fearful faces and fear learning (conditioning and extinction) prior to trauma exposure. The total number of intrusions and amygdala reactivity in neural fear processing served as the primary study outcomes. Our results revealed a significant interaction between loneliness and sex such that loneliness was associated with more intrusions in men, but not in women. A similar pattern emerged at the neural level, with both reduced amygdala habituation to repeated fearful faces and amygdala hyperreactivity during the conditioning of fear signals in lonely men, but not in women. Our findings indicate that loneliness may confer vulnerability to intrusive memories after trauma exposure in healthy men and that this phenotype relates to altered limbic processing of fear signals. Collectively, interventions targeting social connectedness may mitigate the sequelae of traumatic experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison of seven modelling algorithms for GABA-edited 1H-MRS</a></h4>

              
                Edited MRS sequences are widely used for studying GABA in the human brain. Several algorithms are available for modelling these data, deriving metabolite concentration estimates through peak fitting or a linear combination of basis spectra. The present study compares seven such algorithms, using data obtained in a large multi-site study. GABA-edited (GABA+, TE = 68 ms MEGA-PRESS) data from 222 subjects at 20 sites were processed via a standardised pipeline, before modelling with FSL-MRS, Gannet, AMARES, QUEST, LCModel, Osprey and Tarquin, using standardised vendor-specific basis sets (for GE, Philips and Siemens) where appropriate. After referencing metabolite estimates (to water or creatine), systematic differences in scale were observed between datasets acquired on different vendors' hardware, presenting across algorithms. Scale differences across algorithms were also observed. Using the correlation between metabolite estimates and voxel tissue fraction as a benchmark, most algorithms were found to be similarly effective in detecting differences in GABA+. An inter-class correlation across all algorithms showed single-rater consistency for GABA+ estimates of around 0.38, indicating moderate agreement. Upon inclusion of a basis set component explicitly modelling the macromolecule signal underlying the observed 3.0 ppm GABA peaks, single-rater consistency improved to 0.44. Correlation between discrete pairs of algorithms varied, and was concerningly weak in some cases. Our findings highlight the need for consensus on appropriate modelling parameters across different algorithms, and for detailed reporting of the parameters adopted in individual studies to ensure reproducibility and meaningful comparison of outcomes between different studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Flip-flop neuron - A memory efficient alternative for solving challenging sequence processing and decision making problems</a></h4>

              
                Sequential decision making tasks that require information integration over extended durations of time are challenging for several reasons including the problem of vanishing gradients, long training times and significant memory requirements. To this end we propose a neuron model fashioned after the JK flip-flops in digital systems. A flip-flop is a sequential device that can store state information of the previous history. We incorporate the JK flip-flop neuron into several deep network architectures and apply the networks to difficult sequence processing problems. The proposed architectures include flip-flop neural networks (FFNNs), bidirectional flip-flop neural networks (BiFFNNs), convolutional flip-flop neural networks (ConvFFNNs), and bidirectional convolutional flip-flop neural networks (BiConvFFNNs). Learning rules of proposed architectures have also been derived. We have considered the most popular benchmark sequential tasks like signal generation, sentiment analysis, handwriting generation, text generation, video frame prediction, lung volume prediction, and action recognition to evaluate the proposed networks. Finally, we compare the results of our networks with the results from analogous networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neurons on the same sequential tasks. Our results show that the JK flip-flop networks outperform the LSTM networks significantly or marginally on all the tasks, with only half of the trainable parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The sleep EEG envelope: a novel, neuronal firing-based human biomarker</a></h4>

              
                Sleep EEG reflects instantaneous voltage differences relative to a reference, while its spectrum reflects the degree to which it is comprised of oscillations at various frequencies. In contrast, the envelope of the sleep EEG reflects the instantaneous amplitude of oscillations at specific frequencies, and its spectrum reflects the rhythmicity of the occurrence of these oscillations. The ordinary sleep EEG and its spectrum have been extensively studied and its individual stability and relationship to various demographic characteristics, psychological traits and pathologies is well known. In contrast, the envelope spectrum has not been extensively studied before. In two studies, we explored the generating mechanisms and utility of studying the envelope of the sleep EEG. First, we used human invasive data from cortex-penetrating microelectrodes and subdural grids to demonstrate that the sleep EEG envelope spectrum reflects local neuronal firing. Second, we used a large database of healthy volunteers to demonstrate that the scalp EEG envelope spectrum is highly stable within individuals, especially in NREM sleep, and that it is affected by age and sex. Multivariate models based on a learning algorithm could predict both age (r=0.6) and sex (r=0.5) with considerable accuracy from the EEG envelope spectrum. With age, oscillations characteristically shifted from a 4-5 second rhythm to higher rhythms. The envelope spectrum was not associated with general cognitive ability (IQ). Our results demonstrate that the sleep envelope spectrum is a promising, neuronal firing-based biomarker of various demographic and disease-related phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial OPA1 deficiency causes reversible defects in adult neurogenesis-associated spatial memory in mice</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are integrative hubs central to cellular adaptive pathways. Such pathways are critical in highly differentiated post-mitotic neurons, the plasticity of which sustains brain function. Consequently, defects in mitochondrial dynamics and quality control appear instrumental in neurodegenerative diseases and may also participate in cognitive impairments. To directly test this hypothesis, we analyzed cognitive performances in a mouse mitochondria-based disease model, due to haploinsufficiency in the mitochondrial optic-atrophy-type-1 (OPA1) protein. While in Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA) models, the known main symptoms are late onset visual deficits, we discovered early impairments in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory attributable to defects in adult neurogenesis. Moreover, less connected hippocampal adult-born neurons showed a decrease in mitochondrial content. Remarkably, modulating mitochondrial function through voluntary exercise or pharmacological treatment restored spatial memory. Altogether, our study identifies a crucial role for OPA1-dependent mitochondrial functions in adult neurogenesis, and thus in hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions. More generally, our findings show that adult neurogenesis is highly sensitive to mild mitochondrial defects, generating impairments in spatial memory that can be detected at an early stage and counterbalanced by physical exercise and pharmacological targeting of mitochondrial dynamics. Thus, early amplification of mitochondrial function appears beneficial for late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploratory methods for high-performance EEG speech decoding</a></h4>

              
                State-of-the-art technologies in neural speech decoding utilize data collected from microwires or microarrays implanted directly into the cerebral cortex. Yet as a tool accessible only to individuals with implanted electrodes, speech decoding from devices of this nature is severely limited in its implementation, and cannot be considered a viable solution for widespread application. Speech decoding from non-invasive EEG signals can achieve relatively high accuracy (70-80%), but only from very small classification tasks, with more complex tasks typically yielding a limited (20-50%) classification accuracy. We propose a novel combination of technologies in which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is first applied to augment the neural signals of interest, producing a greater signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG data. Next, delay differential analysis (DDA) -- a cutting-edge computational method based on nonlinear dynamics -- is implemented to capture the widest range of information available in the neural signal, by incorporating both linear and nonlinear dynamics.

	<p>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a neuromodulation procedure that is currently studied for the purpose of improving cognitive function in various diseases. A few studies have shown positive effects of tACS in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying tACS has not been established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of tACS in five familial AD mutation (5xFAD) mouse models. We prepared twenty 4-month-old mice and divided them into four groups: wild-type mice without stimulation (WT-NT group), wild-type mice with tACS (WT-T group), 5xFAD mice without stimulation (AD-NT group), and 5xFAD mice with tACS (AD-T group). The protocol implemented was as follows: gamma frequency 200 μA over the bilateral frontal lobe for 20 min over 2 weeks. The following tests were conducted: excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) recording, Western blot analysis (cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) proteins, phosphorylated CREB proteins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and parvalbumin) to examine the synaptic plasticity. The EPSP was remarkably increased in the AD-T group compared with in the AD-NT group. In the Western blot analysis, the differences among the groups were not significant. Hence, tACS can affect the long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission in mice models of AD.</p>

	<p>Studies comparing organized (O) and unresolved/disorganized (UD) attachment have consistently shown structural and functional brain abnormalities, although whether and how attachment patterns may affect resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) is still little characterized. Here, we investigated RSFC of temporal and limbic regions of interest for UD attachment. Participants’ attachment was classified via the Adult Attachment Interview, and all participants underwent clinical assessment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 11 UD individuals and seven matched O participants during rest. A seed-to-voxel analysis was performed, including the anterior and the posterior cingulate cortex, the bilateral insula, amygdala and hippocampus as seed regions. No group differences in the clinical scales emerged. Compared to O, the UD group showed lower RSFC between the left amygdala and the left cerebellum (lobules VIII), and lower functional coupling between the right hippocampus and the posterior portion of the right middle temporal gyrus. Moreover, UD participants showed higher RSFC between the right amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings suggest RSFC alterations in regions associated with encoding of salient events, emotion processing, memories retrieval and self-referential processing in UD participants, highlighting the potential role of attachment experiences in shaping brain abnormalities also in non-clinical UD individuals.</p>

	<p>The insula plays a critical role in many neuropsychological disorders. Research investigating its neurochemistry with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been limited compared with cortical regions. Here, we investigate the within-session and between-session reproducibility of metabolite measurements in the insula on a 3T scanner. We measure N-acetylaspartate + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA), creatine + phosphocreatine (tCr), glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine (tCho), myo-inositol (Ins), glutamate + glutamine (Glx), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in one cohort using a j-edited MEGA-PRESS sequence. We measure tNAA, tCr, tCho, Ins, and Glx in another cohort with a standard short-TE PRESS sequence as a reference for the reproducibility metrics. All participants were scanned 4 times identically: 2 back-to-back scans each day, on 2 days. Preprocessing was done using LCModel and Gannet. Reproducibility was determined using Pearson’s r, intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficients of variation (CV%), and Bland–Altman plots. A MEGA-PRESS protocol requiring averaged results over two 6:45-min scans yielded reproducible GABA measurements (CV% = 7.15%). This averaging also yielded reproducibility metrics comparable to those from PRESS for the other metabolites. Voxel placement inconsistencies did not affect reproducibility, and no sex differences were found. The data suggest that MEGA-PRESS can reliably measure standard metabolites and GABA in the insula.</p>

	<p> Voluntary force modulation is defined as the ability to tune the application of force during motion. However, the mechanisms behind this modulation are not yet fully understood. In this study, we examine muscle activity under various resistance levels at a fixed cycling speed. The main goal of this research is to identify significant changes in muscle activation related to the real-time tuning of muscle force. This work revealed significant motor adaptations of the main muscles utilized in cycling as well as positive associations between the force level and the temporal and spatial inter-cycle stability in the distribution of sEMG activity. From these results, relevant biomarkers of motor adaptation could be extracted for application in clinical rehabilitation to increase the efficacy of physical therapy.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathologies has distinctive stage-specific effects on the structural and functional brain networks along the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum. A more comprehensive account of both types of brain network may provide a better characterization of the stage-specific effects of Aβ pathologies. A potential candidate for this joint characterization is the coupling between the structural and functional brain networks (SC-FC coupling). We therefore investigated the effect of Aβ accumulation on global SC-FC coupling in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and healthy controls. Patients with MCI were dichotomized according to their level of Aβ pathology seen in 18F-flutemetamol PET-CT scans—namely, Aβ-negative and Aβ-positive. Our results show that there was no difference in global SC-FC coupling between different cohorts. During the prodromal AD stage, there was a significant negative correlation between the level of Aβ pathology and the global SC-FC coupling of MCI patients with positive Aβ, but no significant correlation for MCI patients with negative Aβ. During the AD dementia stage, the correlation between Aβ pathology and global SC-FC coupling in patients with AD was positive. Our results suggest that Aβ pathology has distinctive stage-specific effects on global coupling between the structural and functional brain networks along the AD continuum.</p>

	<p>A difficulty in encoding spatial information in an egocentric (i.e., body-to-object) and especially allocentric (i.e., object-to-object) manner, and impairments in executive function (EF) are typical in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer&#039;s disease (AD). Since executive functions are involved in spatial encodings, it is important to understand the extent of their reciprocal or selective impairment. To this end, AD patients, aMCI and healthy elderly people had to provide egocentric (What object was closest to you?) and allocentric (What object was closest to object X?) judgments about memorized objects. Participants&#039; frontal functions, attentional resources and visual-spatial memory were assessed with the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), the Trail Making Test (TMT) and the Corsi Block Tapping Test (forward/backward). Results showed that ADs performed worse than all others in all tasks but did not differ from aMCIs in allocentric judgments and Corsi forward. Regression analyses showed, although to different degrees in the three groups, a link between attentional resources, visuo-spatial memory and egocentric performance, and between frontal resources and allocentric performance. Therefore, visuo-spatial memory, especially when it involves allocentric frames and requires demanding active processing, should be carefully assessed to reveal early signs of conversion from aMCI to AD.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate whole-brain spontaneous activities changes in patients with vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), and to evaluate the relationships between these brain alterations and their neuropsychological assessments. Thirty-one patients with VaMCI and thirty-one healthy controls (HCs) underwent structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological assessments. The functional alterations were determined by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and degree centrality (DC). The gray matter volume (GMV) changes were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between the structural and functional changes of brain regions and neuropsychological assessments. The VaMCI group had significantly lower scores in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and higher scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Compared to the HCs, the VaMCI group exhibited GM atrophy in the right precentral gyrus (PreCG) and right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). VaMCI patients further exhibited significantly decreased brain activity within the default mode network (DMN), including the bilateral precuneus (PCu), angular gyrus (AG), and medial frontal gyrus (medFG). Linear regression analysis revealed that the decreased ALFF was independently associated with lower MoCA scores, and the GM atrophy was independently associated with higher HAMD scores. The current finding suggested that aberrant spontaneous brain activity in the DMN might subserve as a potential biomarker of VaMCI, which may highlight the underlying mechanism of cognitive decline in cerebral small vessel disease.</p>

	<p>Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) in epilepsy surgery patients has a long history of functional brain mapping and seizure triggering. Here, we review its findings when applied to the insula in order to map the insular functions, evaluate its local and distant connections, and trigger seizures. Clinical responses to insular DCS are frequent and diverse, showing a partial segregation with spatial overlap, including a posterior somatosensory, auditory, and vestibular part, a central olfactory-gustatory region, and an anterior visceral and cognitive-emotional portion. The study of cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) has shown that the anterior (resp. posterior) insula has a higher connectivity rate with itself than with the posterior (resp. anterior) insula, and that both the anterior and posterior insula are closely connected, notably between the homologous insular subdivisions. All insular gyri show extensive and complex ipsilateral and contralateral extra-insular connections, more anteriorly for the anterior insula and more posteriorly for the posterior insula. As a rule, CCEPs propagate first and with a higher probability around the insular DCS site, then to the homologous region, and later to more distal regions with fast cortico-cortical axonal conduction delays. Seizures elicited by insular DCS have rarely been specifically studied, but their rate does not seem to differ from those of other DCS studies. They are mainly provoked from the insular seizure onset zone but can also be triggered by stimulating intra- and extra-insular early propagation zones. Overall, in line with the neuroimaging studies, insular DCS studies converge on the view that the insula is a multimodal functional hub with a fast propagation of information, whose organization helps understand where insular seizures start and how they propagate.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>For proper execution of goal-directed behaviors, individuals require both a general representation of the goal and an ability to monitor their own progress toward that goal. Here, we examine how dorsomedial striatum (DMS), a region pivotal for forming associations among stimuli, actions, and outcomes, encodes the execution of goal-directed action sequences that require self-monitoring of behavior. We trained rats to complete a sequence of at least five consecutive lever presses (without visiting the reward port) to obtain a reward and recorded the activity of individual cells in DMS while rats performed the task. We found that the pattern of DMS activity gradually changed during the execution of the sequence, permitting accurate decoding of sequence progress from neural activity at a population level. Moreover, this sequence-related activity was blunted on trials where rats did not complete a sufficient number of presses. Overall, these data suggest a link between DMS activity and the execution of behavioral sequences that require monitoring of ongoing behavior.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) that is localized within neurons and plays crucial roles in RNA metabolism. Its importance in neuronal functioning is underscored from the study of its pathogenic features in many neurodegenerative diseases where neuronal hnRNP A1 is mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm resulting in loss of hnRNP A1 function. Here, we model hnRNP A1 loss-of-function by siRNA-mediated knock-down in differentiated Neuro-2a cells. Through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by gene ontology (GO) analyses, we show that hnRNP A1 is involved in important biological processes, including RNA metabolism, neuronal function, neuronal morphology, neuronal viability, and stress granule (SG) formation. We further confirmed several of these roles by showing that hnRNP A1 knock-down results in a reduction of neurite outgrowth, increase in cell cytotoxicity and changes in SG formation. In summary, these findings indicate that hnRNP A1 loss-of-function contributes to neuronal dysfunction and cell death and implicates hnRNP A1 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                Background: Both smoked and smokeless tobacco use have deleterious effects on most major organ systems including the reproductive system. We conducted a systematic review on smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and reproductive outcomes among women. Methods: We searched Pubmed, ProQuest, Cochrane, Wiley and Emerald databases for studies involving smokeless tobacco use in women with any or a combination of three conditions: infertility, menstrual disorders and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Eligibility criteria included English language publications from 1st January 1990 - 31st October 2020. CADIMA software used for filtering the studies and modified SIGN checklist for the quality assessment. The findings are reported as per the PRISMA guidelines. The AXIS and ROBIN E tool were used for assessment of risk of bias. Results: In total, three studies addressed our research question. Two studies addressed infertility (prospective cohort: n=501, cross sectional: n=192) of which, the cross-sectional study compared the mean cotinine levels between those with infertility, menstrual disorders and PID. This study also explored the association between SLT and PID. PID was the most common gynecological complaint. Women with PID had significantly higher urinary cotinine levels = 24.95±12.259) ng/ ml (p=0.0144). Mean urinary cotinine in women with menstrual complaints was 19.32±10.29 ng/ml.  The other study used population-based sampling of 501 couples who attempted pregnancy (enrolled in the LIFE Study).  Results showed that only 2% (n=28) of men and none of the women used smokeless tobacco.  Compared with never users of tobacco, smoking by females was individually associated with longer time-to-pregnancy;  smoking among males remained significant when modeling partners together. Conclusions: Available studies exploring associations between SLT and reproductive outcomes are inconclusive due to limitations in the study methodologies. More studies with robust study designs are required from low- and middle-income countries with high prevalence of SLT use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferred expression regulator activities suggest genes mediating cardiometabolic genetic signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason W. Hoskins, Charles C. Chung, Aidan O’Brien, Jun Zhong, Katelyn Connelly, Irene Collins, Jianxin Shi, Laufey T. Amundadottir</p>

Expression QTL (eQTL) analyses have suggested many genes mediating genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals but most GWAS signals still lack compelling explanatory genes. We have leveraged an adipose-specific gene regulatory network to infer expression regulator activities and phenotypic master regulators (MRs), which were used to detect activity QTLs (aQTLs) at cardiometabolic trait GWAS loci. Regulator activities were inferred with the VIPER algorithm that integrates enrichment of expected expression changes among a regulator’s target genes with confidence in their regulator-target network interactions and target overlap between different regulators (i.e., pleiotropy). Phenotypic MRs were identified as those regulators whose activities were most important in predicting their respective phenotypes using random forest modeling. While eQTLs were typically more significant than aQTLs in <i>cis</i>, the opposite was true among candidate MRs in <i>trans</i>. Several GWAS loci colocalized with MR <i>trans</i>-eQTLs/aQTLs in the absence of colocalized <i>cis</i>-QTLs. Intriguingly, at the 1p36.1 BMI GWAS locus the <i>EPHB2 cis</i>-aQTL was stronger than its <i>cis</i>-eQTL and colocalized with the GWAS signal and 35 BMI MR <i>trans</i>-aQTLs, suggesting the GWAS signal may be mediated by effects on <i>EPHB2</i> activity and its downstream effects on a network of BMI MRs. These MR and aQTL analyses represent systems genetic methods that may be broadly applied to supplement standard eQTL analyses for suggesting molecular effects mediating GWAS signals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparative genomic analysis reveals varying levels of mammalian adaptation to coronavirus infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sean B. King, Mona Singh</p>

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, is of zoonotic origin. Evolutionary analyses assessing whether coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 infected ancestral species of modern-day animal hosts could be useful in identifying additional reservoirs of potentially dangerous coronaviruses. We reasoned that if a clade of species has been repeatedly exposed to a virus, then their proteins relevant for viral entry may exhibit adaptations that affect host susceptibility or response. We perform comparative analyses across the mammalian phylogeny of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in order to uncover evidence for selection acting at its binding interface with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We uncover that in rodents there is evidence for adaptive amino acid substitutions at positions comprising the ACE2-spike interaction interface, whereas the variation within ACE2 proteins in primates and some other mammalian clades is not consistent with evolutionary adaptations. We also analyze aminopeptidase N (APN), the receptor for the human coronavirus 229E, a virus that causes the common cold, and find evidence for adaptation in primates. Altogether, our results suggest that the rodent and primate lineages may have had ancient exposures to viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Perspectives for the reconstruction of 3D chromatin conformation using single cell Hi-C data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pavel I. Kos, Aleksandra A. Galitsyna, Sergey V. Ulianov, Mikhail S. Gelfand, Sergey V. Razin, Alexander V. Chertovich</p>

Construction of chromosomes 3D models based on single cell Hi-C data constitute an important challenge. We present a reconstruction approach, DPDchrom, that incorporates basic knowledge whether the reconstructed conformation should be coil-like or globular and spring relaxation at contact sites. In contrast to previously published protocols, DPDchrom can naturally form globular conformation due to the presence of explicit solvent. Benchmarking of this and several other methods on artificial polymer models reveals similar reconstruction accuracy at high contact density and DPDchrom advantage at low contact density. To compare 3D structures insensitively to spatial orientation and scale, we propose the Modified Jaccard Index. We analyzed two sources of the contact dropout: contact radius change and random contact sampling. We found that the reconstruction accuracy exponentially depends on the number of contacts per genomic bin allowing to estimate the reconstruction accuracy in advance. We applied DPDchrom to model chromosome configurations based on single-cell Hi-C data of mouse oocytes and found that these configurations differ significantly from a random one, that is consistent with other studies.

Over the past decade, biomarker discovery has become a key goal in psychiatry to aid in the more reliable diagnosis and prognosis of heterogeneous psychiatric conditions and the development of tailored therapies. Nevertheless, the prevailing statistical approach is still the mean group comparison between “cases” and “controls,” which tends to ignore within-group variability. In this educational article, we used empirical data simulations to investigate how effect size, sample size, and the shape of distributions impact the interpretation of mean group differences for biomarker discovery. We then applied these statistical criteria to evaluate biomarker discovery in one area of psychiatric research—autism research. Across the most influential areas of autism research, effect size estimates ranged from small (<i>d</i> = 0.21, anatomical structure) to medium (<i>d</i> = 0.36 electrophysiology, <i>d</i> = 0.5, eye-tracking) to large (<i>d</i> = 1.1 theory of mind). We show that in normal distributions, this translates to approximately 45% to 63% of cases performing within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the typical range, i.e., they do not have a deficit/atypicality in a statistical sense. For a measure to have diagnostic utility as defined by 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity, Cohen’s <i>d</i> of 1.66 is required, with still 40% of cases falling within 1 SD. However, in both normal and nonnormal distributions, 1 (skewness) or 2 (platykurtic, bimodal) biologically plausible subgroups may exist despite small or even nonsignificant mean group differences. This conclusion drastically contrasts the way mean group differences are frequently reported. Over 95% of studies omitted the “on average” when summarising their findings in their abstracts (“autistic people have deficits in X”), which can be misleading as it implies that the group-level difference applies to all individuals in that group. We outline practical approaches and steps for researchers to explore mean group comparisons for the discovery of stratification biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Attention controls multisensory perception via 2 distinct mechanisms at different levels of the cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ambra Ferrari, Uta Noppeney</p>

To form a percept of the multisensory world, the brain needs to integrate signals from common sources weighted by their reliabilities and segregate those from independent sources. Previously, we have shown that anterior parietal cortices combine sensory signals into representations that take into account the signals’ causal structure (i.e., common versus independent sources) and their sensory reliabilities as predicted by Bayesian causal inference. The current study asks to what extent and how attentional mechanisms can actively control how sensory signals are combined for perceptual inference. In a pre- and postcueing paradigm, we presented observers with audiovisual signals at variable spatial disparities. Observers were precued to attend to auditory or visual modalities prior to stimulus presentation and postcued to report their perceived auditory or visual location. Combining psychophysics, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and Bayesian modelling, we demonstrate that the brain moulds multisensory inference via 2 distinct mechanisms. Prestimulus attention to vision enhances the reliability and influence of visual inputs on spatial representations in visual and posterior parietal cortices. Poststimulus report determines how parietal cortices flexibly combine sensory estimates into spatial representations consistent with Bayesian causal inference. Our results show that distinct neural mechanisms control how signals are combined for perceptual inference at different levels of the cortical hierarchy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of astroglia-like cardiac nexus glia that are critical regulators of cardiac development and function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina L. Kikel-Coury, Jacob P. Brandt, Isabel A. Correia, Michael R. O’Dea, Dana F. DeSantis, Felicity Sterling, Kevin Vaughan, Gulberk Ozcebe, Pinar Zorlutuna, Cody J. Smith</p>

Glial cells are essential for functionality of the nervous system. Growing evidence underscores the importance of astrocytes; however, analogous astroglia in peripheral organs are poorly understood. Using confocal time-lapse imaging, fate mapping, and mutant genesis in a zebrafish model, we identify a neural crest–derived glial cell, termed nexus glia, which utilizes Meteorin signaling via Jak/Stat3 to drive differentiation and regulate heart rate and rhythm. Nexus glia are labeled with <i>gfap</i>, <i>glast</i>, and <i>glutamine synthetase</i>, markers that typically denote astroglia cells. Further, analysis of single-cell sequencing datasets of human and murine hearts across ages reveals astrocyte-like cells, which we confirm through a multispecies approach. We show that cardiac nexus glia at the outflow tract are critical regulators of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system. These data establish the crucial role of glia on cardiac homeostasis and provide a description of nexus glia in the PNS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mobile banking adoption and usage among Generation Y Malaysians [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: By 2018, Malaysian mobile banking services made the third-largest amount of banking transactions, following credit card and Internet banking. In addition, it significantly contributes to the banking industry by providing easier transactions to banking consumers. This study examined factors affecting the intention to use, and the actual use of mobile banking services in Malaysia. Methods: Two main theories of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (extended version, UTAUT2), and the model of perceived risk, were used to propose a modified framework. Based on the non-probability sampling method, the data were collected from 504 respondents. The data vas analyzed using SPSS and PLS-SEM to derive the findings. Results: The study's findings revealed that the independent variables could explain 55.3% of the variance in mobile banking use and 60.3% of variance in intention to use variables. Moreover, it demonstrated that common factors that have significantly affected the actual use and intention to use mobile banking were habit, facilitating condition, and interface design quality. In contrast, perceived risk and intention to use were found to only have significant impacts on the use of mobile banking, while effort expectancy was found to only have a significant impact on the intention to use. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide significant new knowledge on mobile banking, from which mobile banking providers and interface designers can develop potential solutions to increase the usage of mobile banking services in Malaysia. However, using a qualitative method, the proposed model could only explain 55% of actual use and 60% of intentional use. Thus, additional variables and qualitative techniques may help increase the understanding on the actual use and intention to use.

                Background: Supracondylar humeral fracture (SHF) is the most common type of fracture in children. Moreover, lateral and posterior surgical approaches are the most frequently chosen approaches for open reduction surgery in displaced SHF when C-arm is unavailable. However, previous literature showed mixed findings regarding functional and cosmetic outcomes. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has compared these two procedures.  Methods: Our protocol was registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021213763). We conducted a comprehensive electronic database search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Two independent reviewers screened the title and abstract, followed by full-text reading and study selection based on eligibility criteria. The quality of the selected studies was analyzed with the ROBINS-I tool. Meta-analysis was carried out to compare the range of motion (functional outcome) and cosmetic outcome according to Flynn’s criteria. This systematic review was conducted based on PRISMA and Cochrane handbook guidelines.  Results: Our initial search yielded 163 studies, from which we included five comparative studies comprising 231 children in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.69, 95% CI [0.97-2.93]) and good (OR 1.12, 95% CI [0.61-2.04]) functional outcomes and less likely to result in fair (OR 0.84, 95% CI [0.34-2.13]) and poor (OR 0.42, 95% CI [0.1-1.73]) functional outcomes compared to the posterior approach. In terms of cosmetic results, both approaches showed mixed findings. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.11, 95% CI [0.61-2.02]) and fair (OR 1.18, 95% CI [0.49-2.80]) but less likely to result in good (OR 0.79, 95% CI [0.40-1.55]) cosmetic outcomes. However, none of these analyses were statistically significant (p> 0.05).  Conclusion: Lateral and posterior surgical approaches resulted in satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcomes. The two approaches are comparable for treating SHF in children when evaluated with Flynn’s criteria.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of disease modifying therapies on immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Four hundred seventy-three people with MS provided one or more dried blood spot samples. Information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccine history, medical, and drug history were extracted from questionnaires and medical records. Dried blood spots were eluted and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody titers were partitioned into tertiles with people on no disease modifying therapy as a reference. We calculated the odds ratio of seroconversion (univariate logistic regression) and compared quantitative vaccine response (Kruskal Wallis) following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine according to disease modifying therapy. We used regression modeling to explore the effect of vaccine timing, treatment duration, age, vaccine type, and lymphocyte count on vaccine response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio = 0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01–0.06, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01–0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. All other drugs did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Both time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly associated with the response to the vaccination. The vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. Preliminary data on cellular T-cell immunity showed 40% of seronegative subjects had measurable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some disease modifying therapies convey risk of attenuated serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

A core process in plant evolution has been the transfer of chloroplast-encoded genes to the nuclear genome. We propose reverting this process as a new approach to improve plant disease resistance and photosynthesis in future crops.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neural circuit for flexible control of persistent behavioral states</a></h4>

              
                To adapt to their environments, animals must generate behaviors that are closely aligned to a rapidly changing sensory world. However, behavioral states such as foraging or courtship typically persist over long time scales to ensure proper execution. It remains unclear how neural circuits generate persistent behavioral states while maintaining the flexibility to select among alternative states when the sensory context changes. Here, we elucidate the functional architecture of a neural circuit controlling the choice between roaming and dwelling states, which underlie exploration and exploitation during foraging in <i>C. elegans</i>. By imaging ensemble-level neural activity in freely-moving animals, we identify stereotyped changes in circuit activity corresponding to each behavioral state. Combining circuit-wide imaging with genetic analysis, we find that mutual inhibition between two antagonistic neuromodulatory systems underlies the persistence and mutual exclusivity of the neural activity patterns observed in each state. Through machine learning analysis and circuit perturbations, we identify a sensory processing neuron that can transmit information about food odors to both the roaming and dwelling circuits and bias the animal towards different states in different sensory contexts, giving rise to context-appropriate state transitions. Our findings reveal a potentially general circuit architecture that enables flexible, sensory-driven control of persistent behavioral states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pan-genome analysis identifies intersecting roles for Pseudomonas specialized metabolites in potato pathogen inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Agricultural soil harbors a diverse microbiome that can form beneficial relationships with plants, including the inhibition of plant pathogens. <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. are one of the most abundant bacterial genera in the soil and rhizosphere and play important roles in promoting plant health. However, the genetic determinants of this beneficial activity are only partially understood. Here, we genetically and phenotypically characterize the <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> population in a commercial potato field, where we identify strong correlations between specialized metabolite biosynthesis and antagonism of the potato pathogens <i>Streptomyces scabies</i> and <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Genetic and chemical analyses identified hydrogen cyanide and cyclic lipopeptides as key specialized metabolites associated with <i>S. scabies</i> inhibition, which was supported by <i>in planta</i> biocontrol experiments. We show that a single potato field contains a hugely diverse and dynamic population of <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria, whose capacity to produce specialized metabolites is shaped both by plant colonization and defined environmental inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct higher-order representations of natural sounds in human and ferret auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Little is known about how neural representations of natural sounds differ across species. For example, speech and music play a unique role in human hearing, yet it is unclear how auditory representations of speech and music differ between humans and other animals. Using functional ultrasound imaging, we measured responses in ferrets to a set of natural and spectrotemporally matched synthetic sounds previously tested in humans. Ferrets showed similar lower-level frequency and modulation tuning to that observed in humans. But while humans showed substantially larger responses to natural vs. synthetic speech and music in non-primary regions, ferret responses to natural and synthetic sounds were closely matched throughout primary and non-primary auditory cortex, even when tested with ferret vocalizations. This finding reveals that auditory representations in humans and ferrets diverge sharply at late stages of cortical processing, potentially driven by higher-order processing demands in speech and music.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Whole-brain connectivity atlas of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the mouse dorsal and median raphe nuclei</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and median raphe nucleus (MR) contain populations of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that regulate diverse behavioral functions. However, their whole-brain input-output circuits remain incompletely elucidated. We used viral tracing combined with fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography to generate a comprehensive whole-brain atlas of inputs and outputs of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the DR and MR. We found that these neurons received inputs from similar upstream brain regions. The glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus had divergent projection patterns with differences in critical brain regions. Specifically, MR glutamatergic neurons projected to the lateral habenula through multiple pathways. Correlation and cluster analysis revealed that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus received heterogeneous inputs and sent different collateral projections. This connectivity atlas further elucidates the anatomical architecture of the raphe nuclei, which could facilitate better understanding of their behavioral functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hydrogen sulfide blocks HIV rebound by maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental challenge in HIV eradication is to understand how the virus establishes latency, maintains stable cellular reservoirs, and promotes rebound upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in HIV latency and reactivation. We show that reactivation of HIV-1 is associated with down-regulation of the key H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzyme cystathionine-g-lyase (CTH) and reduction in endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S. Genetic silencing of CTH disrupts redox homeostasis, impairs mitochondrial function, and remodels the transcriptome of latent cells to trigger HIV reactivation. Chemical complementation of CTH activity using a slow-releasing H<sub>2</sub>S donor, GYY4137, suppressed HIV reactivation and diminished virus replication. Mechanistically, GYY4137 blocked HIV reactivation by inducing the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting NF-kB, and recruiting the epigenetic silencer, YY1, to the HIV promoter. In latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from ART-suppressed human subjects, GYY4137 in combination with ART prevented viral rebound and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, prolonged exposure to GYY4137 exhibited no adverse influence on proviral content or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, indicating that diminished viral rebound is due to a loss of transcription rather than a selective loss of infected cells. In summary, this work provides mechanistic insight into H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated suppression of viral rebound and suggests exploration of H<sub>2</sub>S donors to maintain HIV in a latent form.

                Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. Even though great advances in the last decades have allowed better delineation of its pathogenetic mechanisms, its cellular and molecular bases are still poorly understood. To evaluate the consequences of chromosome aneuploidy on the hippocampus, we analyzed single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of the DS mouse model Ts65Dn. Our data revealed abnormal cell composition specifically of the Ts65Dn dentate gyrus and of specific subtypes of interneurons, without major changes in CA1 or CA3. We found that trisomy results in a highly cell-type specific global alteration of the transcriptome and detected previously undefined differentially expressed genes in specific neuronal populations. We identified the long-non-coding gene Snhg11 to be specifically downregulated in the trisomic dentate gyrus and provide evidence for its involvement in hippocampal-dependent cognitive phenotypes, possibly contributed by impaired adult neurogenesis.

                Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus of global concern. ZIKV infection of the central nervous system has been linked to a variety of clinical syndromes, including microcephaly in fetuses and rare but serious neurologic disease in adults. However, the potential for ZIKV to influence brain physiology and host behavior following recovery from apparently mild or subclinical infection is less well understood. Furthermore, though deficits in cognitive function are well-documented following recovery from neuroinvasive viral infection, the potential impact of ZIKV on other host behavioral domains has not been thoroughly explored. In our study, we performed transcriptomic profiling of primary neuron cultures following ZIKV infection, which revealed altered expression of key genes associated with major psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Gene ontology enrichment analysis also revealed significant changes in gene expression associated with fundamental neurobiological processes, including neuronal development, neurotransmission, and others. These alterations to neurologic gene expression were also observed in the brain in vivo using an immunocompetent mouse model of ZIKV infection. Mechanistic studies identified TNF- signaling via TNFR1 as a major regulatory mechanism controlling ZIKV-induced changes to neurologic gene expression. Our studies reveal that cell-intrinsic innate immune responses to ZIKV infection profoundly shape neuronal transcriptional profiles, highlighting the need to further explore associations between ZIKV infection and disordered host behavioral states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain state and cortical layer-specific mechanisms underlying perception at threshold</a></h4>

              
                Identical stimuli can be perceived or go unnoticed across successive presentations, producing divergent behavioral readouts despite similarities in sensory input. We hypothesized that fluctuations in neurophysiological states in the sensory neocortex, which could alter cortical processing at the level of neural subpopulations, underlies this perceptual variability. We analyzed cortical layer-specific electrophysiological activity in visual area V4 during a cued attention task. We find that hit trials are characterized by a larger pupil diameter and lower incidence of microsaccades, indicative of a behavioral state with increased arousal and perceptual stability. Target stimuli presented at perceptual threshold evoke elevated multi-unit activity in V4 neurons in hit trials compared to miss trials, across all cortical layers. Putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons are strongly positively modulated in the input (IV) and deep (V & VI) layers of the cortex during hit trials. Excitatory neurons in the superficial cortical layers exhibit lower variability in hit trials. Deep layer neurons are less phase-locked to low frequency rhythms in hits. Hits are also characterized by greater interlaminar coherence between the superficial and deep layers in the pre-stimulus period, and a complementary pattern between the input layer and both the superficial and deep layers in the stimulus-evoked period. Taken together, these results indicate that a state of elevated levels of arousal and perceptual stability allow enhanced processing of sensory stimuli, which contributes to hits at perceptual threshold.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Complementary population codes in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus during associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Memories are multifaceted and layered, incorporating external stimuli and internal states, and at multiple levels of resolution. Although the hippocampus is essential for memory, it remains unclear if distinct aspects of experience are encoded within different hippocampal subnetworks during learning. By tracking the same dCA1 or vCA1 neurons across cue-outcome learning, we find detailed and externally based (stimulus identity) representations in dCA1, and broad and internally based (stimulus relevance) signals in vCA1 that emerge with learning. These dorsoventral differences were observed regardless of cue modality or outcome valence, and representations within each region were largely stable for days after learning. These results identify how the hippocampus encodes associative memories, and show that hippocampal ensembles not only link experiences, but also imbue relationships with meaning and highlight behaviorally relevant information. Together, these complementary dynamics across hippocampal subnetworks allow for rich, diverse representation of experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The natural frequencies of the resting human brain: an MEG-based atlas</a></h4>

              
                Brain oscillations are considered to play a pivotal role in neural communication. However, detailed information regarding the typical oscillatory patterns of individual brain regions is surprisingly scarce. In this study we applied a multivariate data-driven approach to create an atlas of the natural frequencies of the resting human brain on a voxel-by-voxel basis. We analysed resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 128 healthy adult volunteers obtained from the Open MEG Archive (OMEGA). Spectral power was computed in source space in 500 ms steps for 82 frequency bins logarithmically spaced from 1.7 to 99.5 Hz. We then applied k-means clustering to detect characteristic spectral profiles and to eventually identify the natural frequency of each voxel. Our results revealed a region-specific organisation of intrinsic oscillatory activity, following both a medial-to-lateral and a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasing frequency. In particular, medial fronto-temporal regions were characterised by slow rhythms (delta/theta). Posterior regions presented natural frequencies in the alpha band, although with differentiated generators in the precuneus and in sensory-specific cortices (i.e., visual and auditory). Somatomotor regions were distinguished by the mu rhythm, while the lateral prefrontal cortex was characterised by oscillations in the high beta range (>20 Hz). Importantly, the brain map of natural frequencies was highly replicable in two independent subsamples of individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive atlas of ongoing oscillatory activity performed to date. Furthermore, the identification of natural frequencies is a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the functional architecture of the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anticipatory dynamics in the human brain guide foraging for primary rewards</a></h4>

              
                Foraging is a fundamental food-seeking behavior in a wide range of species that enables survival in an uncertain world. During foraging, behavioral agents constantly face a trade-off between staying in their current location or exploring another. Despite ethological generality and importance of foraging, it remains unclear how the human brain guides continuous decision in such situations. Here we show that anticipatory activity dynamics in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) and hippocampus underpin foraging for primary rewards. While functional MRI was performed, humans foraged for real liquid rewards available after tens of seconds, and continuous decision during foraging was tracked by a dynamic pattern of brain activity that reflected anticipation of a future reward. When the dynamic anticipatory activity in the aPFC was enhanced, humans remained in their current environment, but when this activity diminished, they explored a new environment. Moreover, the anticipatory activity in the aPFC and hippocampus was associated with distinct decision strategies: aPFC activity was enhanced in humans adopting an exploratory strategy, whereas those remaining stationary showed enhanced activity in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that anticipatory dynamics in the fronto-hippocampal mechanisms underlie continuous decision-making during human foraging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Mechanisms of Learning are Critically Dependent on Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep supports memory consolidation as well as next-day learning. The Active Systems account of offline consolidation suggests that sleep-associated memory processing paves the way for new learning, but empirical evidence in support of this idea is scarce. Using a within-subjects, crossover design, we assessed behavioural and electrophysiological indices of episodic encoding after a night of sleep or total sleep deprivation in healthy adult humans (aged 18-25 years), and investigated whether the behavioural measures were predicted by the overnight consolidation of episodic associations formed the previous day. Sleep supported memory consolidation and next-day learning, as compared to sleep deprivation. However, the magnitude of this sleep-associated consolidation benefit did not significantly predict the ability to form novel memories after sleep. Interestingly, sleep deprivation prompted a qualitative change in the neural signature of encoding: whereas 12-20 Hz beta desynchronization - an established EEG marker of successful encoding - was observed after sleep, sleep deprivation disrupted beta desynchrony during successful learning. Taken together, our findings suggest that effective learning mechanisms are critically dependent on sleep, but not necessarily sleep-associated consolidation.

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to record the brain’s evoked and induced electrical activity from the scalp. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, are increasingly being applied to EEG data for pattern analysis, group membership classification, and brain-computer interface purposes. This study aimed to systematically review recent advances in ML and DL supervised models for decoding and classifying EEG signals. Moreover, this article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques used for EEG signal preprocessing and feature extraction. To this end, several academic databases were searched to explore relevant studies from the year 2000 to the present. Our results showed that the application of ML and DL in both mental workload and motor imagery tasks has received substantial attention in recent years. A total of 75% of DL studies applied convolutional neural networks with various learning algorithms, and 36% of ML studies achieved competitive accuracy by using a support vector machine algorithm. Wavelet transform was found to be the most common feature extraction method used for all types of tasks. We further examined the specific feature extraction methods and end classifier recommendations discovered in this systematic review.</p>

	<p>In the present study, we investigated if individuals with neurogenic speech sound impairments of three types, Parkinson’s dysarthria, apraxia of speech, and aphasic phonological impairment, accommodate their speech to the natural speech rhythm of an auditory model, and if so, whether the effect is more significant after hearing metrically regular sentences as compared to those with an irregular pattern. This question builds on theories of rhythmic entrainment, assuming that sensorimotor predictions of upcoming events allow humans to synchronize their actions with an external rhythm. To investigate entrainment effects, we conducted a sentence completion task relating participants’ response latencies to the spoken rhythm of the prime heard immediately before. A further research question was if the perceived rhythm interacts with the rhythm of the participants’ own productions, i.e., the trochaic or iambic stress pattern of disyllabic target words. For a control group of healthy speakers, our study revealed evidence for entrainment when trochaic target words were preceded by regularly stressed prime sentences. Persons with Parkinson’s dysarthria showed a pattern similar to that of the healthy individuals. For the patient groups with apraxia of speech and with phonological impairment, considerably longer response latencies with differing patterns were observed. Trochaic target words were initiated with significantly shorter latencies, whereas the metrical regularity of prime sentences had no consistent impact on response latencies and did not interact with the stress pattern of the target words to be produced. The absence of an entrainment in these patients may be explained by the more severe difficulties in initiating speech at all. We discuss the results in terms of clinical implications for diagnostics and therapy in neurogenic speech disorders.</p>

	<p>We aim to investigate whether EEG dynamics differ in adults with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) and ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) compared with healthy subjects during the performance of an innovative cognitive task, Aristotle’s valid and invalid syllogisms, and how these differences correlate with brain regions and behavioral data for each subject. We recorded EEGs from 14 scalp electrodes (channels) in 21 adults with ADHD, 21 with ASD, and 21 healthy, normal subjects. The subjects were exposed in a set of innovative cognitive tasks (inducing varying cognitive loads), Aristotle’s two types of syllogism mentioned above. A set of 39 questions were given to participants related to valid–invalid syllogisms as well as a separate set of questionnaires, in order to collect a number of demographic and behavioral data, with the aim of detecting shared information with values of a feature extracted from EEG, the multiscale entropy (MSE), in the 14 channels (‘brain regions’). MSE, a nonlinear information-theoretic measure of complexity, was computed to extract a feature that quantifies the complexity of the EEG. Behavior-Partial Least Squares Correlation, PLSC, is the method to detect the correlation between two sets of data, brain, and behavioral measures. -PLSC, a variant of PLSC, was applied to build a functional connectivity of the brain regions involved in the reasoning tasks. Graph-theoretic measures were used to quantify the complexity of the functional networks. Based on the results of the analysis described in this work, a mixed 14 × 2 × 3 ANOVA showed significant main effects of&amp;amp;nbsp;group factor and brain region* syllogism&amp;amp;nbsp;factor, as well as a significant brain region* group interaction. There are significant differences between the means of MSE (complexity) values at the 14 channels of the members of the ‘pathological’ groups of participants, i.e., between ASD and ADHD, while the difference in means of MSE between both ASD and ADHD and that of the control group is not significant. In conclusion, the valid–invalid type of syllogism generates significantly different complexity values, MSE, between ASD and ADHD. The complexity of activated brain regions of ASD participants increased significantly when switching from a valid to an invalid syllogism, indicating the need for more resources to ‘face’ the task escalating difficulty in ASD subjects. This increase is not so evident in both ADHD and control. Statistically significant differences were found also in the behavioral response of ASD and ADHD, compared with those of control subjects, based on the principal brain and behavior saliences extracted by PLSC. Specifically, two behavioral measures, the emotional state and the degree of confidence of participants in answering questions in Aristotle’s valid–invalid syllogisms, and one demographic variable, age, statistically and significantly discriminate the three groups’ ASD. The seed-PLC generated functional connectivity networks for ASD, ADHD, and control, were ‘projected’ on the regions of the Default Mode Network (DMN), the ‘reference’ connectivity, of which the structural changes were found significant in distinguishing the three groups. The contribution of this work lies in the examination of the relationship between brain activity and behavioral responses of healthy and ‘pathological’ participants in the case of cognitive reasoning of the type of Aristotle’s valid and invalid syllogisms, using PLSC, a machine learning approach combined with MSE, a nonlinear method of extracting a feature based on EEGs that captures a broad spectrum of EEGs linear and nonlinear characteristics. The results seem promising in adopting this type of reasoning, in the future, after further enhancements and experimental tests, as a supplementary instrument towards examining the differences in brain activity and behavioral responses of ASD and ADHD patients. The application of the combination of these two methods, after further elaboration and testing as new and complementary to the existing ones, may be considered as a tool of analysis in helping detecting more effectively such types of disorders.</p>

	<p>System-specific brain responses—time-locked to rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep—are characteristically widespread, with robust and clear activation in the primary visual cortex and other structures involved in multisensory integration. This pattern suggests that REMs underwrite hierarchical processing of visual information in a time-locked manner, where REMs index the generation and scanning of virtual-world models, through multisensory integration in dreaming—as in awake states. Default mode network (DMN) activity increases during rest and reduces during various tasks including visual perception. The implicit anticorrelation between the DMN and task-positive network (TPN)—that persists in REM sleep—prompted us to focus on DMN responses to temporally-precise REM events. We timed REMs during sleep from the video recordings and quantified the neural correlates of REMs—using functional MRI (fMRI)—in 24 independent studies of 11 healthy participants. A reanalysis of these data revealed that the cortical areas exempt from widespread REM-locked brain activation were restricted to the DMN. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a modest temporally-precise REM-locked decrease—phasic deactivation—in key DMN nodes, in a subset of independent studies. These results are consistent with hierarchical predictive coding; namely, permissive deactivation of DMN at the top of the hierarchy (leading to the widespread cortical activation at lower levels; especially the primary visual cortex). Additional findings indicate REM-locked cerebral vasodilation and suggest putative mechanisms for dream forgetting.</p>

	<p>Background: as the most common malignancy of the central nervous system, low-grade glioma (LGG) patients suffered a poor prognosis. Tumor microenvironment, especially immune components, plays an important role in the progression of tumors. Thus, it is critical to explore the key immune-related genes, a comprehensive understanding of the TME in LGG helps us find novel cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: the GPSM3 expression level and the correlations between clinical characteristics and GPSM3 levels were analyzed with the data from CGGA and TCGA dataset. Univariate and multivariate cox regression model were built to predict the prognosis of LGG patients with multiple factors. Then the correlation between GPSM3 with immune cell infiltration was explored by ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and TIMER2.0. At last, the correlation analyzed between GPSM3 expression and immune checkpoint related genes were also analyzed. Results: GPSM3 expression was overexpressed in LGG and negatively correlated to the GPSM3 DNA methylation. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that GPSM3 expression was an independent prognostic factor in LGG patients. Functional characterization of GPSM3 revealed that it was associated with many immune processes to tumor cells. GPSM3 expression was positive related to the immune score, Stromal scores and ESTIMATE scores, but negative related to the Tumor purity. Immune features in the TME of GPSM3-high LGG group is characterized by a higher infiltrating of regulatory T cells, neutrophils, macrophages M2, and a lower proportion of monocytes than to the GPSM3-low group. Furthermore, GPSM3 expression exhibited significant correlations with the immune checkpoint-related genes, especially PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4 and TIM3. Conclusions: these findings proved that GPSM3 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential immunotherapy target for LGG.</p>

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are used in clinical and cognitive neuroscience to induce a mild magnetic or electric field in the brain to modulate behavior and cortical activation. Despite the great body of literature demonstrating promising results, unexpected or even paradoxical outcomes are sometimes observed. This might be due either to technical and methodological issues (e.g., stimulation parameters, stimulated brain area), or to participants’ expectations and beliefs before and during the stimulation sessions. In this narrative review, we present some studies showing that placebo and nocebo effects, associated with positive and negative expectations, respectively, could be present in NIBS trials, both in experimental and in clinical settings. The lack of systematic evaluation of subjective expectations and beliefs before and after stimulation could represent a caveat that overshadows the potential contribution of placebo and nocebo effects in the outcome of NIBS trials.</p>

	<p>An increasing number of people around the world communicate in more than one language, resulting in them having to make decisions in a foreign language on a daily basis. Interestingly, a burgeoning body of literature suggests that people’s decision-making is affected by whether they are reasoning in their native language (NL) or their foreign language (FL). According to the foreign language effect (FLe), people are less susceptible to bias in many decision-making tasks and more likely to display utilitarian cost-benefit analysis in moral decision-making when reasoning in a FL. While these differences have often been attributed to a reduced emotionality in the FL, an emerging body of literature has started to test the extent to which these could be attributable to increased deliberation in the FL. The present study tests whether increased deliberation leads to a FLe on cognitive reflection in a population of older adults (Mage = 65.1), from the successful aging project in Umeå, Sweden. We explored whether performance on a 6-item version of the cognitive reflection test (CRT) adapted to Swedish would differ between participants for whom Swedish was their NL and those for whom Swedish was their FL. The CRT is a task designed to elicit an incorrect, intuitive answer. In order to override the intuitive answer, one requires engaging in deliberative, analytical thinking to determine the correct answer. Therefore, we hypothesized that if thinking in a FL increases deliberation, then those performing the task in their FL would exhibit higher accuracy rates than those performing in their NL. Our results showed that age and level of education predicted performance on the task but performance on the CRT did not differ between the NL and the FL groups. In addition, in the FL group, proficiency in the FL was not related to performance in the CRT. Our results, therefore, do not provide evidence that thinking in a FL increases deliberation in a group of older adults performing a logical reasoning task that is not typically associated with an emotional connotation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">From Progenitors to Progeny: Shaping Striatal Circuit Development and Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding how neurons of the striatum are formed and integrate into complex synaptic circuits is essential to provide insight into striatal function in health and disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the development of striatal neurons and associated circuits with a focus on their embryonic origin. Specifically, we address the role of distinct types of embryonic progenitors, found in the proliferative zones of the ganglionic eminences in the ventral telencephalon, in the generation of diverse striatal interneurons and projection neurons. Indeed, recent evidence would suggest that embryonic progenitor origin dictates key characteristics of postnatal cells, including their neurochemical content, their location within striatum, and their long-range synaptic inputs. We also integrate recent observations regarding embryonic progenitors in cortical and other regions and discuss how this might inform future research on the ganglionic eminences. Last, we examine how embryonic progenitor dysfunction can alter striatal formation, as exemplified in Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorder, and how increased understanding of embryonic progenitors can have significant implications for future research directions and the development of improved therapeutic options.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This review highlights recently defined novel roles for embryonic progenitor cells in shaping the functional properties of both projection neurons and interneurons of the striatum. It outlines the developmental mechanisms that guide neuronal development from progenitors in the embryonic ganglionic eminences to progeny in the striatum. Where questions remain open, we integrate observations from cortex and other regions to present possible avenues for future research. Last, we provide a progenitor-centric perspective onto both Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorder. We suggest that future investigations and manipulations of embryonic progenitor cells in both research and clinical settings will likely require careful consideration of their great intrinsic diversity and neurogenic potential.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Glycine Release Is Potentiated by cAMP via EPAC2 and Ca2+ Stores in a Retinal Interneuron</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuromodulation via the intracellular second messenger cAMP is ubiquitous at presynaptic nerve terminals. This modulation of synaptic transmission allows exocytosis to adapt to stimulus levels and reliably encode information. The AII amacrine cell (AII-AC) is a central hub for signal processing in the mammalian retina. The main apical dendrite of the AII-AC is connected to several lobular appendages that release glycine onto OFF cone bipolar cells and ganglion cells. However, the influence of cAMP on glycine release is not well understood. Using membrane capacitance measurements from mouse AII-ACs to directly measure exocytosis, we observe that intracellular dialysis of 1 m<scp>m</scp> cAMP enhances exocytosis without affecting the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Responses to depolarizing pulses of various durations show that the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles nearly doubles with cAMP, while paired-pulse depression experiments suggest that release probability does not change. Specific agonists and antagonists for exchange protein activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) revealed that the cAMP-induced enhancement of exocytosis requires EPAC2 activation. Furthermore, intact Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores were also necessary for the cAMP potentiation of exocytosis. Postsynaptic recordings from OFF cone bipolar cells showed that increasing cAMP with forskolin potentiated the frequency of glycinergic spontaneous IPSCs. We propose that cAMP elevations in the AII-AC lead to a robust enhancement of glycine release through an EPAC2 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> store signaling pathway. Our results thus contribute to a better understanding of how AII-AC crossover inhibitory circuits adapt to changes in ambient luminance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian retina operates over a wide dynamic range of light intensities and contrast levels. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of processed visual information, both excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the retina must modulate their gain in synaptic transmission to adapt to different levels of ambient light. Here we show that increases of cAMP concentration within AII amacrine cells produce enhanced exocytosis from these glycinergic interneurons. Therefore, we propose that light-sensitive neuromodulators may change the output of glycine release from AII amacrine cells. This novel mechanism may fine-tune the amount of tonic and phasic synaptic inhibition received by bipolar cell terminals and, consequently, the spiking patterns that ganglion cells send to the upstream visual areas of the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Endocannabinoids Tune Intrinsic Excitability in O-LM Interneurons by Direct Modulation of Postsynaptic Kv7 Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>KCNQ-Kv7 channels are found at the axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons, where they control cell firing and membrane potential. In oriens lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, these channels are mainly expressed in the dendrites, suggesting a peculiar function of Kv7 channels in these neurons. Here, we show that Kv7 channel activity is upregulated following induction of presynaptic long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in O-LM interneurons from rats of both sex, thus resulting in a synergistic long-term depression of intrinsic excitability (LTD-IE). Both LTD and LTD-IE involve endocannabinoid (eCB) biosynthesis for induction. However, although LTD is dependent on cannabinoid type 1 receptors, LTD-IE is not. Molecular modeling shows a strong interaction of eCBs with Kv7.2/3 channel, suggesting a persistent action of these lipids on Kv7 channel activity. Our data thus unveil a major role for eCB synthesis in triggering both synaptic and intrinsic depression in O-LM interneurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In principal cells, Kv7 channels are essentially located at the axon initial segment. In contrast, in O-LM interneurons, Kv7 channels are highly expressed in the dendrites, suggesting a singular role of these channels in O-LM cell function. Here, we show that LTD of excitatory inputs in O-LM interneurons is associated with an upregulation of Kv7 channels, thus resulting in a synergistic LTD of LTD-IE. Both forms of plasticity are mediated by the biosynthesis of eCBs. Stimulation of CB1 receptors induces LTD, whereas the direct interaction of eCBs with Kv7 channels induces LTD-IE. Our results thus provide a previously unexpected involvement of eCBs in long-lasting plasticity of intrinsic excitability in GABAergic interneurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurokinin B-Expressing Neurons of the Central Extended Amygdala Mediate Inhibitory Synaptic Input onto Melanin-Concentrating Hormone Neuron Subpopulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) is a highly conserved brain region critical for maintaining physiological homeostasis and goal-directed behavior. LHA neurons that express melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are key regulators of arousal, energy balance, and motivated behavior. However, cellular and functional diversity among LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons is not well understood. Previous anatomic and molecular data suggest that LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons may be parsed into at least two distinct subpopulations, one of which is enriched in neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R), the receptor for neurokinin B (NKB), encoded by the <I>Tac2</I> gene. This tachykininergic ligand-receptor system has been implicated in reproduction, fear memory, and stress in other brain regions, but NKB interactions with LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons are poorly understood. We first identified how LHA<sup>MCH</sup> subpopulations may be distinguished anatomically and electrophysiologically. To dissect functional connectivity between NKB-expressing neurons and LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons, we used Cre-dependent retrograde and anterograde viral tracing in male <I>Tac2-</I>Cre mice and identified <I>Tac2</I>/EYFP+ neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala, the central extended amygdala, as major sources of NKB input onto LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons. In addition to innervating the LHA, these limbic forebrain NKB neurons also project to midbrain and brainstem targets. Finally, using a dual-virus approach, we found that optogenetic activation of these inputs in slices evokes GABA release onto a subset of LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons but lacked specificity for the NK3R+ subpopulation. Overall, these data define parallel tachykininergic/GABAergic limbic forebrain projections that are positioned to modulate multiple nodes of homeostatic and behavioral control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The LHA orchestrates fundamental behavioral states in the mammalian hypothalamus, including arousal, energy balance, memory, stress, and motivated behavior. The neuropeptide MCH defines one prominent population of LHA neurons, with multiple roles in the regulation of homeostatic behavior. Outstanding questions remain concerning the upstream inputs that control MCH neurons. We sought to define neurochemically distinct pathways in the mouse brain that may communicate with specific MCH neuron subpopulations using viral-based retrograde and anterograde neural pathway tracing and optogenetics in brain slices. Here, we identify a specific neuropeptide-defined forebrain circuit that makes functional synaptic connections with MCH neuron subpopulations. This work lays the foundation for further manipulating molecularly distinct neural circuits that modulate innate behavioral states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociated Role of Thalamic and Cortical Input to the Lateral Amygdala for Consolidation of Long-Term Fear Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Post-encoding coordinated reactivation of memory traces distributed throughout interconnected brain regions is thought to be critical for consolidation of memories. However, little is known about the role of neural circuit pathways during post-learning periods for consolidation of memories. To investigate this question, we optogenetically silenced the inputs from both auditory cortex and thalamus in the lateral amygdala (LA) for 15 min immediately following auditory fear conditioning (FC) and examined its effect on fear memory formation in mice of both sexes. Optogenetic inhibition of both inputs disrupted long-term fear memory formation tested 24 h after FC. This effect was specific such that the same inhibition did not affect short-term memory and context-dependent memory. Moreover, long-term memory was intact if the inputs were inhibited at much later time points after FC (3 h or 1 d after FC), indicating that optical inhibition for 15 min itself does not produce any nonspecific deleterious effect on fear memory retrieval. Selective inhibition of thalamic input was sufficient to impair consolidation of auditory fear memory. In contrast, selective inhibition of cortical input disrupted remote fear memory without affecting recent memory. These results reveal a dissociated role of thalamic and cortical input to the LA during early post-learning periods for consolidation of long-term fear memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coordinated communications between brain regions are thought to be essential during post-learning periods for consolidation of memories. However, the role of specific neural circuit pathways in this process has been scarcely explored. Using a precise optogenetic inhibition of auditory input pathways, either thalamic or cortical or both, to the LA during post-training periods, we here show that thalamic input is required for consolidation of both recent and remote fear memory, whereas cortical input is crucial for consolidation of remote fear memory. These results reveal a dissociated role of auditory input pathways to the LA for consolidation of long-term fear memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Constructing Others' Beliefs from One's Own Using Medial Frontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many daily choices are based on one's own knowledge. However, when predicting other people's behavior, we need to consider the differences between our knowledge and other people's presumed knowledge. Social agents need a mechanism to use privileged information for their own behavior but exclude it from predictions of others. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural implementation of such social and personal predictions in healthy human volunteers of both sexes by manipulating privileged and shared information. The medial frontal cortex appeared to have an important role in flexibly making decisions using privileged information for oneself or predicting others' behavior. Specifically, we show that ventromedial PFC tracked the state of the world independent of the type of decision (personal, social), whereas dorsomedial regions adjusted their frame of reference to the use of privileged or shared information. Sampling privileged evidence not available to another person also relied on specific interactions between temporoparietal junction area and frontal pole.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> What we know about the minds of others and how we use that information is crucial to understanding social interaction. Mentalizing, or reading the minds of others, is argued to be particularly well developed in the human and crucially affected in some disorders. However, the intractable nature of human interactions makes it very difficult to study these processes. Here, we present a way to objectively quantify the information people have about others and to investigate how their brain deals with this information. This shows that people use similar areas in the brain related to nonsocial decision-making when making decisions in social situations and modify this information processing by the knowledge about others use these to modify their information processing according to the knowledge of others.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Alpha Oscillations Shape Sensory Representation and Perceptual Sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alpha activity (8&ndash;14 Hz) is the dominant rhythm in the awake brain and is thought to play an important role in setting the internal state of the brain. Previous work has associated states of decreased alpha power with enhanced neural excitability. However, evidence is mixed on whether and how such excitability enhancement modulates sensory signals of interest versus noise differently, and what, if any, are the consequences for subsequent perception. Here, human subjects (male and female) performed a visual detection task in which we manipulated their decision criteria in a blockwise manner. Although our manipulation led to substantial criterion shifts, these shifts were not reflected in prestimulus alpha band changes. Rather, lower prestimulus alpha power in occipital-parietal areas improved perceptual sensitivity and enhanced information content decodable from neural activity patterns. Additionally, oscillatory alpha phase immediately before stimulus presentation modulated accuracy. Together, our results suggest that alpha band dynamics modulate sensory signals of interest more strongly than noise.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The internal state of our brain fluctuates, giving rise to variability in perception and action. Neural oscillations, most prominently in the alpha band, have been suggested to play a role in setting this internal state. Here, we show that ongoing alpha band activity in occipital-parietal regions predicts the quality of visual information decodable in neural activity patterns and subsequently the human observer's sensitivity in a visual detection task. Our results provide comprehensive evidence that visual representation is modulated by ongoing alpha band activity and advance our understanding on how, when faced with unchanging external stimuli, internal neural fluctuations influence perception and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Awareness-Dependent Normalization Framework of Visual Bottom-up Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although bottom-up attention can improve visual performance with and without awareness to the exogenous cue, whether they are governed by a common neural computation remains unclear. Using a modified Posner paradigm with backward masking, we found that the cueing effect displayed a monotonic gradient profile (Gaussian-like), both with and without awareness, whose scope, however, was significantly wider with than without awareness. This awareness-dependent scope offered us a unique opportunity to change the relative size of the attention field to the stimulus, differentially modulating the gain of attentional selection, as proposed by the normalization model of attention. Therefore, for each human subject (male and female), the stimulus size was manipulated as their respective mean attention fields with and without awareness while stimulus contrast was varied in a spatial cueing task. By measuring the gain pattern of contrast-response functions on the spatial cueing effect derived by visible or invisible cues, we observed changes in the cueing effect consonant with changes in contrast gain for visible cues and response gain for invisible cues. Importantly, a complementary analysis confirmed that subjects' awareness-dependent attention fields can be simulated by using the normalization model of attention. Together, our findings indicate an awareness-dependent normalization framework of visual bottom-up attention, placing a necessary constraint, namely, awareness, on our understanding of the neural computations underlying visual attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bottom-up attention is known to improve visual performance with and without awareness. We discovered that manipulating subjects' awareness can modulate their attention fields of visual bottom-up attention, which offers a unique opportunity to regulate its normalization processes. On the one hand, by measuring the gain pattern of contrast-response functions on the spatial cueing effect derived by visible or invisible cues, we observed changes in the cueing effect consonant with changes in contrast gain for visible cues and response gain for invisible cues. On the other hand, by using the normalization model of attention, subjects' awareness-dependent attention fields can be simulated successfully. Our study supports important predictions of the normalization model of visual bottom-up attention and further reveals its dependence on awareness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Memory Reactivation during Sleep Improves Execution of a Challenging Motor Skill</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memory reactivation during sleep reinforces various types of learning. Basic motor skills likely benefit from sleep. There is insufficient evidence, however, on whether memory reactivation during sleep contributes to learning how to execute a novel action. Here, we investigated motor learning in a myoelectric feedback task. Human male and female participants learned to control myoelectric activity in specific arm muscles to move a computer cursor to each of 16 locations. Each location was associated with a unique sound. Half of the sounds were played during slow-wave sleep to reactivate corresponding memories of muscle control. After sleep, movements cued during sleep were performed more quickly and efficiently than uncued movements. These results demonstrated that memory reactivation during sleep contributes to learning of action execution. We conclude that sleep supports learning novel actions, which also maps onto the learning required in certain neurorehabilitation procedures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior literature on motor learning has produced much evidence supporting a role for sleep but scant evidence on the execution component. This aspect of learning is critical for many complex skills that people value in their lives. Our results not only implicate sleep in skill learning but also pinpoint a benefit for motor execution using a method for modifying memory storage during sleep. We used targeted memory reactivation (TMR), whereby a stimulus that has been associated with learning is presented again during sleep to bring on a recapitulation of waking brain activity. Our demonstration that memory reactivation contributed to skilled performance may be relevant for neurorehabilitation as well as fields concerned with motor learning, such as kinesiology and physiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampus-Prefrontal Coupling Regulates Recognition Memory for Novelty Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recognition memory provides the ability to distinguish familiar from novel objects and places, and is important for recording and updating events to guide appropriate behavior. The hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have both been implicated in recognition memory, but the nature of HPC&ndash;mPFC interactions, and its impact on local circuits in mediating this process is not known. Here we show that novelty discrimination is accompanied with higher theta activity (4&ndash;10 Hz) and increased c-Fos expression in both these regions. Moreover, theta oscillations were highly coupled between the HPC and mPFC during recognition memory retrieval for novelty discrimination, with the HPC leading the mPFC, but not during initial learning. Principal neurons and interneurons in the mPFC responded more strongly during recognition memory retrieval compared with learning. Optogenetic silencing of HPC input to the mPFC disrupted coupled theta activity between these two structures, as well as the animals' (male Sprague Dawley rats) ability to differentiate novel from familiar objects. These results reveal a key role of monosynaptic connections between the HPC and mPFC in novelty discrimination via theta coupling and identify neural populations that underlie this recognition memory-guided behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many memory processes are highly dependent on the interregional communication between the HPC and mPFC via neural oscillations. However, how these two brain regions coordinate their oscillatory activity to engage local neural populations to mediate recognition memory for novelty discrimination is poorly understood. This study revealed that the HPC and mPFC theta oscillations and their temporal coupling is correlated with recognition memory-guided behavior. During novel object recognition, the HPC drives mPFC interneurons to effectively reduce the activity of principal neurons. This study provides the first evidence for the requirement of the HPC&ndash;mPFC pathway to mediate recognition memory for novelty discrimination and describes a mechanism for how this memory is regulated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cnksr2 Loss in Mice Leads to Increased Neural Activity and Behavioral Phenotypes of Epilepsy-Aphasia Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epilepsy Aphasia Syndromes (EAS) are a spectrum of childhood epileptic, cognitive, and language disorders of unknown etiology. <I>CNKSR2</I> is a strong X-linked candidate gene implicated in EAS; however, there have been no studies of genetic models to dissect how its absence may lead to EAS. Here we develop a novel <I>Cnksr2</I> KO mouse line and show that male mice exhibit increased neural activity and have spontaneous electrographic seizures. <I>Cnksr2</I> KO mice also display significantly increased anxiety, impaired learning and memory, and a progressive and dramatic loss of ultrasonic vocalizations. We find that Cnksr2 is expressed in cortical, striatal, and cerebellar regions and is localized at both excitatory and inhibitory postsynapses. Proteomics analysis reveals Cnksr2 anchors key binding partners at synapses, and its loss results in significant alterations of the synaptic proteome, including proteins implicated in epilepsy disorders. Our results validate that loss of CNKSR2 leads to EAS and highlights the roles of Cnksr2 in synaptic organization and neuronal network activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epilepsy Aphasia Syndromes (EAS) are at the severe end of a spectrum of cognitive-behavioral symptoms seen in childhood epilepsies, and they remain an inadequately understood disorder. The prognosis of EAS is frequently poor, and patients have life-long language and cognitive disturbances. Here we describe a genetic mouse model of EAS, based on the KO of the EAS risk gene <I>Cnksr2</I>. We show that these mice exhibit electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes similar to those of patients, providing an important new model for future studies of EAS. We also provide insights into the molecular disturbances downstream of Cnksr2 loss by using <I>in vivo</I> quantitative proteomics tools.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altered Response Dynamics and Increased Population Correlation to Tonal Stimuli Embedded in Noise in Aging Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is a chronic health condition that affects one-third of the world population. One hallmark of presbycusis is a difficulty hearing in noisy environments. Presbycusis can be separated into two components: alterations of peripheral mechanotransduction of sound in the cochlea and central alterations of auditory processing areas of the brain. Although the effects of the aging cochlea in hearing loss have been well studied, the role of the aging brain in hearing loss is less well understood. Therefore, to examine how age-related central processing changes affect hearing in noisy environments, we used a mouse model (Thy1-GCaMP6s X CBA) that has excellent peripheral hearing in old age. We used <I>in vivo</I> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to measure the responses of neuronal populations in auditory cortex (ACtx) of adult (2&ndash;6 months, nine male, six female, 4180 neurons) and aging mice (15&ndash;17 months, six male, three female, 1055 neurons) while listening to tones in noisy backgrounds. We found that ACtx neurons in aging mice showed larger responses to tones and have less suppressed responses consistent with reduced inhibition. Aging neurons also showed less sensitivity to temporal changes. Population analysis showed that neurons in aging mice showed higher pairwise activity correlations and showed a reduced diversity in responses to sound stimuli. Using neural decoding techniques, we show a loss of information in neuronal populations in the aging brain. Thus, aging not only affects the responses of single neurons but also affects how these neurons jointly represent stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging results in hearing deficits particularly under challenging listening conditions. We show that auditory cortex contains distinct subpopulations of excitatory neurons that preferentially encode different stimulus features and that aging selectively reduces certain subpopulations. We also show that aging increases correlated activity between neurons and thereby reduces the response diversity in auditory cortex. The loss of population response diversity leads to a decrease of stimulus information and deficits in sound encoding, especially in noisy backgrounds. Future work determining the identities of circuits affected by aging could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deficits in Behavioral and Neuronal Pattern Separation in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>In temporal lobe epilepsy, the ability of the dentate gyrus to limit excitatory cortical input to the hippocampus breaks down, leading to seizures. The dentate gyrus is also thought to help discriminate between similar memories by performing pattern separation, but whether epilepsy leads to a breakdown in this neural computation, and thus to mnemonic discrimination impairments, remains unknown. Here we show that temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by behavioral deficits in mnemonic discrimination tasks, in both humans (females and males) and mice (C57Bl6 males, systemic low-dose kainate model). Using a recently developed assay in brain slices of the same epileptic mice, we reveal a decreased ability of the dentate gyrus to perform certain forms of pattern separation. This is because of a subset of granule cells with abnormal bursting that can develop independently of early EEG abnormalities. Overall, our results linking physiology, computation, and cognition in the same mice advance our understanding of episodic memory mechanisms and their dysfunction in epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often have learning and memory impairments, sometimes occurring earlier than the first seizure, but those symptoms and their biological underpinnings are poorly understood. We focused on the dentate gyrus, a brain region that is critical to avoid confusion between similar memories and is anatomically disorganized in TLE. We show that both humans and mice with TLE experience confusion between similar situations. This impairment coincides with a failure of the dentate gyrus to disambiguate similar input signals because of pathologic bursting in a subset of neurons. Our work bridges seizure-oriented and memory-oriented views of the dentate gyrus function, suggests a mechanism for cognitive symptoms in TLE, and supports a long-standing hypothesis of episodic memory theories.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Select neuronal populations display steady rhythmic neuronal firing that provides tonic excitation to drive downstream networks and behaviors. In noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), circadian neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup>-activated neurons of the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), large subthreshold membrane potential oscillations contribute to the pacemaker-like action potential discharge. The oscillations and firing in LC and SCN involve contributions from leak sodium (NALCN) and L-type calcium channels while recent work from RTN suggested an additional pivotal role for a secondary calcium-activated and voltage-gated cationic current sensitive to TRPM4 channel blockers. Here, we tested whether TRPM4 contributes to subthreshold oscillations in mouse LC and SCN. By RNAscope <I>in situ</I> hybridization, <I>Trpm4</I> transcripts were detected in both cell groups. In whole-cell recordings from acute slice preparations, prominent voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations were revealed in LC and SCN after blocking action potentials. These oscillations were inhibited by two chemically-distinct blockers of TRPM4, 9-phenanthrol (9-pt) and 4-chloro-2-[[2-(2-chlorophenoxy)acetyl]amino]benzoic acid (CBA). Under whole-cell voltage clamp, inward currents evoked by oscillation voltage waveforms were inhibited in LC by blocking L-type calcium channels and TRPM4. These data implicate TRPM4 in the large subthreshold membrane potential oscillations that underlie tonic action potential discharge in LC and SCN, providing a voltage-dependent and calcium-dependent cationic current to augment the depolarizing inward Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents previously associated with this distinctive electroresponsive property.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Modeling Physiological Sources of Heading Bias from Optic Flow</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human heading perception from optic flow is accurate for directions close to the straight-ahead and systematic biases emerge in the periphery (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B10">Cuturi and Macneilage, 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Sun et al., 2020</cross-ref>). In pursuit of the underlying neural mechanisms, primate brain dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) area has been a focus because of its causal link with heading perception (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Gu et al., 2012</cross-ref>). Computational models generally explain heading sensitivity in individual MSTd neurons as a feedforward integration of motion signals from medial temporal (MT) area that resemble full-field optic flow patterns consistent with the preferred heading direction (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Britten, 2008</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Mineault et al., 2012</cross-ref>). In the present simulation study, we quantified within the structure of this feedforward model how physiological properties of MT and MSTd shape heading signals. We found that known physiological tuning characteristics generally supported the accuracy of heading estimation, but not always. A weak-to-moderate overrepresentation of peripheral headings in MSTd garnered the highest accuracy and precision out of the models that we tested. The model also performed well when noise corrupted high proportions of the optic flow vectors. Such a peripheral MSTd model performed well when units possessed a range of receptive field (RF) sizes and were strongly direction tuned. Physiological biases in MT direction tuning toward the radial direction also supported heading estimation, but the tendency for MT preferred speed and RF size to scale with eccentricity did not. Our findings help elucidate the extent to which different physiological tuning properties influence the accuracy and precision of neural heading signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of environmental factors on hematology profile of Gambusia affinis caught at Brantas River watershed, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Contamination of freshwater ecosystems has become a major issue as it threatens public water sources as well as aquatic life. It is important to predict changes in organism health, given a known number of environmental factors and pollutant concentrations, in order to better manage contaminants through biomarker analysis. This study aims to examine the ecosystem health of the Brantas River based on its environmental condition and the hematology profile of Gambusia affinis fish present in the river. This species was chosen because of its wide distribution along the Brantas River, and because it is very tolerant, adaptable, highly abundant, and easy to catch. Methods: The study area included 10 sampling sites along the Brantas River watershed. In total, six water quality parameters were observed (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia concentration, and phenol concentration) and hematology measurements consisted of erythrocyte, leucocyte, and micronuclei analyses. Results: The results showed that the upstream area of Brantas River, located in Batu, was the least polluted region, while Mojokerto was the most polluted. The erythrocyte level of Gambusia affinis caught in most sampling sites was quite low. Furthermore, research revealed that the status of Gambusia affinis' hematological profile was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with water quality parameters, particularly DO, BOD, ammonia, and phenol. Conclusions: It can be concluded from these results that the hematological profile of the fish is poor due to high levels of organic waste and harmful substances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">WBC-based segmentation and classification on microscopic images: a minor improvement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction White blood cells (WBCs) are immunity cells which fight against viruses and bacteria in the human body. Microscope images of captured WBCs for processing and analysis are important to interpret the body condition. At present, there is no robust automated method to segment and classify WBCs images with high accuracy. This paper aims to improve on WBCs image segmentation and classification method. Methods A triple thresholding method was proposed to segment the WBCs; meanwhile, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classification model that adopts transfer learning technique was proposed to detect and classify WBCs as a healthy or a malignant. The input dataset of this research work is the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB). The process first converts the captured microscope images into HSV format for obtaining the H component. Otsu thresholding is applied to segment the WBC area. A 13 × 13 kernel with two iterations was used to apply morphological opening on image to ameliorate output results. Collected cell masks were used to detect the contour of each cell on the original image. To classify WBCs into a healthy or a malignant category, characteristics and conditions of WBCs are to be examined. A transfer learning technique and pre-trained InceptionV3 model were employed to extract the features from the images for classification. Results The proposed WBCs segmentation method yields 90.45% accuracy, 83.81% of the structural similarity index, 76.25% of the dice similarity coefficient, and is computationally efficient. The accuracy of fine-tuned classifier model for training, validation and test sets are 93.27%, 92.31% and 96.15% respectively. The obtained results are high in accuracy and precision are over 96% and with lower loss value. Discussion Triple thresholding outperforms K-means clustering in segmenting smaller dataset. Pre-trained InceptionV3 model and transfer learning improve the flexibility and ability of classifier.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Seroprevalence and characterisation of herpes simplex virus from human immunodeficiency virus in samples collected from two provinces in South Africa: a retrospective study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a widely distributed human pathogen that is known for its ulcerative lesions at the infection site. HSV can cause persistent infection in the host that is often followed by a period of latency within the neurons. Considering the high rate of HIV infection in South Africa, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of HSV with a focus to determine the epidemiological association between HSV-DNA and HIV-1 in the population. Methods: A total of 44 sera samples were screened for HSV and HIV-1 using the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA positive samples were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the positivity of both viruses and to further differentiate HSV into HSV-1 and -2. Thereafter, the samples were analysed for relatedness using phylogenetic analysis. Results: Of the 44 samples, 36 (81.8%) were positive for HIV-1, while 35 (79.5%) were positive for HSV when screened with ELISA kits. The PCR results, with the use of type specific primers, showed that 4/35 (11.4%) samples were specific for HSV-1 while 30/35 (85.7%) were specific for HSV-2. Statistical analysis performed using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test showed that there is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 transmission. Conclusions: There is a significant positive association between HSV-2 and HIV-1 in the study population. Our study shows that some of the HSV-2 isolates are not related to the clinical isolate SD90e from South Africa, suggesting diversity in HSV-2 viral transmission.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">2-DOF robot modelling by SimMechanics and PD-FL integrated controller for position control and trajectory tracking [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Due to the high demand of robots to perform several industrial tasks, such as welding, machining, pick and place, position control in robotics has attracted high attention recently. Controllers’ improvement is also continuous specifically in terms of design simplicity and performance accuracy. This research plans to obtain the SimMechanics model of a two-degree of freedom (DOF) robot and to propose an integrated controller of a proportional–derivative (PD) controller and a fuzzy logic (FL) controller. Methodology The SimMechanics model of the 2-DOF robot is obtained using MATLAB SimMechanics toolbox from a CAD assembly design of the 2-DOF robot. Then, the proposed PD-FL integrated controller is designed and simulated in MATLAB Simulink. The PD controller is widely used for its simplicity, but it doesn’t have a satisfactory performance in difficult tasks. Furthermore, the FL controller is also easy for design and implementation even by non-experts in control theory, but it has the disadvantage of long computational time for multi-input systems due to the increased fuzzy rules. Results The FL controller is integrated with the PD controller for enhanced performance of the 2-DOF robot. The PD-FL integrated controller is developed and tested to control the 2-DOF robot for point-to-point position control and also tip trajectory tracking (TTT) such as triangular TTT and rhombic TTT. Conclusion The PD-FL integrated controller demonstrates enhanced performance compared to the conventional PD controller in both point-to-point position control and TTT. Furthermore, the PD-FL integrated controller has the advantage of less fuzzy rules which helps to overcome the computational time issue of the FL controller.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does COVID-19 infection change the need for future surgical interventions? An exploratory analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is unknown whether recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection leads to an increased need for common surgical procedures. Our objective was to conduct an exploratory analysis of surgical procedures performed after a documented COVID-19 infection.  Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data from the province of Ontario, Canada. We identified individuals with a positive COVID-19 test between February 1 2020 and May 31 2020, and matched them 1:2 with individuals who had a negative COVID-19 test during the same period. We used physician billing codes to identify the ten most frequent surgical procedures in the COVID-19 cohort. An at-risk period 30 days after the first positive COVID-19 swab (or matched index date in the control group) until November 30 2020 was used. Cox proportional hazard models (adjusted for important baseline differences) are reported with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals.   Results: After exclusions and matching, we had 19,143 people in the COVID-19 cohort, and 38,286 people in the control cohort. The top ten surgical procedures were hand/wrist fracture fixation, cesarean-section, ureteral stent placement, cholecystectomy, treatment of an upper tract urinary stone, hysterectomy, femur fracture repair, hip replacement, transurethral prostatectomy, and appendectomy. There was a significantly reduced hazard of requiring upper tract renal stone surgery (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.87) or ureteral stent placement (aHR 0.54, 95%CI 0.36-0.82), or undergoing a cholecystectomy (aHR 0.43, 95%CI 0.26-0.71) among those with a prior positive COVID-19 test.   Conclusions: After a COVID-19 infection there is not an increased risk of needing several common surgical procedures. There appears to be a reduced risk of renal stone disease treatment and ureteral stent placement, and a reduced risk of cholecystectomy, however understanding the reasons for this will require further study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-population coupling of neural activity based on Gaussian process current source densities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natalie Klein, Joshua H. Siegle, Tobias Teichert, Robert E. Kass</p>

Because local field potentials (LFPs) arise from multiple sources in different spatial locations, they do not easily reveal coordinated activity across neural populations on a trial-to-trial basis. As we show here, however, once disparate source signals are decoupled, their trial-to-trial fluctuations become more accessible, and cross-population correlations become more apparent. To decouple sources we introduce a general framework for estimation of current source densities (CSDs). In this framework, the set of LFPs result from noise being added to the transform of the CSD by a biophysical forward model, while the CSD is considered to be the sum of a zero-mean, stationary, spatiotemporal Gaussian process, having fast and slow components, and a mean function, which is the sum of multiple time-varying functions distributed across space, each varying across trials. We derived biophysical forward models relevant to the data we analyzed. In simulation studies this approach improved identification of source signals compared to existing CSD estimation methods. Using data recorded from primate auditory cortex, we analyzed trial-to-trial fluctuations in both steady-state and task-evoked signals. We found cortical layer-specific phase coupling between two probes and showed that the same analysis applied directly to LFPs did not recover these patterns. We also found task-evoked CSDs to be correlated across probes, at specific cortical depths. Using data from Neuropixels probes in mouse visual areas, we again found evidence for depth-specific phase coupling of primary visual cortex and lateromedial area based on the CSDs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MGEnrichment: A web application for microglia gene list enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justin Jao, Annie Vogel Ciernia</p>

Gene expression analysis is becoming increasingly utilized in neuro-immunology research, and there is a growing need for non-programming scientists to be able to analyze their own genomic data. MGEnrichment is a web application developed both to disseminate to the community our curated database of microglia-relevant gene lists, and to allow non-programming scientists to easily conduct statistical enrichment analysis on their gene expression data. Users can upload their own gene IDs to assess the relevance of their expression data against gene lists from other studies. We include example datasets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from human postmortem brain samples from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and matched controls. We demonstrate how MGEnrichment can be used to expand the interpretations of these DEG lists in terms of regulation of microglial gene expression and provide novel insights into how ASD DEGs may be implicated specifically in microglial development, microbiome responses and relationships to other neuropsychiatric disorders. This tool will be particularly useful for those working in microglia, autism spectrum disorders, and neuro-immune activation research. MGEnrichment is available at https://ciernialab.shinyapps.io/MGEnrichmentApp/ and further online documentation and datasets can be found at https://github.com/ciernialab/MGEnrichmentApp. The app is released under the GNU GPLv3 open source license.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Upregulation of DNA repair genes and cell extrusion underpin the remarkable radiation resistance of Trichoplax adhaerens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Angelo Fortunato, Alexis Fleming, Athena Aktipis, Carlo C. Maley</p>

<i>Trichoplax adhaerens</i> is the simplest multicellular animal with tissue differentiation and somatic cell turnover. Like all other multicellular organisms, it should be vulnerable to cancer, yet there have been no reports of cancer in <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> or any other placozoan. We investigated the cancer resistance of <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i>, discovering that they are able to tolerate high levels of radiation damage (218.6 Gy). To investigate how <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> survive levels of radiation that are lethal to other animals, we examined gene expression after the X-ray exposure, finding overexpression of genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis including the <i>MDM2</i> gene. We also discovered that <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> extrudes clusters of inviable cells after X-ray exposure. <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> is a valuable model organism for studying the molecular, genetic, and tissue-level mechanisms underlying cancer suppression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pattern changes of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi women preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: We compared the pattern of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi females of all ages between 4 months preceding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the same months 1 year later within the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, that targeted all female patients attending an outpatient clinic for dermatology and venereology in Al-Kindy teaching hospital, Baghdad between October 2019 to the end of January 2020, and the same 4-month duration 1 year later (October 2020 to the end of January 2021) after the COVID-19 peak period had passed and there was no or partial curfew to exclude seasonal impact. Results: A total of 2657 female-patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with 1314 females during the 4 months pre COVID-19, and 1343 females during the pandemic. The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was 27.2±16.6 years, while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was 28.1±15.6 years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages (P >0.05). Hair loss in general with telogen effluvium specifically increased significantly. Cutaneous contagious viral infections were reduced significantly and specifically of these molluscum contagiosum and condylomata accuminata. Other forms of infections including bacterial and parasitic were also reduced while dermatophytosis was increased but not to a significant level. Acne vulgaris, rosacea, lichen planus, urticaria, pityriasis rosea, seborrheic dermatitis, and vitiligo were increased, but psoriasis, alopecia areata, other types of dermatitis, and melasma were reduced but none to a significant level. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the pattern of diseases presented to an out-patient clinic for dermatology and venereology. This could be either related to COVID-19 infection or stress associated with the pandemic, because of curfew, or wearing facemasks which may cause a decrease or increase in certain diseases.
