                Visual neurons can have their tuning properties contextually modulated by the presence of visual stimuli in the area surrounding their receptive field, especially when that stimuli contains natural features. However, stimuli presented in specific egocentric locations may have greater behavioural relevance, raising the possibility that the extent of contextual modulation may vary with position in visual space. To explore this possibility we utilised the small size and optical transparency of the larval zebrafish to describe the form and spatial arrangement of contextually modulated cells throughout an entire tectal hemisphere. We found that the spatial tuning of tectal neurons to a prey-like stimulus sharpens when the stimulus is presented in the context of a naturalistic visual scene. These neurons are confined to a spatially restricted region of the tectum and have receptive fields centred within a region of visual space in which the presence of prey preferentially triggers hunting behaviour. Our results demonstrate that circuits that support behaviourally relevant modulation of tectal neurons are not uniformly distributed. These findings add to the growing body of evidence that the tectum shows regional adaptations for behaviour.

                The archicortical hippocampus differs, like the neocortex, in its folding patterns between individuals. Here, we present an automated and robust BIDS-App, HippUnfold, for defining and indexing subject-specific hippocampal folding in MRI, analogous to popular tools used in neocortical reconstruction. This is critical for inter-individual alignment, with topology as the basis for homology. This topological framework enables qualitatively new analyses of morphological and laminar structure in the hippocampus or hippocampal subfields, and is critical for the advancement of neuroimaging analyses at a meso- or micro-scale. HippUnfold uses state-of-the-art deep learning combined with previously developed topological constraints on hippocampal tissue. It is designed to work with commonly employed sub-millimetric MRI acquisitions, with extensibility to microscopic resolutions as well. In this paper we illustrate the power of HippUnfold in feature extraction, and its construct validity compared to several extant hippocampal subfield analysis methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Computational Model of Stereoscopic Prey Capture inPraying Mantises</a></h4>

              
                We present a simple model which can account for the stereoscopic sensitivity of praying mantis predatory strikes. The model consists of a single disparity sensor: a binocular neuron sensitive to stereoscopic disparity and thus to distance from the animal. The model is based closely on the known behavioural and neurophysiological properties of mantis stereopsis. The monocular inputs to the neuron reflect temporal change and are insensitive to contrast sign, making the sensor insensitive to interocular correlation. The monocular receptive fields have a excitatory centre and inhibitory surround, making them tuned to size. The disparity sensor combines inputs from the two eyes linearly, applies a threshold and then an exponent output nonlinearity. The activity of the sensor represents the model mantis instantaneous probability of striking. We integrate this over the stimulus duration to obtain the expected number of strikes in response to moving targets with different stereoscopic distance, size and vertical disparity. We optimised the parameters of the model so as to bring its predictions into agreement with our empirical data on mean strike rate as a function of stimulus size and distance. The model proves capable of reproducing the relatively broad tuning to size and narrow tuning to stereoscopic distance seen in mantis striking behaviour. The model also displays realistic responses to vertical disparity. Most surprisingly, although the model has only a single centre surround receptive field in each eye, it displays qualitatively the same interaction between size and distance as we observed in real mantids: the preferred size increases as prey distance increases beyond the preferred distance. We show that this occurs because of a stereoscopic false match between the leading edge of the stimulus in one eye and its trailing edge in the other; further work will be required to find whether such false matches occur in real mantises. This is the first image-computable model of insect stereopsis, and reproduces key features of both neurophysiology and striking behaviour.

                While networks of neurons, glia and vascular systems enable and support brain functions, to date, mathematical tools to decode network dynamics and structure from very scarce and partially observed neuronal spiking behavior remain underdeveloped. Large neuronal networks contribute to the intrinsic neuron transfer function and observed neuronal spike trains encoding complex causal information processing, yet how this emerging causal fractal memory in the spike trains relates to the network topology is not fully understood. Towards this end, we propose a novel statistical physics inspired neuron particle model that captures the causal information flow and processing features of neuronal spiking activity. Relying on synthetic comprehensive simulations and real-world neuronal spiking activity analysis, the proposed fractional order operators governing the neuronal spiking dynamics provide insights into the memory and scale of the spike trains as well as information about the topological properties of the underlying neuronal networks. Lastly, the proposed model exhibits superior predictions of animal behavior during multiple cognitive tasks.

                A classic approach to estimate the individual theta-to-alpha transition frequency requires two electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, one acquired in resting-state condition and one showing an alpha de-synchronisation due e.g. to task execution. This translates into longer recording sessions that my be cumbersome in studies involving patients. Moreover, incomplete de-synchronisation of the alpha rhythm may compromise the final estimation of the transition frequency. Here we present transfreq, a Python library that allows the computation of the transition frequency from restingstate data by clustering the spectral profiles at different EEG channels based on their content in the alpha and theta bands. We first provide an overview of the transfreq core algorithm and of the software architecture. Then we demonstrate its feasibility and robustness across different experimental setups on a publicly available EEG data set and on in-house recordings. A detailed documentation of transfreq and the codes for reproducing the analysis of the paper with the open-source data set are available online at https://elisabettavallarino.github.io/transfreq/

                The contribution of structural connectivity to functional connectivity dynamics is still far from being fully elucidated. Herein, we applied track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity (tw-dFC), a model integrating structural, functional, and dynamic connectivity, on high quality diffusion weighted imaging and resting-state fMRI data from two independent repositories. The tw-dFC maps were analyzed using independent component analysis, aiming at identifying spatially independent white matter components which support dynamic changes in functional connectivity. Each component consisted of a spatial map of white matter bundles that show consistent fluctuations in functional connectivity at their endpoints, and a time course representative of such functional activity. These components show high intra-subject, inter-subject, and inter-cohort reproducibility. We provided also converging evidence that functional information about white matter activity derived by this method can capture biologically meaningful features of brain connectivity organization, as well as predict higher-order cognitive performance.

                Faces are a rich source of social information. How does the infant brain develop the ability to recognize faces and identify potential social partners? We collected functional magnetic neuroimaging (fMRI) data from 49 awake human infants (aged 2.5-9.7 months) while they watched movies of faces, bodies, objects, and scenes. Face-selective responses were observed not only in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) but also in superior temporal sulcus (STS), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Face responses were also observed (but not fully selective) in the amygdala and thalamus. We find no evidence that face-selective responses develop in visual perception regions (VTC) prior to higher order social perception (STS) or social evaluation (MPFC) regions. We suggest that face-selective responses may develop in parallel across multiple cortical regions. Infants' brains could thus simultaneously process faces both as a privileged category of visual images, and as potential social partners.

	<p>Current evidence suggests emotion regulation is an important factor in both math anxiety and math performance, but the interplay between these constructs is unexamined. Given the multicomponent structure of math anxiety, emotion regulation, and math performance, here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive model of the underlying nature of the links between these latent variables. Using the innovative network analysis approach, the study visualized the underlying links between directly observable and measurable variables that might be masked by traditional statistical approaches. One hundred and seventeen adults completed a battery of tests and questionnaires on math anxiety, emotion regulation, and math performance. The results revealed: (1) state math anxiety (the emotional experience in math-related situations), rather than trait math anxiety, was linked to anxiety predisposition, subjective valence of math information, and difficulties in emotion regulation; (2) the link between state math anxiety and math performance partialed out the link between trait math anxiety and performance. The study innovatively demonstrates the need to differentiate between traits and tendencies to the actual emotional experience and emotion regulation used in math anxiety. The results have important implications for the theoretical understanding of math anxiety and future discussions and work in the field.</p>

	<p>Corpus callosotomy (CC) is one of the options in epilepsy surgeries to palliate patient seizures, and is typically applied for drop attacks. The mechanisms of seizure palliation involve disrupting the propagation of epileptic activity to the contralateral side of the brain. This review article focuses on the surgical aspects of CC. As a variations of CC, anterior two-thirds, posterior one-third, and total callosotomy are described with intraoperative photographs. As less-invasive surgical variations, recent progress in endoscopic CC, and CC without craniotomy, is described. CC remains acceptable under the low prevalence of complications, and surgeons should make the maximum effort to minimize the complication rate.</p>

                Over a decade of schizophrenia research using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural models has provided substantial data describing neurobiological characteristics of the disorder in vitro. Simultaneously, translation of the results into general mechanistic concepts underlying schizophrenia pathophysiology has been trailing behind. Given that modeling brain function using cell cultures is challenging, the gap between the in vitro models and schizophrenia as a clinical disorder has remained wide.

                Peripheral neuropathy is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), of which the pathogenesis is not fully understood. We investigated whether human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), which forms pathogenic aggregates that damage islet {beta}-cells in T2DM, is involved in T2DM-associated peripheral neuropathy. In vitro, hIAPP incubation with sensory neurons reduced neurite outgrowth. Transgenic hIAPP Ob/Ob mice, an established animal model for T2DM, as well as hIAPP mice, which have elevated plasma hIAPP levels but no hyperglycaemia. Both transgenic mice developed peripheral neuropathy as evidenced by pain-associated behavior and reduced intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF), suggesting hIAPP is a mediator of diabetic neuropathy. Intraplantar and intravenous hIAPP injection in WT mice induced long-lasting mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced IENF, whereas non-aggregating murine IAPP or mutated hIAPP (Pramlintide) did not have these effects, and were not toxic for cultured sensory neurons. In T2DM patients, significantly more hIAPP oligomers were found in the skin compared to non-T2DM controls. Thus, we provide evidence that hIAPP is toxic to sensory neurons, and mediates peripheral neuropathy in mice. The presence of hIAPP aggregates in skin of humans with T2DM supports the notion that human IAPP is a potential driver of T2DM neuropathy in man.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term labeling and imaging of synaptically-connected neuronal networks in vivo using nontoxic, double-deletion-mutant rabies viruses</a></h4>

              
                The highly specific and complex connectivity between neurons is the hallmark of nervous systems, but techniques for identifying, imaging, and manipulating synaptically-connected networks of neurons are limited. Monosynaptic tracing, or the gated replication and spread of a deletion-mutant rabies virus to label neurons directly connected to a targeted population of starting neurons1, is the most widely-used technique for mapping neural circuitry, but the rapid cytotoxicity of first-generation rabies viral vectors has restricted its use almost entirely to anatomical applications. We recently introduced double-deletion-mutant second-generation rabies viral vectors, showing that they have little or no detectable toxicity and are efficient means of retrogradely targeting neurons projecting to an injection site2, but they have not previously been shown to be capable of gated replication in vivo, the basis of monosynaptic tracing. Here we present a complete second-generation system for labeling direct inputs to genetically-targeted neuronal populations with minimal toxicity, using double-deletion-mutant rabies viruses. Spread of the viruses requires complementation of both of the deleted viral genes in trans in the starting postsynaptic cells; suppressing the expression of these viral genes following an initial period of viral replication, using the Tet-Off system, reduces toxicity to the starting cells without decreasing the efficiency of viral spread. Using longitudinal two-photon imaging of live monosynaptic tracing in visual cortex, we found that 94.4% of all labeled cells, and an estimated 92.3% of starting cells, survived for the full twelve-week course of imaging. Two-photon imaging of calcium responses in labeled networks of neurons in vivo over ten weeks showed that labeled neurons' visual response properties remained stable for as long as we followed them. This nontoxic labeling of inputs to genetically-targeted neurons in vivo is a long-held goal in neuroscience, with transformative applications including nonperturbative transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling, long-term functional imaging and behavioral studies, and optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation of synaptically-connected neuronal networks over the lifetimes of experimental animals.

                Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating monogenic neurodegenerative disease characterized by early, selective pathology in the basal ganglia despite the ubiquitous expression of mutant huntingtin. The molecular mechanisms underlying this region-specific neuronal degeneration and how these relate to the development of early cognitive phenotypes are poorly understood. Here, we show that there is selective loss of synaptic connections between the cortex and striatum in postmortem tissue from HD patients that is associated with the increased activation and localization of complement proteins, innate immune molecules, to markers of these synaptic elements. We also find that levels of these secreted innate immune molecules are elevated in the CSF of premanifest HD patients and correlate with established measures of disease burden. In preclinical genetic models of HD we show that complement proteins mediate the selective elimination of corticostriatal synapses at an early stage in disease pathogenesis marking them for removal by microglia, the brain's resident macrophage population. This process requires mutant huntingtin to be expressed in both cortical and striatal neurons and inhibition of this complement-dependent elimination mechanism through administration of a therapeutically relevant C1q function blocking antibody or genetic ablation of a complement receptor on microglia, prevented synapse loss, increased excitatory input to the striatum and rescued the early development of visual discrimination learning and cognitive flexibility deficits in these models. Together, our findings implicate microglia and the complement cascade in the selective, early degeneration of corticostriatal synapses and the development of cognitive deficits in presymptomatic HD, and also provide new preclinical data to support complement as a therapeutic target for early intervention.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disturbances of the early stages of neurogenesis lead to irreversible changes in the structure of the mature brain and its functional impairment, including increased excitability, which may be the basis for drug-resistant epilepsy. The range of possible clinical symptoms is as wide as the different stages of disturbed neurogenesis may be. In this study, we used a quadruple model of brain dysplasia by comparing structural and functional disorders in animals whose neurogenesis was disturbed with a single dose of 1 Gy of gamma rays at one of the four stages of neurogenesis, i.e. on days 13, 15, 17 or 19 of prenatal development.</p>
<p>When reached adulthood, the prenatally irradiated rats received EEG teletransmitter implantation. Thereafter, pilocarpine was administered and significant differences in susceptibility to seizure behavioral symptoms were detected depending on the degree of brain dysplasia. Before, during and after the seizures significant correlations were found between the density of parvalbumin-immunopositive neurons located in the cerebral cortex and the intensity of behavioral seizure symptoms or increases in the power of particular EEG bands. Neurons expressing calretinin or NPY showed also dysplasia-related increases without, however, correlations with parameters of seizure intensity. The results point to significant roles of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, and also to expression of NPY - an endogenous anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant reducing susceptibility to seizures and supporting neuronal survival.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The lateral septum (LS) is implicated as a hub that regulates a variety of affects, such as reward, feeding, anxiety, fear, sociability, and memory. However, it remains unclear how the LS, previously treated as a structure of homogeneity, exhibits such multifaceted functions. Emerging evidence suggests that different functions of the LS are mediated largely by its diverse input and output connections. It has also become clear that the LS is a heterogeneous region, where its dorsal and ventral poles play dissociable and often opposing roles. This functional heterogeneity can often be explained by distinct dorsal and ventral hippocampal inputs along the LS dorsoventral axis, as well as antagonizing connections between LS subregions. Similarly, outputs from LS subregions to respective downstream targets, such as hypothalamic, preoptic, and tegmental areas, also account for this functional heterogeneity. In this review, we provide an updated perspective on LS subregion classification, connectivity, and functions. We also identify key questions that have yet to be addressed in the field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Recommendations for connecting molecular sequence and biodiversity research infrastructures through ELIXIR [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Threats to global biodiversity are increasingly recognised by scientists and the public as a critical challenge. Molecular sequencing technologies offer means to catalogue, explore, and monitor the richness and biogeography of life on Earth. However, exploiting their full potential requires tools that connect biodiversity infrastructures and resources. As a research infrastructure developing services and technical solutions that help integrate and coordinate life science resources across Europe, ELIXIR is a key player. To identify opportunities, highlight priorities, and aid strategic thinking, here we survey approaches by which molecular technologies help inform understanding of biodiversity. We detail example use cases to highlight how DNA sequencing is: resolving taxonomic issues; Increasing knowledge of marine biodiversity; helping understand how agriculture and biodiversity are critically linked; and playing an essential role in ecological studies. Together with examples of national biodiversity programmes, the use cases show where progress is being made but also highlight common challenges and opportunities for future enhancement of underlying technologies and services that connect molecular and wider biodiversity domains. Based on emerging themes, we propose key recommendations to guide future funding for biodiversity research: biodiversity and bioinformatic infrastructures need to collaborate closely and strategically; taxonomic efforts need to be aligned and harmonised across domains; metadata needs to be standardised and common data management approaches widely adopted; current approaches need to be scaled up dramatically to address the anticipated explosion of molecular data; bioinformatics support for biodiversity research needs to be enabled and sustained; training for end users of biodiversity research infrastructures needs to be prioritised; and community initiatives need to be proactive and focused on enabling solutions. For sequencing data to deliver their full potential they must be connected to knowledge: together, molecular sequence data collection initiatives and biodiversity research infrastructures can advance global efforts to prevent further decline of Earth’s biodiversity.

                Research evaluation is often understood as something similar to a competition, where an evaluation panel’s task is to award the most excellent researchers. This interpretation is challenging, in as far as excellence it is at best a multi-dimensional concept and at worst an ill-defined term because it assumes that there exists some ground truth as to who the very best researchers are and all that an evaluation panel needs to do is uncover this ground truth. Therefore, instead of focusing on competition, the Swiss National Science Foundation focused on active decision-making and sought inspiration in the deliberation proceedings of a jury trial for the design of a new evaluation procedure of an academic award. The new evaluation procedure is based upon fully anonymised documents consisting of three independent parts (achievements, impact and prominence). Before the actual evaluation meeting, the panel, which includes non-academic experts, pre-evaluates all nominations through a pseudo-randomly structured network, such that every nomination is reviewed by six members of the panel only. Evaluation decisions are based upon anonymous votes, structured discussions in the panel, ranking as opposed to rating of nominees and data-rich figures providing an overview of the positioning of the nominee along various dimensions and the ranking provided by the individual panel members. The proceedings are overseen by an academic chair, focusing on content, and a procedural chair, focusing on the process and compliance. Combined, these elements form a highly-structure deliberation procedure, consisting of individual steps, through which nominations proceed and which each either feed into the next step or into the final verdict. The proposed evaluation process has been successfully applied in the real world in the evaluation of the Swiss Science Prize Marcel Benoist, Switzerland’s most prestigious academic award.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PDBrt: A free database of complexes with measured drug-target residence time [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Difficulties in translating the in vitro potency determined by cellular assays into in vivo efficacy in living organisms complicates the design and development of drugs. However,  the residence time of a drug in its molecular target is becoming a key parameter in the design and optimization of new drugs, as recent studies show that residence time can reliably predict drug efficacy in vivo. Experimental approaches to binding kinetics and target ligand complex solutions are currently available, but known bioinformatics databases do not usually report information about the ligand residence time in its molecular target. Methods: To extend existing databases we developed the Protein Data Bank (PDB) residence time database (PDBrt) which reports drug residence time. The database is implemented as an open access web-based tool. The front end uses Bootstrap with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), jQuery for the interface and 3Dmol.js to visualize the complexes. The server-side code uses Python web application framework, Django Rest Framework and backend database PostgreSQL. Results: The PDBrt database is a free, non-commercial repository for 3D protein-ligand complex data, including the measured ligand residence time inside the binding pocket of the specific biological macromolecules as deposited in The Protein Data Bank. The PDBrt database contains information about both the protein and the ligand separately, as well as the protein-ligand complex, binding kinetics, and time of the ligand residence inside the protein binding site.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thermodynamic constraints on the assembly and diversity of microbial ecosystems are different near to and far from equilibrium</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jacob Cook, Samraat Pawar, Robert G. Endres</p>

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has long been an area of substantial interest to ecologists because most fundamental biological processes, such as protein synthesis and respiration, are inherently energy-consuming. However, most of this interest has focused on developing coarse ecosystem-level maximisation principles, providing little insight into underlying mechanisms that lead to such emergent constraints. Microbial communities are a natural system to decipher this mechanistic basis because their interactions in the form of substrate consumption, metabolite production, and cross-feeding can be described explicitly in thermodynamic terms. Previous work has considered how thermodynamic constraints impact competition between pairs of species, but restrained from analysing how this manifests in complex dynamical systems. To address this gap, we develop a thermodynamic microbial community model with fully reversible reaction kinetics, which allows direct consideration of free-energy dissipation. This also allows species to interact via products rather than just substrates, increasing the dynamical complexity, and allowing a more nuanced classification of interaction types to emerge. Using this model, we find that community diversity increases with substrate lability, because greater free-energy availability allows for faster generation of niches. Thus, more niches are generated in the time frame of community establishment, leading to higher final species diversity. We also find that allowing species to make use of near-to-equilibrium reactions increases diversity in a low free-energy regime. In such a regime, two new thermodynamic interaction types that we identify here reach comparable strengths to the conventional (competition and facilitation) types, emphasising the key role that thermodynamics plays in community dynamics. Our results suggest that accounting for realistic thermodynamic constraints is vital for understanding the dynamics of real-world microbial communities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic analysis of noise reduction properties of coupled and isolated feed-forward loops</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suchana Chakravarty, Attila Csikász-Nagy</p>

Cells can maintain their homeostasis in a noisy environment since their signaling pathways can filter out noise somehow. Several network motifs have been proposed for biological noise filtering and, among these, feed-forward loops have received special attention. Specific feed-forward loops show noise reducing capabilities, but we notice that this feature comes together with a reduced signal transducing performance. In posttranslational signaling pathways feed-forward loops do not function in isolation, rather they are coupled with other motifs to serve a more complex function. Feed-forward loops are often coupled to other feed-forward loops, which could affect their noise-reducing capabilities. Here we systematically study all feed-forward loop motifs and all their pairwise coupled systems with activation-inactivation kinetics to identify which networks are capable of good noise reduction, while keeping their signal transducing performance. Our analysis shows that coupled feed-forward loops can provide better noise reduction and, at the same time, can increase the signal transduction of the system. The coupling of two coherent 1 or one coherent 1 and one incoherent 4 feed-forward loops can give the best performance in both of these measures.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A machine learning pipeline for classification of cetacean echolocation clicks in large underwater acoustic datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kaitlin E. Frasier</p>

Machine learning algorithms, including recent advances in deep learning, are promising for tools for detection and classification of broadband high frequency signals in passive acoustic recordings. However, these methods are generally data-hungry and progress has been limited by challenges related to the lack of labeled datasets adequate for training and testing. Large quantities of known and as yet unidentified broadband signal types mingle in marine recordings, with variability introduced by acoustic propagation, source depths and orientations, and interacting signals. Manual classification of these datasets is unmanageable without an in-depth knowledge of the acoustic context of each recording location. A signal classification pipeline is presented which combines unsupervised and supervised learning phases with opportunities for expert oversight to label signals of interest. The method is illustrated with a case study using unsupervised clustering to identify five toothed whale echolocation click types and two anthropogenic signal categories. These categories are used to train a deep network to classify detected signals in either averaged time bins or as individual detections, in two independent datasets. Bin-level classification achieved higher overall precision (>99%) than click-level classification. However, click-level classification had the advantage of providing a label for every signal, and achieved higher overall recall, with overall precision from 92 to 94%. The results suggest that unsupervised learning is a viable solution for efficiently generating the large, representative training sets needed for applications of deep learning in passive acoustics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal transport analysis reveals trajectories in steady-state systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephen Zhang, Anton Afanassiev, Laura Greenstreet, Tetsuya Matsumoto, Geoffrey Schiebinger</p>

Understanding how cells change their identity and behaviour in living systems is an important question in many fields of biology. The problem of inferring cell trajectories from single-cell measurements has been a major topic in the single-cell analysis community, with different methods developed for equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems (e.g. haematopoeisis vs. embryonic development). We show that optimal transport analysis, a technique originally designed for analysing time-courses, may also be applied to infer cellular trajectories from a single snapshot of a population in equilibrium. Therefore, optimal transport provides a unified approach to inferring trajectories that is applicable to both stationary and non-stationary systems. Our method, StationaryOT, is mathematically motivated in a natural way from the hypothesis of a Waddington’s epigenetic landscape. We implement StationaryOT as a software package and demonstrate its efficacy in applications to simulated data as well as single-cell data from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> root development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cysteine and iron accelerate the formation of ribose-5-phosphate, providing insights into the evolutionary origins of the metabolic network structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriel Piedrafita, Sreejith J. Varma, Cecilia Castro, Christoph Messner, Lukasz Szyrwiel, Julian L. Griffin, Markus Ralser</p>

The structure of the metabolic network is highly conserved, but we know little about its evolutionary origins. Key for explaining the early evolution of metabolism is solving a chicken–egg dilemma, which describes that enzymes are made from the very same molecules they produce. The recent discovery of several nonenzymatic reaction sequences that topologically resemble central metabolism has provided experimental support for a “metabolism first” theory, in which at least part of the extant metabolic network emerged on the basis of nonenzymatic reactions. But how could evolution kick-start on the basis of a metal catalyzed reaction sequence, and how could the structure of nonenzymatic reaction sequences be imprinted on the metabolic network to remain conserved for billions of years? We performed an in vitro screening where we add the simplest components of metabolic enzymes, proteinogenic amino acids, to a nonenzymatic, iron-driven reaction network that resembles glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). We observe that the presence of the amino acids enhanced several of the nonenzymatic reactions. Particular attention was triggered by a reaction that resembles a rate-limiting step in the oxidative PPP. A prebiotically available, proteinogenic amino acid cysteine accelerated the formation of RNA nucleoside precursor ribose-5-phosphate from 6-phosphogluconate. We report that iron and cysteine interact and have additive effects on the reaction rate so that ribose-5-phosphate forms at high specificity under mild, metabolism typical temperature and environmental conditions. We speculate that accelerating effects of amino acids on rate-limiting nonenzymatic reactions could have facilitated a stepwise enzymatization of nonenzymatic reaction sequences, imprinting their structure on the evolving metabolic network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Consolidation and maintenance of long-term memory involve dual functions of the developmental regulator Apterous in clock neurons and mushroom bodies in the Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Show Inami, Tomohito Sato, Yuto Kurata, Yuki Suzuki, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Takaomi Sakai</p>

Memory is initially labile but can be consolidated into stable long-term memory (LTM) that is stored in the brain for extended periods. Despite recent progress, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the intriguing neurobiological processes of LTM remain incompletely understood. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> courtship conditioning assay as a memory paradigm, here, we show that the LIM homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factor Apterous (Ap), which is known to regulate various developmental events, is required for both the consolidation and maintenance of LTM. Interestingly, Ap is involved in these 2 memory processes through distinct mechanisms in different neuronal subsets in the adult brain. Ap and its cofactor Chip (Chi) are indispensable for LTM maintenance in the <i>Drosophila</i> memory center, the mushroom bodies (MBs). On the other hand, Ap plays a crucial role in memory consolidation in a Chi-independent manner in pigment dispersing factor (Pdf)-containing large ventral–lateral clock neurons (l-LNvs) that modulate behavioral arousal and sleep. Since disrupted neurotransmission and electrical silencing in clock neurons impair memory consolidation, Ap is suggested to contribute to the stabilization of memory by ensuring the excitability of l-LNvs. Indeed, ex vivo imaging revealed that a reduced function of Ap, but not Chi, results in exaggerated Cl<sup>−</sup> responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in l-LNvs, indicating that wild-type (WT) Ap maintains high l-LNv excitability by suppressing the GABA response. Consistently, enhancing the excitability of l-LNvs by knocking down GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors compensates for the impaired memory consolidation in <i>ap</i> null mutants. Overall, our results revealed unique dual functions of the developmental regulator Ap for LTM consolidation in clock neurons and LTM maintenance in MBs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19, pseudo-declining skin cancer rates and the rise of teledermatology [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In late 2019, the world was introduced to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that shook the global medical community. By early 2020, the new coronavirus strain led to the rapid spread of a disease that earned its classification as a pandemic, prompting authorities to enforce new health regulations that significantly limited access to in-person medical evaluations, and resulted in a significant reduction in skin cancer diagnosis volume over the course of the pandemic. Skin cancer is amongst the most common and frequently diagnosed cancers, with incidence rates steadily increasing for the past few decades, until recently when world-wide changes to the health system drastically reduced opportunities for screening, diagnosis and management. In order to optimize patient treatment in the midst of the pandemic, practicing providers relied heavily on remote alternatives, sparking a huge spike in teledermatology practices globally. The successful adoption of widescale teledermatology allowed improved triage of concerning skin lesions requiring urgent face-to-face assessment, which helped mitigate the repercussions of delayed diagnosis and management. The detrimental consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have permanently changed the way we view and practice medicine, and it is imperative that the medical community continues to improve modern healthcare, through continued technological innovations that will advance this new technologically-reliant age of medicine.

                Background: Cigarette smoke can trigger oxidative stress. An alternative to overcome the harmful effects of cigarette smoke is through antioxidants. White oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus Ostreatus) are a source of exogenous antioxidants because many contain active compounds for potential antioxidants such as phenol and flavonoid compounds. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of ethanolic extract of Pleurotus ostreatus on 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and glutathione (GSH), as well as to analyze their correlation in the lung of Wistar male rats exposed to cigarette smoke. Methods: The study was a preclinical experiment conducted on 24 rats divided into four groups. The treatment was carried out for 42 days and antioxidant effects were assessed through levels of HNE and GSH in rat lungs. Groups were divided as follows: I- normal control, II- negative control, III and IV exposed to cigarette smoke for 60 minutes/day. Group III (treatment group) was treated with ethanolic extract of Pleurotus ostreatus at 250 mg/kg BW rat/day, and group IV (comparison group) was treated with N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg /day. Data analysis used was one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test, and Spearmen rank correlation coefficient test. Results: The results showed that the group receiving ethanolic extract of Pleurotus ostreatus had HNE levels of (44,18 ± 2,09 pg/mL) and GSH (0,04 ± 0,00 pg/mL) protein. This extract significantly increased GSH levels and inhibited the increase of HNE levels. Results of GSH (p≤0.01) showed significant results using one-way ANOVA. Conclusions: The ethanolic extract of P. ostreatus can prevent lipid peroxidation and decrease endogenous antioxidant levels in lung cells exposed to cigarette smoke. Ethanolic extract of Pleurotus ostreatus has good antioxidant potential.

This mushroom contains many active substances in its secondary metabolites which have pharmacological effects. The purpose of this study was to identify the active compounds in the ethanolic extract of white oyster mushroom that will form the extract profile and become the basis for drug development. Methods: The active compound test used High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS). Ethanolic extract of white oyster mushroom was processed by 70% alcohol maceration, evaporation, and thickening. Results: The results of the HPLC test showed that the ethanolic extract of white oyster mushroom contained cinnamic acid and rutin, while the LC-MS test showed the presence of p-coumaric acid, Ascorbic acid, Linoleic acid, 9-Eicosene (E), Niacinamide, Veritric acid, Syringic acid, Ergosterol. Conclusions: The active compounds that were detected in the ethanolic extract of white oyster mushroom showed that the extract had the potential for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Perfusion Imaging Predicts Favorable Outcomes after Basilar Artery Thrombectomy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Perfusion imaging identifies anterior circulation stroke patients who respond favorably to endovascular thrombectomy (ET), but its role in basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is unknown. We hypothesized that BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion (time to reach maximum concentration in seconds [Tmax] &gt; 10) would have a favorable response to ET compared to patients with more extensive regions involved.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of BAO patients with perfusion imaging prior to ET. We prespecified a Critical Area Perfusion Score (CAPS; 0–6 points), which quantified severe hypoperfusion (Tmax &gt; 10) in cerebellum (1 point/hemisphere), pons (2 points), and midbrain and/or thalamus (2 points). Patients were dichotomized into favorable (CAPS ≤ 3) and unfavorable (CAPS &gt; 3) groups. The primary outcome was a favorable functional outcome 90 days after ET (modified Rankin Scale = 0–3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred three patients were included. CAPS ≤ 3 patients (87%) had a lower median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS; 12.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 7–22) compared to CAPS &gt; 3 patients (13%; 23, IQR = 19–36; <i>p</i> = 0.01). Reperfusion was achieved in 84% of all patients, with no difference between CAPS groups (<i>p</i> = 0.42). Sixty-four percent of reperfused CAPS ≤ 3 patients had a favorable outcome compared to 8% of nonreperfused CAPS ≤ 3 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 21.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6–170; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No CAPS &gt; 3 patients had a favorable outcome, regardless of reperfusion. In a multivariate regression analysis, CAPS ≤ 3 was a robust independent predictor of favorable outcome after adjustment for reperfusion, age, and pre-ET NIHSS (OR = 39.25, 95% CI = 1.34–&gt;999, <i>p</i> = 0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion had a favorable response to reperfusion following ET. However, patients with more extensive regions of hypoperfusion in critical brain regions did not benefit from endovascular reperfusion. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Recent single-cell technologies have enabled researchers to simultaneously assess the transcriptomes and other modalities of thousands of cells within their spatial context. Here, we have summarized available single-cell methods for dissociated tissues and tissue slides with respect to the specifics of microglial biology. We have focused on next-generation-based technologies. We review the potential of these single-cell sequencing methods and newer multiomics approaches to extend the understanding of microglia function beyond the status quo.

                Chevée, Finkel et al. show that the activity of neurons in the anterior claustrum recorded during a cross-modal sensory selection task reflects movement rather than sensory input. Premotor activity in individual claustrum neurons was biased for ipsilateral or contralateral movements and encoded upcoming lick direction during intertrial intervals.

                The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1) variants of concern (VoCs) include a key mutation (N501Y) found in the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant that enhances affinity of the spike protein for its receptor, ACE2. Additional mutations are found in these variants at residues 417 and 484 that appear to promote antibody evasion. In contrast, the Epsilon variants (B.1.427/429) lack the N501Y mutation, yet exhibit antibody evasion. We have engineered spike proteins to express these RBD VoC mutations either in isolation, or in different combinations, and analyze the effects using biochemical assays and cryo-EM structural analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Simultaneous recording of multiple cellular signaling events by frequency- and spectrally-tuned multiplexing of fluorescent probes</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent probes that change their spectral properties upon binding to small biomolecules, ions, or changes in the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) are invaluable tools to study cellular signaling pathways. Here, we introduce a novel technique for simultaneous recording of multiple probes at millisecond time resolution: <i>frequency- and spectrally-tuned multiplexing</i> (FAST<sup>M</sup>). Different from present multiplexing approaches, FAST<sup>M</sup> uses phase-sensitive signal detection, which renders various combinations of common probes for V<sub>m</sub> and ions accessible for multiplexing. Using kinetic stopped-flow fluorimetry, we show that FAST<sup>M</sup> allows simultaneous recording of rapid changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, pH, Na<sup>+</sup>, and V<sub>m</sub> with high sensitivity and minimal crosstalk. FAST<sup>M</sup> is also suited for multiplexing using single-cell microscopy and genetically-encoded FRET biosensors. Moreover, FAST<sup>M</sup> is compatible with opto-chemical tools to study signaling using light. Finally, we show that the exceptional time resolution of FAST<sup>M</sup> also allows resolving rapid chemical reactions. Altogether, FAST<sup>M</sup> opens new opportunities for interrogating cellular signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CRMP4-mediated fornix development involves semaphorin-3E signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental axonal pathfinding plays a central role in correct brain wiring and subsequent cognitive abilities. Within the growth cone, various intracellular effectors transduce axonal guidance signals by remodeling the cytoskeleton. Semaphorin-3E (Sema3E) is a guidance cue implicated in development of the fornix, a neuronal tract connecting the hippocampus to the hypothalamus. Microtubule-Associated Protein 6 (MAP6) has been shown to be involved in the Sema3E growth-promoting signaling pathway. In this study, we identified the Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 4 (CRMP4) as a MAP6 partner and a crucial effector in Sema3E growth-promoting activity. CRMP4-KO mice displayed abnormal fornix development reminiscent of that observed in Sema3E-KO mice. CRMP4 was shown to interact with the Sema3E tripartite receptor complex within Detergent-<i>Resistant</i> Membrane (DRM) domains, and DRM domain integrity was required to transduce Sema3E signaling through the Akt/GSK3 pathway. Finally, we showed that the cytoskeleton-binding domain of CRMP4 is required for Sema3E's growth-promoting activity, suggesting that CRMP4 plays a role at the interface between Sema3E receptors, located in DRM domains, and the cytoskeleton network. As the fornix is affected in many psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, our results provide new insights to better understand the neurodevelopmental components of these diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Toxoplasma bradyzoites exhibit physiological plasticity of calcium and energy stores controlling motility and egress</a></h4>

              
                <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> has evolved different developmental stages for disseminating during acute infection (i.e. tachyzoites) and for establishing chronic infection (i.e. bradyzoites). Calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling tightly regulates the lytic cycle of tachyzoites by controlling microneme secretion and motility to drive egress and cell invasion. However, the roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in bradyzoites remain largely unexplored. Here we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are highly restricted in bradyzoites and that they fail to egress in response to agonists. Development of dual-reporter parasites revealed dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and minimal microneme secretion by bradyzoites induced in vitro or harvested from infected mice and tested ex vivo. Ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging demonstrated lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> basal levels, reduced magnitude, and slower Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics in bradyzoites compared with tachyzoites stimulated with agonists. Diminished responses in bradyzoites were associated with down-regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases involved in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acidocalcisomes. Once liberated from cysts by trypsin digestion, bradyzoites incubated in glucose plus Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly restored their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP stores leading to enhanced gliding. Collectively, our findings indicate that intracellular bradyzoites exhibit dampened Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling<sup> </sup>and lower energy levels that restrict egress, and yet upon release they rapidly respond to changes in the environment to regain motility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Working memory capacity of crows and monkeys arises from similar neuronal computations</a></h4>

              
                Complex cognition relies on flexible working memory, which is severely limited in its capacity. The neuronal computations underlying these capacity limits have been extensively studied in humans and in monkeys, resulting in competing theoretical models. We probed the working memory capacity of crows (<i>Corvus corone</i>) in a change detection task, developed for monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), while we performed extracellular recordings of the prefrontal-like area nidopallium caudolaterale. We found that neuronal encoding and maintenance of information were affected by item load, in a way that is virtually identical to results obtained from monkey prefrontal cortex. Contemporary neurophysiological models of working memory employ divisive normalization as an important mechanism that may result in the capacity limitation. As these models are usually conceptualized and tested in an exclusively mammalian context, it remains unclear if they fully capture a general concept of working memory or if they are restricted to the mammalian neocortex. Here we report that carrion crows and macaque monkeys share divisive normalization as a neuronal computation that is in line with mammalian models. This indicates that computational models of working memory developed in the mammalian cortex can also apply to non-cortical associative brain regions of birds.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Constitutive deficiency of the neurogenic hippocampal modulator AP2γ promotes anxiety-like behavior and cumulative memory deficits in mice from juvenile to adult periods</a></h4>

              
                The transcription factor activating protein two gamma (AP2γ) is an important regulator of neurogenesis both during embryonic development as well as in the postnatal brain, but its role for neurophysiology and behavior at distinct postnatal periods is still unclear. In this work, we explored the neurogenic, behavioral, and functional impact of a constitutive and heterozygous AP2γ deletion in mice from early postnatal development until adulthood. AP2γ deficiency promotes downregulation of hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenesis, altering the ontogeny of emotional and memory behaviors associated with hippocampus formation. The impairments induced by AP2γ constitutive deletion since early development leads to an anxious-like phenotype and memory impairments as early as the juvenile phase. These behavioral impairments either persist from the juvenile phase to adulthood or emerge in adult mice with deficits in behavioral flexibility and object location recognition. Collectively, we observed a progressive and cumulative impact of constitutive AP2γ deficiency on the hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenic process, as well as alterations on limbic-cortical connectivity, together with functional behavioral impairments. The results herein presented demonstrate the modulatory role exerted by the AP2γ transcription factor and the relevance of hippocampal neurogenesis in the development of emotional states and memory processes.

                Despite the small number of gustatory sense neurons, <i>Drosophila</i> larvae are able to sense a wide range of chemicals. Although evidence for taste multimodality has been provided in single neurons, an overview of gustatory responses at the periphery is missing and hereby we explore whole-organ calcium imaging of the external taste center. We find that neurons can be activated by different combinations of taste modalities including of opposite hedonic valence and identify distinct temporal dynamics of response. Although sweet sensing has not been fully characterized so far in the external larval gustatory organ, we recorded responses elicited by sugar. Previous findings established that larval sugar sensing relies on the Gr43a pharyngeal receptor, but the question remains if external neurons contribute to this taste. Here we postulate that external and internal gustation use distinct and complementary mechanisms in sugar sensing and we identify external sucrose sensing neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Striatum-projecting prefrontal cortex neurons support working memory maintenance</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the dorsomedial striatum (dmStr) are linked to working memory (WM) but how striatum-projecting mPFC neurons contribute to WM encoding, maintenance, or retrieval remains unclear. Here, we probed mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr pathway function in freely-moving mice during a T-maze alternation test of spatial WM. Fiber photometry of GCaMP6m-labeled mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr projection neurons revealed strongest activity during the delay period that requires WM maintenance. Demonstrating causality, optogenetic inhibition of mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr neurons only during the delay period impaired performance. Conversely, enhancing mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr pathway activity - via pharmacological suppression of HCN1 or by optogenetic activation during the delay -alleviated WM impairment induced by NMDA receptor blockade. Consistently, cellular-resolution miniscope imaging resolved preferred activation of >50% mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr neurons during WM maintenance. This subpopulation was distinct from neurons showing preference for encoding and retrieval. In all periods, including the delay, neuronal sequences were evident. Striatum-projecting mPFC neurons thus critically contribute to spatial WM maintenance.

                Purpose Simple psychophysical paradigm is available as a digital application in iOS devices such as iPad to measure the function of ON and OFF visual pathways. However, an age-matched normative database is not readily available. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the response of ON and OFF visual pathways as a function of age. Methods 158 normal healthy adults (84 males and 74 females) whose age ranged 18-80 years participated in the study. None of them had any ocular disease (except cataract of grade II or less) and visual acuity of [&le;] 20/25. Monocular testing (only one eye) was performed on the  EyeSpeed application on an iPad at 40cm distance. The targets ranged between 1 to 3 light or dark squares presented randomly in a noise background and participants responded by indicating the number of squares by touching the screen as fast as possible. The main outcome variables are reaction time, accuracy and performance index (1 / speed * accuracy). Results The median reaction time was shorter (Median (IQR): 1.53s (0.49) [dark] Vs 1.76s (0.58) [light], p < 0.001) and accuracy was higher (97.21% (3.30) [dark] Vs 95.15% (5.10) [light], p < 0.001) for dark targets than the light targets. Performance index and reaction time for both target types significantly correlated with age ({rho} = -0.41 to -0.43; p < 0.001). Conclusions This normative database will be useful to quantify disease-specific defects. More importantly, the ON pathway function can potentially serve as a surrogate for rod photoreceptor function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Volumetric assessment and longitudinal changes of brain structures in formalinized Beagle brains</a></h4>

              
                High field MRI represents an advanced technique both for diagnostic and research purposes on animal models such as the Beagle dog. The increasing interest in non-invasive neuroscience, aging, and neuropathological research led to a need of reference values (in terms of volumetric assessment) for the typical brain structures involved and, nowadays, several canine brain MRI atlases have been provided. Since no reports are available regarding the measurements reproducibility and few information are available about formalin fixation effect on brain structures when applied to MRI segmentation, we assessed the segmentation variability of selected structures as a function of the operator (two operators segmented the same data) and their intrinsic variability within a sample of 11 Beagle dogs (9 females and 2 males, 1.6 {+/-} 0.2 years). Then, we analyzed for one further Beagle dog (2 years old) the longitudinal changes in the brain segmentations of these structures corresponding four conditions: in vivo, post mortem (after euthanasia) , ex vivo (brain extracted and studied after 1 month in formalin and after 11 months); all the MRI images were collected with a 3 T MRI scanner. Our findings suggest that the segmentation procedure can be considered overall reproducible since only slight statistical differences were detected, apart from the ventricles. Furthermore, in the post mortem/ ex vivo comparison, the majority of the structures showed a higher contrast leading to more reproducible segmentations across operators and a net increase of volume of the studied structures; this could be justified by the intrinsic relaxation time changes observed as a consequence of formalin fixation, that led to an improvement of brain structures visualization and then segmentation. To conclude, MRI based segmentation seems to be a useful and accurate tool that allows longitudinal studies, especially when applied to formalin fixed brains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LINE-1 activation in the cerebellum drives ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have revealed that dysregulation of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1), a dominant class of transposable elements in the human genome, correlates with neurodegeneration. Yet whether LINE-1 dysregulation is causal to disease pathogenesis has not been proven directly. Here, we demonstrate that expression of evolutionarily younger LINE-1 families is elevated in the cerebella of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients, which was correlated with extensive downregulation of epigenetic silencers. To examine whether LINE-1 activation causes neurologic disease, we established an approach to directly target and activate the promoter of a young family of LINE-1 in mice. LINE-1 activation in the cerebellum was sufficient to lead to robust progressive ataxia. Purkinje cells in the diseased mice exhibited marked electrophysiological dysfunctions and degeneration with a significant accumulation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein LINE-1Orf1p aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and DNA damage. Treatment with lamivudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, blunted the disease progression by reducing DNA damage, attenuating gliosis and interferon gene signature, and recovering the loss of key functional molecules for calcium homeostasis in Purkinje cells. This study provides direct evidence that young LINE-1 activation drives ataxia phenotype, and points to its pleiotropic effects leading to DNA damage, inflammation, and dysfunction and degeneration of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anti-inflammatory therapy protects spiral ganglion neurons after aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced hair cell loss</a></h4>

              
                Destruction of cochlear hair cells by aminoglycoside antibiotics leads to gradual death of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that relay auditory information to the brain, resulting in progressive deafness. The reason for SGN degeneration, however, is not known. Consequently, there are no neuroprotective strategies for patients. To investigate this problem, we assessed SGN transcriptomic changes following aminoglycoside antibiotic (kanamycin)-induced destruction of hair cells in rats. We observed selectively increased expression of inflammatory response genes and increased abundance of activated macrophages in spiral ganglia by postnatal day 23 in kanamycin-deafened rats, which preceded widespread SGN degeneration. Treatment with the anti-inflammatory medications dexamethasone and ibuprofen diminished long-term SGN degeneration. Ibuprofen and dexamethasone also diminished macrophage activation. Efficacy of ibuprofen treatment was augmented by co-administration of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-stabilizing agent P7C3-A20. Thus, our results support a critical role of neuroinflammation in SGN degeneration after aminoglycoside antibiotic-mediated cochlear hair cell loss, as well as a neuroprotective strategy that could help protect from deafness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simultaneous Super-Resolution and Distortion Correction for Single-shot EPI DWI using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                Single-shot echo planer imaging (SS-EPI) is widely used for clinical Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) acquisitions. However, due to the limited bandwidth along the phase encoding direction, the obtained images suffer from distortion and blurring, which limits its clinical value for diagnosis. Here we proposed a deep learning-based image-quality-transfer method with a novel loss function with improved network structure to simultaneously increase the resolution and correct distortions for SS-EPI. We proposed a modified network structure based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). A dense net with gradient map guidance and a multi-level fusion block was employed as the generator to suppress the over-smoothing effect. We also proposed a fractional anisotropy (FA) loss to exploit the intrinsic signal relations in DWI. In-vivo brain DWI data were used to test the proposed method. The results showed that the distortion-corrected high-resolution DWI images with restored anatomical details can be obtained from low-resolution SS-EPI images by taking the advantage of high-resolution anatomical images. Additionally, the proposed FA loss can improve the image quality and quantitative accuracy of diffusion metrics by utilizing the intrinsic relations among different diffusion directions.

                Immune system molecules are expressed by neurons, often for unknown functions. We have identified IL-13 and its receptor IL-13Ra1 as neuronal, synaptic proteins in mouse, rat, and human brains, whose engagement upregulates the phosphorylation of NMDAR and AMPAR subunits and, in turn, increases synaptic activity and CREB-mediated transcription. We demonstrate that increased IL-13 is a hallmark of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice as well as in two distinct cohorts of human patients. We also provide evidence that IL-13 upregulation protects neurons from excitotoxic death. We show IL-13 upregulation occurring in several cohorts of human brain samples and in CSF. Thus, IL-13 is a previously unrecognized physiological modulator of synaptic physiology of neuronal origin, with implications for the establishment of synaptic plasticity and the survival of neurons under injury conditions. Furthermore, we suggest that the neuroprotection afforded through the upregulation of IL-13 represents a new entry point for interventions in the pathophysiology of TBI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Steroid hormone signaling activates thermal nociception during Drosophila peripheral nervous system development</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons enable animals to detect environmental changes and avoid harm. An intriguing open question concerns how the various attributes of sensory neurons arise in development. Drosophila melanogaster larvae undergo a behavioral transition by robustly activating a thermal nociceptive escape behavior during the second half of larval development (3rd instar). The Class 4 dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons are multimodal sensors which tile the body wall of Drosophila larvae and detect nociceptive temperature, light, and mechanical force. In contrast to the increase in nociceptive behavior in the 3rd instar, we find that ultraviolet light-induced Ca2+ activity in C4da neurons decreases during same period of larval development. Loss of ecdysone receptor has previously been shown to reduce nociception in 3rd instar larvae. We find that ligand dependent activation of ecdysone signaling is sufficient to promote nociceptive responses in 2nd instar larvae and suppress expression of subdued (encoding a TMEM16 channel). Reduction of subdued expression in 2nd instar C4da neurons not only increases thermal nociception but also decreases the response to ultraviolet light. Thus, steroid hormone signaling suppresses subdued expression to facilitate the sensory switch of C4da neurons. This regulation of a developmental sensory switch through steroid hormone regulation of channel expression raises the possibility that ion channel homeostasis is a key target for tuning the development of sensory modalities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Looking from the top: enhanced top-down sensorimotor processing in somatic anxiety</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundFunctional neuroimaging research on anxiety has traditionally focused on brain networks associated with the complex psychological aspects of anxiety. In this study, instead, we target the somatic aspects of anxiety. Motivated by the growing recognition that top-down cortical processing plays crucial roles in perception and action, we investigate effective connectivity among hierarchically organized sensorimotor regions and its association with (trait) anxiety.

MethodsWe selected 164 participants from the Human Connectome Project based on psychometric measures. We used their resting-state functional MRI data and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to assess effective connectivity within and between key regions in the exteroceptive, interoceptive, and motor hierarchy. Using hierarchical modeling of between-subject effects in DCM with Parametric Empirical Bayes we first established the architecture of effective connectivity in sensorimotor networks and investigated its association with fear somatic arousal (FSA) and fear affect (FA) scores. To probe the robustness of our results, we implemented a leave-one-out cross validation analysis.

ResultsAt the group level, the top-down connections in exteroceptive cortices were inhibitory in nature whereas in interoceptive and motor cortices they were excitatory. With increasing FSA scores, the pattern of top-down effective connectivity was enhanced in all three networks: an observation that corroborates well with anxiety phenomenology. Anxiety associated changes in effective connectivity were of effect size sufficiently large to predict whether somebody has mild or severe somatic anxiety. Interestingly, the enhancement in top-down processing in sensorimotor cortices were associated with FSA but not FA scores, thus establishing the (relative) dissociation between somatic and cognitive dimensions of anxiety.

ConclusionsOverall, enhanced top-down effective connectivity in sensorimotor cortices emerges as a promising and quantifiable candidate marker of trait somatic anxiety. These results pave the way for a novel approach into investigating the neural underpinnings of anxiety based on the recognition of anxiety as an embodied phenomenon and the emerging interest in top-down cortical processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spectral distribution dynamics across different attentional priority states</a></h4>

              
                Anticipatory covert spatial attention improves performance on tests of visual detection and discrimination, and shifts are accompanied by decreases and increases of alpha-band power at EEG electrodes corresponding to the attended and unattended location, respectively. Although the increase at the unattended location is often interpreted as an active mechanism (e.g., inhibiting processing at the unattended location), most experiments cannot rule out the alternative possibility that it is a secondary consequence of selection elsewhere. To adjudicate between these accounts, we designed a Posner-style cuing task in which male and female human participants made orientation judgments of targets appearing at one of four locations: up, down, right, or left. Critically, trials were blocked such that within a block the locations along one meridian alternated in status between attended and unattended, and targets never appeared at the other two, making them irrelevant. Analyses of the concurrently measured EEG signal were carried out on traditional narrowband alpha (8-14 Hz), as well as on two components resulting from the decomposition of this signal: periodic alpha; and the slope of the aperiodic 1/f-like component. Although data from right-left blocks replicated the familiar pattern of lateralized asymmetry in narrowband alpha power, with neither alpha signal could we find evidence for any difference in the time course at unattended versus irrelevant locations, an outcome consistent with the secondary-consequence interpretation of attention-related dynamics in the alpha band. Additionally, 1/f slope was lower at attended and unattended locations, relative to irrelevant, suggesting a tonic adjustment of physiological state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory-thresholded switch of neural firing states in a computational model of the ventromedial hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                The mouse ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is both necessary and sufficient for defensive responses to predator and social threats. Defensive behaviors typically involve cautious approach toward potentially threatening stimuli aimed at obtaining information about the risk involved, followed by sudden avoidance and flight behavior to escape harm. In vivo neural recording studies in mice have identified two major populations of VMH neurons that either increase their firing activity as the animal approaches the threat (called Assessment+ cells) or increase their activity as the animal flees the threat (called Flight+ cells). Interestingly, Assessment+ and Flight+ cells abruptly decrease and increase their firing activity, respectively, at the decision point for flight, creating an escape-related 'switch' in functional state. This suggests that the activity of the two cell types in VMH is coordinated and could result from local circuit interactions. Here, we used computational modelling to test if a local inhibitory feedback circuit could give rise to key features of the neural activity seen in VMH during the approach-to-flight transition. Starting from a simple dual-population inhibitory feedback circuit receiving repeated trains of monotonically increasing sensory input to mimic approach to threat, we tested the requirement for balanced sensory input, balanced feedback, short-term synaptic plasticity, rebound excitation, and inhibitory feedback exclusivity to reproduce an abrupt, sensory-thresholded reciprocal firing change that resembles Assessment+ and Flight+ cell activity seen in vivo. Our work demonstrates that a relatively simple local circuit architecture is sufficient for the emergence of firing patterns similar to those seen in vivo and suggests that a reiterative process of experimental and computational work may be a fruitful avenue for better understanding the functional organization of mammalian instinctive behaviors at the circuit level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupillary dynamics of optimal effort</a></h4>

              
                While a substantial body of work has shown that cognitive effort is aversive and costly, a separate line of research on intrinsic motivation suggests that people spontaneously seek challenging tasks. According to one prominent account of intrinsic motivation, the Learning Progress Motivation theory, the preference for difficult tasks reflects the dynamic range that these tasks yield for minimization of performance accuracy prediction errors (Oudeyer, Kaplan & Hafner, 2007). Here we test this hypothesis, by asking whether greater engagement with intermediately difficult tasks, indexed by subjective ratings and objective pupil measurements, is a function of trial-wise changes in performance prediction error. In a novel paradigm, we determined each individuals capacity for task performance and used difficulty levels that are too low, intermediately challenging or high for that individual. We demonstrated that intermediately challenging tasks resulted in greater liking and engagement scores compared with easy tasks. Task-evoked and baseline pupil size tracked objective task difficulty, where challenging tasks were associated with smaller baseline and greater phasic pupil responses than easy tasks. Most importantly, pupil responses were predicted by trial-to-trial changes in expected accuracy, performance prediction error magnitude and changes in prediction errors (learning progress), whereas smaller baseline pupil responses also predicted greater subjective engagement scores. Together, these results suggest that what is underlying the link between task engagement and intermediate tasks might be the dynamic range that these tasks yield for minimization of performance accuracy prediction errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related differences in the neural network dynamics underlying the predictability gain</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension is often challenged by increased background noise, but can be facilitated via the semantic context of a sentence. This predictability gain relies on an interplay of language-specific semantic and domain-general brain regions. However, age-related differences in the interactions within and between semantic and domain-general networks remain poorly understood. Here we investigated commonalities and differences in degraded speech processing in healthy young and old participants. Participants performed a sentence repetition task while listening to sentences with high and low predictable endings and varying intelligibility. Stimulus intelligibility was adjusted to individual hearing abilities. Older adults showed an undiminished behavioural predictability gain. Likewise, both groups recruited a similar set of semantic and cingulo-opercular brain regions. However, we observed age-related differences in effective connectivity for high predictable speech of increasing intelligibility. Young adults exhibited stronger coupling within the cingulo-opercular network and between a cingulo-opercular and a posterior temporal semantic node. Moreover, these interactions were excitatory in young adults but inhibitory in old adults. Finally, the degree of the inhibitory influence between cingulo-opercular regions was predictive of the behavioural sensitivity towards changes in intelligibility for high predictable sentences in older adults only. Our results demonstrate that the predictability gain is relatively preserved in older adults when stimulus intelligibility is individually adjusted. While young and old participants recruit similar brain regions, differences manifest in network dynamics. Together, these results suggest that ageing affects the network configuration rather than regional activity during successful speech comprehension under challenging listening conditions.

                We explore the stability and dynamic properties of a hierarchical, linearized, and analytic spectral graph model for neural oscillations that integrates the structuring wiring of the brain. Previously we have shown that this model can accurately capture the frequency spectra and the spatial patterns of the alpha and beta frequency bands obtained from magnetoencephalography recordings without regionally varying parameters. Here, we show that this macroscopic model based on long-range excitatory connections exhibits dynamic oscillations with a frequency in the alpha band even without any oscillations implemented at the mesoscopic level. We show that depending on the parameters, the model can exhibit combinations of damped oscillations, limit cycles, or unstable oscillations. We determined bounds on model parameters that ensure stability of the oscillations simulated by the model. Finally, we estimated time-varying model parameters to capture the temporal fluctuations in magnetoencephalography activity. We show that a dynamic spectral graph modeling framework with a parsimonious set of biophysically interpretable model parameters can thereby be employed to capture oscillatory fluctuations observed in electrophysiological data in various brain states and diseases.

                Despite numerous studies examining the mechanisms of operant conditioning (OC), the diversity of plasticity loci and their synergism have not been examined sufficiently. In the well-characterized feeding neural circuit of Aplysia, appetitive OC increases neuronal excitability and electrical coupling among several neurons. Here we found OC decreased the intrinsic excitability of B4 and the strength of its inhibitory connection to a key decision-making neuron, B51. The OC-induced changes were specific without affecting the B4-to-B8 inhibitory connection or excitability of another neuron critical for feeding behavior, B8. A conductance-based circuit model indicated certain sites of plasticity mediated the OC phenotype more effectively and that plasticity loci acted synergistically. This synergy was specific in that only certain combinations of loci synergistically enhanced feeding. Taken together, these results suggest modifications of diverse loci work synergistically to mediate OC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contextual control of conditioned pain tolerance and endogenous analgesic systems: Evidence for sex-based differences in endogenous opioid engagement</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain are unclear but may involve the persistence or strengthening of pain memories acquired in part through associative learning. Contextual cues, which comprise the surrounding environment where events occur, were recently described as a critical regulator of pain memory; both rodents and humans exhibit increased pain sensitivity in environments recently associated with a single painful experience. It is unknown, however, how repeated exposure to an acute painful unconditioned stimulus in a distinct context modifies pain sensitivity or the expectation of pain in that environment. To answer this question, we conditioned mice to associate distinct contexts with either repeated administration of a mild visceral pain stimulus (intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid) or vehicle injection over the course of three days. On the final day of experiments animals received either an acid injection or vehicle injection prior to being placed into both contexts. In this way, contextual control of pain sensitivity and pain expectation could be tested respectively. Both male and female mice developed context-dependent conditional pain tolerance, a phenomenon mediated by endogenous opioid signaling. However, when expecting the presentation of a painful stimulus in a given context, males exhibited conditional hypersensitivity whereas females exhibited endogenous opioid-mediated conditional analgesia. Successful determination of the brain circuits involved in this sexually dimorphic anticipatory response may allow for the manipulation of pain memories, which may contribute to the development of chronic pain states.

                The sex of the experimenter may cause stress in animal models and be a major confounding factor in preclinical research. We studied the effects of the sex of the experimenter on female and male rat anxiety behaviours using thigmotaxis in the open field test, anxiety-induced changes in brain and back temperature using infra-red thermography, and alterations in plasma concentrations of stress hormones, corticosterone and oxytocin. Female rats displayed consistently exacerbated anxiety-related behaviours along with increased infrared cutaneous temperature during repeated exposure to male experimenters. Experimental stress further intensified thermal responses to a male experimenter, especially in female rats. These behavioural responses to a male experimenter in females were associated with higher circulating corticosterone and lower oxytocin levels. Similar responses were induced by a T-shirt worn by a human male. These findings suggest that emotional and physiological responses of female rats to a male experimenter are influenced by visual and olfactory cues. These results emphasize the need to standardize and report experimenter sex throughout a study to avoid ambiguity in interpretation of the results.

                When fields lack consensus standards and ground truths for their analytic methods, reproducibility tends to be more of an ideal than a reality. Such has been the case for functional neuroimaging, where there exists a sprawling space of tools from which scientists can construct processing pipelines and draw interpretations. We provide a critical evaluation of the impact of differences observed in results across five independently developed functional MRI minimal preprocessing pipelines. We show that even when handling the same exact data, inter-pipeline agreement was only moderate, with the specific steps that contribute to the lack of agreement varying across pipeline comparisons. Using a densely sampled test-retest dataset, we show that the limitations imposed by inter-pipeline agreement mainly become appreciable when the reliability of the underlying data is high. We highlight the importance of comparison among analytic tools and parameters, as both widely debated (e.g., global signal regression) and commonly overlooked (e.g., MNI template version) decisions were each found to lead to marked variation. We provide recommendations for incorporating tool-based variability in functional neuroimaging analyses and a supporting infrastructure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estimating muscle activation from EMG using deep learning-based dynamical systems models</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To study the neural control of movement, it is often necessary to estimate how muscles are activated across a variety of behavioral conditions. However, estimating the latent command signal that underlies muscle activation is challenging due to its complex relation with recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals. Common approaches estimate muscle activation independently for each channel or require manual tuning of model hyperparameters to optimally preserve behaviorally-relevant features. Approach: Here, we adapted AutoLFADS, a large-scale, unsupervised deep learning approach originally designed to de-noise cortical spiking data, to estimate muscle activation from multi-muscle EMG signals. AutoLFADS uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model the spatial and temporal regularities that underlie multi-muscle activation. Main Results: We first tested AutoLFADS on muscle activity from the rat hindlimb during locomotion, and found that it dynamically adjusts its frequency response characteristics across different phases of behavior. The model produced single-trial estimates of muscle activation that improved prediction of joint kinematics as compared to low-pass or Bayesian filtering. We also tested the generality of the approach by applying AutoLFADS to monkey forearm muscle activity from an isometric task. AutoLFADS uncovered previously uncharacterized high-frequency oscillations in the EMG that enhanced the correlation with measured force compared to low-pass or Bayesian filtering. The AutoLFADS-inferred estimates of muscle activation were also more closely correlated with simultaneously-recorded motor cortical activity than other tested approaches. Significance: Ultimately, this method leverages both dynamical systems modeling and artificial neural networks to provide estimates of muscle activation for multiple muscles that can be used for further studies of multi-muscle coordination and its control by upstream brain areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relationship between high-frequency activity in the sensory and the motor hand areas, and regional myelin content</a></h4>

              
                Background: The human primary sensory (S1) and primary motor (M1) hand areas feature high-frequency neuronal responses. Electrical nerve stimulation evokes high-frequency oscillations (HFO) at around 650 Hz in the contralateral S1. Likewise, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1 produces short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) of motor evoked potentials in contralateral hand muscles. SICF features several peaks of facilitation which are separated by inter-peak intervals resembling HFO rhythmicity. Hypothesis: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the individual expressions of HFO and SICF are tightly related to each other and to the regional myelin content in the sensorimotor cortex. Methods: In 24 healthy volunteers, we recorded HFO and SICF, and, in a subgroup of 20 participants, we mapped the cortical myelin content using the ratio between the T1- and T2-weighted MRI signal as read-out. Results: The individual frequencies and magnitudes of HFO and SICF were tightly correlated: the intervals between the first and second peak of cortical HFO and SICF showed a positive linear relationship (r= 0.703, p< 0.001), while their amplitudes were inversely related (r= -0.613, p= 0.001). The rhythmicity, but not the magnitude of the high-frequency responses, was related to the cortical myelin content: the higher the cortical myelin content, the shorter the inter-peak intervals of HFO and SICF. Conclusion: The results confirm a tight functional relationship between high-frequency responses in S1 (i.e., HFO) and M1 (i.e., SICF). They also establish a link between the degree of regional cortical myelination and the expression of high-frequency responses in the human cortex, giving further the opportunity to infer their possible generators.

                Bilateral sensory information is indispensable for navigating the world. In most mammals, signals sensed by either side of the midline will ultimately reach the cortex where they will be integrated for perception and appropriate action selection. Even though information transferred across the hemispheres is routed through the corpus callosum, how and which microcircuits are key in integrating it is not well understood. Here we identify an essential role for layer 1 NDNF+ inhibitory cells of mice in integrating bilateral whisker-evoked information in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner. Direct connections from the contralateral cortex and the ipsilateral side activate NDNF+ neurons, which subsequently inhibit the late spiking activity of underlying layer 2/3 neurons, but not layer 5. Our results identify a feed-forward regulatory pathway for bilateral cortical sensory processing of upper layer cortical neurons actuated via layer 1 NDNF+ interneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex Differences in Affective States and Association with Voluntary Ethanol Intake in Sprague Dawley Rats</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are a major problem across the United States. While AUD remains a complex human condition, it is difficult to isolate the directionality of anxiety and ethanol (EtOH) drinking from outside influences. The present study sought to investigate the relationship between affective states and EtOH intake using male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Using complementary tests of anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, we found sex- and test-specific differences in basal affective behavior such that females displayed enhanced anxiety-like behavior in the Splash Test and males displayed enhanced anxiety-like behavior in the Novelty Suppressed Feeding Test. Although there were no sex differences in EtOH intake and no correlation between anxiety-like behavior and subsequent EtOH intake, we did find that depressive-like behavior predicted future EtOH intake in females rats only. In addition, we observed an increase in depressive-like behavior is male rats in both the water and EtOH drinking groups. Furthermore, anxiety-like behavior, but not depressive-like behavior predicted subsequent EtOH intake in female rats. Lastly, we found a history of EtOH intake decreased pain thresholds in male and female rats. Together, these experiments provide important information on the complex interaction between negative affect and alcohol intake and how these two contexts reciprocally do, or do not, influence each other in a sex-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial control of microglial phagocytosis in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Microglial phagocytosis is an energetically demanding process that plays a critical role in the removal of toxic aggregates of beta amyloid (A{beta}) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence indicates that metabolic programming may breakdown in microglia in AD, thereby disrupting this important protective function. The mechanisms coordinating mitochondrial metabolism to fuel phagocytosis in microglia remain poorly understood, however. Here we demonstrate that mitochondrial displacement of the glucose metabolizing enzyme, hexokinase-II (HK) regulates microglial metabolism and phagocytosis, and that deletion of the the translocator protein (TSPO) inhibits this. TSPO is a PET-visible inflammatory biomarker and therapeutic target in AD, previously shown to regulate microglial metabolism via an unknown mechanism. Using RNAseq and proteomic analyses, we found TSPO function in the brain to be linked with the regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics, lipid metabolism and phagocytosis. In cultured microglia, TSPO deletion induced mitochondrial recruitment of HK, which was associated with a switch to non-oxidative glucose metabolism, reduced mitochondrial energy production, lipid storage and impaired phagocytosis. Impaired phagocytosis was underpinned by reduced actin polymerization, which is highly energetically demanding and critical for initiation of phagocytosis. Consistent with in vitro findings, TSPO expression was also associated with phagocytic microglia in both AD brain and AD mice. Conversely, TSPO deletion in AD mice reduced phagocytic microglia and exacerbated amyloid accumulation. Based on these findings we propose that microglial TSPO functions as an immunometabolic brake via regulation of mitochondrial HK recruitment, preventing hyperglycolysis and promoting phagocytosis in AD. Further, we demonstrate that targeting mitochondrial HK may offer a novel immunotherapeutic approach to promote microglial phagocytosis in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence that LSD microdosing affects recall or the balance between distracter resistance and updating</a></h4>

              
                The effect of low doses (<=20 g) of LSD on working memory, in the absence of altered states of consciousness, remain largely unexplored. Given its possible effects on serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and dopaminergic signalling, it could be hypothesised that LSD microdoses modulate working memory recall. Moreover, in line with computational models, LSD microdoses could exert antagonistic effects on distracter resistance and updating. Here, we tested this hypothesis in a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing three different LSD microdoses (5 g, 10g and 20g) with placebo. After capsule administration, participants performed a modified delay-match-to-sample (DMTS) dopamine-sensitive task. The standard DMTS task was modified to include novel items in the delay period between encoding and probe. These novel items either had to be ignored or updated into working memory. There was no evidence that LSD microdoses affected the accuracy or efficiency of working memory recall and there was no evidence for differential effects on ignoring or updating. Due to the small sample of participants, these results are preliminary and larger studies are required to establish whether LSD microdoses affect short-term recall.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopaminergic challenge dissociates learning from primary versus secondary sources of information</a></h4>

              
                Some theories of human cultural evolution posit that humans have social-specific learning mechanisms that are adaptive specialisations moulded by natural selection to cope with the pressures of group living. However, the existence of neurochemical pathways that are specialised for learning from social information and from individual experience is widely debated. Cognitive neuroscientific studies present mixed evidence for social-specific learning mechanisms: some studies find dissociable neural correlates for social and individual learning whereas others find the same brain areas and, dopamine-mediated, computations involved in both. Here we demonstrate that, like individual learning, social learning is modulated by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol when social information is the primary learning source, but not when it comprises a secondary, additional element. Two groups (total N = 43) completed a decision-making task which required primary learning, from own experience, and secondary learning from an additional source. For one group the primary source was social, and secondary was individual; for the other group this was reversed. Haloperidol affected primary learning irrespective of social/individual nature, with no effect on learning from the secondary source. Thus, we illustrate that neurochemical mechanisms underpinning learning can be dissociated along a primary-secondary but not a social-individual axis. These results resolve conflict in the literature and support an expanding field showing that, rather than being specialised for particular inputs, neurochemical pathways in the human brain can process both social and non-social cues and arbitrate between the two depending upon which cue is primarily relevant for the task at hand.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent in adults. TBI-related functional brain alterations have been linked with common post-TBI neurobehavioral sequelae, with unknown neural substrates. This study examined the systems-level functional brain alterations in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) for visual sustained attention processing, their interactions, and contribution to post-TBI attention deficits. Task-based functional MRI data were collected from 42 adults with TBI and 43 group-matched normal controls (NCs), and analyzed using the graph theoretic technique. Global and nodal topological properties were calculated and compared be-tween the two groups. Correlation analyses were conducted between the neuroimaging measures that showed significant between-group differences and the behavioral symptom measures in attention domain in the groups of TBI and NCs, respectively. Significantly altered nodal efficiency and/or degree in several WM and GM nodes were reported in the TBI group, including the posterior corona radiata (PCR), posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), postcentral gyrus (PoG), and superior temporal sulcus (STS). Subjects with TBI also demonstrated abnormal systems-level functional synchronization between the PTR and STS in the right hemisphere, hypo-interaction be-tween PCR and PoG in the left hemisphere; as well as the involvement of systems-level functional aberrances in PCR in TBI-related behavioral impairments in the attention domain. Findings of the current study suggest that TBI-related systems-level functional alterations associated with these two major association WM tracts and their anatomically connected GM regions may play critical role in TBI-related behavioral deficits in attention domain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-dependent changes in murine striatal dopamine release, sleep, and behavior during spontaneous Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol abstinence</a></h4>

              
                Withdrawal symptoms are observed upon cessation of cannabis use in humans. Although animal studies have examined withdrawal symptoms following exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), difficulties in obtaining objective measures of spontaneous withdrawal using paradigms that mimic cessation of use in humans have slowed research. The neuromodulator dopamine (DA) is known to be affected by chronic THC treatment and plays a role in many behaviors related to human THC withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include sleep disturbances that often drive relapse, and emotional behaviors, e.g., irritability and anhedonia. We examined THC withdrawal-induced changes in striatal DA release and the extent to which sleep disruption and behavioral maladaptation manifest during withdrawal in a mouse chronic cannabis exposure model. Using a THC treatment regimen known to produce tolerance we measured electrically elicited DA release in acute brain slices from different striatal subregions during early and late THC abstinence. Long-term polysomnographic recordings from mice were used to assess vigilance state and sleep architecture before, during, and after THC treatment. We additionally assessed how behaviors that model human withdrawal symptoms are altered by chronic THC treatment in early and late abstinence. We detected altered striatal DA release, sleep disturbances that mimic clinical observations, and behavioral maladaptation in mice following tolerance inducing THC treatment. Sex differences were observed in nearly all metrics. Altered striatal DA release, sleep and affect-related behaviors associated with spontaneous THC abstinence were more consistently observed in male mice. To our knowledge these findings provide the first model of directly translatable non-precipitated cannabis withdrawal symptoms, in particular, sleep disruption.

                Oscillations and evoked responses are two types of neuronal activity recorded non-invasively with EEG/MEG. Although typically studied separately, they might in fact represent the same process. One possibility to unite them is to demonstrate that neuronal oscillations have non-zero mean which would indicate that stimulus-relating amplitude modulation of neuronal oscillations should lead to the generation of evoked responses. We validated this mechanism using computational modelling and analysis of a large EEG data set. With a biophysical model generating alpha rhythm, we indeed demonstrated that the oscillatory mean is non-zero for a large range of model-parameter values. In EEG data we detected non-zero mean alpha oscillations in about 96% of the participants. Furthermore, using neuronal-ensemble modelling, we provided an explanation for the often observed discrepancies between amplitude modulation and baseline shifts. Overall, our results provide strong support for the unification of neuronal oscillations and evoked responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging Three-Dimensional Brain Organoid Architecture from Meso- to Nanoscale across Development</a></h4>

              
                Organoids are human stem cell-derived three-dimensional cultures offering a new avenue to model human development and disease. Brain organoids allow studying various aspects of human brain development in the finest details in vitro in a tissue-like context. However, spatial relationships of subcellular structures such as synaptic contacts between distant neurons are hardly accessible by conventional light microscopy. This limitation can be overcome by systems that quickly image the entire organoid in three dimensions and in super-resolution. To that end we have developed a setup combining tissue expansion and light sheet fluorescence microscopy for imaging and quantifying diverse spatial parameters during organoid development. This technique enables zooming from a mesoscopic perspective into super-resolution within a single imaging session, thus revealing cellular and subcellular structural details in three spatial dimensions, including unequivocal delineation of mitotic cleavage planes as well as the alignment of pre- and postsynaptic proteins. We expect light sheet fluorescence expansion microscopy (LSFEM) to facilitate qualitative and quantitative assessment of organoids in developmental and disease-related studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multivariate autoregressive model estimation for high dimensional intracranial electrophysiological data</a></h4>

              
                Fundamental to elucidating the functional organization of the brain is the assessment of causal interactions between different brain regions. Multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) modeling techniques applied to multisite electrophysiological recordings are a promising avenue for identifying such causal links. They estimate the degree to which past activity in one or more brain regions is predictive of another region's present activity, while simultaneously accounting for the mediating effects of other regions. Including in the model as many mediating variables as possible has the benefit of drastically reducing the odds of detecting spurious causal connectivity. However, effective bounds on the number of MVAR model coefficients that can be estimated reliably from limited data make exploiting the potential of MVAR models challenging. Here, we utilize well-established dimensionality-reduction techniques to fit MVAR models to human intracranial data from ~100-200 recording sites spanning dozens of anatomically and functionally distinct cortical regions. First, we show that high dimensional MVAR models can be successfully estimated from long segments of data and yield plausible connectivity profiles. Next, we use these models to generate synthetic data with known ground-truth connectivity to explore the utility of applying principal component analysis and group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to reduce the number of parameters (connections) during model fitting to shorter data segments. We show that group LASSO is highly effective for recovering ground truth connectivity in the limited data regime, capturing important features of connectivity for high-dimensional models with as little as 10 s of data. The methods presented here have broad applicability to the analysis of high-dimensional time series data in neuroscience, facilitating the elucidation of the neural basis of sensation, cognition, and arousal.

	<p>High Intellectual Potential (HIP) and High Functioning Autism (HFA) are two different conditions sharing some clinical and neurobiological features. The aim of the present study was to characterize a sample of HIP children (n: 16; M/F: 14/2; median age: 10 years) in comparison to those with HFA (n: 17; M/F: 16/1; median age: 13 years) and to neurotypically developed (NTD) children (n: 10; M/F: 4/6; median age: 11 years) from a clinical and neurophysiological perspective. Specifically, a standardized clinical assessment of cognitive and adaptive skills, autistic symptoms, executive functions and behavioral features was performed. Moreover, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded, referring specifically to the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 paradigm. Our data highlighted the presence of similarities between the intellectually gifted individuals and the ones with autism (i.e., a nonhomogeneous intellective profile, an adaptive skills impairment, subthreshold autistic symptoms and increased perfectionism). Interestingly, a distinct neurophysiological characterization between groups came out, with evidence of a reduced MMN amplitude only in the HFA group. Furthermore, no differences within groups in the P300 component emerged. Therefore, our results start to provide a more informative characterization of the HIP phenotype in comparison to those of HFA and NTD, highlighting the potential role of the MMN amplitude index in helping clinicians and researchers to distinguish between HIP and HFA. Nevertheless, further research on the topic is strongly needed.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cerebral palsy (CP) are some of the most common neurodevelopmental diseases. They have multifactorial origin, which means that each case may manifest differently from the others. In patients with ASD, symptoms associated with deficits in social communication and characteristic, repetitive types of behaviors or interests are predominant, while in patients with CP, motor disability is diagnosed with accompanying cognitive impairment of various degrees. In order to minimize their adverse effects, it is necessary to promptly diagnose and incorporate appropriate management, which can significantly improve patient quality of life. One of the therapeutic possibilities is stem cell therapy, already known from other branches of medicine, with high hopes for safe and effective treatment of these diseases. Undoubtedly, in the future we will have to face the challenges that will arise due to the still existing gaps in knowledge and the heterogeneity of this group of patients. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize briefly the latest achievements and advances in stem cell therapy for ASD and CP.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Postural abnormalities are common in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and lead to gait abnormalities. Relationships between changes in the trunk posture of PD patients and gait profile score (GPS) and gait spatiotemporal parameters are poorly investigated. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationships between trunk posture, GPS, and gait spatiotemporal parameters, in patients with PD. Materials and Methods: Twenty-three people with PD and nineteen age-matched healthy people participated in this study. A 3D gait kinematical analysis was applied to all participants using the Plug-In Gait Full BodyTM tool. Trunk and limb kinematics patterns and gait spatio-temporal parameters of patients with PD and the control group were compared. Additionally, correlations between trunk kinematics patterns, gait spatio-temporal parameters, and GPS of the PD group were tested. Results: Cadence, opposite foot off, step time, single support, double support, foot off, gait speed, trunk kinematics, and GPS showed significant differences between the two groups (p &amp;amp;le; 0.05). Posture of the trunk during gait was not related to the spatio-temporal parameters and gait profile score in the PD group. The trunk flexor pattern influenced GPS domains, mainly of the ankle and the knee. Discussion and Conclusions: Flexed posture of the trunk in patients with PD seems to influence both ankle and knee movement patterns during the gait. The GPS analysis provided direct and simplified kinematic information for the PD group. These results may have implications for understanding the importance of considering the positioning of the trunk during gait.</p>

<p>Recent technological advances have enabled neural recordings consisting of hundreds to thousands of channels. As the pace of these developments continues to grow rapidly, it is imperative to have fast, flexible tools supporting the analysis of neural data gathered by such large-scale modalities. Here we introduce GhostiPy (<b>g</b>eneral <b>h</b>ub <b>o</b>f <b>s</b>pectral <b>t</b>echniques <b>i</b>n <b>Py</b>thon), a Python open source software toolbox implementing various signal processing and spectral analyses including optimal digital filters and time&ndash;frequency transforms. GhostiPy prioritizes performance and efficiency by using parallelized, blocked algorithms. As a result, it is able to outperform commercial software in both time and space complexity for high-channel count data and can handle out-of-core computation in a user-friendly manner. Overall, our software suite reduces frequently encountered bottlenecks in the experimental pipeline, and we believe this toolset will enhance both the portability and scalability of neural data analysis.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Safe and efficient locomotion relies on placing the foot on a reliable surface at the end of each leg swing movement. Visual information has been shown to be important for determining the location of foot placement in humans during walking when precision is required. Yet in quadrupedal animals where the hindlimbs are outside of the visual field, such as in mice, the mechanisms by which precise foot placement is achieved remain unclear. Here we show that the placement of the hindlimb paw is determined by the position of the forelimb paw during normal locomotion and in the presence of perturbations. When a perturbation elicits a stumbling corrective reaction, we found that the forelimb paw shifts posteriorly relative to body at the end of stance, and this spatial shift is echoed in hindlimb paw placement at the end of the swing movement. Using a mutant mouse line in which muscle spindle feedback is selectively removed, we show that this posterior shift of paw placement is dependent on muscle spindle feedback in the hindlimb but not in the forelimb. These findings uncover a neuronal mechanism that is independent of vision to ensure safe locomotion during perturbation. This mechanism adds to our general knowledge of how the nervous system controls targeted limb movements and could inform the development of autonomous walking machines.</p>

                The common, or spectacled, caiman Caiman crocodilus is an abundant, widely distributed Neotropical crocodilian exhibiting notable morphological and molecular diversification. The species also accounts by far for the largest share of crocodilian hides on the global market, with the C. crocodilus hide trade alone valued at about US$86.5 million per year. We obtained 239,911,946 paired-end reads comprising approximately 72 G bases using IlluminaTM sequencing of tissue sampled from a single Caiman crocodilus individual. These reads were de-novo assembled and progressively aligned against the genomes of increasingly related crocodilians; liftoff was used to annotate the draft C. crocodilus genome assembly based on an Alligator mississipiensis (a confamilial species) annotation. The draft assembly has been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information and both assembly and annotation are currently available for review at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4755063

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Observable variations in human sex ratio at birth</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yanan Long, Qi Chen, Henrik Larsson, Andrey Rzhetsky</p>

The human sex ratio at birth (SRB), defined as the ratio between the number of newborn boys to the total number of newborns, is typically slightly greater than 1/2 (more boys than girls) and tends to vary across different geographical regions and time periods. In this large-scale study, we sought to validate previously-reported associations and test new hypotheses using statistical analysis of two very large datasets incorporating electronic medical records (EMRs). One of the datasets represents over half (∼ 150 million) of the US population for over 8 years (IBM Watson Health MarketScan insurance claims) while another covers the entire Swedish population (∼ 9 million) for over 30 years (the Swedish National Patient Register). After testing more than 100 hypotheses, we showed that neither dataset supported models in which the SRB changed seasonally or in response to variations in ambient temperature. However, increased levels of a diverse array of air and water pollutants, were associated with lower SRBs, including increased levels of industrial and agricultural activity, which served as proxies for water pollution. Moreover, some exogenous factors generally considered to be environmental toxins turned out to induce higher SRBs. Finally, we identified new factors with signals for either higher or lower SRBs. In all cases, the effect sizes were modest but highly statistically significant owing to the large sizes of the two datasets. We suggest that while it was unlikely that the associations have arisen from sex-specific selection mechanisms, they are still useful for the purpose of public health surveillance if they can be corroborated by empirical evidences.

                <p>Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by JC virus (JCV), which occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Management of PML relies on restoration of immunity within the CNS. However, when this restoration cannot be readily achieved, PML has a grim prognosis. Innovative strategies have shown promise in promoting anti-JCV immune responses, and include T-cell adoptive transfer or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Conversely, management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, particularly in iatrogenic PML, remains a major challenge. In this paper, we review recent development in the treatment of PML.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and whether this association differs after risk stratification based on the Age, Blood Pressure, Clinical Features, Duration of Symptoms, Diabetes (ABCD<sup>2</sup>) score.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>INSPiRE-TMS was a randomized controlled trial allocating patients with minor stroke or TIA to an intensified support program or conventional care. In this post hoc analysis, participants were categorized using hs-cTnT levels (5th generation; Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany; 99th percentile upper reference limit [URL] = 14ng/l). Vascular risk was stratified using the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score (lower risk = 0–5 vs higher risk = 6–7). Cox proportional hazard regression was performed using covariate adjustment and propensity score matching (PSM) for the association between hs-cTnT and MACE (stroke/nonfatal coronary event/vascular death).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 889 patients (mean age = 70 years, 37% female), MACE occurred in 153 patients (17.2%) during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. hs-cTnT was associated with MACE (9.3%/yr, &gt;URL vs 4.4%/yr, ≤URL, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13–2.35], adjusted HR [Q<sub>4</sub> vs Q<sub>1</sub>] = 2.57 [95% CI = 1.35–4.97], adjusted HR [log-transformed] = 2.31 [95% CI = 1.37–3.89]). This association remained after PSM (adjusted HR = 1.76 [95% CI = 1.14–2.72]). There was a significant interaction between hs-cTnT and ABCD<sup>2</sup> category for MACE occurrence (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.04). In the lower risk category, MACE rate was 9.5%/yr in patients with hs-cTnT &gt; URL, which was higher than in those ≤URL (3.8%/yr) and similar to the overall rate in the higher risk category.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with incident MACE within 3 years after minor stroke or TIA and may help to identify high-risk individuals otherwise deemed at lower risk based on the ABCD<sup>2</sup> score. If confirmed in independent validation studies, this might warrant intensified secondary prevention measures and cardiac diagnostics in stroke patients with elevated hs-cTnT.

                <p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-antibody (Ab)–associated diseases (MOGADs) account for a substantial proportion of pediatric and adult patients who present with acquired demyelinating disorders. Its pathogenesis and optimal therapy are incompletely understood. We profiled systemic complement activation in adult and pediatric patients with MOGAD compared with patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and pediatric control and adult healthy donors. Proteins indicative of systemic classical and alternative complement activation were substantially increased in patients with MOGAD compared to control groups. Elevated levels were detected in both adult and pediatric cases and across all clinical syndromes. Complement inhibition should be explored for its therapeutic merit in patients with MOGAD.

                <p>Younger adults with epilepsy have an increased mortality. Some deaths are seizure-related, for example, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), whereas others, for example, suicide, have multiple causes, including adverse effects of the treatment on mood. In this retrospective population-based study of all Danish persons with epilepsy aged 18 to 49 years during 2007 to 2009 we evaluated the risk of death from seizures and suicide. SUDEP comprised 82.7% of all seizure-related death. Younger adults with epilepsy had an 8.3-fold increased risk of death from seizure-related causes compared with suicide. This underpins the importance of effective seizure control in preventing premature death. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:983–987</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Hydroxychloroquine for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) does not respond well to immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. Chronic activation of microglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PPMS. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the activity of human microglia and has neuroprotective effects in vitro.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-arm, phase II futility trial of 200 mg oral HCQ twice daily for 18 months. In an effort to investigate disability worsening in the absence of overt focal inflammation, we excluded participants with contrast enhancing lesions on a screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary end point was ≥20% worsening on the timed 25-foot walk measured between 6 and 18 months of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Based on original trial data, 40% of the cohort were expected to worsen. We used a Simon 2-stage design to compare a null hypothesis of 40% of the cohort worsening against the one-sided alternative of 20%. Using a 5% type 1 error rate and 80% power, HCQ treatment would be deemed successful if fewer than 10 of 35 participants experienced clinically significant worsening. The study met its primary end point, as only 8 of 35 participants worsened between 6 and 18 months. HCQ was overall well-tolerated, with adverse events in 82% and serious adverse events in 12% of participants. All serious adverse events were unlikely related to HCQ use.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HCQ treatment was associated with reduced disability worsening in people with PPMS. HCQ is a promising treatment candidate in PPMS and should be investigated further in randomized controlled clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:940–948</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to compare the outcomes of subdural electrode (SDE) implantations versus stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG), the 2 predominant methods of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) performed in difficult-to-localize drug-resistant focal epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Surgical Therapies Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy created an international registry of iEEG patients implanted between 2005 and 2019 with ≥1 year of follow-up. We used propensity score matching to control exposure selection bias and generate comparable cohorts. Study endpoints were: (1) likelihood of resection after iEEG; (2) seizure freedom at last follow-up; and (3) complications (composite of postoperative infection, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or permanent neurological deficit).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ten study sites from 7 countries and 3 continents contributed 2,012 patients, including 1,468 (73%) eligible for analysis (526 SDE and 942 SEEG), of whom 988 (67%) underwent subsequent resection. Propensity score matching improved covariate balance between exposure groups for all analyses. Propensity-matched patients who underwent SDE had higher odds of subsequent resective surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 1.84) and higher odds of complications (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.34, 3.74; unadjusted: 9.6% after SDE vs 3.3% after SEEG). Odds of seizure freedom in propensity-matched resected patients were 1.66 times higher (95% CI 1.21, 2.26) for SEEG compared with SDE (unadjusted: 55% seizure free after SEEG-guided resections vs 41% after SDE).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In comparison to SEEG, SDE evaluations are more likely to lead to brain surgery in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy but have more surgical complications and lower probability of seizure freedom. This comparative-effectiveness study provides the highest feasible evidence level to guide decisions on iEEG. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:927–939</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Impact of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Neurogenesis and Cortical Maturation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurodevelopmental delays and frontal lobe cortical dysmaturation are widespread among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest pool of neural stem/progenitor cells in the postnatal brain. Our aim is to determine the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on neurogenesis and cortical maturation in piglets whose SVZ development is similar to human infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three-week-old piglets (n = 29) were randomly assigned to control (no surgery), mild-CPB (34°C full flow for 60 minutes) and severe-CPB groups (25°C circulatory-arrest for 60 minutes). The SVZ and frontal lobe were analyzed with immunohistochemistry 3 days and 4 weeks postoperatively. MRI of the frontal lobe was used to assess cortical development.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SVZ neurogenic activity was reduced up to 4 weeks after both mild and severe CPB-induced insults. CPB also induced decreased migration of young neurons to the frontal lobe, demonstrating that CPB impairs postnatal neurogenesis. MRI 4 weeks after CPB displayed a decrease in gyrification index and cortical volume of the frontal lobe. Cortical fractional anisotropy was increased after severe CPB injury, indicating a prolonged deleterious impact of CPB on cortical maturation. Both CPB-induced insults displayed a significant change in densities of three major inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the frontal cortex. In addition, different CPB insults altered different subpopulations of inhibitory neurons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced neurological impairments. Further refinement of CPB hardware and techniques is necessary to improve long-term frontal cortical dysmaturation observed in children with CHD. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:913–926</p>

                <p>Difficulty retrieving proper names is common in older adults, coinciding with the accumulation of aggregated proteins in mid-life. We investigated the ability of healthy older adults to retrieve the names of famous faces in relation to positron emission tomography measurements of amyloid-β plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. More tau in the left fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus was related to reduced proper name retrieval performance and this effect was potentiated by amyloid-β. These findings provide an explanation for a common complaint of older adults and link proper name retrieval to neural systems involved in face perception, memory, and naming.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Long‐Term Cognitive Outcome in Anti–N‐Methyl‐D‐Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom of anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, but detailed studies on prevalence, characteristics of cognitive deficits, and the potential for recovery are missing. Here, we performed a prospective longitudinal study to assess cognitive long-term outcome and identify clinical predictors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed in 43 patients with NMDAR encephalitis 2.3 years and 4.9 years (median) after disease onset. Cognitive assessments covered executive function, working memory, verbal/visual episodic memory, attention, subjective complaints, and depression and anxiety levels. Cognitive performance of patients was compared to that of 30 healthy participants matched for age, sex, and education.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients had persistent cognitive deficits 2.3 years after onset, with moderate or severe impairment in &gt;80% of patients. Core deficits included memory and executive function. After 4.9 years, significant improvement of cognitive function was observed, but moderate to severe deficits persisted in two thirds of patients, despite favorable functional neurological outcomes (median modified Rankin Scale = 1). Delayed treatment, higher disease severity, and longer duration of the acute phase were predictors for impaired cognitive outcome. The recovery process was time dependent, with greater gains earlier after the acute phase, although improvements were possible for several years after disease onset.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cognitive deficits are the main contributor to long-term morbidity in NMDAR encephalitis and persist beyond functional neurological recovery. Nonetheless, cognitive improvement is possible for several years after the acute phase and should be supported by continued cognitive rehabilitation. Cognition should be included as an outcome measure in future clinical studies. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:949–961</p>

                <p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to determine the prevalence of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (<i>LTA4H</i>) polymorphisms in Zambian adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and its association with mortality. We completed genotype testing on 101 definite cases of TBM and 119 consecutive non-TBM controls. The distribution of genotypes among TBM patients was as follows: C/C (0.83), C/T (0.14), T/T (0.03). There was no significant difference in genotype distribution between TBM and non-TBM patients. We found no relationship between <i>LTA4H</i> polymorphism and survival. Prospective studies are needed to determine the benefit of adjuvant steroids in TBM based upon population <i>LTA4H</i> genotype. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:994–998</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The majority of patients with a familial cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) referred for molecular screening do not show pathogenic variants in known genes. In this study, we aimed to identify novel CSVD causal genes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a gene-based collapsing test of rare protein-truncating variants identified in exome data of 258 unrelated CSVD patients of an ethnically matched control cohort and of 2 publicly available large-scale databases, gnomAD and TOPMed. Western blotting was used to investigate the functional consequences of variants. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of mutated patients were characterized.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that <i>LAMB1</i> truncating variants escaping nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay are strongly overrepresented in CSVD patients, reaching genome-wide significance (<i>p</i> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). Using 2 antibodies recognizing the N- and C-terminal parts of LAMB1, we showed that truncated forms of LAMB1 are expressed in the endogenous fibroblasts of patients and trapped in the cytosol. These variants are associated with a novel phenotype characterized by the association of a hippocampal type episodic memory defect and a diffuse vascular leukoencephalopathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings are important for diagnosis and clinical care, to avoid unnecessary and sometimes invasive investigations, and also from a mechanistic point of view to understand the role of extracellular matrix proteins in neuronal homeostasis. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:962–975</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor increases phosphomannomutase (PMM) enzyme activity in a PMM2-congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) worm model. Epalrestat also decreases sorbitol level in diabetic neuropathy. We evaluated the genetic, biochemical, and clinical characteristics, including the Nijmegen Progression CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), urine polyol levels and fibroblast glycoproteomics in patients with PMM2-CDG.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed PMM enzyme measurements, multiplexed proteomics, and glycoproteomics in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts before and after epalrestat treatment. Safety and efficacy of 0.8 mg/kg/day oral epalrestat were studied in a child with PMM2-CDG for 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PMM enzyme activity increased post-epalrestat treatment. Compared with controls, 24% of glycopeptides had reduced abundance in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts, 46% of which improved upon treatment. Total protein N-glycosylation improved upon epalrestat treatment bringing overall glycosylation toward the control fibroblasts’ glycosylation profile. Sorbitol levels were increased in the urine of 74% of patients with PMM2-CDG and correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy, and CDG severity rating scale. In the child with PMM2-CDG on epalrestat treatment, ataxia scores improved together with significant growth improvement. Urinary sorbitol levels nearly normalized in 3 months and blood transferrin glycosylation normalized in 6 months.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Epalrestat improved PMM enzyme activity, N-glycosylation, and glycosylation biomarkers in vitro. Leveraging cellular glycoproteome assessment, we provided a systems-level view of treatment efficacy and discovered potential novel biosignatures of therapy response. Epalrestat was well-tolerated and led to significant clinical improvements in the first pediatric patient with PMM2-CDG treated with epalrestat. We also propose urinary sorbitol as a novel biomarker for disease severity and treatment response in future clinical trials in PMM2-CDG. ANN NEUROL 20219999:n/a–n/a</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Profile of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: Results from a Longitudinal, Prospective, Multisite Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is highly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives of the study were to characterize autistic features in young children with TSC.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants included 138 children followed from ages 3 to 36 months with TSC from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASD in TSC. Developmental and autism-specific assessments were administered, and a clinical diagnosis of ASD was determined for all participants at 36 months. Further analyses were performed on 117 participants with valid autism assessments based on nonverbal mental age greater than 15 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prevalence of clinical diagnosis of ASD at 36 months was 25%. Nearly all autistic behaviors on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) were more prevalent in children diagnosed with ASD; however, autism-specific behaviors were also observed in children without ASD. Overall quality of social overtures, facial expressions, and abnormal repetitive interests and behaviors were characteristics most likely to distinguish children with ASD from those without an ASD diagnosis. Participants meeting ADOS-2 criteria but not a clinical ASD diagnosis exhibited intermediate developmental and ADOS-2 scores compared to individuals with and without ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASD is highly prevalent in TSC, and many additional individuals with TSC exhibit a broad range of subthreshold autistic behaviors. Our findings reveal a broader autism phenotype that can be identified in young children with TSC, which provides opportunity for early targeted treatments.

                PCAD possesses a public health challenge resulting in years of productive life lost and an escalating burden on health systems. Objective of this review is to compare modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for PCAD compared to those without PCAD. This review will include all comparative observational studies conducted in adults aged >18 years with confirmed diagnosis of PCAD (on angiography) compared to those without PCAD. Databases to be searched include; PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and grey literature (Google Scholar). All identified studies will be screened for title and abstract and full-text against the inclusion criteria on Covidence software. Data relevant to exposures and outcomes will be extracted from all included studies. All studies selected for data extraction will be critically appraised for methodological quality. Meta-analysis using random-effects model will be performed using Review Manager 5.3. Effect sizes for categorical risk factors will be expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. For risk factors measured in continuous form, mean difference (if units are consistent) otherwise standardized mean difference (if units are different across studies) will be reported. Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed using I2 test statistics. GRADE will be used to assess the certainty of the findings. Systematic review registration number: PROSPERO Registration # CRD42020173216

                Background: In this work, a COVID19 Application Programming Interface (API) was built using the Representational State Transfer (REST) API architecture and it is designed to fetch data daily from the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC) website. Methods: The API is developed using ASP.NET Core Web API framework using C# programming language and Visual Studio 2019 as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The application has been deployed to Microsoft Azure as the cloud hosting platform and to successfully get new data from the NCDC website using Hangfire where a job has been scheduled to run every 12:30 pm (GMT + 1) and load the fetched data into our database. Various API Endpoints are defined to interact with the system and get data as needed, data can be fetched from a single state by name, all states on a particular day or over a range of days, etc. Results: The results from the data showed that Lagos and Abuja FCT in Nigeria were the hardest-hit states in terms of Total Confirmed cases while Lagos and Edo states had the highest death causalities with 465 and 186 as of August 2020. This analysis and many more can be easily made as a result of this API we have created that warehouses all COVID19 Data as presented by the NCDC since the first contracted case on February 29, 2020. This system was tested on the BlazeMeter platform, and it had an average of 11Hits/s with a response time of 2905milliseconds. Conclusions: The extension of NaijaCovidAPI over existing COVID19 APIs for Nigeria is the access and retrieval of previous data. Our contribution to the body of knowledge is the creation of a data hub for Nigeria's COVID-19 incidence from February 29, 2020, to date

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge creation in IT projects to accelerate digital innovation: two decade systematic literature review [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The interactivity and ubiquity of digital technologies are exerting a significant impact on the knowledge creation in information technology (KC-IT) projects. According to the literature, the critical relevance of KC-IT is highly associated with digital innovation (DI) for organisational success. However, DI is not yet a fully-fledged research subject but is an evolving corpus of theory and practise that draws from a variety of social science fields. Given the preceding setting, this study explores the interaction of KC-IT with DI. This work provides a systemic literature review (SLR) to examine the literature in KC-IT and its connection to DI. A SLR of 527 papers from 2001 to 2021 was performed across six online databases. The review encompasses quantitative and qualitative studies on KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Three major gaps were found in the SLR. Firstly, only 57 (0.23%) papers were found to examine the association between KC and IT projects. These works were analysed for theories, type of papers, KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Secondly, the convergence reviews indicate that scarce research has examined TMS and trust in KC-IT as factors. Thirdly, only 0.02% (5) core papers appeared in the search relevant to KC in IT projects to accelerate DI. The majority of the papers examined were not linked to DI. A significant gap also exists in these areas. These findings warrant the attention of the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A Case of Encephalopathy Presenting the Lentiform Fork Sign on MRI in a Diabetic Dialysis Patient [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Basal ganglia lesions showing an expansile high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI are termed the lentiform fork sign. This specific finding is mainly observed in diabetic patients with uremic encephalopathy with metabolic acidosis, although there are also reports in patients with ketoacidosis, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, intoxication, and following drug treatment (e.g., metformin). A 57-year-old Japanese man on chronic hemodialysis for 4 years because of diabetic nephropathy was admitted to our hospital for relatively rapid-onset gait disturbance, severe dysarthria, and consciousness disturbance. Brain T2-weighted MRI showed the lentiform fork sign. Hemodialysis was performed the day before admission, and laboratory tests showed mild metabolic (lactic) acidosis, but no uremia. Surprisingly, metformin, which is contraindicated for patients with end-stage kidney disease, had been prescribed for 6 months in his medication record, and his sluggish speaking and dysarthria appeared gradually after metformin treatment was started. Thus, the encephalopathy was considered to be related to metformin treatment. He received hemodialysis treatment for 6 consecutive days, and his consciousness disturbance and dysarthria improved in 1 week. At the 8-month follow-up, the size of the hyperintensity area on MRI had decreased, while the mild gait disturbance remained. Considering the rapid onset of gait and consciousness disturbance immediately before admission, diabetic uremic syndrome may also have occurred with metformin-related encephalopathy, and resulted in the lentiform fork sign, despite the patient showing no evidence of severe uremia on laboratory data.

                Fernandez-Abascal et al. report that a ClC Cl− channel expressed in glia associated with mechanosensory neurons mediates touch responses. The glial Cl− channel mediates efflux of Cl− from glia, which consequently permeates through GABA receptors expressed on mechanosensory neurons, resulting in regulation of neuronal Ca2+ and cAMP levels, enabling touch responses.

                Tyulmankov et al. use meta-learning to build neural network models for continual familiarity detection. They show that anti-Hebbian plasticity is the preferred mechanism for optimizing memory capacity and propose strong feedforward weights as an explicit addressing mechanism for selecting memory locations during storage and retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinguishing different modes of growth using single-cell data</a></h4>

              
                Collection of high-throughput data has become prevalent in biology. Large datasets allow the use of statistical constructs such as binning and linear regression to quantify relationships between variables and hypothesize underlying biological mechanisms based on it. We discuss several such examples in relation to single-cell data and cellular growth. In particular, we show instances where what appears to be ordinary use of these statistical methods leads to incorrect conclusions such as growth being non-exponential as opposed to exponential and vice versa. We propose that the data analysis and its interpretation should be done in the context of a generative model, if possible. In this way, the statistical methods can be validated either analytically or against synthetic data generated via the use of the model, leading to a consistent method for inferring biological mechanisms from data. On applying the validated methods of data analysis to infer cellular growth on our experimental data, we find the growth of length in E. coli to be non-exponential. Our analysis shows that in the later stages of the cell cycle the growth rate is faster than exponential.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gated recurrence enables simple and accurate sequence prediction in stochastic, changing, and structured environments</a></h4>

              
                From decision making to perception to language, predicting what is coming next is crucial. It is also challenging in stochastic, changing, and structured environments; yet the brain makes accurate predictions in many situations. What computational architecture could enable this feat? Bayesian inference makes optimal predictions but is prohibitively difficult to compute. Here, we show that a specific recurrent neural network architecture enables simple and accurate solutions in several environments. This architecture relies on three mechanisms: gating, lateral connections, and recurrent weight training. Like the optimal solution and the human brain, such networks develop internal representations of their changing environment (including estimates of the environment's latent variables and the precision of these estimates), leverage multiple levels of latent structure, and adapt their effective learning rate to changes without changing their connection weights. Being ubiquitous in the brain, gated recurrence could therefore serve as a generic building block to predict in real-life environments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Histone deacetylase 3 represses cholesterol efflux during CD4+ T-cell activation</a></h4>

              
                After antigenic activation, quiescent naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells alter their metabolism to proliferate. This metabolic shift increases production of nucleotides, amino acids, fatty acids, and sterols. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is critical for activation of murine peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to proliferate and blast after in vitro TCR/CD28 stimulation. Upon T-cell activation, genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis are upregulated while genes that promote cholesterol efflux are repressed. HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had reduced levels of cellular cholesterol both before and after activation. HDAC3-deficient cells upregulate cholesterol synthesis appropriately after activation, but fail to repress cholesterol efflux; notably, they overexpress cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Repression of these genes is the primary function for HDAC3 in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as addition of exogenous cholesterol restored proliferative capacity. Collectively, these findings demonstrate HDAC3 is essential during CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation to repress cholesterol efflux.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">REST/NRSF drives homeostatic plasticity of inhibitory synapses in a target-dependent fashion</a></h4>

              
                The repressor-element 1-silencing transcription/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) controls hundreds of neuron-specific genes. We showed that REST/NRSF downregulates glutamatergic transmission in response to hyperactivity, thus contributing to neuronal homeostasis. However, whether GABAergic transmission is also implicated in the homeostatic action of REST/NRSF is unknown. Here, we show that hyperactivity-induced REST/NRSF activation, triggers a homeostatic rearrangement of GABAergic inhibition, with increased frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and amplitude of evoked IPSCs in mouse cultured hippocampal neurons. Notably, this effect is limited to inhibitory-onto-excitatory neuron synapses, whose density increases at somatic level and decreases in dendritic regions, demonstrating a complex target- and area-selectivity. The upscaling of perisomatic inhibition was occluded by TrkB receptor inhibition and resulted from a coordinated and sequential activation of the <i>Npas4</i> and <i>Bdnf</i> gene programs. On the opposite, the downscaling of dendritic inhibition was REST-dependent, but BDNF-independent. The findings highlight the central role of REST/NRSF in the complex transcriptional responses aimed at rescuing physiological levels of network activity in front of the ever-changing environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell-level protein analysis revealing the roles of autoantigen-reactive B lymphocytes in autoimmune disease and the murine model</a></h4>

              
                Despite antigen affinity of B cells varying from cell to cell, functional analyses of antigen-reactive B cells on individual B cells are missing due to technical difficulties. Especially in the field of autoimmune diseases, promising pathogenic B cells have not been adequately studied to date because of its rarity. In this study, functions of autoantigen-reactive B cells in autoimmune disease were analyzed at the single-cell level. Since topoisomerase I is a distinct autoantigen, we targeted systemic sclerosis as autoimmune disease. Decreased and increased affinities for topoisomerase I of topoisomerase I-reactive B cells led to anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokine production associated with the inhibition and development of fibrosis, which is the major symptom of systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increased affinity of topoisomerase I-reactive B cells suppressed fibrosis. These results indicate that autoantigen-reactive B cells contribute to the disease manifestations in autoimmune disease through their antigen affinity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular architecture of the human tRNA ligase complex</a></h4>

              
                RtcB enzymes are RNA ligases that play essential roles in tRNA splicing, unfolded protein response, and RNA repair. In metazoa, RtcB functions as part of a five-subunit tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) along with Ddx1, Cgi-99, Fam98B and Ashwin. The human tRNA-LC or its individual subunits have been implicated in additional cellular processes including microRNA maturation, viral replication, DNA double-strand break repair and mRNA transport. Here we present a biochemical analysis of the inter-subunit interactions within the human tRNA-LC along with crystal structures of the catalytic subunit RTCB and the N-terminal domain of CGI-99. We show that the core of the human tRNA-LC is assembled from RTCB and the C-terminal alpha-helical regions of DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B, all of which are required for complex integrity. The N-terminal domain of CGI-99 displays structural homology to calponin-homology domains, and CGI-99 and FAM98B associate via their N-terminal domains to form a stable subcomplex. The crystal structure of GMP-bound RTCB reveals divalent metal coordination geometry in the active site, providing insights into its catalytic mechanism. Collectively, these findings shed light on the molecular architecture and mechanism of the human tRNA ligase complex, and provide a structural framework for understanding its functions in cellular RNA metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Low affinity integrin states have faster ligand binding kinetics than the high affinity state</a></h4>

              
                Integrin conformational ensembles contain two low-affinity states, bent-closed and extended-closed, and an active, high-affinity, extended-open state. It is widely thought that integrins must be activated before they bind ligand; however, one model holds that activation follows ligand binding. As ligand-binding kinetics are not only rate limiting for cell adhesion but also have important implications for the mechanism of activation, we measure them here for integrins α4β1 and α5β1 and show that the low-affinity states bind substantially faster than the high-affinity state. On and off-rates are similar for integrins on cell surfaces and as ectodomain fragments. Although the extended-open conformation's on-rate is ~20-fold slower, its off-rate is ~25,000-fold slower, resulting in a large affinity increase. The tighter ligand-binding pocket in the open state may slow its on-rate. Low affinity integrin states not only bind ligand more rapidly, but are also more populous on the cell surface than high affinity states. Thus, our results suggest that integrin binding to ligand may precede, rather than follow, activation by 'inside-out signaling'.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A distributed residue network permits conformational binding specificity in a conserved family of actin remodelers</a></h4>

              
                Metazoan proteomes contain many paralogous proteins that have evolved distinct functions. The Ena/VASP family of actin regulators consists of three members that share an EVH1 interaction domain with a 100 % conserved binding site. A proteome-wide screen revealed photoreceptor cilium actin regulator (PCARE) as a high-affinity ligand for ENAH EVH1. Here, we report the surprising observation that PCARE is ~100-fold specific for ENAH over paralogs VASP and EVL and can selectively bind ENAH and inhibit ENAH-dependent adhesion in cells. Specificity arises from a mechanism whereby PCARE stabilizes a conformation of the ENAH EVH1 domain that is inaccessible to family members VASP and EVL. Structure-based modeling rapidly identified seven residues distributed throughout EVL that are sufficient to differentiate binding by ENAH vs. EVL. By exploiting the ENAH-specific conformation, we rationally designed the tightest and most selective ENAH binder to date. Our work uncovers a conformational mechanism of interaction specificity that distinguishes highly similar paralogs and establishes tools for dissecting specific Ena/VASP functions in processes including cancer cell invasion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Silencing long ascending propriospinal neurons after spinal cord injury improves hindlimb stepping in the adult rat</a></h4>

              
                Long ascending propriospinal neurons (LAPNs) are a subpopulation of spinal cord interneurons that directly connect the lumbar and cervical enlargements. Previously we showed, in uninjured animals, that conditionally silencing LAPNs disrupted left-right coordination of the hindlimbs and forelimbs in a context-dependent manner, demonstrating that LAPNs secure alternation of the fore- and hindlimb pairs during overground stepping. Given the ventrolateral location of LAPN axons in the spinal cord white matter, many likely remain intact following incomplete, contusive, thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), suggesting a potential role in the recovery of stepping. Thus, we hypothesized that silencing LAPNs after SCI would disrupt recovered locomotion. Instead, we found that silencing spared LAPNs post-SCI improved locomotor function, including paw placement order and timing, and a decrease in the number of dorsal steps. Silencing also restored left-right hindlimb coordination and normalized spatiotemporal features of gait such as stance and swing time. However, hindlimb-forelimb coordination was not restored. These data indicate that the temporal information carried between the spinal enlargements by the spared LAPNs post-SCI is detrimental to recovered hindlimb locomotor function. These findings are an illustration of a post-SCI neuroanatomical-functional paradox and have implications for the development of neuronal- and axonal-protective therapeutic strategies and the clinical study/implementation of neuromodulation strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">cacna2d3, a voltage-gated calcium channel subunit, functions in vertebrate habituation learning and the startle sensitivity threshold</a></h4>

              
                The ability to filter sensory information into relevant versus irrelevant stimuli is a fundamental, conserved property of the central nervous system and is accomplished in part through habituation learning. Synaptic plasticity that underlies habituation learning has been described at the cellular level, yet the genetic regulators of this plasticity remain poorly understood, as do circuits that mediate sensory filtering. A forward genetic screen for zebrafish genes that control habituation learning identified a mutant allele doryp177 that caused reduced habituation of the acoustic startle response. Whole-genome sequencing identified the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha-2/delta-3 (cacna2d3) as a candidate gene affected in doryp177 mutants. Behavioral characterization of larvae homozygous for two additional, independently derived mutant alleles of cacna2d3, together with failure of these alleles to complement doryp177, confirmed a critical role for cacna2d3 in habituation learning. Notably, detailed analyses of the acoustic response in mutant larvae also revealed increased startle sensitivity to acoustic stimuli, suggesting a broader role for cacna2d3 in controlling innate response thresholds to acoustic stimuli. Taken together, our data demonstrate a critical role for cacna2d3 in sensory filtering, a process that is disrupted in human CNS disorders, e.g. ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison of subjective peripheral sensation, F-waves, and somatosensory evoked potentials in response to a unilateral pinch task measured on the contractile and non-contractile sides</a></h4>

              
                Depression of sensory input during voluntary muscle contractions has been demonstrated using electrophysiological methods in both animals and humans. However, the association between electrophysiological responses of the sensory system and subjective peripheral sensation (SPS) during a voluntary muscle contraction remains unclear. Our aim in this study was to describe the changes in SPS, spinal -motoneuron excitability (F-wave to M-wave amplitude), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) during a unilateral pinch-grip task. Outcome variables were measured on the side ipsilateral and contralateral to the muscle contraction, and at rest (control). Participants were 8 healthy men, 20.9{+/-}0.8 years of age. The isometric pinch-grip task was performed at 30% of the maximum voluntary isometric force measured for the right and left hand separately. The appearance rate of the F-wave during the task was significantly higher for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and control condition. Although there was no difference in F-wave latency between hands and the control condition, the amplitude of the F-wave was significantly higher for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and the control condition. There was no difference in the amplitude of the SEP at N20. However, the amplitude at P25 was significantly lower for the ipsilateral (right) hand than for the contralateral (left) hand and the control condition. The accuracy rate of detecting tactile stimulation, evaluated for 20 repetitions using a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at the sensory threshold for each participant, was significantly lower during the pinch-grip task for both the ipsilateral (right) and contralateral (left) hand compared to the control condition. Overall, our findings show that SPS and neurophysiological parameters were not modulated in parallel during the task, with changes in subjective sensation preceding changes in electrophysiological indices during the motor task. Our findings provide basic information on sensory-motor coordination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crowding changes appearance systematically in peripheral, amblyopic, and developing vision</a></h4>

              
                Visual crowding is the disruptive effect of clutter on object recognition. Although most prominent in adult peripheral vision, crowding also disrupts foveal vision in typically-developing children and those with strabismic amblyopia. Do these crowding effects share the same mechanism? Here we exploit observations that crowded errors in peripheral vision are not random: target objects appear either averaged with the flankers (assimilation), or replaced by them (substitution). If amblyopic and developmental crowding share the same mechanism then their errors should be similarly systematic. We tested foveal vision in children aged 3-9 years with typical vision or strabismic amblyopia, and peripheral vision in adults. The perceptual effects of crowding were measured by requiring observers to adjust a reference stimulus to match the perceived orientation of a target "Vac-Man" element. When the target was surrounded by flankers that differed by 30deg., adults and children reported orientations between the target and flankers (assimilation). Errors were reduced with 90deg. differences, but primarily matched the flanker orientation (substitution) when they did occur. A population pooling model of crowding successfully simulated this pattern of errors in all three groups. We conclude that the perceptual effects of amblyopic and developing crowding are systematic and resemble the near periphery in adults, suggesting a common underlying mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Benchmarking Geometric Deep Learning for Cortical Segmentation and Neurodevelopmental Phenotype Prediction</a></h4>

              
                The emerging field of geometric deep learning extends the application of convolutional neural networks to irregular domains such as graphs, meshes and surfaces. Several recent studies have explored the potential for using these techniques to analyse and segment the cortical surface. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of these approaches to one another, nor to existing Euclidean methods, to date. This paper benchmarks a collection of geometric and traditional deep learning models on phenotype prediction and segmentation of sphericalised neonatal cortical surface data, from the publicly available Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Tasks include prediction of postmenstrual age at scan, gestational age at birth and segmentation of the cortical surface into anatomical regions defined by the M-CRIB-S atlas. Performance was assessed not only in terms of model precision, but also in terms of network dependence on image registration, and model interpretation via occlusion. Networks were trained both on sphericalised and anatomical cortical meshes. Findings suggest that the utility of geometric deep learning over traditional deep learning is highly task-specific, which has implications for the design of future deep learning models on the cortical surface. The code, and instructions for data access, are available from https://github.com/Abdulah-Fawaz/Benchmarking-Surface-DL.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeted memory reactivation in human REM sleep elicits recurrent, temporally compressed reactivation</a></h4>

              
                Memories are reactivated during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but the question of whether equivalent reactivation also occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is hotly debated. To examine this, we used a technique called targeted memory reactivation (TMR) in which sounds are paired with learned material in wake, and then re-presented in subsequent sleep to trigger reactivation. We then used machine learning classifiers to identify TMR-induced reactivation in REM. The reactivation we measured was temporally compressed by approximately five times during REM compared to wakeful performance of the task, and often occurred twice after a single TMR cue. Reactivation strength positively predicted overnight performance improvement and was only apparent in trials with high theta activity. These findings provide strong evidence for memory reactivation in human REM sleep after TMR as well as an initial characterisation of this reactivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping lesion, structural disconnection, and functional disconnection to symptoms in semantic aphasia</a></h4>

              
                Patients with semantic aphasia have impaired control of semantic retrieval, often accompanied by executive dysfunction following left hemisphere stroke. Many but not all of these patients have damage to the left inferior frontal gyrus, important for semantic and cognitive control. Yet semantic and cognitive control networks are highly distributed, including posterior as well as anterior components. Accordingly, semantic aphasia might not only reflect local damage but also white matter structural and functional disconnection. Here we characterise the lesions and predicted patterns of structural and functional disconnection in individuals with semantic aphasia and relate these effects to semantic and executive impairment. Impaired semantic cognition was associated with infarction in distributed left-hemisphere regions, including in the left anterior inferior frontal and posterior temporal cortex. Lesions were associated with executive dysfunction within a set of adjacent but distinct left frontoparietal clusters. Performance on executive tasks was also associated with interhemispheric structural disconnection across the corpus callosum. Poor semantic cognition was associated with small left-lateralized structurally disconnected clusters, including in the left posterior temporal cortex. These results demonstrate that while left-lateralized semantic and executive control regions are often damaged together in stroke aphasia, these deficits are associated with distinct patterns of structural disconnection, consistent with the bilateral nature of executive control and the left-lateralized yet distributed semantic control network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupillometry and the vigilance decrement: Task-evoked but not baseline pupil measures reflect declining performance in visual vigilance tasks</a></h4>

              
                Baseline and task-evoked pupil measures are known to reflect the activity of the nervous system's central arousal mechanisms. With the increasing availability, affordability and flexibility of video-based eye tracking hardware, these measures may one day find practical application in real-time biobehavioral monitoring systems to assess performance or fitness for duty in tasks requiring vigilant attention. But real-world vigilance tasks are predominantly visual in their nature and most research in this area has taken place in the auditory domain. Here we explore the relationship between pupil size--both baseline and task-evoked--and behavioral performance measures in two novel vigilance tasks requiring visual target detection: 1) a traditional vigilance task involving prolonged, continuous, and uninterrupted performance (n = 28), and 2) a psychomotor vigilance task (n = 25). In both tasks, behavioral performance and task-evoked pupil responses declined as time spent on task increased, corroborating previous reports in the literature of a vigilance decrement with a corresponding reduction in task-evoked pupil measures. Also in line with previous findings, baseline pupil size did not show a consistent relationship with performance measures. We discuss our findings considering the adaptive gain theory of locus coeruleus function and question the validity of the assumption that baseline (prestimulus) pupil size and task-evoked (poststimulus) pupil measures correspond to the tonic and phasic firing modes of the LC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NAc-DBS corrects depression-like behaviors in CUMS mouse model via disinhibition of DA neurons in the VTA</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include loss of motivation and anhedonia. If multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy fail in some patients with MDD, their condition is then termed treatment - resistant depression (TRD). MDD can be associated with abnormalities in the reward - system - dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, in which the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) play major roles. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied to the NAc alleviates the depressive symptoms of MDD. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of this DBS has remained elusive. In this study, using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, we investigated the behavioral and neurobiological effects of NAc - DBS on the multidimensional depression - like phenotypes induced by CUMS by integrating behavioral, in vivo microdialysis coupled with high - performance liquid chromatography - electrochemical detector (HPLC - ECD), calcium imaging, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation methods in freely moving mice. We found that long - term and repeated, but not single, NAc - DBS induced robust antidepressant responses in CUMS mice. Moreover, even a single trial NAc - DBS led to the elevation of the {gamma} - aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, accompanied by the increase in dopamine (DA) neuron activity in the VTA. Both the inhibition of the GABAA receptor activity and knockdown of the GABAA - 1 gene in VTA - GABA neurons blocked the antidepressant effect of NAc - DBS in CUMS mice. Our results showed that NAc - DBS could disinhibit VTA - DA neurons by regulating the level of GABA and the activity of VTA - GABA in the VTA and could finally correct the depression - like behaviors in the CUMS mouse model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emotion Dynamics as Hierarchical Bayesian Inference in Time</a></h4>

              
                What fundamental property of our environment would be most valuable and optimal in characterizing the emotional dynamics we experience in our daily life? Empirical work has shown that an accurate estimation of uncertainty is necessary for our optimal perception, learning, and decision-making. However, the role of this uncertainty in governing our affective dynamics remains unexplored. Using Bayesian encoding, decoding and computational modelling, we show that emotional experiences naturally arise due to ongoing uncertainty estimations in a hierarchical neural architecture. This hierarchical organization involves a number of prefrontal sub-regions, with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex having the highest representational complexity of uncertainty. Crucially, this representational complexity, was sensitive to temporal fluctuations in uncertainty and was predictive of participants predisposition to anxiety. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of uncertainty revealed a distinct functional double dissociation within the OFC. Specifically, the medial OFC showed higher connectivity with the DMN, while the lateral OFC with that of the FPN in response to the evolving affect. Finally, we uncovered a temporally predictive code updating individual beliefs swiftly in the face of fluctuating uncertainty in the lateral OFC. A biologically relevant and computationally crucial parameter in theories of brain function, we extend uncertainty to be a defining component of complex emotions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correspondence between gene expression and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter density in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter receptors modulate the signaling between neurons. Thus, neurotransmitter receptors and transporters play a key role in shaping brain function. Due to the lack of comprehensive neurotransmitter receptor/transporter density datasets, microarray gene expression is often used as a proxy for receptor densities. In the present report, we comprehensively test the expression-density association for a total of 27 neurotransmitter receptors, receptor binding-sites, and transporters across 9 different neurotransmitter systems, using both PET and autoradiography imaging modalities. We find poor spatial correspondences between gene expression and density for all neurotransmitter receptors and transporters except four single-protein metabotropic receptors (5-HT1A, D2, CB1, and MOR). These expression-density associations are related to population variance and change across different classes of laminar differentiation. Altogether, we recommend using direct measures of receptor and transporter density when relating neurotransmitter systems to brain structure and function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid volumetric brain changes after acute psychosocial stress</a></h4>

              
                Rapid structural brain plasticity after acute stress has been shown in animals. It is unknown whether such stress-related brain changes also occur in humans, in which they have been found, using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after motor learning and visual stimulation. We here investigated grey matter volume (GMV) changes after acute stress in humans and tested their relation to psychophysiological stress measures. Sixty-seven healthy men (25.8 +/- 2.7 years) completed a standardized psychosocial laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control version while blood, saliva, heart rate, and psychometrics were sampled. T1-weighted MP2RAGE images at 3T MRI were acquired 45 min before and 90 min after intervention onset. GMV changes were analysed using voxel-based morphometry. Associations with endocrine, autonomic, and subjective stress measures were tested with linear models. We found significant group-by-time interactions in several brain clusters including anterior/mid-cingulate cortices and bilateral insula: GMV was increased in the stress group relative to the control group, in which several clusters showed a GMV decrease. We found no significant group-by-time interaction for other MRI parameters, including cerebral blood flow, but a significant association of GMV changes with state anxiety and heart rate variability changes. In summary, we show rapid GMV changes following acute psychosocial stress in humans. The results suggest that endogenous circadian brain changes are counteracted by acute stress and generally emphasize the influence of stress on the brain.

                Patients suffering from familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) may have a disproportionally severe outcome after head trauma, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Hence, we subjected knock-in mice carrying the severer S218L or milder R192Q FHM1 gain-of-function missense mutation in the CACNA1A gene that encodes the 1A subunit of neuronal voltage-gated CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channels and their wild-type (WT) littermates to experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) by controlled cortical impact (CCI) and investigated cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), lesion volume, brain edema formation, and functional outcome. After TBI, all mutant mice displayed considerably more CSDs and seizures than WT mice, while S218L mutant mice had a substantially higher mortality. Brain edema formation and the resulting increase in intracranial pressure was more pronounced in mutant mice, while only S218L mutant mice had larger lesion volumes and worse functional outcome. Here we show that gain of CaV2.1 channel function worsens histopathological and functional outcome after TBI in mice. This phenotype was associated with a higher number of CSDs, increased seizure activity, and more pronounced brain edema formation. Hence, our results suggest increased susceptibility for CSDs and seizures as potential mechanisms for bad outcome after TBI in FHM1 mutation carriers.

                Metacognition refers to the ability to be aware of one's own cognition. Ample evidence indicate that metacognition in the human primate is highly dissociable from cognition, specialized across domains, and subserved by distinct neural substrates. However, these aspects remain relatively understudied in the macaque monkeys. Here we investigated the functionality of macaques' metacognition by combining a confidence proxy, hierarchical Bayesian meta-d' computational modelling, and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation technique. We found a critical role of Brodmann Area 46d (BA 46d) in supporting metacognition without implicating task performance and its critical time-sensitive role in meta-calculation. We additionally revealed that macaque metacognition is highly domain-specific with respect to memory and perception decisions. These findings carry implications for our understanding of metacognitive introspection within the primate lineage.
