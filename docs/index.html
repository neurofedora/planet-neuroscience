	<p>Increasing evidence shows that virtual reality (VR) training is highly effective in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Another modern form of training is cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor dual-task training (CMDT), which has been demonstrated to rapidly improve physical and cognitive functions in real environments. This study aims to test whether a VR-based CMDT protocol can be used for motor and cognitive skill enhancement in young, healthy subjects. For this aim, 24 university students participated in a randomized control trial. The experimental group participated in a 5-week virtual reality reaction training (VRRT), performing 30 min sessions once a week. The control group did not receive any training but was tested twice with the same measures and temporal distance as the experimental group. Before and after the intervention, motor, cognitive, and electrophysiological measures were assessed. The results showed that following VRRT, the response time for both physical and cognitive tests was improved by about 14% and 12%, respectively, while the control group did not show significant changes. Moreover, electrophysiological data revealed a significant increase in anticipatory motor readiness in premotor brain areas in the experimental group only; however, cognitive top&amp;amp;ndash;down control tended to be increased in prefrontal areas after VRRT. This training protocol in a VR modality seems to be as effective as other CMDT methodologies carried out in a real modality. Still, it has the advantages of being more flexible and more user-friendly compared to standard training. The VRRT&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficacy on physical and cognitive functions indicates that virtual reality applications can be used by the young population, not only for entertainment purposes but also in the form of cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor training.</p>

	<p>A body of experimental research has aimed to investigate processes underlying dream formation by examining the effects of a range of pre-sleep stimuli and events on subsequent dream content. Given its ever-growing presence and salience in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s everyday lives, pre-sleep media consumption stands out as a key variable that could influence people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams. We conducted a scoping review to evaluate the experimental evidence of the effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content. A systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science using terms related to moving visual media and dreams yielded 29 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, we found modest yet varied effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content, with rates of stimulus-related incorporation ranging from 3% to 43% for REM dream reports, 4% to 30% for NREM sleep mentation reports, and between 11% and 35% for home dream reports. Our review highlights the large methodological heterogeneity and gaps across studies, the general difficulty in influencing dream content using pre-sleep exposure to visual media, and suggests promising venues for future research to advance our understanding of how and why digital media may impact people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams.</p>

                Background A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can learn and make predictions by adjusting the strength of the connections between nodes. The sigmoid function is commonly used as an activation function in these nodes. This study explores the potential applicability of biological materials in the development of alternative activation functions. Methods Inspired by the fact that acetylcholine induces intestinal contractions that follow a sigmoid function, we used pharmacological data obtained from guinea pig ilea in a layered neural network for image classification tasks. Results and Conclusions We found that the intestinal data-based neural network with the same structure as a conventional three-layer perceptron achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 85.7% ± 0.6% based on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (chance = 10%). Additionally, the neural network was trained to determine whether objects in photographs collected from the internet were digestible, achieving an accuracy of 88.5% ± 0.9% (chance = 50%). Our approach highlights the potential applicability of intestine data in neural computations based on pharmacological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-301/v2?src=rss">Proposal of a domain model for 3D representation of buildings in Ecuador. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The accelerated urban sprawl of cities around the world presents major challenges for urban planning and land resource management. In this context, it is crucial to have a detailed 3D representation of buildings enriched with accurate alphanumeric information. A distinctive aspect of this proposal is its specific focus on the spatial unit corresponding to buildings. In order to propose a domain model for the 3D representation of buildings, the national standard of Ecuador and the international standard (ISO 19152:2012 LADM) were considered. The proposal includes a detailed specification of attributes, both for the general subclass of buildings and for their infrastructure. The application of the domain model proposal was crucial in a study area located in the Riobamba canton, due to the characteristics of the buildings in that area. For this purpose, a geodatabase was created in pgAdmin4 with official information, taking into account the structure of the proposed model and linking it with geospatial data for an adequate management and 3D representation of the buildings in an open-source Geographic Information System. This application improves cadastral management in the study region and has wider implications. This model is intended to serve as a benchmark for other countries facing similar challenges in cadastral management and 3D representation of buildings, promote efficient urban development and contribute to global sustainable development.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                <p>by Jaejoong Kim, Sarah M. Tashjian, Dean Mobbs</p>

Comparative research suggests that the hypothalamus is critical in switching between survival behaviors, yet it is unclear if this is the case in humans. Here, we investigate the role of the human hypothalamus in survival switching by introducing a paradigm where volunteers switch between hunting and escape in response to encounters with a virtual predator or prey. Given the small size and low tissue contrast of the hypothalamus, we used deep learning-based segmentation to identify the individual-specific hypothalamus and its subnuclei as well as an imaging sequence optimized for hypothalamic signal acquisition. Across 2 experiments, we employed computational models with identical structures to explain internal movement generation processes associated with hunting and escaping. Despite the shared structure, the models exhibited significantly different parameter values where escaping or hunting were accurately decodable just by computing the parameters of internal movement generation processes. In experiment 2, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) showed that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray encode switching of survival behaviors while not encoding simple motor switching outside of the survival context. Furthermore, multi-voxel connectivity analyses revealed a network including the hypothalamus as encoding survival switching and how the hypothalamus is connected to other regions in this network. Finally, model-based fMRI analyses showed that a strong hypothalamic multi-voxel pattern of switching is predictive of optimal behavioral coordination after switching, especially when this signal was synchronized with the multi-voxel pattern of switching in the amygdala. Our study is the first to identify the role of the human hypothalamus in switching between survival behaviors and action organization after switching.

                Introduction A urethral diverticulum can be defined as a pocket that forms from the lining of the urethra and protrudes into the surrounding tissue, a condition which causes voiding dysfunction and may result as a rare complication of hypospadias repair surgery. Case report We report the case of a 2-year-old child who presented to us in 2019 complaining of a thin forceful stream, ballooning of the ventral aspect of the penis while voiding, and post-void dribbling. He has a history of undergoing a tubularised incised plate urethroplasty for distal penile hypospadias at 18-months-old. Ultrasound showed increased post-void residual volume and cystourethroscopy confirmed a urethral diverticulum extending from the subcorona to the base of the penis. The patient underwent partial excision of diverticulum, urethroplasty, and meatoplasty. He was followed-up 3 months later with complete resolution of his symptoms and a normal urinary stream with no urethral ballooning or dribbling. Conclusion Urethral diverticulum may present as a complication post hypospadias repair. Although it is rare, we believe that it is important for the patient’s parents to understand the possibility and know of the signs and symptoms in addition to attending regular outpatient clinic appointments in order to facilitate early management if needed. Furthermore, it is highly important for physicians to assess newborns for hypospadias before carrying out circumcision as it is a contraindication for the procedure.

                Abstract* Pleomorphic adenomas (PA) are the most prevalent benign salivary gland neoplasms. They may occur at any age, with a peak incidence between 40 and 60 years of age. They are more commonly observed in females (60%). These tumors can arise in both the major and minor salivary glands. Approximately 80% of these tumors are diagnosed in the parotid gland, whereas 10% arise in the minor salivary glands, mainly affecting the palates, followed by the lips and cheeks. This report describes two cases of unusual lesions that were diagnosed as (PA) in the minor salivary glands in our department via a review of the relevant literature. The first case involved an 83-year-old man who presented with a slow-growing swelling on the right side of the upper lip, and the second case involved a 45-year-old woman who presented with a slow-growing lesion on the palate. The presence of PA was confirmed histopathologically after surgical resection. Although relatively rare, PA is a benign lesion, the diagnosis of which must be known for appropriate therapeutic management.

                Background Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the causative agent of the most recent pandemic that hit the globe and has been the cause of a vast range of symptoms, including neurological symptoms. Bell’s palsy is an acute peripheral facial paralysis commonly associated with viral infections. Case presentation This case report describes a patient with incidental COVID-19 infection that led to acute unilateral peripheral facial paralysis, Bell’s palsy. Our patient is a 35-year-old male with no known comorbidities who was presenting with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and was found to be positive for COVID-19. Soon after the onset of symptoms, he also developed right-sided facial weakness in association with his symptoms. A thorough examination revealed a peripheral neurological lesion. The diagnosis of Bell’s palsy secondary to COVID-19 virus infection was through the exclusion of other possible causes. Conclusions This case report suggests a potential link between Bell’s palsy and COVID-19, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Further research is essential to determine the significance of neuropathies in COVID-19 and enhance treatment strategies.

                Background Recall of medical instructions is associated with improved adherence to treatment. The recall of the Body Mass Index (BMI) is important for the improvement of adherence to treatments related to obesity. The burden of obesity all over the world has increased, including in many sub-Saharan African countries. This study measured the recall of BMI, shared decision-making (SDM), and patients’ demographics to determine if they were associated. Methods The study was conducted at a rural hospital outpatient clinic in South Western Uganda. Data were collected using a questionnaire and collaboRate-5 tool for measuring shared decision-making. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. The chi-square test and Pearson coefficient test were done. Results Out of the 92 participants in this study, the median age was 36 years, in an age range of 18 to 87 years, the majority were male 54 (58.7%), most had a background of attending formal education 75 (81.5%), 79 (85.9%) were not able to recall their BMI; 13 (14.1%) were able to recall their BMI. Only gender among demographic factors studied was associated with recall of BMI (p = 0.027). Shared decision-making was associated with the recall of BMI (P < 0.001). Conclusions The proportion of patients who were not able to recall their BMI after the outpatient clinic visit was high. Gender and the use of SDM were associated with recall of BMI. Measured items describing the use of SDM were only reported among 21(22.8%) participants. SDM was underutilized during the study period at the outpatient clinic. There is a need to have continuous medical education on SDM.

                Background Expert consensus methods are regularly used in natural, social, and life sciences. This article explores the potential of applying these methods more frequently in humanities research. Methods The authors reviewed literature and applied the philosophical methods of conceptual analysis and conceptual engineering. Results This article identifies and describes six main elements of expert consensus methods. It also provides an overview of the different types of expert consensus methods regularly used in the natural, social, and life sciences: Delphi studies, nominal groups, consensus conferences, and Glaser’s state of the art method. Subsequently, each of these types is illustrated by an example from the sciences. The article also presents the potential of and objections to the application of expert consensus methods there. It gives four examples of expert consensus methods that were applied in humanities research, also presented in line with the six elements. Conclusions The comparisons and categorization show that, as in the natural, social, and life sciences, expert consensus methods in the humanities can in some instances potentially accelerate the epistemic process and enhance transparency, replicability, diversity, and fair processes. Nevertheless, expert consensus methods need to be fine-tuned to do justice to the unique nature and approaches of the humanities and therefore further research is needed.

                Background Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used in hepatectomy patients since it is opioid-sparing. However, TEA has a high failure rate and is associated with potentially devastating complications (spinal haematoma) and the risk is increased with hepatectomy. Thus, some centres favour systemic opioid-based modalities which, in turn, are associated with inferior analgesia and well-known risks/side-effects. Hence, alternative analgesic methods are desirable. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used in liver resection with advantages including haemodynamic stability, low failure rates, and low risk of spinal haematoma. The purpose of this pilot RCT is to compare continuous TEA (traditional standard of care is local anesthetic (LA) + opioids) with PVB (traditional standard of care is with LA without opioid) for patients undergoing hepatectomy. We hypothesise that pain outcomes will be comparable between groups, but PVB patients will require fewer perioperative vasopressors/blood products, have fewer opioid-related side effects and a shorter hospital length of stay. Methods With ethics approval, this non-inferiority, pilot RCT with a convenience sample of 50 hepatectomy patients will examine whether PVB imparts analgesia comparable to TEA but with fewer adverse effects. Primary outcomes are surrogates of analgesia for 72 h postoperatively (i.e., opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request and pain scores at rest and with coughing); Secondary outcomes are blood products/fluids administered; side effects/complications until 72 h postoperatively; length of hospital stay. The results will be used to plan a large multicentre trial comparing TEA vs. PVB in hepatectomy patients. This study has a high potential to positively impact the quality/safety of patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87753">GABAergic synaptic scaling is triggered by changes in spiking activity rather than AMPA receptor activation</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms that are thought to recover some aspect of neural function. One such mechanism called AMPAergic scaling was thought to be a likely candidate to homeostatically control spiking activity. However, recent findings have forced us to reconsider this idea as several studies suggest AMPAergic scaling is not directly triggered by changes in spiking. Moreover, studies examining homeostatic perturbations <i>in vivo</i> have suggested that GABAergic synapses may be more critical in terms of spiking homeostasis. Here, we show results that GABAergic scaling can act to homeostatically control spiking levels. We found that perturbations which increased or decreased spiking in cortical cultures triggered multiplicative GABAergic upscaling and downscaling, respectively. In contrast, we found that changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) or GABAR transmission only influence GABAergic scaling through their indirect effect on spiking. We propose that GABAergic scaling represents a stronger candidate for spike rate homeostat than AMPAergic scaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90278">Serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the dorsal raphe are differentially altered in a mouse model for parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairments caused by degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to these symptoms, PD patients often suffer from non-motor comorbidities including sleep and psychiatric disturbances, which are thought to depend on concomitant alterations of serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission. A primary locus of serotonergic neurons is the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), providing brain-wide serotonergic input. Here, we identified electrophysiological and morphological parameters to classify serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the murine DRN under control conditions and in a PD model, following striatal injection of the catecholamine toxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Electrical and morphological properties of both neuronal populations were altered by 6-OHDA. In serotonergic neurons, most changes were reversed when 6-OHDA was injected in combination with desipramine, a noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor, protecting the noradrenergic terminals. Our results show that the depletion of both NA and dopamine in the 6-OHDA mouse model causes changes in the DRN neural circuitry.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92938">Neural interactions in the human frontal cortex dissociate reward and punishment learning</a></h4>

              
                How human prefrontal and insular regions interact while maximizing rewards and minimizing punishments is unknown. Capitalizing on human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that the functional specificity toward reward or punishment learning is better disentangled by interactions compared to local representations. Prefrontal and insular cortices display non-selective neural populations to rewards and punishments. Non-selective responses, however, give rise to context-specific interareal interactions. We identify a reward subsystem with redundant interactions between the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, with a driving role of the latter. In addition, we find a punishment subsystem with redundant interactions between the insular and dorsolateral cortices, with a driving role of the insula. Finally, switching between reward and punishment learning is mediated by synergistic interactions between the two subsystems. These results provide a unifying explanation of distributed cortical representations and interactions supporting reward and punishment learning.

                SARS-CoV-2 induces delayed type-I/III interferon production, allowing it to escape the early innate immune response. The delay has been attributed to a deﬁciency in the ability of cells to sense viral replication upon infection, which in turn hampers activation of the antiviral state in bystander cells. Here, we introduce a cellular automaton model to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading of viral infection as a function of virus and host-dependent parameters. The model suggests that the considerable person-to-person heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 infections is a consequence of high sensitivity to slight variations in biological parameters near a critical threshold. It further suggests that within-host viral proliferation can be curtailed by the presence of remarkably few cells that are primed for IFN production. Thus, the observed heterogeneity in defense readiness of cells reﬂects a remarkably cost-eﬃcient strategy for protection.

                Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, in particular in the IDRs.

">Mapping individual differences in intermodal coupling in neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                Within-individual coupling between measures of brain structure and function evolves in development and may underlie differential risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite increasing interest in the development of structure-function relationships, rigorous methods to quantify and test individual differences in coupling remain nascent. In this article, we explore and address gaps in approaches for testing and spatially localizing individual differences in intermodal coupling. We propose a new method, called CIDeR, which is designed to simultaneously perform hypothesis testing in a way that limits false positive results and improve detection of true positive results. Through a comparison across different approaches to testing individual differences in intermodal coupling, we delineate subtle differences in the hypotheses they test, which may ultimately lead researchers to arrive at different results. Finally, we illustrate the utility of CIDeR in two applications to brain development using data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort.

">Integrative Transcriptomics Reveals Layer 1 Astrocytes Altered in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders with unclear pathophysiology despite a century-long history of intense research. Schizophrenia affects multiple networks across different brain regions. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is the region that connects the limbic system to cognitive areas such as the prefrontal cortex and represents a pivotal region for the etiology of schizophrenia; however, the molecular pathology, considering its cellular and anatomical complexity, is not well understood. Here, we performed an integrative analysis of spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomics of the postmortem ACC of people with schizophrenia, together with a thorough histological analysis. The data revealed major transcriptomics signatures altered in schizophrenia, pointing at the dysregulation of glial cells, primarily in astrocytes. We further discovered a decrease in the cellular density and abundance of processes of interlaminar astrocytes, a subpopulation of astrocytes specific to primates that localize in the layer 1 and influence the superficial cortical microenvironment across layer 1 and layers 2/3 of the cortex. Our study suggests that aberrant changes in interlaminar astrocytes could explain the cell-to-cell circuit alterations found in schizophrenia and represent novel therapeutic targets to ameliorate schizophrenia-associated dysfunction.

">Control of innate olfactory valence by segregated cortical amygdala circuits</a></h4>

              
                Animals perform innate behaviors that are stereotyped responses to specific evolutionarily relevant stimuli in the absence of prior learning or experience. These behaviors can be reduced to an axis of valence, whereby specific odors evoke approach or avoidance. The cortical amygdala (plCoA) mediates innate attraction and aversion to odor. However, little is known about how this brain area gives rise to behaviors of opposing motivational valence. Here, we sought to define the circuit features of plCoA that give rise to innate olfactory behaviors of valence. We characterized the physiology, gene expression, and projections of this structure, identifying a divergent, topographic organization that selectively controls innate attraction and avoidance to odor. First, we examined odor-evoked responses in these areas and found sparse encoding of odor identity, but not valence. We next considered a topographic organization and found that optogenetic stimulation of the anterior and posterior domains of plCoA elicits attraction and avoidance, respectively, suggesting a functional axis for valence. Using single cell and spatial RNA sequencing, we identified the molecular cell types in plCoA, revealing an anteroposterior gradient in cell types, whereby anterior glutamatergic neurons preferentially express Slc17a6 and posterior neurons express Slc17a7. Activation of these respective cell types recapitulates appetitive and aversive valence behaviors, and chemogenetic inhibition reveals partial necessity for valence responses to innate appetitive or aversive odors. Finally, we identified topographically organized circuits defined by projections, whereby anterior neurons preferentially project to medial amygdala, and posterior neurons preferentially project to nucleus accumbens, which are respectively sufficient and necessary for innate negative and positive olfactory valence. Together, these data advance our understanding of how the olfactory system generates stereotypic, hardwired attraction and avoidance, and supports a model whereby distinct, topographically distributed plCoA populations direct innate olfactory valence responses by signaling to divergent valence-specific targets, linking upstream olfactory identity to downstream valence behaviors, through a population code. This represents a novel circuit motif in which valence encoding is represented not by the firing properties of individual neurons, but by population level identity encoding that is routed through divergent targets to mediate distinct valence.

">Layer Va neurons, as major presynaptic partners of corticospinal neurons, play critical roles in skilled movements</a></h4>

              
                Corticospinal neurons (CSNs) are located in the cortex and projecting into the spinal cord. The activation of CSNs, which is associated with skilled motor behaviors, induces the activation of interneurons in the spinal cord. Eventually, motor neuron activation is induced by corticospinal circuits to coordinate muscle activation. Therefore, elucidating how the activation of CSNs in the brain is regulated is necessary for understanding the roles of CSNs in skilled motor behaviors. However, the presynaptic partners of CSNs in the brain remain to be identified. Here, we performed transsynaptic rabies virus-mediated brain-wide mapping to identify presynaptic partners of CSNs (pre-CSNs). We found that pre-CSNs are located in all cortical layers, but major pre-CSNs are located in layer Va. A small population of pre-CSNs are also located outside the cortex, such as in the thalamus. Inactivation of layer Va neurons in Tlx3-Cre mice results in deficits in skilled reaching and grasping behaviors, suggesting that, similar to CSNs, layer Va neurons are critical for skilled movements. Finally, we examined whether the connectivity of CSNs is altered after spinal cord injury (SCI). We found that unlike connections between CNSs and postsynaptic neurons, connections between pre-CSNs and CSNs do not change after SCI.

">Exercise-induced pain modulation is sex, opioid, and fitness-dependent and mediated by the medial frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Exercise leads to a release of endogenous opioids, potentially resulting in pain relief. However, the neurobiological underpinnings of this effect remain unclear, and studies in rodents and humans have mainly investigated this in male subjects. Using a pharmacological within-subject fMRI study with the opioid antagonist naloxone and different levels of exercise and pain we investigated exercise-induced hypoalgesia in a balanced sample (N = 39, 21 female). Overall, we were unable to detect exercise-induced pain modulation after exercise in heat pain. However, our data reveal a crucial interplay of drug, fitness level, and sex where males showed greater hypoalgesia through exercise with increasing fitness levels. This effect was attenuated by naloxone and mirrored by fMRI signal changes in the medial frontal cortex, where activation also varied with fitness level and sex, and was reversed by naloxone. These results indicate that exercise exerts a sex and fitness-dependent hypoalgesic effect mediated by endogenous opioids and the medial frontal cortex.

">Translational control in the spinal cord regulates gene expression and pain hypersensitivity in the chronic phase of neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Sensitization of spinal nociceptive circuits plays a crucial role in neuropathic pain. This sensitization depends on new gene expression that is primarily regulated via transcriptional and translational control mechanisms. The relative roles of these mechanisms in regulating gene expression in the clinically relevant chronic phase of neuropathic pain are not well understood. Here, we show that changes in gene expression in the spinal cord during the chronic phase of neuropathic pain are substantially regulated at the translational level. Downregulating spinal translation at the chronic phase alleviated pain hypersensitivity. Cell-type-specific profiling revealed that spinal inhibitory neurons exhibited greater changes in translation after peripheral nerve injury compared to excitatory neurons. Notably, increasing translation selectively in all inhibitory neurons or parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, but not excitatory neurons, promoted mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, increasing translation in PV+ neurons decreased their intrinsic excitability and spiking activity, whereas reducing translation in spinal PV+ neurons prevented the nerve injury-induced decrease in excitability. Thus, translational control mechanisms in the spinal cord, particularly in inhibitory neurons, play a role in mediating neuropathic pain hypersensitivity.

                Alzheimer disease currently has no cure and is usually detected too late for interventions to be effective. In this study we have focused on cognitively normal subjects to study the impact of risk factors on their long-range brain connections. To detect vulnerable connections, we devised a multiscale, hierarchical method for spatial clustering of the whole brain tractogram and examined the impact of age and APOE allelic variation on cognitive abilities and bundle properties including texture e.g., mean fractional anisotropy, variability, and geometric properties including streamline length, volume, and shape, as well as asymmetry. We found that the third level subdivision in the bundle hierarchy provided the most sensitive ability to detect age and genotype differences associated with risk factors. Our results indicate that frontal bundles were a major age predictor, while the occipital cortex and cerebellar connections were important risk predictors that were heavily genotype dependent, and showed accelerated decline in fractional anisotropy, shape similarity, and increased asymmetry. Cognitive metrics related to olfactory memory were mapped to bundles, providing possible early markers of neurodegeneration. In addition, physiological metrics such as diastolic blood pressure were associated with changes in white matter tracts. Our novel method for a data driven analysis of sensitive changes in tractography may differentiate populations at risk for AD and isolate specific vulnerable networks.

                Human eyes' optical components are misaligned. This study presents the geometric construction of ocular torsion in the binocular system, in which the eye model incorporates the fovea that is not located on and the lens that is tilted away from the eye's optical axis. The ocular torsion computation involves Euler's rotation theorem in the framework of Rodrigue's vector. When the eyes' binocular posture changes, each eye's torsional orientation transformations are visualized in GeoGebra's dynamic geometry environment. Listing's law, which originally restricts single-eye torsional positions and has imprecise binocular extensions, is formulated ab initio for binocular fixations using Euler's rotation theorem. It, however, replaces the Listing plane defined for the eyes looking straight ahead with the eyes' resting posture fixation related to the abathic distance fixation of the empirical horopter uniquely defined by its straight-line frontal orientation. Thus, Listing's law use in clinical diagnosis and management of strabismus should be updated.

">Cell-specific wiring routes information flow through hippocampal CA3</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is dogmatically described as a trisynaptic circuit. Dentate gyrus granule cells, CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs), and CA1 PNs are serially connected, forming a circuit that critically enables memory storage in the brain. However, fundamental aspects of hippocampal function go beyond this simplistic 'trisynaptic' definition. CA3 PNs connect not only to CA1, but also establish the largest autoassociative network in the brain. In addition, CA3 PNs are not uniform, differing in their morphology, intrinsic properties, and even the extent of granule cell input. Understanding how these different subtypes of CA3 PNs are embedded in the hippocampal network is essential for our quest to understand learning and memory. Here, we performed simultaneous multi-cellular patch-clamp recordings from up to eight CA3 PNs in acute mouse hippocampal slices, testing 3114 possible connections between identified cells. Combined with post-hoc morphological analysis, this allowed full characterization of neuronal heterogeneity in functioning microcircuits. We demonstrate that CA3 PNs can be divided into distinct 'deep' and 'superficial' subclasses, with altered input-output balance. While both subtypes formed recurrent connectivity within classes, connectivity between subtypes was surprisingly asymmetric. Recurrent connectivity was abundant from superficial to deep, but almost absent from deep to superficial PNs, thereby splitting CA3 into parallel recurrent networks which will allow more complex information processing. Finally, we observed innervation of PN subclasses by distinct interneurons, a potential mechanism to gate information flow through CA3 sublayers. Together, our data present a major revision to the classical 'trisynaptic' view of the hippocampus, bringing us closer to understanding its complex action in information storage.

">The pathogenicity of PSEN2 variants is tied to Aβ production and homology to PSEN1</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Though recognized as a potential cause of Autosomal Dominant Alzheimers Disease, the pathogenicity of many PSEN2 variants remains uncertain. We compared A{beta} production across all missense PSEN2 variants in the Alzforum database and, when possible, to corresponding PSEN1 variants. METHODS: We expressed 74 PSEN2 variants, 21 of which had homologous PSEN1 variants with the same amino acid substitution, in HEK293 cells lacking PSN1/2. A{beta} production was compared to age at symptom onset (AAO) and between homologous PSEN1/2 variants. RESULTS: A{beta} 42/40 and A{beta} 37/42 ratios were associated with AAO across PSEN2 variants, strongly driven by PSEN2 variants with PSEN1 homologs. PSEN2 AAO was 18.3 years later compared to PSEN1 homologs. A{beta} ratios from PSEN1/2 homologs were highly correlated, suggesting a similar mechanism of {gamma}-secretase dysfunction. DISCUSSION: The existence of a PSEN1 homolog and patterns of A{beta} production are important considerations in assessing the pathogenicity of previously-reported and new PSEN2 variants.

">N2 Sleep Inspires Insight</a></h4>

              
                Humans sometimes have an insight that leads to a sudden and drastic performance improvement on the task they are working on. The precise origins of such insights are unknown. Some evidence has shown that sleep facilitates insights, while other work has not found such a relationship. One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight. To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime. Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep. Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation. In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.

">Attenuated processing of vowels in the left hemisphere predicts speech-in-noise perception deficit in children with autism</a></h4>

              
                Background: Difficulties with speech-in-noise perception in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be associated with impaired analysis of speech sounds, such as vowels, which represent the fundamental phoneme constituents of human speech. Vowels elicit early (< 100 ms) sustained processing negativity (SPN) in the auditory cortex that reflects the detection of an acoustic pattern based on the presence of formant structure and/or periodic envelope information (f0) and its transformation into an auditory "object". Methods: We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and individual brain models to investigate whether SPN is altered in children with ASD and whether this deficit is associated with impairment in their ability to perceive speech in the background of noise. MEG was recorded while boys with ASD and typically developing boys passively listened to sounds that differed in the presence/absence of f0 periodicity and formant structure. Word-in-noise perception was assessed in the separate psychoacoustic experiment using stationary and amplitude modulated noise with varying signal-to-noise ratio. Results: SPN was present in both groups with similarly early onset. In children with ASD, SPN associated with processing formant structure was reduced predominantly in the cortical areas lateral to and medial to the primary auditory cortex, starting at ~ 150 - 200 ms after the stimulus onset. In the left hemisphere, this deficit correlated with impaired ability of children with ASD to recognize words in amplitude-modulated noise, but not in stationary noise. Limitations: Our analysis was limited to the auditory cortical areas, while ASD vs TD differences in vowel processing may exist beyond these areas. It is not clear if the SPN group differences are specific to vowels or are also present for other acoustic patterns with coherent frequency structure. Conclusions: These results suggest that perceptual grouping of vowel formants into phonemes is impaired in children with ASD and that, in the left hemisphere, this deficit contributes to their difficulties with speech perception in fluctuating background noise.

">MICROBIOME-MODIFIED METABOLITES PREDICT ACUTE BRAIN INJURY OUTCOME</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND. Acute brain injury (ABI)-mediated disruption of the microbiome may potentiate inflammation and secondary brain injury (SBI). However, microbial-specific mediators and mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS. Thirty-five consecutive patients with ABI admitted to the neuroscience critical care unit at the University of Chicago were prospectively studied. Injury severity at hospital admission was assessed using the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Final neurologic function was assessed via the Glasgow Outcome Score extended (GOSe). Serum, plasma, and stool targeted metabolomics, as well as stool shotgun metagenomics, were performed on longitudinal samples collected during hospitalization. RESULTS. Multivariate analysis identified microbiome-modified metabolites that were positively and negatively associated with functional outcomes after ABI. Novel identification of conjugated bile acid (BA) species and vitamin B12 precursors indicative of outcome were detected in the first collected samples (within 48 hours). Network analysis revealed greater integration of negatively associated metabolites across tissues and identified tauro-a/B-muricholic acid (TMCA) as central to the cross-tissue metabolomes. CONCLUSIONS. Microbiome metabolites may be useful in assessing brain injury outcomes to inform treatment. Bile acid species transformed by the gut microbiome are predictive of ABI outcome.

">Spiking network model of the cerebellum as a reinforcement learning machine</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum has been considered to perform error-based supervised learning via long-term depression (LTD) at synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells (PCs). Since the discovery of multiple synaptic plasticities other than LTD, recent studies have suggested that synergistic plasticity mechanisms could enhance the learning capability of the cerebellum. We have proposed that the mechanisms allow the cerebellar circuit to perform reinforcement learning (RL). However, its detailed spike-based implementation is still missing. In this research, we implemented a cerebellar spiking network as an actor-critic model based on known anatomical properties of the cerebellum. We confirmed that our model successfully learned a state value and solved the mountain car task, a simple RL benchmark. Furthermore, our model demonstrated the ability to solve the delay eyeblink conditioning task using biologically plausible internal dynamics. The study presents the implementation of the first cerebellar spiking network model capable of performing RL.

">Simply crushed Zizyphi spinosi semen prevents neurodegenerative diseases and reverses age-related cognitive decline in mice</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are age-related disorders characterized by the cerebral accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins, and cellular senescence underlies their pathogenesis. Thus, it is necessary for preventing these diseases to remove toxic proteins, repair damaged neurons, and suppress cellular senescence. As a source for such prophylactic agents, we selected Zizyphi spinosi semen (ZSS), a medicinal herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. ZSS hot water extract ameliorated A{beta} and tau pathology and cognitive impairment in mouse models of Alzheimers disease and frontotemporal dementia. Non-extracted ZSS simple crush powder showed stronger effects than the extract and improved -synuclein pathology and cognitive/motor function in Parkinsons disease model mice. Furthermore, when administered to normal aged mice, the ZSS powder suppressed cellular senescence, reduced DNA oxidation, promoted brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis, and enhanced cognition to levels similar to those in young mice. The quantity of known active ingredients of ZSS, jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin, was not proportional to the nootropic activity of ZSS. These results suggest that ZSS simple crush powder is a promising dietary material for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.

">Sequential estimation of nonstationary oscillator states and stimulus responses</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations have been linked to multiple behaviors and neuropsychiatric disorders. The individual contributions to behavior from both oscillations and non-oscillatory activity are still unclear, complicating efforts to link neurophysiology to cognition, hindering the discovery of novel biomarkers, and preventing the development of effective therapeutics. To overcome these hurdles, it will be critical to investigate the biological origins of neural oscillations by characterizing the dynamic properties of different brain regions. The dynamical regime for a population of neurons generating oscillations in neural recordings can be discovered by stimulating the population and recording its subsequent response to stimulation. There are different dynamical regimes that can produce population-level neural oscillations. For certain dynamical regimes, like that of a nonlinear oscillator, the phase response curve (PRC) can help differentiate the dynamic state of the population. The PRC can be measured by stimulating the population across different phases of its oscillatory state. However, neural dynamics are non-stationary, so neural oscillations will vary in frequency and amplitude across a recording and the PRC can change over time. This non-stationarity could bias a PRC estimated from an electrophysiological experiment, preventing accurate characterization of a neural population's dynamics. This necessitates tools that can operate online to trigger stimulation and update PRC estimates. To that end, we develop online methods for tracking non-stationary oscillations and recovering PRCs corrupted by estimation errors. We validate the performance of our non-stationary oscillation estimator compared to both a known ground truth model and an alternative phase estimation approach. We demonstrate that a PRC can be recovered online under different random error conditions in silico and that a similar amplitude response curve (ARC) can be estimated from physiologic data using online methods compared to offline approaches.

">Behavioral and neural mechanisms of face-specific attention during goal-directed visual search</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed visual attention is a fundamental cognitive process that enables animals to selectively focus on specific regions of the visual field while filtering out irrelevant information. However, given the domain specificity of social behaviors, it remains unclear whether attention to faces versus non-faces recruits different neurocognitive processes. In this study, we simultaneously recorded activity from temporal and frontal nodes of the attention network while macaques performed a goal-directed visual search task. V4 and inferotemporal (IT) visual category-selective units, selected during cue presentation, discriminated fixations on targets and distractors during the search, but were differentially engaged by face and house targets. V4 and IT category-selective units also encoded fixation transitions and search dynamics. Compared to distractors, fixations on targets reduced spike-LFP coherence within the temporal cortex. Importantly, target-induced desynchronization between the temporal and prefrontal cortices was only evident for face targets, suggesting that attention to faces differentially engaged the prefrontal cortex. We further revealed bidirectional theta influence between the temporal and prefrontal cortices using Granger causality, which was again disproportionate for faces. Finally, we showed that the search became more efficient with increasing target-induced desynchronization. Together, our results suggest domain specificity for attending to faces and an intricate interplay between visual attention and social processing neural networks.

">Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia contribute to thepathophysiology of Fragile X syndrome via increased RAC1 signaling</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common monogenic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy. Emerging evidence suggests a role for immune dysfunction in autism. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglial cells from FXS patients (mFXS-MG) and FMR1-deficient microglia from FMR1-knock out human embryonic stem cells (FMR1 KO-MG), we show that loss-of-function of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) leads to cell autonomous phagocytic deficits and a proinflammatory state in microglia when compared to gene-corrected controls. Moreover, increased RAC1 signaling in mFXS-MG and FMR1 KO-MG results in increased actin polymerization and enhanced activation of NF-kB signaling. Exposure of control iPSC-derived cortical neuron cultures to conditioned medium from proinflammatory mFXS-MG results in hyperexcitability. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of RAC1 signaling in mFXS-MG attenuates their proinflammatory profile and corrects the neuronal hyperexcitability caused by the conditioned medium. Our results suggest that microglia impair neuronal function in FXS, which can be prevented by targeting of RAC1 signaling.

">An Investigation of Parameter-Dependent Cell-Type Specific Effects of Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Stimulation Using an Awake Head-Fixed Rodent Model</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a promising neuromodulation technique able to target shallow and deep brain structures with high precision. Previous studies have demonstrated that tFUS stimulation responses are both cell-type specific and controllable through altering stimulation parameters. Specifically, tFUS can elicit time-locked neural activity in regular spiking units (RSUs) that is sensitive to increases in pulse repetition frequency (PRF), while time-locked responses are not seen in fast spiking units (FSUs). These findings suggest a unique capability of tFUS to alter circuit network dynamics with cell-type specificity; however, these results could be biased by the use of anesthesia, which significantly modulates neural activities. In this study, we develop an awake head-fixed rat model specifically designed for tFUS study, and address a key question if tFUS still has cell-type specificity under awake conditions. Using this novel animal model, we examined a series of PRFs and burst duty cycles (DCs) to determine their effects on neuronal subpopulations without anesthesia. We conclude that cell-type specific time-locked and delayed responses to tFUS as well as PRF and DC sensitivity are present in the awake animal model and that despite some differences in response, isoflurane anesthesia is not a major confound in studying the cell-type specificity of ultrasound neuromodulation. We further determine that, in an awake, head-fixed setting, the preferred PRF and DC for inducing time-locked excitation with our pulsed tFUS paradigm are 1500 Hz and 60%, respectively.

">Robust sub-network fingerprints of brief signals in the MEGfunctional connectome for single-patient classification</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) functional connectome is differentiable in a same-day recording with only 20 latent components, showing variability across synchrony measures and spectral bands. Here, we succeed with 45/4,005 components of the functional connectome on a multi-day dataset of 43 subjects and link it to related clinical applications. By optimizing sub-networks of 10/90 regions with 30 seconds of broadband signal, we find robust fingerprinting performance, showing patterns of region re-occurrence. From a search space of 5.72 trillion, we find 46,071 of many more acceptable solutions, with minimal duplicates found in our optimization. Finally, we show that each of these sub-networks can identify thirty Parkinsons' patient sub-networks from thirty healthy controls' with a mean F1 score of 0.716 +/- 0.090SD. MEG fingerprints have previously been shown on multiple occasions to hold rich information on the stage and severity of progressive neurodegenerative diseases using significantly fewer features. Furthermore, these sub-networks may similarly be useful for identifying patterns across age, genetics, and cognition.

">Computational Models of Age-Associated Cognitive Slowing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cognitive slowing accompanies normal aging, yet understanding of the mechanisms of slowing is limited at the network and neuronal level. Relating the pathophysiological factors responsible for cognitive slowing, and interpreting its relationship to working memory, requires multiscale computer modeling. Objective: The aim of this research is to explore multiple mechanisms of cognitive slowing using computational modeling of the cortex to link neuronal activity with cognitive content. Method: We developed multiscale computer models of a simple cognitive task - Condition 1 of the Stroop recognition task - using the Nengo system, a cognitive simulation environment with a semantic pointer architecture developed to model cognitive tasks using spiking neural networks. We explored how changes associated with aging such as increased input noise, axonal loss, neuronal loss, and feedback would affect the function of the models. Results: Axonal loss and increased input noise produced profound slowing. High levels of neuronal loss severely impaired memory and paradoxically decreased slowing via the ability to respond more quickly by 'releasing' a prior memory. Increased feedback improved memory at the cost of increased slowing. Conclusion: Our simulations suggest that significant slowing could be caused by white matter loss (axonal loss) or input signal degradation (which could be caused by visual or other afferent system worsening). As neuronal loss markedly decreased the duration of working memory, we propose that physiological feedback is increased to preserve working memory at the cost of further cognitive slowing.

">Semantic Influences on Object Detection: Drift Diffusion Modeling Provides Insights Regarding Mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Research shows that semantics, activated by words, impacts object detection. Skocypec & Peterson (2022) indexed object detection via correct reports of where figures lie in bipartite displays depicting familiar objects on one side of a border. They reported 2 studies with intermixed Valid and Invalid labels shown before test displays and a third, control, study. Valid labels denoted display objects. Invalid labels denoted unrelated objects in a different or the same superordinate-level category in studies 1 & 2, respectively. We used drift diffusion modeling (DDM) to elucidate the mechanisms of their results. DDM revealed that, following Valid labels, drift rate toward the correct decision increased, i.e., SNR increased. Following Invalid labels, SNR was lower only for upright displays in study 2. Thresholds were higher in studies 1 & 2 than in control. That more evidence must be accumulated from displays that follow labels implies that familiar object detection entails semantic activation. Threshold was even higher following Invalid labels in study 2, suggesting that more evidence from the display is needed to resolve within- category conflicts. These results support the view that semantic networks are engaged in object detection.

">The Incisive Duct as a Pathway for Early Vomeronasal Communication in Neonatal Dogs</a></h4>

              
                The detection of chemical signals by the vomeronasal organ (VNO) is critical for communication among mammals from an early age, influencing behaviors such as suckling and recognition of the mother and conspecifics. Located in a concealed position at the base of the nasal cavity, the VNO features a duct covered with a sensory epithelium rich in neuroreceptors. A critical aspect of VNO functionality is the efficient access of stimuli from the nasal and oral cavities to the receptors. In adult dogs, it has been demonstrated through in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and anatomically postmortem how the VNO duct (VD) communicates to the environment through the incisive duct (ID). However, in newborn puppies, the existence of functional communication between the ID and the VD has not been confirmed to date, raising doubts about the potential physiological obliteration of the ID due to its small size and the degree of immaturity of the puppies at birth. Determining this aspect is necessary to evaluate the role played by chemical communication in this critical phase for the survival and socialization of puppies. This study employs serial histological staining techniques to examine the presence and functionality of the incisive duct in neonatal dogs. The serial histological sections have confirmed both the existence of functional communication between both the vomeronasal and incisive ducts in perinatal puppies, and the dual functional communication of the incisive duct with the oral and nasal cavities. The ID shows an uninterrupted lumen along its path and is associated with a sophisticated cartilaginous complex that prevents its collapse, as well as erectile tissue rich in blood vessels and connective tissue that acts as a cushion, facilitating its action under pressure induced by sampling behaviors such as tonguing. This investigation demonstrates the communicative capabilities of the VNO during the perinatal stage in dogs.

">Propagating cortical waves coordinate sensory encoding and memory retrieval in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Complex behavior entails a balance between taking in sensory information from the environment and utilizing previously learned internal information. Experiments in behaving mice have demonstrated that the brain continually alternates between outward and inward modes of cognition, switching its mode of operation every few seconds. Further, each state transition is marked by a stereotyped cascade of neuronal spiking that pervades most forebrain structures. Here we analyzed large fMRI datasets to demonstrate that a similar switching mechanism governs the operation of the human brain. We found that human brain activity was punctuated every several seconds by coherent, propagating waves emerging in the exteroceptive sensorimotor regions and terminating in the interoceptive default mode network. As in the mouse, the issuance of such events coincided with fluctuations in pupil size, indicating a tight relationship with arousal fluctuations, and this phenomenon occurred across behavioral states. Strikingly, concurrent measurement of human performance in a visual memory task indicated that each cycle of propagating fMRI waves sequentially promoted the encoding of semantic information and self-directed retrieval of memories. Together, these findings indicate that human cognitive performance is governed by autonomous switching between exteroceptive and interoceptive states. This apparently conserved feature of mammalian brain physiology bears directly on the integration of sensory and mnemonic information during everyday behavior.

">Strong, but not weak, noise correlations are beneficial for population coding</a></h4>

              
                Neural correlations play a critical role in sensory information coding. They are of two kinds: signal correlations, when neurons have overlapping sensitivities, and noise correlations from network effects and shared noise. It is commonly thought that stimulus and noise correlations should have opposite signs to improve coding. However, experiments from early sensory systems and cortex typically show the opposite effect, with many pairs of neurons showing both types of correlations to be positive and large. Here, we develop a theory of information coding by correlated neurons which resolves this paradox. We show that noise correlations are always beneficial if they are strong enough. Extensive tests on retinal recordings under different visual stimuli confirm our predictions. Finally, using neuronal recordings and modeling, we show that for high dimensional stimuli noise correlation benefits the encoding of fine-grained details of visual stimuli, at the expense of large-scale features, which are already well encoded.

">Exploration and exploitation are flexibly balanced during local search in flies</a></h4>

              
                After finding food, a foraging animal must decide whether to continue feeding, or to explore the environment for potentially better options. One strategy to negotiate this tradeoff is to perform local searches around the food but repeatedly return to feed. We studied this behavior in flies and used genetic tools to uncover the underlying mechanisms. Over time, flies gradually expand their search, shifting from primarily exploiting food sources to exploring the environment, a change that is likely driven by increases in satiety. We found that flies' search patterns preserve these dynamics even as the overall scale of the search is modulated by starvation-induced changes in metabolic state. In contrast, search induced by optogenetic activation of sugar sensing neurons does not show these dynamics. We asked what navigational strategies underlie local search. Using a generative model, we found that a change in locomotor pattern after food consumption could account for repeated returns to the food, but failed to capture relatively direct, long return trajectories. Alternative strategies, such as path integration or sensory taxis could allow flies to return from larger distances. We tested this by individually silencing the fly's head direction system, olfaction and hygrosensation, and found that the only substantial effect was from perturbing hygrosensation, which reduced the number of long exploratory trips. Our study illustrates that local search is composed of multiple behavioral features that evolve over time based on both internal and external factors, providing a path towards uncovering the underlying neural mechanisms.

">Impact of dendritic non-linearities on the computational capabilities of neurons</a></h4>

              
                Multiple neurophysiological experiments have shown that dendritic non-linearities can have a strong influence on synaptic input integration. In this work we model a single neuron as a two-layer computational unit with non-overlapping sign-constrained synaptic weights and a biologically plausible form of dendritic non-linearity, which is analytically tractable using statistical physics methods. Using both analytical and numerical tools, we demonstrate several key computational advantages of non-linear dendritic integration with respect to models with linear synaptic integration. We find that the dendritic non-linearity concurrently enhances the number of possible learned input-output associations and the learning velocity, and we characterize how capacity and learning speed depend on the implemented non-linearity and the levels of dendritic and somatic inhibition. We find that experimentally observed connection probabilities naturally emerge in neurons with sign-constrained synapses as a consequence of non-linear dendritic integration, while in models with linear integration, an additional robustness parameter must be introduced in order to reproduce realistic connection probabilities. Non-linearly induced sparsity comes with a second central advantage for neuronal information processing, i.e. input and synaptic noise robustness. By testing our model on standard real-world benchmark datasets inspired by deep learning practice, we observe empirically that the non-linearity provides an enhancement in generalization performance, showing that it enables to capture more complex input/output relations.

">Binary Brains: How Excitable Dynamics Simplify Neural Connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Fiber networks connecting different brain regions are the structural foundation of brain dynamics and function. Recent studies have provided detailed characterizations of neural connectomes with weighted connections. However, the topological analysis of weighted networks still has conceptual and practical challenges. Consequently, many investigations of neural networks are performed on binarized networks, and the functional impact of unweighted versus weighted networks is unclear. Here we show, for the widespread case of excitable dynamics, that the excitation patterns observed in weighted and unweighted networks are nearly identical, if an appropriate network threshold is selected. We generalize this observation to different excitable models, and formally predict the network threshold from the intrinsic model features. The network-binarizing capacity of excitable dynamics suggests that neural activity patterns may primarily depend on the strongest structural connections. Our findings have practical advantages in terms of the computational cost of representing and analyzing complex networks. There are also fundamental implications for the computational simulation of connectivity-based brain dynamics and the computational function of diverse other systems governed by excitable dynamics such as artificial neural networks.

">Restoring hippocampal glucose metabolism rescues cognition across Alzheimer's disease pathologies</a></h4>

              
                Impaired cerebral glucose metabolism is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and recent proteomic studies highlight a disruption of glial carbohydrate metabolism with disease progression. Here, we report that inhibition of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine (KYN) in the first step of the kynurenine pathway, rescues hippocampal memory function and plasticity in preclinical models of amyloid and tau pathology by restoring astrocytic metabolic support of neurons. Activation of IDO1 in astrocytes by amyloid-beta42 and tau oligomers, two major pathological effectors in AD, increases KYN and suppresses glycolysis in an AhR-dependent manner. Conversely, pharmacological IDO1 inhibition restores glycolysis and lactate production. In amyloid-producing APPSwe-PS1{triangleup}E9 and 5XFAD mice and in tau-producing P301S mice, IDO1 inhibition restores spatial memory and improves hippocampal glucose metabolism by metabolomic and MALDI-MS analyses. IDO1 blockade also rescues hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in a monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-dependent manner, suggesting that IDO1 activity disrupts astrocytic metabolic support of neurons. Indeed, in vitro mass-labeling of human astrocytes demonstrates that IDO1 regulates astrocyte generation of lactate that is then taken up by human neurons. In co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons derived from AD subjects, deficient astrocyte lactate transfer to neurons was corrected by IDO1 inhibition, resulting in improved neuronal glucose metabolism. Thus, IDO1 activity disrupts astrocytic metabolic support of neurons across both amyloid and tau pathologies and in a model of AD iPSC-derived neurons. These findings also suggest that IDO1 inhibitors developed for adjunctive therapy in cancer could be repurposed for treatment of amyloid- and tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.

                Resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) holds promise as a biomarker of chronic pain. However, the impact of centrally acting analgesics like opioids, antiepileptics, and antidepressants on rsEEG remains unclear. This confounds and limits the interpretability of previous studies and questions the validity of rsEEG biomarker candidates of chronic pain. We, therefore, aimed to elucidate the effects of opioids, antiepileptics, and antidepressants on common rsEEG biomarker candidates of chronic pain. To this end, we analyzed two large, independent rsEEG datasets, including 220 people with chronic pain. We performed preregistered multivariate Bayesian analyses and controlled for the potential confounds of age, pain intensity, and depression. The results predominantly provided evidence against effects of centrally acting analgesics on peak alpha frequency, oscillatory power in different frequency bands, and connectivity-based network measures. Although these findings do not rule out any effects of analgesics on rsEEG, they argue against medium to large effects of centrally acting analgesics on rsEEG. Thus, the findings strengthen the validity of rsEEG biomarker candidates of chronic pain and might thereby help to develop clinically valuable biomarkers of chronic pain.

	<p>Respiratory dysfunction is an important hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Elevation of creatine kinase (CK) has been reported in 23&amp;amp;ndash;75% of ALS patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This work aims to enlighten the role of CK as a prognostic factor of respiratory dysfunction in ALS. A retrospective analysis of demographic and clinical variables, CK, functional decline per month (&amp;amp;Delta;FS), forced vital capacity (%FVC), and mean amplitude of the phrenic nerve compound motor action potential (pCMAP) in 319 ALS patients was conducted. These measurements were evaluated at study entry, and patients were followed from the moment of first observation until death or last follow-up visit. High CK values were defined as above the 90th percentile (CK &amp;amp;ge; P90) adjusted to sex. We analyzed survival and time to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as proxies for respiratory impairment. Linear regression analysis revealed that high CK was associated with male sex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), spinal onset (p = 0.018), and FVC &amp;amp;ge; 80% (p = 0.038). CK was 23.4% higher in spinal-onset ALS patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). High CK levels were not linked with an increased risk of death (p = 0.334) in Cox multivariate regression analysis. CK &amp;amp;ge; P90 (HR = 1.001, p = 0.038), shorter disease duration (HR = 0.937, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), lower pCMAP (HR = 0.082, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and higher &amp;amp;Delta;FS (HR = 1.968, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were risk factors for respiratory failure. The association between high CK levels and poorer respiratory outcomes could derive from cellular metabolic stress or a specific phenotype associated with faster respiratory decline. Our study suggests that CK measurement at diagnosis should be more extensively investigated as a possible marker of poor respiratory outcome in future studies, including a larger population of patients.</p>

	<p>Depression is clinically diagnosed when a defined constellation of symptoms manifests over a specific duration with notable severity. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by the presence of five or more symptoms persisting for at least two weeks. As a profound mental health condition affecting millions globally, depression presents a considerable challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. In pediatric and adolescent populations, depression can precipitate adverse outcomes, including substance abuse, academic difficulties, risky sexual behaviors, physical health problems, impaired social relationships, and a markedly elevated risk of suicide&amp;amp;mdash;up to thirty times higher than the general population. This paper details a study that evaluated the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) alone vs. CBT combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in a treatment program. The study cohort comprised sixteen (16) children and adolescents diagnosed with depression (eight males and eight females) and sixteen (16) typically developing peers (eight males and eight females) aged from 9 to 15 years (Mean age = 11.94, standard deviation = 2.02). Initial assessments employed Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), the Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Depression Inventory (CDI), and reaction time measurements. The results reveal that participants with depression exhibit cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as evidenced by prolonged P300 latencies. Following intervention with either CBT alone or CBT combined with medication, the depressed participants demonstrated significant improvements, evidenced by lower CDI scores, reduced P300 latencies, and faster reaction times, both compared to their pre-treatment status and relative to the control group.</p>

	<p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a side effect of cancer treatment, often linked with pain complaints. Patients report mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity that may emerge during chemotherapy treatment and may persist after cancer remission. Whereas the latter situation disturbs the quality of life, life itself may be endangered by the appearance of CIPN during cancer treatment. The causes of CIPN have almost entirely been ascribed to the neurotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs in the peripheral nervous system. However, the central consequences of peripheral neuropathy are starting to be unraveled, namely in the supraspinal pain modulatory system. Based on our interests and experience in the field, we undertook a review of the brain-centered alterations that may underpin pain in CIPN. The changes in the descending pain modulation in CIPN models along with the functional and connectivity abnormalities in the brain of CIPN patients are analyzed. A translational analysis of preclinical findings about descending pain regulation during CIPN is reviewed considering the main neurochemical systems (serotoninergic and noradrenergic) targeted in CIPN management in patients, namely by antidepressants. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of studying supraspinal areas involved in descending pain modulation to understand the pathophysiology of CIPN, which will probably allow a more personalized and effective CIPN treatment in the future.</p>

	<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), major depressive disorder (MDD) is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide and the second most common disease after cardiovascular events. Approximately 280 million people live with MDD, with incidence varying by age and gender (female to male ratio of approximately 2:1). Although a variety of antidepressants are available for the different forms of MDD, there is still a high degree of individual variability in response and tolerability. Given the complexity and clinical heterogeneity of these disorders, a shift from &amp;amp;ldquo;canonical treatment&amp;amp;rdquo; to personalized medicine with improved patient stratification is needed. OPADE is a non-profit study that researches biomarkers in MDD to tailor personalized drug treatments, integrating genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, immune response, and clinical data for analysis. A total of 350 patients between 14 and 50 years will be recruited in 6 Countries (Italy, Colombia, Spain, The Netherlands, Turkey) for 24 months. Real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) and patient cognitive assessment will be correlated with biological sample analysis. A patient empowerment tool will be deployed to ensure patient commitment and to translate patient stories into data. The resulting data will be used to train the artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) predictive tool.</p>

	<p>Menopause may increase the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) dementia. This study aimed to use young plasma therapy (YPT) to improve dementia caused by AD in aged ovariectomized rats. Female Wistar rats were used in the following groups: (a) young (CY) (180&amp;amp;ndash;200 g, 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 months, n = 10) and (b) old groups (250&amp;amp;ndash;350 g, 22&amp;amp;ndash;24 months, n = 60). The old rats were randomly assigned to six sub-groups: (1) control, (2) sham, (3) ovariectomized group (OVX), (4) OVX + Alzheimer disease (OVX + AD), (5) OVX + AD+ 17&amp;amp;beta;-Estradiol (OVX + AD + E), and (6) OVX + AD + young plasma (OVX + AD + YP). Cognitive behaviors were evaluated using NOR, MWM, and PAL tests. MiR-134a, SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF expressions were measured using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Oxidative stress in hippocampal tissue was assayed using ELISA kits. OVX and AD caused significant cognitive impairment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), up-regulated miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), down-regulated SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF protein expression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and decreased antioxidant marker levels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to the sham group. YPT significantly restored miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), SIRT-1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CREB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and BDNF (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) protein expression in OVX + AD rats. YPT, as much as or more than estrogen therapy (ERT), significantly improved oxidative stress and down-regulated miR-134a expression and the up-regulation of SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins in OVX + AD rats (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). YPT significantly improved histological alteration compared to the OVX + AD group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). As a non-pharmacological treatment, YPT can improve the expression of miR-134a and SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins as much as or more than estrogen therapy, ameliorating AD-induced dementia in aged OVX rats.</p>

	<p>This study examined the impact of personalizing muscle vibration parameters on trunk control. We assessed how altered trunk extensor muscle (TEM) proprioception affects seated trunk control in healthy controls (HCs). To explore the link between altered TEM proprioception and impaired trunk control in chronic low back pain (cLBP), we performed equivalence testing between HCs undergoing TEM vibration and cLBP without vibration. Twenty HCs performed active joint reposition error (AJRE) testing to determine personalized vibration parameters. Each participant maintained balance on an unstable chair with eyes open and closed, with and without TEM vibration. We compared trunk control between HCs and twenty age- and sex-matched cLBP participants, using mean velocity and 95% confidence ellipse area of center-of-pressure changes to quantify trunk postural control. Equivalence was examined by comparing mean difference scores to minimal detectable change values and calculating between-group effect sizes. Personalized vibration parameters led to larger lumbopelvic repositioning errors (d = 0.89) than any single vibration frequency (d = 0.31&amp;amp;ndash;0.36). In healthy adults with no back pain, vision had large effects on postural control (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.604&amp;amp;ndash;0.842), but TEM vibration had no significant effects (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.105) or interactions with vision (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.423). Between-group effect sizes (d = 0.32&amp;amp;ndash;0.51) exceeded our threshold for performance equivalence (d &amp;amp;lt; 0.2). Muscle vibration altered position sense during AJRE testing, and personalizing parameters amplified this effect. However, TEM vibration had minimal impact on seated trunk postural control in adults with no back pain and did not lead to performance degradation comparable to that in cLBP.</p>

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.'s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates impacting periodontal disease were considered, and demographic and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health's impact on periodontal disease. Results Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried subjects affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between subjects with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Within study limitations, it is concluded that no significant difference exists in periodontal status between individuals with compromised mental health and those without. The findings underscore potential associations between mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance with periodontal disease.

                <p>Linked rhythmic behaviors, such as respiration/locomotion or swallowing/chewing, often require coordination for proper function. Despite its prevalence, the cellular mechanisms controlling coordination of the underlying neural networks remain undetermined in most systems. We use the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab <I>Cancer borealis</I> to investigate mechanisms of internetwork coordination, due to its small, well-characterized feeding-related networks (gastric mill [chewing, ~0.1&nbsp;Hz]; pyloric [filtering food, ~1&nbsp;Hz]). Here, we investigate coordination between these networks during the Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide neuropeptide modulatory state. Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide activates a unique triphasic gastric mill rhythm in which the typically pyloric-only LPG neuron generates dual pyloric-plus gastric mill-timed oscillations. Additionally, the pyloric rhythm exhibits shorter cycles during gastric mill rhythm-timed LPG bursts, and longer cycles during IC, or IC plus LG gastric mill neuron bursts. Photoinactivation revealed that LPG is necessary to shorten pyloric cycle period, likely through its rectified electrical coupling to pyloric pacemaker neurons. Hyperpolarizing current injections demonstrated that although LG bursting enables IC bursts, only gastric mill rhythm bursts in IC are necessary to prolong the pyloric cycle period. Surprisingly, LPG photoinactivation also eliminated prolonged pyloric cycles, without changing IC firing frequency or gastric mill burst duration, suggesting that pyloric cycles are prolonged via IC synaptic inhibition of LPG, which indirectly slows the pyloric pacemakers via electrical coupling. Thus, the same dual-network neuron directly conveys excitation from its endogenous bursting and indirectly funnels synaptic inhibition to enable one network to alternately decrease and increase the cycle period of a related network.</p>

                Background The goal of the Fifth Annual Baylor College of Medicine & DNAnexus Structural Variation Hackathon was to push forward the research on structural variants (SVs) by rapidly developing and deploying open-source software. The event took place in-person and virtually in August 2023, when 49 scientists from 14 countries and 8 U.S. states collaboratively worked on projects to address critical gaps in the field of genomics. The hackathon projects concentrated on developing bioinformatic workflows for the following challenges: RNA transcriptome comparison, simulation of mosaic variations, metagenomics, Mendelian variation, SVs in plant genomics, and assembly vs. mapping SV calling comparisons. Methods As a starting point we used publicly available data from state-of-the-art long- and short-read sequencing technologies. The workflows developed during the hackathon incorporated open-source software, as well as scripts written using Bash and Python. Moreover, we leveraged the advantages of Docker and Snakemake for workflow automation. Results The results of the hackathon consists of six prototype bioinformatic workflows that use open-source software for SV research. We made the workflows scalable and modular for usability and reproducibility. Furthermore, we tested the workflows on example public data to show that the workflows can work. The code and the data produced during the event have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics) to reproduce and built upon in the future. Conclusions The following sections describe the motivation, lessons learned, and software produced by teams during the hackathon. Here, we describe in detail the objectives, value propositions, implementation, and use cases for our workflows. In summary, the article reports the advancements in the development of software for SV detection made during the hackathon.

                Background Increasing the participation of peer educators (PEs) to deliver HIV/AIDS services in a limited income context remains challenging, despite their profound effectiveness, and this has become more evident since the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examines the roles of PEs and the current challenges in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam. Methods A mixed-method approach was employed. The study was conducted in seven large provinces in Vietnam from December 2021 to March 2022. An online cross-sectional survey was administered to 63 health staff and 147 PEs to collect quantitative data on PEs’ roles. Qualitative interviews included seven focus-group discussions with 39 PEs and in-depth interviews with 25 key informants, including seven leaders and 14 health staff from district health centers and provincial centers for disease control (CDCs), one national-level HIV/AIDS program manager, one non-government organization representative, and two senior experts. Results Results show the diversified roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS activities in Vietnam. The roles could be categorized into two main groups, including community-based activities and facilities-based activities. Prominent roles are identifying and referring customers to HIV testing services, conducting communication and education activities, and referring patients to treatment services. The study shows a decrease in the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam despite the high demand for their participation from healthcare providers. Critical challenges in employing PEs in HIV/AIDS services are related to lack of funding, inadequate training, lack of recognition, and stigma. Conclusion To keep the right path to the goal of ending the HIV pandemic by 2030, it is important to maintain and increase the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services. Raising better acknowledgment from stakeholders of PEs’ roles could help overcome the remaining challenges and expand their participation toward this goal.

                <p>by Youcheng Li, Leann Lac, Qian Liu, Pingzhao Hu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics has gained popularity over the past decade due to its ability to evaluate transcriptome data while preserving spatial information. Cell segmentation is a crucial step in spatial transcriptomic analysis, as it enables the avoidance of unpredictable tissue disentanglement steps. Although high-quality cell segmentation algorithms can aid in the extraction of valuable data, traditional methods are frequently non-spatial, do not account for spatial information efficiently, and perform poorly when confronted with the problem of spatial transcriptome cell segmentation with varying shapes. In this study, we propose ST-CellSeg, an image-based machine learning method for spatial transcriptomics that uses manifold for cell segmentation and is novel in its consideration of multi-scale information. We first construct a fully connected graph which acts as a spatial transcriptomic manifold. Using multi-scale data, we then determine the low-dimensional spatial probability distribution representation for cell segmentation. Using the adjusted Rand index (ARI), normalized mutual information (NMI), and Silhouette coefficient (SC) as model performance measures, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline models in selected datasets and is efficient in computational complexity.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012195">Prioritizing drug targets by perturbing biological network response functions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew C. Perrone, Michael G. Lerner, Matthew Dunworth, Andrew J. Ewald, Joel S. Bader</p>

Therapeutic interventions are designed to perturb the function of a biological system. However, there are many types of proteins that cannot be targeted with conventional small molecule drugs. Accordingly, many identified gene-regulatory drivers and downstream effectors are currently undruggable. Drivers and effectors are often connected by druggable signaling and regulatory intermediates. Methods to identify druggable intermediates therefore have general value in expanding the set of targets available for hypothesis-driven validation. Here we identify and prioritize potential druggable intermediates by developing a network perturbation theory, termed NetPert, for response functions of biological networks. Dynamics are defined by a network structure in which vertices represent genes and proteins, and edges represent gene-regulatory interactions and protein-protein interactions. Perturbation theory for network dynamics prioritizes targets that interfere with signaling from driver to response genes. Applications to organoid models for metastatic breast cancer demonstrate the ability of this mathematical framework to identify and prioritize druggable intermediates. While the short-time limit of the perturbation theory resembles betweenness centrality, NetPert is superior in generating target rankings that correlate with previous wet-lab assays and are more robust to incomplete or noisy network data. NetPert also performs better than a related graph diffusion approach. Wet-lab assays demonstrate that drugs for targets identified by NetPert, including targets that are not themselves differentially expressed, are active in suppressing additional metastatic phenotypes.

                <p>by Apolline Louvet, Clément Mantoux, Nathalie Machon</p>

As the spatial arrangement of trees planted along streets in cities makes their bases potential ecological corridors for the flora, urban tree bases may be a key contributor to the overall connectivity of the urban ecosystem. However, these tree bases are also a highly fragmented environment in which extinctions are frequent. The goal of this study was to assess the plant species’ ability to survive and spread through urban tree bases. To do so, we developed a Bayesian framework to assess the extinction risk of a plant metapopulation using presence/absence data, assuming that the occupancy dynamics was described by a Hidden Markov Model. The novelty of our approach is to take into account the combined effect of low-distance dispersal and the potential presence of a seed bank on the extinction risk. We introduced a metric of the extinction risk and examined its performance over a wide range of metapopulation parameters. We applied our framework to yearly floristic inventories carried out in 1324 tree bases in Paris, France. While local extinction risks were generally high, extinction risks at the street scale varied greatly from one species to another. We identified 10 plant species that could survive and spread through urban tree bases, and three plant traits correlated with the extinction risk at the metapopulation scale: the maximal height, and the beginning and end of the flowering period. Our results suggest that some plant species can use urban tree bases as ecological corridors despite high local extinction risks by forming a seed bank. We also identified other plant traits correlated with the ability to survive in tree bases, related to the action of gardeners. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that our Bayesian estimation framework based on percolation theory has the potential to be extended to more general metapopulations.

                <p>by Caleb J. Holt, Kenneth D. Miller, Yashar Ahmadian</p>

When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column’s receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.

                <p>by Devon J. Boland, Nicola M. Ayres</p>

AlphaFold2 is an Artificial Intelligence-based program developed to predict the 3D structure of proteins given only their amino acid sequence at atomic resolution. Due to the accuracy and efficiency at which AlphaFold2 can generate 3D structure predictions and its widespread adoption into various aspects of biochemical research, the technique of protein structure prediction should be considered for incorporation into the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. A module for introducing AlphaFold2 into a senior-level biochemistry laboratory classroom was developed. The module’s focus was to have students predict the structures of proteins from the MPOX 22 global outbreak virus isolate genome, which had no structures elucidated at that time. The goal of this study was to both determine the impact the module had on students and to develop a framework for introducing AlphaFold2 into the undergraduate curriculum so that instructors for biochemistry courses, regardless of their background in bioinformatics, could adapt the module into their classrooms.

Throughout history, humans have relied on plants as a source of medication, flavoring, and food. Plants synthesize large chemical libraries and release many of these compounds into the rhizosphere and atmosphere where they affect animal and microbe behavior. To survive, nematodes must have evolved the sensory capacity to distinguish plant-made small molecules (SMs) that are harmful and must be avoided from those that are beneficial and should be sought. This ability to classify chemical cues as a function of their value is fundamental to olfaction and represents a capacity shared by many animals, including humans. Here, we present an efficient platform based on multiwell plates, liquid handling instrumentation, inexpensive optical scanners, and bespoke software that can efficiently determine the valence (attraction or repulsion) of single SMs in the model nematode, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Using this integrated hardware-wetware-software platform, we screened 90 plant SMs and identified 37 that attracted or repelled wild-type animals but had no effect on mutants defective in chemosensory transduction. Genetic dissection indicates that for at least 10 of these SMs, response valence emerges from the integration of opposing signals, arguing that olfactory valence is often determined by integrating chemosensory signals over multiple lines of information. This study establishes that <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> is an effective discovery engine for determining chemotaxis valence and for identifying natural products detected by the chemosensory nervous system.

                <p>by Lingchao Ji, Beatriz C. Borges, David T. Martel, Calvin Wu, M. Charles Liberman, Susan E. Shore, Gabriel Corfas</p>

Loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and inner hair cells (IHC synaptopathy) leads to an auditory neuropathy called hidden hearing loss (HHL) characterized by normal auditory thresholds but reduced amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials. It has been proposed that synaptopathy and HHL result in poor performance in challenging hearing tasks despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse counts were increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 knockdown or overexpression reduces or increases, respectively, IHC synapse density and suprathreshold amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials without changing cochlear thresholds. We now show that IHC synapse density does not influence the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex or its prepulse inhibition. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test for auditory temporal processing, is reduced or enhanced according to Ntf3 expression levels. These results indicate that IHC synaptopathy causes temporal processing deficits predicted in HHL. Furthermore, the improvement in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27019?af=R">Metabolic Syndrome and Risk of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Insights from a Large‐Scale Prospective Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although metabolic abnormalities are implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a subject of controversy. We aimed to identify the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study included 395,987 participants from the UK Biobank to investigate the relationship between MetS and ALS. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Stratified analyses were performed based on gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and education level. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore potential mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this study, a total of 539 cases of ALS were recorded after a median follow-up of 13.7 years. Patients with MetS (defined harmonized) had a higher risk of developing ALS after adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19–1.89). Specifically, hypertension and high triglycerides were linked to a higher risk of ALS (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19–1.95; HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.61, respectively). Moreover, the quantity of metabolic abnormalities showed significant results. Stratified analysis revealed that these associations are particularly significant in individuals with a BMI &lt;25. These findings remained stable after sensitivity analysis. Notably, mediation analysis identified potential metabolites and metabolomic mediators, including alkaline phosphatase, cystatin C, γ-glutamyl transferase, saturated fatty acids to total fatty acids percentage, and omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids ratio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MetS exhibits a robust association with an increased susceptibility to ALS, particularly in individuals with a lower BMI. Furthermore, metabolites and metabolomics, as potential mediators, provide invaluable insights into the intricate biological mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether choroid plexus volumes in subacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with neurological symptoms could indicate inflammatory activation or barrier dysfunction and assess their association with clinical data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Choroid plexus volumes were measured in 28 subacute COVID-19 patients via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy patients (n = 25), asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 21). Associations with inflammatory serum markers (peak counts of leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6), an MRI-based marker of barrier dysfunction (CSF volume fraction [V-CSF]), and clinical parameters like olfactory performance and cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>COVID-19 patients showed significantly larger choroid plexus volumes than control groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.172). These volumes correlated significantly with peak leukocyte levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.621) and V-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.009, Spearman's rho = 0.534), but neither with CRP nor interleukin 6. No significant correlations were found with clinical parameters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with subacute COVID-19, choroid plexus volume is a marker of central nervous system inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the presence of neurologic symptoms. The absence of plexus enlargement in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy suggests a specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 effect. This study also documents an increase in choroid plexus volume for the first time as a parainfectious event. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The aim of this paper was to explore how the Fourth Industrial Revolution shapes teaching and learning during COVID-19 in some of the schools located in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, South Africa. This paper employed qualitative interpretative multiple case study design. Purposive sampling was used to sample our participants. Methods We selected four teachers who separately taught at the early childhood development stage, intermediate phase, senior phase, and further education and training phases. Data was collected telephonically through semi-structured interviews with teachers from Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. Data was collected from their experiences of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. Collected data was analysed using a typology approach whereby themes that derived from the literature reviewed and research questions were used. Results We inferred from the results of the paper that teachers had challenges with teaching and availability of learning resources, such as limited access to internet and socio-economic backgrounds, which hindered the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the teaching and learning process. There were also challenges related to teachers’ background on the usage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the lack of school management teams support. The paper revealed that the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in teaching and learning was affected negatively by the existence of the above-mentioned challenges, which needs to be addressed. Conclusions Therefore, we recommended that the government and stakeholders within the education sector provide resources such as smart-boards, computers, and network access in schools lacking such facilities, as well as providing professional development interventions and training teachers to have an in-depth understanding of the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the teaching and learning context.

                Fish species are commonly used as experimental models in the laboratory. DNA is routinely collected from these animals to permit identification of their genotype. The current standard procedure to sample DNA is fin clipping, which involves anaesthetising individuals and removing a portion of the caudal fin. While fin clipping reliably generates good quality DNA samples for downstream applications, there is evidence that it can alter health and welfare, and impact the fish’s behaviour. This in turn can result in greater variation in the data collected. In a recent study we adapted a skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA from small-bodied fish, including sticklebacks and zebrafish, without the use of analgesics, anaesthetics or sharp instruments. A rayon-tipped swab was used to collect mucus from the flank of the fish, which was then used for DNA extraction. We subsequently demonstrated that compared to fin clipping, skin swabbing triggered fewer changes in stress axis activation and behaviour. We also found that gene expression and behaviour data collected from swabbed fish were less variable than similar data collected from fish that had been fin clipped. This potentially allows smaller sample sizes in experimental groups to be used after skin swabbing, thereby reducing animal use. Here we provide a detailed protocol explaining how to collect DNA samples from small laboratory fish using skin swabs.

                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                Background Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and the expression was weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which was an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

                Background In Sierra Leone, the National Emergency Medical Services (NEMS) was designed to facilitate maternal and under-five referrals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health facilities were repurposed and mobility restrictions were introduced, and this might have negatively influenced access to care. Thus, we compared utilization, timeliness and outcomes of referrals between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Methods This was a cohort study using routinely collected data by the NEMS. There were 65 weeks in the pre-COVID-19 period (week one of January 2019 to week three of March 2020) and 91 weeks in the COVID-19 period (week four of March 2020 to week four of December 2021). We compared weekly referrals and the duration from initiating the NEMS for a referral to the patient reaching the receiving facility (prehospital delay) using the Mann–Whitney U test. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the mode of transportation and referral outcomes. Results Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, there was significant decrease during the COVID-19 period in the median number of weekly maternal referrals (277 to 205), under-five referrals (177 to 104) and transfers on NEMS ambulances (348 to 269). The prehospital delays increased during the COVID-19 period for both maternal (72 to 86 minutes) and under-five (75 to 90 minutes) referrals (p<0.001). The percentage of NEMS ambulance transfers for maternal referrals was similar in both periods (90%), but for under-five referrals this decreased between the pre-COVID-19 (72%) and COVID-19 (68%) periods. In both periods, maternal (98%) and under-five (96%) referrals were successfully admitted to the receiving facilities. Conclusions The performance of the NEMS system in terms of referrals reaching the receiving health facilities was maintained during the pandemic. However, there is a need to sustain the current performance of the NEMS system while making more efforts to increase utilization and reduce delays during outbreaks/pandemics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-702/v1?src=rss">Management of Strangulated Richter’s Hernia in a Resource-Limited Setting: Report of Two Cases and Literature Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Richter’s hernia is a rare type of abdominal wall hernia characterized by high morbidity and mortality. It occurs when the anti-mesenteric border of the bowel is partially trapped in a tight hernial ring. The femoral ring is the most common site, with the ileum being the most frequently involved intestinal segment. However, the advent of laparoscopic surgery has introduced another potential site for Richter’s hernia formation. In our region, this pathological entity is exceptionally diagnosed due to limited access to abdominal imaging and delayed management. Additionally, the wide variety of clinical manifestations resulting from incomplete intestinal obstruction makes it particularly difficult to diagnose. Consequently, it is usually identified during surgery. We present here the case of two adult patients (a 33-yeairs-old woman and a 59-year-old man), the first with a history of surgical procedures and the second with a spontaneously reducible painless inguinal swelling. They were transferred to the surgical emergency department for an acute abdomen with abdominal distension and cessation of matter and gas. Clinical and paraclinical examinations (including hydroaeric level on abdominal X-ray) indicated mechanical intestinal obstruction. Emergency laparotomy, necessitated by the unavailability of abdominal computed tomography due to financial constraints, confirmed the diagnosis of Richter's hernia, with the first case located in the right inguinal region and the second in the linea alba. Surgical management involved reduction of the hernia contents and suture repair in both cases. Despite requiring bowel resection in the second patient, the postoperative course was straightforward. These two rare cases highlight that emergency exploratory laparotomy is the cornerstone of Richter hernia management in resource-limited conditions.

                Liver transplantation is the ultimate therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease. The clinical management of transplant patients significantly impacts their prognosis, with outcomes influenced by multiple interacting variables. Cardiovascular complications count as a leading cause of both short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients. In this respect, accurate risk assessment and stratification are crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significant potential for early risk prediction, providing comprehensive risk assessments in both diagnosed cohorts and early clinical phase patients. This systematic review examines the state of the art in AI applications for predicting cardiovascular risks in liver transplantation, identifying current issues, challenges, and future research directions. We reviewed articles from digital repositories such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect published between 2000 and 2023, using keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, cardiovascular, and liver transplantation. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of machine learning algorithms used in this domain. Despite the potential, only 12 papers met the criteria for adequate topic coverage, highlighting a scarcity of research at this intersection. Key challenges include integrating diverse datasets, isolating cardiovascular effects amid multifaceted influences, ensuring data quality and quantity, and the issues to extrapolate machine learning models to day-to-day clinical practice. Nevertheless, leveraging AI for risk prediction in liver transplantation could significantly enhance patient management and resource optimization, indicating a shift towards more personalized and effective medical practices.

                Background Statistical process control (SPC) is utiled in manufacturing and service applications. It is used to monitor the behavior of the process, also to discover and solve the issues in internal systems. SPC allows immediate corrective actions to prevent defects and maintain process stability. There are two types of control charts are available in the literature: variable control charts and attribute control charts. Methods The use of attribute control charts for two positively skewed distributions such as power function distribution and weighted power function distribution is discussed in this research paper. We compared the behavior of both types of control charts and presented the results in form of tables. Results We conclude that control charts under a weighted power function distribution perform better than control charts using a power function distribution. Furthermore, these results will help in the early detection of errors that enhance the process reliability of the telecommunications and financing industries.

                Background Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) at home might be an alternative choice to identify optimal treatment pressure for OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment. Data on the association of effective treatment pressure between laboratory polysomnography (in-lab PSG) and home APAP has been limited. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of effective CPAP pressure between in-lab PSG and home APAP. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted. OSA participants aged 18 years or older who required CPAP therapy were included. Patients underwent in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration to identify an effective treatment pressure. Patients also underwent APAP at home for 2 weeks to identify 95 percentile treatment pressure as an effective pressure. Results Fifty OSA patients (82% male) were included. Mean age was 48.9±14.6 years. Body mass index was 28.7±6.1 kg/m2. Polysomnographic data showed the effective treatment pressure of 10.4±2.9 cmH2O and the apnea-hypopnea index was 55.1±29.0 events/hour. Severe OSA was 76%. Home APAP data showed effective treatment pressure of 10.8±1.8 cmH2O. There was positive correlation of effective pressure between home APAP and in-lab PSG (r=0.472, P=0.001). The equation for predicting an in-lab effective pressure was: predicted pressure (cmH2O) = 2 + (home APAP ⁎ 0.78). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of -0.428 cmH2O and 96% within the limit of agreement. Conclusions Home APAP pressure is moderately positively correlated with in-lab PSG effective pressure. The accuracy of home APAP is in agreement with in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration. This APAP might be able to determine an effective therapeutic pressure in the sleep laboratory for OSA treatment.

                Background Sexual violence is prevalent in higher education institutions in Nigeria and stakeholders have encouraged staff and students to blow the whistle whenever they fall victim to or are aware of any sexual violence case. However, there is lack of data about whether the staff and students of these institutions have the intention to blow the whistle internally (within the institution) or not. There is also a lack of data on the existing reporting mechanisms or preferred whistleblowing mechanisms in these institutions. These have hindered the analysis of stakeholders’ opinions on this topic. Methods This data note presents a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data set collected from staff and students of three categories of government owned higher education institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education) in Nigeria. Data collection was between February and December, 2021, during which quantitative data were collected from 21,937 students and 3,108 staff. Qualitatively, 138 students and 111 staff participated in a total of 35 focus group discussion sessions. The study provides unique information on respondents’ attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norm to sexual violence whistleblowing. It also provides information on self-reported sexual violence experiences, whistleblowing intention, reporting systems in higher institutions and the preferred sexual violence whistleblowing mechanisms. Conclusions In this data note, we provide a detailed account of the variables in the dataset and then highlight the potential of this study to contribute to improved sexual violence reporting in higher education institutions, thereby reducing the occurrence of the social menace.

                Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, apathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Method A systematic search was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework with studies published on leisure-based intervention from January 1990 to December 2023. Results The review included 11 articles in the study. In total two studies were pilot interventional study, one randomized controlled study, one case-control, one retrospective study, three were cross sectional, one was cross sectional longitudinal study and two were qualitative in nature. Studies used different types of leisure activities like cooking group, discussions, board games, arts and craft, painting, beading, sewing, clay work, paper craft, etc were used as an intervention. Qualitative studies found that individuals with schizophrenia spent less time in social and leisure activities and more time relaxing and doing nothing. Conclusion The study highlights the need to conduct further research on leisure-based interventions using various study designs like randomized controlled trials and mixed methods to understand its effectiveness among individuals with schizophrenia.

                Background: Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening disease characterized by diffuse bilateral cellulitis with an odontogenic origin. This unique infection is now rare owing to the antibiotic era. Case: This patient presented to the emergency room with trismus, jaw and neck swelling, mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, hyperthermia, and panic. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. As it is a quickly spreading infection, the patient was taken up for immediate surgical decompression leading to pus drainage, removal of the offending tooth, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and administration of empirical antibiotics. As we had operated promptly, there was no need for emergency airway intervention, and the patient had immediate relief from airway distress. Conclusions: Early accurate diagnosis with conservative surgical decompression, thereby negating the need for airway intervention, was vital to avoiding mortality which is always possible in such an expeditious infection.

                Background For more than 150 years, dental amalgam (DA) has been popular as a dental restorative material. Many organizations oppose its use due to perceived toxicity and environmental concerns. Hence, this study aimed to explore the continued use of DA from a South Indian dental practitioners’ perspective. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among fifty-two private and public dental practitioners of Udupi district in Southern India. A self‑administered questionnaire was distributed, that involved assessment of their preferences, continuation of use and concerns of using DA as a restorative material. The percentage contribution of each variable was calculated. Preferences for continuation of use of silver amalgam based upon the age, experience and mercury toxicity as a risk factor were analyzed using Students-t test and Fisher’s Exact Test test. Results Most dentists were satisfied (87%) with the results of the DA, found minimal failures (96%) and found DA more economical (89%). More than half (54%) of the participants reported that they would not continue the use of DA owing to mercury toxicity and environmental concerns. Dentists with higher age and longer clinical experience preferred continuation of DA. Conclusions Despite satisfaction with DA for its minimal failure, longevity and affordability, the authors found that most practitioners did not prefer its continued usage. This highlights their concerns over mercury toxicity and soft tissue lesions and accentuates their community social responsibility. There is also an urgent need to educate dentists on mercury hygiene, mercury waste management and disposal.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 56.6% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 18.1% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.

                Changes in pupil size offer a rich, continuous, and integrated neurophysiological readout of attention and cognition. I here briefly reintroduce examples of a vast, forgotten literature, full of inspiring ideas, which described attentional modulations of pupil size decades earlier than often assumed. I outline parallels between these early studies and recent developments in pupillometry.

                Cellular stress may contribute to neurodegeneration. Huang et al. demonstrate that stress-induced nuclear condensation of the neurodegeneration-linked TDP-43 protein causes its transient inactivation and loss of function in splicing. Although these changes are reversible, some TDP-43 splicing targets, e.g., STMN2, recover slowly, rendering them prone to misregulation under chronic stress.

	<p>Dyslexia is a common learning disorder that hinders reading fluency and comprehension. Traditional treatments can be tedious for children, limiting their effectiveness. This study investigated the one-year effects of rehabilitation treatment with a virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) on children with dyslexia. Twenty-four children were divided into control (CG) and experimental (EG) groups. The CG underwent conventional neuropsychological treatment (CNT), while the EG underwent VR neurorehabilitation training (VRNT) using the VRRS. Neuropsychological evaluation was conducted before treatment, after six months, and again after one year for both groups. Compared to the control group, children who received VR training showed significant improvement in reading skills, especially in non-word reading and reading speed, even after one year without further VR intervention. VRRS can improve treatment adherence and minimize symptoms by offering engaging activities for children. These findings suggest VRRS may be a valuable tool for dyslexia rehabilitation with long-lasting effects.</p>

	<p>Sleep and brain/cognitive/neural reserve significantly impact well-being and cognition throughout life. This review aims to explore the intricate relationship between such factors, with reference to their effects on human cognitive functions. The specific goal is to understand the bidirectional influence that sleep and reserve exert on each other. Up to 6 February 2024, a methodical search of the literature was conducted using the PubMed database with terms related to brain, cognitive or neural reserve, and healthy or disturbed sleep. Based on the inclusion criteria, 11 articles were selected and analyzed for this review. The articles focus almost exclusively on cognitive reserve, with no explicit connection between sleep and brain or neural reserve. The results evidence sleep&amp;amp;rsquo;s role as a builder of cognitive reserve and cognitive reserve&amp;amp;rsquo;s role as a moderator in the effects of physiological and pathological sleep on cognitive functions. In conclusion, the findings of the present review support the notion that both sleep and cognitive reserve are critical factors in cognitive functioning. Deepening comprehension of the interactions between them is essential for devising strategies to enhance brain health and resilience against age- and pathology-related conditions.</p>

	<p>Somatosensory tactile experience is a key aspect of our interaction with the environment. It is involved in object manipulation, in the planning and control of actions and, in its affective components, in the relationships with other individuals. It is also a foundational component of body awareness. An intriguing aspect of sensory perception in general and tactile perception in particular is the way in which stimulation comes to consciousness. Indeed, although being aware of something seems a rather self-evident and monolithic aspect of our mental states, sensory awareness may be in fact modulated by many different processes that impact on the mere stimulation of the skin, including the way in which we perceive our bodies as belonging to us. In this review, we first took into consideration the pathological conditions of absence of phenomenal experience of touch, in the presence of implicit processing, as initial models for understanding the neural bases of conscious tactile experience. Subsequently, we discussed cases of tactile illusions both in normal subjects and in brain-damaged patients which help to understand which high-order processes impact tactile awareness. Finally, we discussed the observations reported in the review in light of some influential models of touch and body representation.</p>

	<p>Background: Specific phobias impact over 400 million people worldwide. Digitalizing mental health could alleviate the burden. Still, although the corporate-driven Metaverse is expanding rapidly, there needs to be more momentum in harnessing virtual reality exposure therapy uptake. Objective: This study aims to conceptualize, develop, and deploy a free Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) application specifically designed for treating acrophobia and claustrophobia. This pilot study, which holds the promise of a future where mental health is more accessible and effective, explores the feasibility of leveraging transdisciplinary collaboration among specialists to create a safe, accessible, and effective VRET solution. Methods: We conducted a Delphi heuristic approach involving bioethicists, neuroscientists, and tech developers. Second, we reviewed the existing psychological theories and therapeutic strategies for addressing phobias in VR. Third, we conceptualized a thematic analysis-derived framework for a safe, adaptive-gamified free exposure to virtual reality acrophobia and claustrophobia (SAFEvR ACT). Finally, we provide an overview of the iterative improvements made during 12 workshops and 76 weekly briefings on developmental implementations. Results: We developed the SAFEvR ACT into a proof-of-concept application freely deployed on the MentalVerse app platform. Our safety-focused approach can benefit from prevalidation perspectives within future randomized control trials. Conclusions: The resulting application derived from the SAFEvR ACT framework represents a blueprint to counter the current lack of iVR mental health uptake by offering a free VRET alternative. Future research should aim towards developing similar free platforms to lessen mental health burdens and gather quantitative data. We conclude with a call to action to researchers to fine-tune our current approach and take a stand for free digital mental health within MentalVeRse.app.</p>

	<p>Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively healthy aging and dementia, are characterized by subtle neurocognitive changes. Clinically, they can be grouped into two main variants, namely patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). The distinction of the two variants is known to be clinically significant as they exhibit different progression rates to dementia. However, it has been particularly challenging to classify the two variants robustly. Recent research indicates that linguistic changes may manifest as one of the early indicators of pathology. Therefore, we focused on MCI&amp;amp;rsquo;s discourse-level writing samples in this study. We hypothesized that a written picture description task can provide information that can be used as an ecological, cost-effective classification system between the two variants. We included one hundred sixty-nine individuals diagnosed with either aMCI or naMCI who received neurophysiological evaluations in addition to a short, written picture description task. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a BERT pre-trained language model were utilized to analyze the writing samples. We showed that the written picture description task provided 90% overall classification accuracy for the best classification models, which performed better than cognitive measures. Written discourses analyzed by AI models can automatically assess individuals with aMCI and naMCI and facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, therapy planning, and evaluation.</p>

	<p>Spinal cord epidural electrical stimulation (EES) has been successfully employed to treat chronic pain and to restore lost functions after spinal cord injury. Yet, the efficacy of this approach is largely challenged by the suboptimal spatial distribution of the electrode contacts across anatomical targets, limiting the spatial selectivity of stimulation. In this study, we exploited different ESS paradigms, designed as either Spatial-Selective Stimulation (SSES) or Orientation-Selective Epidural Stimulation (OSES), and compared them to Conventional Monopolar Epidural Stimulation (CMES). SSES, OSES, and CMES were delivered with a 3- or 4-contact electrode array. Amplitudes and latencies of the Spinally Evoked Motor Potentials (SEMPs) were evaluated with different EES modalities. The results demonstrate that the amplitudes of SEMPs in hindlimb muscles depend on the orientation of the electrical field and vary between stimulation modalities. These findings show that the electric field applied with SSES or OSES provides more selective control of amplitudes of the SEMPs as compared to CMES. We demonstrate that spinal cord epidural stimulation applied with SSES or OSES paradigms in the rodent model could be tailored to the functional spinal cord neuroanatomy and can be tuned to specific target fibers and their orientation, optimizing the effect of neuromodulation.</p>

	<p>Gene expression alterations in postmortem schizophrenia tissue are well-documented and are influenced by genetic, medication, and epigenetic factors. The Wingless/Integrated (WNT) signaling pathway, critical for cell growth and development, is involved in various cellular processes including neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. Despite its importance, WNT signaling remains understudied in schizophrenia, a disorder characterized by metabolic and bioenergetic defects in cortical regions. In this study, we examined the gene expression of 10 key WNT signaling pathway transcripts: IQGAP1, CTNN&amp;amp;beta;1, GSK3&amp;amp;beta;, FOXO1, LRP6, MGEA5, TCF4, &amp;amp;beta;TRC, PPP1C&amp;amp;beta;, and DVL2 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using postmortem tissue from schizophrenia subjects (n = 20, 10 males, 10 females) compared to age, pH, and postmortem interval (PMI)-matched controls (n = 20, 10 males, 10 females). Employing the R-shiny application Kaleidoscope, we conducted in silico &amp;amp;ldquo;lookup&amp;amp;rdquo; studies from published transcriptomic datasets to examine cell- and region-level expression of these WNT genes. In addition, we investigated the impact of antipsychotics on the mRNA expression of the WNT genes of interest in rodent brain transcriptomic datasets. Our findings revealed no significant changes in region-level WNT transcript expression; however, analyses of previously published cell-level datasets indicated alterations in WNT transcript expression and antipsychotic-specific modulation of certain genes. These results suggest that WNT signaling transcripts may be variably expressed at the cellular level and influenced by antipsychotic treatment, providing novel insights into the role of WNT signaling in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The central nervous system (CNS) exhibits remarkable adaptability throughout life, enabled by intricate interactions between neurons and glial cells, in particular, oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). This adaptability is pivotal for learning and memory, with OLs and OPCs playing a crucial role in neural circuit development, synaptic modulation, and myelination dynamics. Myelination by OLs not only supports axonal conduction but also undergoes adaptive modifications in response to neuronal activity, which is vital for cognitive processing and memory functions. This review discusses how these cellular interactions and myelin dynamics are implicated in various neurocircuit diseases and disorders such as epilepsy, gliomas, and psychiatric conditions, focusing on how maladaptive changes contribute to disease pathology and influence clinical outcomes. It also covers the potential for new diagnostics and therapeutic approaches, including pharmacological strategies and emerging biomarkers in oligodendrocyte functions and myelination processes. The evidence supports a fundamental role for myelin plasticity and oligodendrocyte functionality in synchronizing neural activity and high-level cognitive functions, offering promising avenues for targeted interventions in CNS disorders.</p>

	<p>In this study, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying action anticipation in volleyball players, especially concerned with the differences between experts and amateurs. Participants included both expert (male, N = 26) and amateur (male, N = 23) volleyball players, who were asked to predict spiking movements containing high, medium, and low levels of kinematic information while their electrophysiological activities were recorded. The high-information stimuli included the whole spiking action, the medium-information stimuli ended at 120 ms, and the low-information stimuli ended at 160 ms before hand&amp;amp;ndash;ball contact. The results showed that experts significantly outperformed amateurs in both prediction accuracy (68% in experts vs. 55% in amateurs) and reaction time (475.09 ms in experts vs. 725.81 ms in amateurs) under the medium-information condition. Analysis of alpha rhythm activity revealed that experts exhibited the strongest desynchronization under the low-information condition, suggesting increased attentional engagement. In contrast, amateurs showed the weakest desynchronization under the medium-information condition. Furthermore, mu rhythm activity analysis showed greater desynchronization in the duration of 100&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms before hand&amp;amp;ndash;ball contact for experts, correlating with their higher anticipation accuracy. These findings highlight the significant kinematic information-processing abilities of volleyball experts and elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying efficient attentional engagement and mirroring. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights for the development of targeted training programs through which to enhance athletic performance.</p>

	<p>The insular cortex, a critical hub in the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensory, cognitive, and emotional networks, remains an intriguing subject of study. In this article, we discuss its intricate functional neuroanatomy, emphasizing its pivotal role in processing olfactory information. Through concise exploration, we delve into the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s diverse connectivity and its involvement in sensory integration, particularly in olfaction. Stimulation studies in humans reveal compelling insights into the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s contribution to the perception of smell, hinting at its broader implications for cognitive processing. Additionally, we explore an avenue of research in which studying olfactory processing via insular stimulation could unravel higher-level cognitive processes. This innovative approach could help give a fresh perspective on the interplay between sensory and cognitive domains, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognition and emotion. In conclusion, future research efforts should emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced imaging and surgical techniques to explore the intricate functions of the human insula. Moreover, awake craniotomies could offer a unique opportunity for real-time observation, shedding light on its neural circuitry and contributions to higher-order brain functions. Furthermore, olfaction&amp;amp;rsquo;s direct cortical projection enables precise exploration of insular function, promising insights into cognitive and emotional processes. This multifaceted approach will deepen our understanding of the insular cortex and its significance in human cognition and emotion.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The integration of augmented reality (AR) in spine surgery marks a significant advancement, enhancing surgical precision and patient outcomes. AR provides immersive, three-dimensional visualizations of anatomical structures, facilitating meticulous planning and execution of spine surgeries. This technology not only improves spatial understanding and real-time navigation during procedures but also aims to reduce surgical invasiveness and operative times. Despite its potential, challenges such as model accuracy, user interface design, and the learning curve for new technology must be addressed. AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s application extends beyond the operating room, offering valuable tools for medical education and improving patient communication and satisfaction. Material and methods: A literature review was conducted by searching PubMed and Scopus databases using keywords related to augmented reality in spine surgery, covering publications from January 2020 to January 2024. Results: In total, 319 articles were identified through the initial search of the databases. After screening titles and abstracts, 11 articles in total were included in the qualitative synthesis. Conclusion: Augmented reality (AR) is becoming a transformative force in spine surgery, enhancing precision, education, and outcomes despite hurdles like technical limitations and integration challenges. AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s immersive visualizations and educational innovations, coupled with its potential synergy with AI and machine learning, indicate a bright future for surgical care. Despite the existing obstacles, AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on improving surgical accuracy and safety marks a significant leap forward in patient treatment and care.</p>

                <p>Sleep disruption and impaired synaptic processes are common features in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylated Tau is known to accumulate at neuronal synapses in AD, contributing to synapse dysfunction. However, it remains unclear how sleep disruption and synapse pathology interact to contribute to cognitive decline. Here, we examined sex-specific onset and consequences of sleep loss in AD/tauopathy model PS19 mice. Using a piezoelectric home-cage monitoring system, we showed PS19 mice exhibited early-onset and progressive hyperarousal, a selective dark-phase sleep disruption, apparent at 3 months in females and 6 months in males. Using the Morris water maze test, we report that chronic sleep disruption (CSD) accelerated the onset of decline of hippocampal spatial memory in PS19 males only. Hyperarousal occurs well in advance of robust forebrain synaptic Tau burden that becomes apparent at 6&ndash;9 months. To determine whether a causal link exists between sleep disruption and synaptic Tau hyperphosphorylation, we examined the correlation between sleep behavior and synaptic Tau, or exposed mice to acute or chronic sleep disruption at 6 months. While we confirm that sleep disruption is a driver of Tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons of the locus ceruleus, we were unable to show any causal link between sleep loss and Tau burden in forebrain synapses. Despite the finding that hyperarousal appears earlier in females, female cognition was resilient to the effects of sleep disruption. We conclude sleep disruption interacts with the synaptic Tau burden to accelerate the onset of cognitive decline with greater vulnerability in males.</p>

                <p><scp>l</scp>-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating motor side effect arising from chronic dopamine (DA) replacement therapy with <scp>l</scp>-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. LID is associated with supersensitivity of striatal dopaminergic signaling and fluctuations in synaptic DA following each <scp>l</scp>-DOPA dose, shrinking the therapeutic window. The heterogeneous composition of the striatum, including subpopulations of medium spiny output neurons (MSNs), interneurons, and supporting cells, complicates the identification of cell(s) underlying LID. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to establish a comprehensive striatal transcriptional profile during LID development. Male hemiparkinsonian mice were treated with vehicle or <scp>l</scp>-DOPA for 1, 5, or 10&nbsp;d, and striatal nuclei were processed for snRNA-seq. Analyses indicated a limited population of DA D1 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) formed three subclusters in response to <scp>l</scp>-DOPA treatment and expressed cellular markers of activation. These activated D1-MSNs display similar transcriptional changes previously associated with LID; however, their prevalence and transcriptional behavior were differentially influenced by <scp>l</scp>-DOPA experience. Differentially expressed genes indicated acute upregulation of plasticity-related transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, while repeated <scp>l</scp>-DOPA-induced synaptic remodeling, learning and memory, and transforming growth factor-&beta; (TGF-&beta;) signaling genes. Notably, repeated <scp>l</scp>-DOPA sensitized <I>Inhba</I>, an activin subunit of the TGF-&beta; superfamily, in activated D1-MSNs, and its pharmacological inhibition impaired LID development, suggesting that activin signaling may play an essential role in LID. These data suggest distinct subsets of D1-MSNs become differentially <scp>l</scp>-DOPA-responsive due to aberrant induction of molecular mechanisms necessary for neuronal entrainment, similar to processes underlying hippocampal learning and memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e0240242024?rss=1">Striatal Dopamine Contributions to Skilled Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coordinated multijoint limb and digit movements&mdash;"manual dexterity"&mdash;underlie both specialized skills (e.g., playing the piano) and more mundane tasks (e.g., tying shoelaces). Impairments in dexterous skill cause significant disability, as occurs with motor cortical injury, Parkinson's disease, and a range of other pathologies. Clinical observations, as well as basic investigations, suggest that corticostriatal circuits play a critical role in learning and performing dexterous skills. Furthermore, dopaminergic signaling in these regions is implicated in synaptic plasticity and motor learning. Nonetheless, the role of striatal dopamine signaling in skilled motor learning remains poorly understood. Here, we use fiber photometry paired with a genetically encoded dopamine sensor to investigate striatal dopamine release in both male and female mice as they learn and perform a skilled reaching task. Dopamine rapidly increases during a skilled reach and peaks near pellet consumption. In the dorsolateral striatum, dopamine dynamics are faster than in the dorsomedial and ventral striatum. Across training, as reaching performance improves, dopamine signaling shifts from pellet consumption to cues that predict pellet availability, particularly in medial and ventral areas of the striatum. Furthermore, performance prediction errors are present across the striatum, with reduced dopamine release after an unsuccessful reach. These findings show that dopamine dynamics during skilled motor behaviors change with learning and are differentially regulated across striatal subregions.</p>

                <p>The striatum plays a central role in directing many complex behaviors ranging from motor control to action choice and reward learning. In our study, we used 55 male CFW mice with rapid decay linkage disequilibrium to systematically mine the striatum-related behavioral functional genes by analyzing their striatal transcriptomes and 79 measured behavioral phenotypic data. By constructing a gene coexpression network, we clustered the genes into 13 modules, with most of them being positively correlated with motor traits. Based on functional annotations as well as Fisher's exact and hypergeometric distribution tests, brown and magenta modules were identified as core modules. They were significantly enriched for striatal-related functional genes. Subsequent Mendelian randomization analysis verified the causal relationship between the core modules and dyskinesia. Through the intramodular gene connectivity analysis, <I>Adcy5</I> and <I>Kcnma1</I> were identified as brown and magenta module hub genes, respectively. Knock outs of both <I>Adcy5</I> and <I>Kcnma1</I> lead to motor dysfunction in mice, and <I>KCNMA1</I> acts as a risk gene for schizophrenia and smoking addiction in humans. We also evaluated the cellular composition of each module and identified oligodendrocytes in the striatum to have a positive role in motor regulation.</p>

                <p>Myelinated axons conduct action potentials, or spikes, in a saltatory manner. Inward current caused by a spike occurring at one node of Ranvier spreads axially to the next node, which regenerates the spike when depolarized enough for voltage-gated sodium channels to activate, and so on. The rate at which this process progresses dictates the velocity at which the spike is conducted and depends on several factors including axial resistivity and axon diameter that directly affect axial current. Here we show through computational simulations in modified double-cable axon models that conduction velocity also depends on extracellular factors whose effects can be explained by their indirect influence on axial current. Specifically, we show that a conventional double-cable model, with its outside layer connected to ground, transmits less axial current than a model whose outside layer is less absorptive. A more resistive barrier exists when an axon is packed tightly between other myelinated fibers, for example. We show that realistically resistive boundary conditions can significantly increase the velocity and energy efficiency of spike propagation, while also protecting against propagation failure. Certain factors like myelin thickness may be less important than typically thought if extracellular conditions are more resistive than normally considered. We also show how realistically resistive boundary conditions affect ephaptic interactions. Overall, these results highlight the unappreciated importance of extracellular conditions for axon function.</p>

                <p>The third trimester is a critical period for the development of functional networks that support the lifelong neurocognitive performance, yet the emergence of neuronal coupling in these networks is poorly understood. Here, we used longitudinal high-density electroencephalographic recordings from preterm infants during the period from 33 to 45&nbsp;weeks of conceptional age (CA) to characterize early spatiotemporal patterns in the development of local cortical function and the intrinsic coupling modes [ICMs; phase&ndash;phase (PPCs), amplitude&ndash;amplitude (AACs), and phase&ndash;amplitude correlations (PACs)]. Absolute local power showed a robust increase with CA across the full frequency spectrum, while local PACs showed sleep state-specific, biphasic development that peaked a few weeks before normal birth. AACs and distant PACs decreased globally at nearly all frequencies. In contrast, the PPCs showed frequency- and region-selective development, with an increase of coupling strength with CA between frontal, central, and occipital regions at low-delta and alpha frequencies together with a wider-spread decrease at other frequencies. Our findings together present the spectrally and spatially differential development of the distinct ICMs during the neonatal period and provide their developmental templates for future basic and clinical research.</p>

                <p>Humans make decisions about food every day. The visual system provides important information that forms a basis for these food decisions. Although previous research has focused on visual object and category representations in the brain, it is still unclear how visually presented food is encoded by the brain. Here, we investigate the time-course of food representations in the brain. We used time-resolved multivariate analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) data, obtained from human participants (both sexes), to determine which food features are represented in the brain and whether focused attention is needed for this. We recorded EEG while participants engaged in two different tasks. In one task, the stimuli were task relevant, whereas in the other task, the stimuli were not task relevant. Our findings indicate that the brain can differentiate between food and nonfood items from ~112&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. The neural signal at later latencies contained information about food naturalness, how much the food was transformed, as well as the perceived caloric content. This information was present regardless of the task. Information about whether food is immediately ready to eat, however, was only present when the food was task relevant and presented at a slow presentation rate. Furthermore, the recorded brain activity correlated with the behavioral responses in an odd-item-out task. The fast representation of these food features, along with the finding that this information is used to guide food categorization decision-making, suggests that these features are important dimensions along which the representation of foods is organized.</p>

                <p>Human experience is imbued by the sense of being an embodied agent. The investigation of such basic self-consciousness has been hampered by the difficulty of comprehensively modulating it in the laboratory while reliably capturing ensuing subjective changes. The present preregistered study fills this gap by combining advanced meditative states with principled phenomenological interviews: 46 long-term meditators (19 female, 27 male) were instructed to modulate and attenuate their embodied self-experience during magnetoencephalographic monitoring. Results showed frequency-specific (high-beta band) activity reductions in frontoparietal and posterior medial cortices (PMC). Importantly, PMC reductions were driven by a subgroup describing radical embodied self-disruptions, including suspension of agency and dissolution of a localized first-person perspective. Neural changes were correlated with lifetime meditation and interview-derived experiential changes, but not with classical self-reports. The results demonstrate the potential of integrating in-depth first&ndash;person methods into neuroscientific experiments. Furthermore, they highlight neural oscillations in the PMC as a central process supporting the embodied sense of self.</p>

                <p>MAGUK scaffold proteins play a central role in maintaining and modulating synaptic signaling, providing a framework to retain and position receptors, signaling molecules, and other synaptic components. In particular, the MAGUKs SAP102 and PSD-95 are essential for synaptic function at distinct developmental timepoints and perform both overlapping and unique roles. While their similar structures allow for common binding partners, SAP102 is expressed earlier in synapse development and is required for synaptogenesis, whereas PSD-95 expression peaks later and is associated with synapse maturation. PSD-95 and other key synaptic proteins organize into subsynaptic nanodomains that have a significant impact on synaptic transmission, but the nanoscale organization of SAP102 is unknown. How SAP102 is organized within the synapse, and how it relates spatially to PSD-95 on a nanometer scale, could underlie its unique functions and impact how SAP102 scaffolds synaptic proteins. Here we used DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy to measure SAP102 nano-organization and its spatial relationship to PSD-95 at individual synapses in mixed-sex rat cultured neurons. We found that like PSD-95, SAP102 accumulates in high-density subsynaptic nanoclusters (NCs). However, SAP102 NCs were smaller and denser than PSD-95 NCs across development. Additionally, only a subset of SAP102 NCs co-organized with PSD-95, revealing MAGUK nanodomains within individual synapses containing either one or both proteins. These MAGUK nanodomain types had distinct NC properties and were differentially enriched with the presynaptic release protein Munc13-1. This organization into both shared and distinct subsynaptic nanodomains may underlie the ability of SAP102 and PSD-95 to perform both common and unique synaptic functions.</p>

                <p>The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a small midbrain structure that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, regulates brain&ndash;body communication, and is often studied for its role in "fight-or-flight" and "freezing" responses to threat. We used ultra-high-field 7&nbsp;T fMRI to resolve the PAG in humans and distinguish it from the cerebral aqueduct, examining its in vivo function during a working memory task (<I>N</I> = 87). Both mild and moderate cognitive demands elicited spatially similar patterns of whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, and moderate cognitive demand elicited widespread BOLD increases above baseline in the brainstem. Notably, these brainstem increases were not significantly greater than those in the mild demand condition, suggesting that a subthreshold brainstem BOLD increase occurred for mild cognitive demand as well. Subject-specific masks were group aligned to examine PAG response. In PAG, both mild and moderate demands elicited a well-defined response in ventrolateral PAG, a region thought to be functionally related to anticipated painful threat in humans and nonhuman animals&mdash;yet, the present task posed only the most minimal (if any) "threat," with the cognitive tasks used being approximately as challenging as remembering a phone number. These findings suggest that the PAG may play a more general role in visceromotor regulation, even in the absence of threat.</p>

                <p>The N2pc and P3 event-related potentials (ERPs), used to index selective attention and access to working memory and conscious awareness, respectively, have been important tools in cognitive sciences. Although it is likely that these two components and the underlying cognitive processes are temporally and functionally linked, such links have not yet been convincingly demonstrated. Adopting a novel methodological approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW), we provide evidence that the N2pc and P3 ERP components are temporally linked. We analyzed data from an experiment where 23 participants (16 women) monitored bilateral rapid serial streams of letters and digits in order to report a target digit indicated by a shape cue, separately for trials with correct responses and trials where a temporally proximal distractor was reported instead (distractor intrusion). DTW analyses revealed that N2pc and P3 latencies were correlated in time, both when the target or a distractor was reported. Notably, this link was weaker on distractor intrusion trials. This N2pc&ndash;P3 association is discussed with respect to the relationship between attention and access consciousness. Our results demonstrate that our novel method provides a valuable approach for assessing temporal links between two cognitive processes and their underlying modulating factors. This method allows to establish links and their modulator for any two time-series across all domains of the field (general-purpose MATLAB functions and a Python module are provided alongside this paper).</p>

                <p>Aging is accompanied by a decline of working memory, an important cognitive capacity that involves stimulus-selective neural activity that persists after stimulus presentation. Here, we unraveled working memory dynamics in older human adults (male and female) including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a combination of behavioral modeling, neuropsychological assessment, and MEG recordings of brain activity. Younger adults (male and female) were studied with behavioral modeling only. Participants performed a visuospatial delayed match-to-sample task under systematic manipulation of the delay and distance between sample and test stimuli. Their behavior (match/nonmatch decisions) was fit with a computational model permitting the dissociation of noise in the internal operations underlying the working memory performance from a strategic decision threshold. Task accuracy decreased with delay duration and sample/test proximity. When sample/test distances were small, older adults committed more false alarms than younger adults. The computational model explained the participants&rsquo; behavior well. The model parameters reflecting internal noise (not decision threshold) correlated with the precision of stimulus-selective cortical activity measured with MEG during the delay interval. The model uncovered an increase specifically in working memory noise in older compared with younger participants. Furthermore, in the MCI group, but not in the older healthy controls, internal noise correlated with the participants&rsquo; clinically assessed cognitive integrity. Our results are consistent with the idea that the stability of working memory contents deteriorates in aging, in a manner that is specifically linked to the overall cognitive integrity of individuals diagnosed with MCI.</p>

                <p>The neurophysiological effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for chronic pain are poorly understood, resulting in inefficient failure-prone programming protocols and inadequate pain relief. Nonetheless, novel stimulation patterns are regularly introduced and adopted clinically. Traditionally, paresthetic sensation is considered necessary for pain relief, although novel paradigms provide analgesia without paresthesia. However, like pain relief, the neurophysiological underpinnings of SCS-induced paresthesia are unknown. Here, we paired biophysical modeling with clinical paresthesia thresholds (of both sexes) to investigate how stimulation frequency affects the neural response to SCS relevant to paresthesia and analgesia. Specifically, we modeled the dorsal column (DC) axonal response, dorsal column nucleus (DCN) synaptic transmission, conduction failure within DC fiber collaterals, and dorsal horn network output. Importantly, we found that high-frequency stimulation reduces DC fiber activation thresholds, which in turn accurately predicts clinical paresthesia perception thresholds. Furthermore, we show that high-frequency SCS produces asynchronous DC fiber spiking and ultimately asynchronous DCN output, offering a plausible biophysical basis for why high-frequency SCS is less comfortable and produces qualitatively different sensation than low-frequency stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that the model dorsal horn network output is sensitive to SCS-inherent variations in spike timing, which could contribute to heterogeneous pain relief across patients. Importantly, we show that model DC fiber collaterals cannot reliably follow high-frequency stimulation, strongly affecting the network output and typically producing antinociceptive effects at high frequencies. Altogether, these findings clarify how SCS affects the nervous system and provide insight into the biophysics of paresthesia generation and pain relief.</p>

                Background Muscle injuries are the most frequent in football and may lead to the end of a player’s career. Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of prevention programs for all injury types. Few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise on muscle injuries. Methods A documentary search was conducted in October 2022 from three databases: Medline via its PubMed interface, Google Scholar, and COCHRANE databases. We only included original articles published between October 2012 and October 2022 with a high level of evidence. The research was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. The target population consisted of professional and semi-professional footballers. The intervention in question was structured injury preventive protocols, including specific training or pre-established protocols such as the FIFA 11+ program, compared to each other or with regular training sessions. The main outcomes were the incidence rates of muscle injuries and severe injury in each group, as well as the time loss to injury. Results Seven randomized controlled trials with a high level of evidence confirmed using the PEDRO scale were included. There were 3815 male professional football players. There was heterogeneity in the age, hours of exposure, and duration of the intervention. The prevention protocols used were FIFA 11+, bounding exercises, NHE, and stretching exercises. Structured exercises significantly reduce the severity of muscle injury and, consequently, time loss to injury. Discussion Despite the diversity of prevention programs, teams still lack standardized programs. Structured exercises, such as FIFA 11+ and bounding exercises, which combine strengthening, body kinesthesic awareness, and neuromuscular control, reduce the incidence and severity of muscle injury. FIFA 11+ is the first and most complete structured program, but lacks some exercises, such as adductor strengthening. Conclusion This review showed the interest in structured exercises in reducing severity and time loss to injury in professional football players. Registration This review was registered on 8/17/2023 in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under the reference code CRD42023452202.

                <p>by Chengwei Ai, Hongpeng Yang, Xiaoyi Liu, Ruihan Dong, Yijie Ding, Fei Guo</p>

De novo drug design is crucial in advancing drug discovery, which aims to generate new drugs with specific pharmacological properties. Recently, deep generative models have achieved inspiring progress in generating drug-like compounds. However, the models prioritize a single target drug generation for pharmacological intervention, neglecting the complicated inherent mechanisms of diseases, and influenced by multiple factors. Consequently, developing novel multi-target drugs that simultaneously target specific targets can enhance anti-tumor efficacy and address issues related to resistance mechanisms. To address this issue and inspired by Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models, we propose an upgraded GPT model with generative adversarial imitation learning for multi-target molecular generation called MTMol-GPT. The multi-target molecular generator employs a dual discriminator model using the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method for a concurrently multi-target molecular generation. Extensive results show that MTMol-GPT generates various valid, novel, and effective multi-target molecules for various complex diseases, demonstrating robustness and generalization capability. In addition, molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping experiments demonstrate the drug-likeness properties and effectiveness of generated molecules potentially improve neuropsychiatric interventions. Furthermore, our model’s generalizability is exemplified by a case study focusing on the multi-targeted drug design for breast cancer. As a broadly applicable solution for multiple targets, MTMol-GPT provides new insight into future directions to enhance potential complex disease therapeutics by generating high-quality multi-target molecules in drug discovery.

                <p>by Heung-Yeol Lim, Inah Lee</p>

The perirhinal cortex (PER) supports multimodal object recognition, but how multimodal information of objects is integrated within the PER remains unknown. Here, we recorded single units within the PER while rats performed a PER-dependent multimodal object-recognition task. In this task, audiovisual cues were presented simultaneously (multimodally) or separately (unimodally). We identified 2 types of object-selective neurons in the PER: crossmodal cells, showing constant firing patterns for an object irrespective of its modality, and unimodal cells, showing a preference for a specific modality. Unimodal cells further dissociated unimodal and multimodal versions of the object by modulating their firing rates according to the modality condition. A population-decoding analysis confirmed that the PER could perform both modality-invariant and modality-specific object decoding—the former for recognizing an object as the same in various conditions and the latter for remembering modality-specific experiences of the same object.

                Background This study aimed to compare the effect on postoperative complications of prehabilitation targeting predefined co-existing risky lifestyle factors with usual preoperative routines in surgical patients. Methods This systematic review followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and the protocol (CRD42022282611). Five databases were searched from inception to November 7, 2022 for randomised controlled trials on prehabilitation targeting ≥2 predefined risky lifestyles compared with usual preoperative routines. Risky lifestyles included Smoking, Nutrition (malnutrition and/or BMI>25), risky Alcohol intake, and Physical inactivity (SNAP). Primary outcome was postoperative complications ≤30 days. Cochrane’s risk-of-bias tool 2 was used and meta-analyses were conducted. GRADE was used to assess certainty of evidence. Results The search resulted in 20,862 records. At full-text screening, only two (120 participants) of 24 identified trials on combined SNAP intervention had ≥2 predefined risk factors and were included. One (n=110) on intensive physical and brief nutritional intervention to frail patients with colorectal cancer resection reported complication rates of 45% in both groups (relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.51). The other study (n=10, subgroup) on intensive alcohol and smoking intervention in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy, reported complications in 3/7 vs 3/3 participants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.19). The meta-analysis estimated a RR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.51, I2 51%). Conclusion Two small of the 24 trials on prehabilitation targeted co-existing and predefined risky SNAP factors and the effect on postoperative complications is very uncertain. Future prehabilitation research involving patient needs is warranted.

                Background Food insecurity is a historical global human challenge, but has yet remained a burning development agenda. The capacity to withstand and recover from food insecurity shocks and stresses refereed as resilience, which is determined by a strand of factors. This paper deals with measuring and; identifying major determinants of household resilience to food insecurity among weaving-based livelihood system in Chencha district. Methods Multi-stage sampling technique was employed to generate data from 303 sample households through household survey, focus group discussion, and key informant interviews. The collected data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, household resilience index, chi-square test, one-way ANOVA and econometric model (probit regression). Results The household survey revealed that 59.04% households were non-resilient, 24.42% were moderately resilient, 10.89% resilient and 4.95% highly resilient. The Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests have shown a meaningful and statistically significant difference among resilience categories. Finally, probit model analysis indicated that access to credit, average years of family education, crop diversity, income diversity, landholding size, TLU, expected crop harvest, expected cash income from fruit trees, frequency of extension contact, FCS, annual food expenditure, ownerships of Radio, Jewelry, furnished bed, membership in local associations, and distance to local market have positively influenced the likelihood of attaining higher household resilience at CI 95% or P<1%, 5% and 10%. Whereas; lack of access to mobile phone, inability to read and write, family business, formal employment, and transfers of payment have decreased likelihood of households to achieve higher resilience level. Conclusions Therefore, improving household access to credit, education, income diversification, livestock and land, agricultural extension services, membership to local associations, mobile service, and income diversification would enhance household income and food security, which could in turn improve household resilience to food insecurity.

                Background Private universities in Peru still need to implement digital transformation models to enhance the job performance of faculty and staff, achieving consistent improvement in the performance levels of university teachers by deploying technological and didactic tools for students. Therefore, the study aims to determine the relationship between digital transformation and the job performance of employees at a Private University. Methods The research approach was quantitative, employing a non-experimental, longitudinal correlational design. The technique used was a survey, applied to a sample of 104 employees (school heads, faculty, and a director) from the university on a national level from a total population of 144. Results Descriptive results reveal that the university has regularly adopted tools related to digital transformation. In particular, it has efficiently employed agile technologies, Big Data, and various technological means, benefiting 90% (52% and 38%) of the staff. The study also showed a high positive correlation (0.92>0.7) between digital transformation and the job performance of staff at the Private University, confirming that there is a significant connection between the variables studied. Conclusions Therefore, creating an innovative culture across all hierarchical levels and identifying key technologies that add value to the learning flow can meet the needs of an increasingly demanding society.

                Background Non-contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) plays a pivotal role in assessing central nervous system disorders and is a crucial diagnostic method. Iterative reconstruction (IR) methods have enhanced image quality (IQ) but may result in a blotchy appearance and decreased resolution for subtle contrasts. The deep-learning image reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) into the reconstruction process, generates high-quality images with minimal noise. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the IQ of the Precise Image (DLIR) and the IR technique (iDose4) for the NCCT brain. Methods This is a prospective study. Thirty patients who underwent NCCT brain were included. The images were reconstructed using DLIR-standard and iDose4. Qualitative IQ analysis parameters, such as overall image quality (OQ), subjective image noise (SIN), and artifacts, were measured. Quantitative IQ analysis parameters such as Computed Tomography (CT) attenuation (HU), image noise (IN), posterior fossa index (PFI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum-semiovale (CSO) were measured. Paired t-tests were performed for qualitative and quantitative IQ analyses between the iDose4 and DLIR-standard. Kappa statistics were used to assess inter-observer agreement for qualitative analysis. Results Quantitative IQ analysis showed significant differences (p<0.05) in IN, SNR, and CNR between the iDose4 and DLIR-standard at the BG and CSO levels. IN was reduced (41.8-47.6%), SNR (65-82%), and CNR (68-78.8%) were increased with DLIR-standard. PFI was reduced (27.08%) the DLIR-standard. Qualitative IQ analysis showed significant differences (p<0.05) in OQ, SIN, and artifacts between the DLIR standard and iDose4. The DLIR standard showed higher qualitative IQ scores than the iDose4. Conclusion DLIR standard yielded superior quantitative and qualitative IQ compared to the IR technique (iDose4). The DLIR-standard significantly reduced the IN and artifacts compared to iDose4 in the NCCT brain.

                This narrative review explores loneliness among medical students, particularly heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review aims to narratively describe how the digital age, both pre- and post-pandemic, influences loneliness and to assess the psychological effects of the pandemic on medical students. Our literature search, adhering to SANRA guidelines, scrutinized studies published in the last ten years focusing on loneliness among medical students. Our findings reveal that medical students experienced significant loneliness during the pandemic, attributed to virtual learning environments and decreased social interactions. Notably, the transition to online education has mitigated and exacerbated feelings of isolation. The review also highlights the dual role of social media in either alleviating or intensifying loneliness, depending on usage patterns and platform types. Overall, our study underscores the need for targeted interventions and support systems to address the mental well-being of medical students in the digital age and beyond, providing crucial insights for future research and policy-making in educational and psychological support frameworks.
