<p>From interacting cellular components to networks of neurons and neural
systems, interconnected units comprise a fundamental organizing principle of
the nervous system. Understanding how their patterns of connections and
interactions give rise to the many functions of the nervous system is a primary
goal of neuroscience. Recently, this pursuit has begun to benefit from the
development of new mathematical tools that can relate a system's architecture
to its dynamics and function. These tools, which are known collectively as
network science, have been used with increasing success to build models of
neural systems across spatial scales and species. Here we discuss the nature of
network models in neuroscience. We begin with a review of model theory from a
philosophical perspective to inform our view of networks as models of complex
systems in general, and of the brain in particular. We then summarize the types
of models that are frequently studied in network neuroscience along three
primary dimensions: from data representations to first-principles theory, from
biophysical realism to functional phenomenology, and from elementary
descriptions to coarse-grained approximations. We then consider ways to
validate these models, focusing on approaches that perturb a system to probe
its function. We close with a description of important frontiers in the
construction of network models and their relevance for understanding
increasingly complex functions of neural systems.

<p>To learn how cognition is implemented in the brain, we must build
computational models that can perform cognitive tasks, and test such models
with brain and behavioral experiments. Cognitive science has developed
computational models of human cognition, decomposing task performance into
computational components. However, its algorithms still fall short of human
intelligence and are not grounded in neurobiology. Computational neuroscience
has investigated how interacting neurons can implement component functions of
brain computation. However, it has yet to explain how those components interact
to explain human cognition and behavior. Modern technologies enable us to
measure and manipulate brain activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in animals
and humans. However, experiments will yield theoretical insight only when
employed to test brain-computational models. It is time to assemble the pieces
of the puzzle of brain computation. Here we review recent work in the
intersection of cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial
intelligence. Computational models that mimic brain information processing
during perceptual, cognitive, and control tasks are beginning to be developed
and tested with brain and behavioral data.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/33051">Capturing change in clonal composition amongst single mouse germinal centers</a></h4>

Understanding cellular processes occurring in vivo on time scales of days to weeks requires repeatedly interrogating the same tissue without perturbing homeostasis. We describe a novel setup for longitudinal intravital imaging of murine peripheral lymph nodes (LNs). The formation and evolution of single germinal centers (GCs) was visualized over days to weeks. Naïve B cells encounter antigen and form primary foci, which subsequently seed GCs. These experience widely varying rates of homogenizing selection, even within closely confined spatial proximity. The fluidity of GCs is greater than previously observed with large shifts in clonality over short time scales; and loss of GCs is a rare, observable event. The observation of contemporaneous, congruent shifts in clonal composition between GCs within the same animal suggests inter-GC trafficking of memory B cells. This tool refines approaches to resolving immune dynamics in peripheral LNs with high temporospatial resolution and minimal perturbation of homeostasis.

In 1984, biochemists George Glenner and Caine Wong, in search of ‘a unique amyloid fibril precursor protein in the serum’ of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, successfully isolated and sequenced the first 24 amino acids of a ‘cerebrovascular amyloid fibril protein β’ that we now know as the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. This landmark paper laid the foundation for extensive research in the following decades that ultimately established the role of β-amyloidosis as a player in the pathogenesis of AD.

In their 1994 paper, Monyer et al. described unique functional properties and cell type-specific expression of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) GluN2 subunits, suggesting that the roles of NMDAR vary across brain regions and throughout development. This influential work not only provided insight into how molecular diversity impacts synapse function, but also continues to inform new approaches for modulating brain circuits.

Kynurenines, the major degradative products of the essential amino acid tryptophan, may play critical roles in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. In 2014, Agudelo and colleagues reported that exercise indirectly modulates the metabolism of kynurenines in skeletal muscle, which in turn influences the brain and enhances resilience to depression.

In 2004, Prinz et al. demonstrated that almost indistinguishable network activity can arise from widely different sets of underlying membrane and synaptic parameters, and, thus, likely arise from different cellular and network mechanisms. This now broadly accepted principle guides research into individual variation in neuronal and synaptic properties, and their homeostatic regulation.

<p>by Farzaneh Mohajerani, Michael F. Hagan</p>

Bacterial microcompartments are large, roughly icosahedral shells that assemble around enzymes and reactants involved in certain metabolic pathways in bacteria. Motivated by microcompartment assembly, we use coarse-grained computational and theoretical modeling to study the factors that control the size and morphology of a protein shell assembling around hundreds to thousands of molecules. We perform dynamical simulations of shell assembly in the presence and absence of cargo over a range of interaction strengths, subunit and cargo stoichiometries, and the shell spontaneous curvature. Depending on these parameters, we find that the presence of a cargo can either increase or decrease the size of a shell relative to its intrinsic spontaneous curvature, as seen in recent experiments. These features are controlled by a balance of kinetic and thermodynamic effects, and the shell size is assembly pathway dependent. We discuss implications of these results for synthetic biology efforts to target new enzymes to microcompartment interiors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VqXYLlYSdr8" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Individual variations in motor adaptation rate were recently shown to correlate with movement variability or "motor noise" in a forcefield adaptation task. However, this finding could not be replicated in a meta-analysis of adaptation experiments. Possibly, this inconsistency stems from noise being composed of distinct components that relate to adaptation rate in different ways. Indeed, previous modeling and electrophysiological studies have suggested that motor noise can be factored into planning noise, originating from the brain, and execution noise, stemming from the periphery. Were the motor system optimally tuned to these noise sources, planning noise would correlate positively with adaptation rate, and execution noise would correlate negatively with adaptation rate, a phenomenon familiar in Kalman filters. To test this prediction, we performed a visuomotor adaptation experiment in 69 subjects. Using a novel Bayesian fitting procedure, we succeeded in applying the well-established state-space model of adaptation to individual data. We found that adaptation rate correlates positively with planning noise (<i>β</i> = 0.44; 95% HDI = [0.27 0.59]) and negatively with execution noise (<i>β</i> = –0.39; 95% HDI = [–0.50 –0.30]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from planning and execution noise correlated positively with adaptation rate (<i>r</i> = 0.54; 95% HDI = [0.38 0.66]). These results suggest that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with the "optimal control" framework that has been used to explain motor control. Since motor adaptation is thought to be a largely cerebellar process, the results further suggest the sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise.</p>

Abstract
<p>Using the rat conditioned gaping model of nausea, the interoceptive insular cortex (IIC) has been identified as a critical site for the regulation of lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced nausea. Indirect evidence supports a model where serotonin (5-HT) acts on postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors and its release is suppressed by elevating 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition to suppress nausea. Here, we directly test the hypothesis that systemic LiCl elevates 5-HT in the IIC, and this is prevented by pretreatments that reduce 5-HT release. Using male Sprague Dawley rats, LiCl (but not saline), elevated 5-HT selectively in the IIC, for 20 min after LiCl administration (127.2 mg/kg, i.p.). Systemic pretreatment with the MAGL inhibitor, MJN110, prevented the LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Systemic cannabidiol (CBD), which reduces LiCl-induced nausea by acting at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> somatodendritic autoreceptors, also prevented LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Since 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor agonists delivered to the IIC produce nausea, we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that the intra-IIC administration of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, ondansetron, but not MJN110, would prevent LiCl-induced conditioned gaping reactions produced by intra-IIC administration of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist, <i>m-</i>chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG). Finally, we demonstrate that exposure to a LiCl-paired flavor (but not a saline-paired flavor) produces elevated 5-HT release in the IIC, while rats display conditioned gaping reactions. These results confirm that LiCl-induced nausea is triggered by elevated 5-HT release in the IIC and is attenuated by treatments that reduce 5-HT availability in this region.</p>

<p>A developing brain shows intense reorganization and heightened neuronal plasticity allowing for environmental modulation of its development. During early life, maternal care is a key factor of this environment and defects in this care can derail adaptive brain development and may result in susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which those maternal interactions immediately impact the offspring’s brain activity to initiate the pathway to pathology are not well understood. We do know that multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved, including the serotonergic system, a key neuromodulator involved in brain development and emotional regulation. We tested the importance of the serotonergic system and pups’ immediate neural response to maternal presence using wireless electrophysiological recordings, a novel approach allowing us to record neural activity during pups’ interactions with their mother. We found that maternal contact modulates the P10–P12 rat pups’ anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity by notably increasing local-field potential (LFP) power in low-frequency bands. We demonstrated, by blocking serotonergic receptors, that this increase is mediated through 5-HT2 receptors (5-HT2Rs). Finally, we showed in isolated pups that enhancing serotonergic transmission, using a selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor, is sufficient to enhance LFP power in low-frequency bands in a pattern similar to that observed when the mother is in the nest. Our results highlight a significant contribution of the serotonergic system in mediating changes of cortical activity in pups related to maternal presence.</p>

<p>We present the fundamentals of the quantum theoretical approach we have
developed in the last decade to model cognitive phenomena that resisted
modeling by means of classical logical and probabilistic structures, like
Boolean, Kolmogorovian and, more generally, set theoretical structures. We
firstly sketch the operational-realistic foundations of conceptual entities,
i.e. concepts, conceptual combinations, propositions, decision-making entities,
etc. Then, we briefly illustrate the application of the quantum formalism in
Hilbert space to represent combinations of natural concepts, discussing its
success in modeling a wide range of empirical data on concepts and their
conjunction, disjunction and negation. Next, we naturally extend the quantum
theoretical approach to model some long-standing `fallacies of human
reasoning', namely, the `conjunction fallacy' and the `disjunction effect'.
Finally, we put forward an explanatory hypothesis according to which human
reasoning is a defined superposition of `emergent reasoning' and `logical
reasoning', where the former generally prevails over the latter. The quantum
theoretical approach explains human fallacies as the consequence of genuine
quantum structures in human reasoning, i.e. `contextuality', `emergence',
`entanglement', `interference' and `superposition'. As such, it is alternative
to the Kahneman-Tversky research programme, which instead aims to explain human
fallacies in terms of `individual heuristics and biases'.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38992">Branching morphogenesis in the developing kidney is not impacted by nephron formation or integration</a></h4>

Branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud is integral to kidney development; establishing the collecting ducts of the adult organ and driving organ expansion via peripheral interactions with nephron progenitor cells. A recent study suggested that termination of tip branching within the developing kidney involved stochastic exhaustion in response to nephron formation, with such a termination event representing a unifying developmental process evident in many organs. To examine this possibility we have profiled the impact of nephron formation and maturation on elaboration of the ureteric bud during mouse kidney development. We find a distinct absence of random branch termination events within the kidney or evidence that nephrogenesis impacts the branching program or cell proliferation in either tip or progenitor cell niches. Instead, organogenesis proceeds in a manner indifferent to the development of these structures. Hence stochastic cessation of branching is not a unifying developmental feature in all branching organs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38801">Rap2 and TNIK control Plexin-dependent tiled synaptic innervation in <i>C. elegans</i></a></h4>

During development, neurons form synapses with their fate-determined targets. While we begin to elucidate the mechanisms by which extracellular ligand-receptor interactions enhance synapse specificity by inhibiting synaptogenesis, our knowledge about their intracellular mechanisms remains limited. Here we show that Rap2 GTPase (<i>rap-2</i>) and its effector, TNIK (<i>mig-15</i>), act genetically downstream of Plexin (<i>plx-1</i>) to restrict presynaptic assembly and to form tiled synaptic innervation in <i>C. elegans</i>. Both constitutively GTP- and GDP-forms of <i>rap-2</i> mutants exhibit synaptic tiling defects as <i>plx-1</i> mutants, suggesting that cycling of the RAP-2 nucleotide state is critical for synapse inhibition. Consistently, PLX-1 suppresses local RAP-2 activity. Excessive ectopic synapse formation in <i>mig-15</i> mutants causes a severe synaptic tiling defect. Conversely, overexpression of <i>mig-15</i> strongly inhibited synapse formation, suggesting that <i>mig-15</i> is a negative regulator of synapse formation. These results reveal that subcellular regulation of small GTPase activity by Plexin shapes proper synapse patterning in vivo.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38433">Structural relationship between the putative hair cell mechanotransduction channel TMC1 and TMEM16 proteins</a></h4>

The hair cell mechanotransduction (MET) channel complex is essential for hearing, yet it’s molecular identity and structure remain elusive. The transmembrane channel–like 1 (TMC1) protein localizes to the site of the MET channel, interacts with the tip-link responsible for mechanical gating, and genetic alterations in TMC1 alter MET channel properties and cause deafness, supporting the hypothesis that TMC1 forms the MET channel. We generated a model of TMC1 based on X-ray and cryo-EM structures of TMEM16 proteins, revealing the presence of a large cavity near the protein-lipid interface that also harbors the Beethoven mutation, suggesting that it could function as a permeation pathway. We also find that hair cells are permeable to 3 kDa dextrans, and that dextran permeation requires TMC1/2 proteins and functional MET channels, supporting the presence of a large permeation pathway and the hypothesis that TMC1 is a pore forming subunit of the MET channel complex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38340">The origin of the odorant receptor gene family in insects</a></h4>

The origin of the insect odorant receptor (OR) gene family has been hypothesized to have coincided with the evolution of terrestriality in insects. Missbach et al. (2014) suggested that ORs instead evolved with an ancestral OR co-receptor (Orco) after the origin of terrestriality and the OR/Orco system is an adaptation to winged flight in insects. We investigated genomes of the Collembola, Diplura, Archaeognatha, Zygentoma, Odonata, and Ephemeroptera, and find ORs present in all insect genomes but absent from lineages predating the evolution of insects. Orco is absent only in the ancestrally wingless insect lineage Archaeognatha. Our new genome sequence of the zygentoman firebrat <i>Thermobia domestica </i>reveals a full OR/Orco system. We conclude that ORs evolved before winged flight, perhaps as an adaptation to terrestriality, representing a key evolutionary novelty in the ancestor of all insects, and hence a molecular synapomorphy for the Class Insecta.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37443">Cerebellar implementation of movement sequences through feedback</a></h4>

Most movements are not unitary, but are comprised of sequences. Although patients with cerebellar pathology display severe deficits in the execution and learning of sequences<sup>1,2</sup>, most of our understanding of cerebellar mechanisms has come from analyses of single component movements. Eyelid conditioning is a cerebellar-mediated behavior that provides the ability to control and restrict inputs to the cerebellum through stimulation of mossy fibers. We utilized this advantage to test directly how the cerebellum can learn a sequence of inter-connected movement components in rabbits. We show that the feedback signals from one component are sufficient to serve as a cue for the next component in the sequence.<i> In vivo</i> recordings from Purkinje cells demonstrated that all components of the sequence were encoded similarly by cerebellar cortex. These results provide a simple yet general framework for how the cerebellum can use simple associate learning processes to chain together a sequence of appropriately timed responses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36953">Wnt/PCP controls spreading of Wnt/β-catenin signals by cytonemes in vertebrates</a></h4>

Signaling filopodia, termed cytonemes, are dynamic actin-based membrane structures that regulate the exchange of signaling molecules and their receptors within tissues. However, how cytoneme formation is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that Wnt/PCP autocrine signaling controls the emergence of cytonemes, and that cytonemes subsequently control paracrine Wnt/β-catenin signal activation. Upon binding of the Wnt family member Wnt8a, the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 gets activated. Ror2/PCP signaling leads to induction of cytonemes, which mediate transport of Wnt8a to neighboring cells. In the Wnt receiving cells, Wnt8a on cytonemes triggers Wnt/β-catenin-dependent gene transcription and proliferation. We show that cytoneme-based Wnt transport operates in diverse processes, including zebrafish development, the murine intestinal crypt, and human cancer organoids, demonstrating that Wnt transport by cytonemes and its control via the Ror2 pathway is highly conserved in vertebrates.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36740">Germ layer-specific regulation of cell polarity and adhesion gives insight into the evolution of mesoderm</a></h4>

In triploblastic animals, Par-proteins regulate cell-polarity and adherens junctions of both ectodermal and endodermal epithelia. But, in embryos of the diploblastic cnidarian <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>, Par-proteins are degraded in all cells in the bifunctional gastrodermal epithelium. Using immunohistochemistry, CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, and mRNA overexpression, we describe the functional association between Par-proteins, ß-catenin, and <i>snail</i> transcription factor genes in <i>N. vectensis</i> embryos. We demonstrate that the aPKC/Par complex regulates the localization of ß-catenin in the ectoderm by stabilizing its role in cell-adhesion, and that endomesodermal epithelial cells are organized by a different cell-adhesion system than overlying ectoderm. We also show that ectopic expression of <i>snail</i> genes, which are expressed in mesodermal derivatives in bilaterians, is sufficient to downregulate Par-proteins and translocate ß-catenin from the junctions to the cytoplasm in ectodermal cells. These data provide molecular insight into the evolution of epithelial structure and distinct cell behaviors in metazoan embryos.

Mesenchymal condensation is a critical step in organogenesis, yet the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The hair follicle dermal condensate is the precursor to the permanent mesenchymal unit of the hair follicle, the dermal papilla, which regulates hair cycling throughout life and bears hair inductive potential. Dermal condensate morphogenesis depends on epithelial Fibroblast Growth Factor 20 (Fgf20). Here, we combine mouse models with 3D and 4D microscopy to demonstrate that dermal condensates form <i>de novo</i> and via directional migration. We identify cell cycle exit and cell shape changes as early hallmarks of dermal condensate morphogenesis and find that Fgf20 primes these cellular behaviors and enhances cell motility and condensation. RNAseq profiling of immediate Fgf20 targets revealed induction of a subset of dermal condensate marker genes. Collectively, these data indicate that dermal condensation occurs via directed cell movement and that Fgf20 orchestrates the early cellular and molecular events.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36362">Control of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway by G<sub>2</sub>-quadruplexes</a></h4>

G-quadruplexes are naturally-occurring structures found in RNAs and DNAs. Regular RNA G-quadruplexes are highly stable due to stacked planar arrangements connected by short loops. However, reports of irregular quadruplex structures are increasing and recent genome-wide studies suggest that they influence gene expression. We have investigated a grouping of G<sub>2</sub>-motifs in the UTRs of eight genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis, and concluded that several likely form novel metastable RNA G-quadruplexes. We performed a comprehensive biophysical characterization of their properties, comparing them to a reference G-quadruplex. Using cellular assays, together with polyamine-depleting and quadruplex-stabilizing ligands, we discovered how some of these motifs regulate and sense polyamine levels, creating feedback loops during polyamine biosynthesis. Using high-resolution <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated that a long-looped quadruplex in the <i>AZIN1</i> mRNA co-exists in salt-dependent equilibria with a hairpin structure. This study expands the repertoire of regulatory G-quadruplexes and demonstrates how they act in unison to control metabolite homeostasis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36068">Content-specific activity in frontoparietal and default-mode networks during prior-guided visual perception</a></h4>

How prior knowledge shapes perceptual processing across the human brain, particularly in the frontoparietal (FPN) and default-mode (DMN) networks, remains unknown. Using ultra-high-field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we elucidated the effects that the acquisition of prior knowledge has on perceptual processing across the brain. We observed that prior knowledge significantly impacted neural representations in the FPN and DMN, rendering responses to individual visual images more distinct from each other, and more similar to the image-specific prior. In addition, neural representations were structured in a hierarchy that remained stable across perceptual conditions, with early visual areas and DMN anchored at the two extremes. Two large-scale cortical gradients occur along this hierarchy: first, dimensionality of the neural representational space increased along the hierarchy; second, prior’s impact on neural representations was greater in higher-order areas. These results reveal extensive and graded influences of prior knowledge on perceptual processing across the brain.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34028">Non-invasive imaging of CSF-mediated brain clearance pathways via assessment of perivascular fluid movement with DTI MRI</a></h4>

The glymphatics system describes a CSF-mediated clearance pathway for the removal of potentially harmful molecules, such as amyloid beta, from the brain. As such, its components may represent new therapeutic targets to alleviate aberrant protein accumulation that defines the most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions. Currently, however, the absence of any non-invasive measurement technique prohibits detailed understanding of glymphatic function in the human brain and in turn, it's role in pathology. Here, we present the first non-invasive technique for the assessment of glymphatic inflow by using an ultra-long echo time, low <i>b</i>-value, multi-direction diffusion weighted MRI sequence to assess perivascular fluid movement (which represents a critical component of the glymphatic pathway) in the rat brain. This novel, quantitative and non-invasive approach may represent a valuable biomarker of CSF-mediated brain clearance, working towards the clinical need for reliable and early diagnostic indicators of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ventral part of the anteromedial thalamic nucleus (AMv) receives substantial inputs from hypothalamic sites that are highly responsive to a live predator or its odor trace and represents an important thalamic hub for conveying predatory threat information to the cerebral cortex. In the present study, we begin by examining the cortico-amygdalar-hippocampal projections of the main AMv cortical targets, namely, the caudal prelimbic, rostral anterior cingulate, and medial visual areas, as well as the rostral part of the ventral retrosplenial area, one of the main targets of the anterior cingulate area. We observed that these areas form a clear cortical network. Next, we revealed that in animals exposed to a live cat, all of the elements of this circuit presented a differential increase in Fos, supporting the idea of a predator threat-responsive cortical network. Finally, we showed that bilateral cytotoxic lesions in each element of this cortical network did not change innate fear responses but drastically reduced contextual conditioning to the predator-associated environment. Overall, the present findings suggest that predator threat has an extensive representation in the cerebral cortex and revealed a cortical network that is responsive to predatory threats and exerts a critical role in processing fear memory.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although frequently discussed in terms of sex dimorphism, the neurobiology of sexual orientation and identity is unknown. We report multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data, including cortical thickness (Cth), subcortical volumes, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, from 27 transgender women (TrW), 40 transgender men (TrM), and 80 heterosexual (40 men) and 60 homosexual cisgender controls (30 men). These data show that whereas homosexuality is linked to cerebral sex dimorphism, gender dysphoria primarily involves cerebral networks mediating self–body perception. Among the homosexual cisgender controls, weaker sex dimorphism was found in white matter connections and a partly reversed sex dimorphism in Cth. Similar patterns were detected in transgender persons compared with heterosexual cisgender controls, but the significant clusters disappeared when adding homosexual controls, and correcting for sexual orientation. Instead, both TrW and TrM displayed singular features, showing greater Cth as well as weaker structural and functional connections in the anterior cingulate-precuneus and right occipito-parietal cortex, regions known to process own body perception in the context of self.</span>

Selective attention is central to cognition. Dramatic advances have been made in understanding the neural circuits that mediate selective attention. Forebrain networks, most elaborated in primates, control all forms of attention based on task demands and the physical salience of stimuli. These networks contain circuits that distribute top-down signals to sensory processing areas and enhance information processing in those areas. A midbrain network, most elaborated in birds, controls spatial attention.

There has been keen interest in measuring in vivo GABA. However, GABA signal is low and typically measured using techniques vulnerable to the confounding effects of in-scanner head movement. This issue is particularly problematic for clinical studies since it may lead to Type I or II error in testing for group differences. While solutions to mitigate the effects of movement have been proposed, fundamental and largely unexamined issues are the nature and scale of this effect. We developed a method to quantify and characterize head movement during GABA spectroscopy and found that two parameters of movement, displacement and instantaneous movement, were inversely correlated with and accounted for 12.1% and 20.2% variance of GABA estimates respectively. We conclude that head movement can significantly affect GABA measurements and the application of methods to account for movement may improve of GABA measurement accuracy and the detection of true group differences in clinical studies.

Alcohol use contributes to numerous diseases and injuries. The nervous system is affected by alcohol in diverse ways, though the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not clearly understood. Using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we developed a neural cell culture model to identify the mechanisms of alcohol's effects. iPSCs were generated from fibroblasts and differentiated into forebrain neural cells cultures that were treated with 50 mM alcohol or sham conditions (same media lacking alcohol) for 7 days. We analyzed gene expression using total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for 34 samples derived from 11 subjects and for 10 samples from 5 subjects in an independent experiment that had intermittent exposure to the same dose of alcohol. We also analyzed genetic effects on gene expression and conducted a weighted correlation network analysis. We found that differentiated neural cell cultures have the capacity to recapitulate gene regulatory effects previously observed in specific primary neural tissues and identified 226 genes that were differentially expressed (FDR &lt; 0.1) after alcohol treatment. The effects on expression included decreases in INSIG1 and LDLR, two genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. We also identified a module of 58 co-expressed genes that were uniformly decreased following alcohol exposure. The majority of these effects were supported in the independent alcohol exposure experiment. Enrichment analysis linked the alcohol responsive genes to cell cycle, notch signaling, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways, which are disrupted in several neurological disorders. Our findings suggest that there is convergence between these disorders and the effects of alcohol exposure.

Astrocytes play multiple functions in the central nervous system, from control of blood flow through to modulation of synaptic activity. Transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ are thought to control these activities. The prevailing concept is that these Ca2+ transients are triggered by distinct pathways, with little mechanistic and functional overlap. Here we demonstrate that astrocytes in visual cortex of mice encode local visual signals in conjunction with arousal state, functioning as multi-modal integrators. Such activity adds an additional layer of complexity to astrocyte function and may enable astrocytes to specifically and subtly regulate local network activity and plasticity.

Metacognition refers to the ability to be aware of one's own cognition. The anterior prefrontal cortex has been associated with meta-perceptual but not meta-memory decisions. A recent study has challenged this notion showing that neural activation in macaques' prefrontal areas 9 and 9/46d is associated with metamemory of recognition of items. Here, we verified the critical role of sub-regions of prefrontal cortex in the domain of spatial recognition memory. We contrasted performance of monkeys with superior dorsolateral prefrontal lesion with orbitofrontal lesioned monkeys and unoperated controls in spatial recognition memory tasks. We show that monkeys with dorsolateral lesions are impaired in meta-accuracy, but not in recognition performance, in comparison to orbitofrontal-lesioned and control monkeys. Together with the observation that the same orbitofrontal-lesioned monkeys were impaired in updating rule-value in a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analog, we provide causal evidence towards functional specialisation between dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices underpinning the introspection ability in relation to memory recognition in primates.

Despite their wide-spread use, only limited information is available on the comparative test-retest reliability of task-based functional and resting state magnetic resonance imaging measures of blood oxygen level dependence (tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling. This information is critical to designing properly powered longitudinal studies. Here we comprehensively quantified and compared the test-retest reliability and reproducibility performance of 8 commonly applied fMRI tasks, 6 rs-fMRI metrics and CBF in 30 healthy volunteers. We find large variability in test-retest reliability performance across the different tb-fMRI paradigms and rs-fMRI metrics, ranging from poor to excellent. A larger extent of activation in tb-fMRI is linked to higher between-subject reliability of the respective task suggesting that differences in the amount of activation may be used as a first reliability estimate of novel tb-fMRI paradigms. For rs-fMRI, a good reliability of local activity estimates is paralleled by poor performance of global connectivity metrics. Evaluated CBF measures provide in general a good to excellent test-reliability matching or surpassing the best performing tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI metrics. This comprehensive effort allows for direct comparisons of test-retest reliability between the evaluated MRI domains and measures to aid the design of future tb-fMRI, rs-fMRI and CBF studies.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/381236v1?rss=1">Spontaneous network activity accounts for variability in stimulus-induced gamma responses</a></h4>

Gamma range activity in human visual cortex is believed to play a major role in cognitive functions, such as selective attention. Although recent studies have revealed substantial variability in gamma activity, its origins are still unclear. We investigated whether variability in stimulus-induced gamma activity is related to the spontaneous dynamics of resting-state networks using Hidden Markov Modelling. The magnetoencephalogram (MEG) of 15 healthy participants was recorded at rest and while they were performing a task involving a visual stimulus inducing strong, narrow-band gamma activity. Brain states were inferred from the task's baseline periods and from resting-state recordings, respectively. Our results show how network states are related to the amplitude of stimulus-induced gamma responses. Across trials, we found an association between the amplitude of gamma responses and the brain state occurring immediately prior to stimulus presentation. Strong gamma responses followed a state characterized by prominent delta/theta oscillations in parieto-occipital regions and comparably weak alpha activity. Across subjects, the overall probability of visiting this state in the baseline period, i.e. the individual preference for this state, correlated positively with the amplitude of the trial-averaged gamma response. Remarkably, this relationship persisted when states were inferred from resting-state recordings rather than the task's baseline. In summary, both within- and across-subject variability in stimulus-induced gamma activity can in part be explained by the ongoing network dynamics. Fast, pre-stimulus modulations of brain states account for differences between trials while stable, individual state preferences account for differences between subjects.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/381152v1?rss=1">Effects of depression on prefrontal striatal goal directed and habitual control</a></h4>

Depression is characterized by deficits in the reinforcement learning (RL) process. Although many computational and neural studies have extended our knowledge of the impact of depression on RL, most focus on habitual control (model free RL), yielding a relatively poor understanding of goal directed control (model based RL) and arbitration control to find a balance between the two. We investigate the effects of depression on goal directed and habitual control in the prefrontal striatal circuitry. We find that depression is associated with attenuated state and reward prediction error representation in the insula and caudate, a disruption of arbitration control in the predominantly inferior lateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar cortex, and suboptimal value action conversion. These findings fully characterize how depression influences different levels of RL, challenging previous conflicting views that depression simply influences either habitual or goal directed control. Our study creates possibilities for various clinical applications, such as early diagnosis and behavioral therapy design.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/381103v1?rss=1">How do dopamine neurons resolve a tradeoff between performance and energy?</a></h4>

The reinforcement learning (RL) theory accounts for the two types of dopamine activity patterns: phasic and ramping. However, we still lack an understanding of when and why dopamine activity transitions between the two modes. This study examines a theoretical possibility that dopamine neurons ramp up, though it is a physiologically demanding job, to distribute cognitive resources in both space and time, while they transition to an energy-efficient phasic firing mode to concentrate cognitive resources on learning reward-predicting cues. These results lend better insight into how animals find tradeoffs between task performance maximization and resource consumption minimization.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/381004v1?rss=1">Molecular Diversity of Intrinsically Photosensitive Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are rare mammalian photoreceptors essential for non-image-forming vision functions, such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. They comprise multiple subtypes distinguishable by morphology, physiology, projections, and levels of expression of melanopsin (Opn4), their photopigment. The molecular programs that differentiate ipRGCs from other ganglion cells and ipRGC subtypes from one another remain elusive. Here, we present comprehensive gene expression profiles of early postnatal and adult mouse ipRGCs purified from two lines of reporter mice marking different sets of ipRGC subtypes. We find dozens of novel genes highly enriched in ipRGCs. We reveal that Rasgrp1 and Tbx20 are selectively expressed in subsets of ipRGCs, though these molecularly defined groups imperfectly match established ipRGC subtypes. We demonstrate that the ipRGCs regulating circadian photoentrainment are unexpectedly diverse at the molecular level. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in gene expression patterns across mammalian ipRGC subtypes.

By studying different sources of temporal variability in central pattern generator circuits, in this paper we unveil distinct aspects of the instantaneous balance between flexibility and robustness in sequential dynamics -a property that characterizes many systems that display neural rhythms. The level of irregularity and coordination was characterized using intrinsic time references and intervals in long recordings of the pyloric central pattern generator. The analysis demonstrated strong robustness of transient dynamics in keeping not only the activation sequences but also specific cycle-by-cycle temporal relationships in the form of dynamical invariants. The rich dynamics of neurons and connections balance flexibility and coordination to readily negotiate the interactions between neurons and produce the resultant rhythm. In particular, two dynamical invariants were identified between time intervals that build the sequence, existing even outside steady states. We suggest that invariant temporal sequence relationships could be present in other networks, including those related to brain rhythms, and underlie rhythm programming and functionality.

The accuracy of machine learning tasks critically depends on high quality ground truth data. Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of the generated datasets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PSYkmktapmQ" width="1" />

<p>by Fredrik Allenmark, Hermann J. Müller, Zhuanghua Shi</p>

Many previous studies on visual search have reported inter-trial effects, that is, observers respond faster when some target property, such as a defining feature or dimension, or the response associated with the target repeats versus changes across consecutive trial episodes. However, what processes drive these inter-trial effects is still controversial. Here, we investigated this question using a combination of Bayesian modeling of belief updating and evidence accumulation modeling in perceptual decision-making. In three visual singleton (‘pop-out’) search experiments, we explored how the probability of the response-critical states of the search display (e.g., target presence/absence) and the repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension (color/ orientation) affect reaction time distributions. The results replicated the mean reaction time (RT) inter-trial and dimension repetition/switch effects that have been reported in previous studies. Going beyond this, to uncover the underlying mechanisms, we used the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) and the Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate (LATER) model to explain the RT distributions in terms of decision bias (starting point) and information processing speed (evidence accumulation rate). We further investigated how these different aspects of the decision-making process are affected by different properties of stimulus history, giving rise to dissociable inter-trial effects. We approached this question by (i) combining each perceptual decision making model (DDM or LATER) with different updating models, each specifying a plausible rule for updating of either the starting point or the rate, based on stimulus history, and (ii) comparing every possible combination of trial-wise updating mechanism and perceptual decision model in a factorial model comparison. Consistently across experiments, we found that the (recent) history of the response-critical property influences the initial decision bias, while repetition/switch of the target-defining dimension affects the accumulation rate, likely reflecting an implicit ‘top-down’ modulation process. This provides strong evidence of a disassociation between response- and dimension-based inter-trial effects.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0rQcDnT9JDA" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Circadian clocks modulate timing of sleep/wake cycles in animals; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, large ventral lateral neurons (l-LN<sub>v</sub>) are known to promote wakefulness through the action of the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), but the downstream targets of PDF signalling remain elusive. In a screen using down-regulation or over-expression of the gene encoding PDF receptor (<i>pdfr</i>), we found that a subset of dopaminergic neurons respond to PDF to promote wakefulness during the day. Moreover, we found that small LN<sub>v</sub> (s-LN<sub>v</sub>) and dopaminergic neurons form synaptic contacts, and PDFR signalling inhibited dopaminergic neurons specifically during day-time. We propose that these dopaminergic neurons that respond to PDFR signalling are sleep-promoting and that during the day when PDF levels are high, they are inhibited, thereby promoting wakefulness. Thus we identify a novel circadian clock pathway that mediates wake promotion specifically during daytime.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> It is well established that sleep is controlled by two major factors, the circadian clock as well as a sleep homeostat. Organisms need to remain awake during appropriate times of the day in order to engage in activities such as feeding and mating that increase their chances of survival. How wakefulness during the day is maintained remains unknown. Here, we show that circadian clock neurons direct their inhibitory peptidergic wake-promoting signal to dopamine neurons specifically during the day-time. Importantly, contact of dopamine neurons with known homeostatic structures established through previous studies, underlies an important pathway bridging together circadian and homeostatic neurons in sleep/wake regulation.</p>

Abstract<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has become a compelling global public health concern. Besides pathological hallmarks such as extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neurons and synapses, clinical reports have shown that epileptiform activity, even seizures, can occur early in the disease. Aberrant synaptic and network activities as well as epileptiform discharges have also been observed in various mouse models of AD. The new <i>App<sup>NL-F</sup></i> mouse model is generated by a gene knock-in approach and there are limited studies on basic synaptic properties in <i>App<sup>NL-F</sup></i> mice. Therefore, we applied quantitative methods to analyze spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in parietal cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. First, by an objective amplitude distribution analysis, we found decreased amplitudes of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in aged <i>App<sup>NL-F</sup></i> mice caused by a reduction in the amplitudes of the large sIPSCs with fast rates of rise, consistent with deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs). Second, we calculated the burstiness and memory in a series of successive synaptic events. Lastly, by using a novel approach to determine the excitation to inhibition (E/I) ratio, we found no changes in the <i>App<sup>NL-F</sup></i> mice, indicating that homeostatic mechanisms may have maintained the overall balance of excitation and inhibition in spite of a mildly impaired PV IN function.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Using novel quantitative analyses of spontaneous synaptic currents in L2/3 pyramidal cells, we revealed subtle deficits in the function of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV INs) in a new mouse model of AD, the <i>App<sup>NL-F</sup></i> mice.

Our approach provides rigorous quantitative tools for the analysis of synaptic events in mouse models of disease for objectively and reliably revealing even subtle disease-related alterations.</p>

Abstract<p>Using the rat conditioned gaping model of nausea, the interoceptive insular cortex (IIC) has been identified as a critical site for the regulation of lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced nausea. Indirect evidence supports a model where serotonin (5-HT) acts on post-synaptic 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors and its release is suppressed by elevating 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition to suppress nausea. Here we directly test the hypothesis that systemic LiCl elevates 5-HT in the IIC and this is prevented by pretreatments that reduce 5-HT release. Using male Sprague-Dawley rats, LiCl (but not saline), elevated 5-HT selectively in the IIC, for 20 min after LiCl administration (127.2 mg/kg, ip). Systemic pretreatment with the MAGL inhibitor, MJN110, prevented the LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Systemic cannabidiol (CBD), which reduces LiCl-induced nausea by acting at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> somatodendritic autoreceptors, also prevented LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Since 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor agonists delivered to the IIC produce nausea, we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that, the intra-IIC administration of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, ondansetron, but not MJN110, would prevent LiCl-induced conditioned gaping reactions produced by intra-IIC administration of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist, <i>m-</i>chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG). Finally, we demonstrate that exposure to a LiCl-paired flavor (but not a saline-paired flavor), produces elevated 5-HT release in the IIC, while rats display conditioned gaping reactions. These results confirm that LiCl-induced nausea is triggered by elevated 5-HT release in the IIC and is attenuated by treatments that reduce 5-HT availability in this region.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Understanding of the neurobiology of nausea has lagged behind that of the neurobiology of vomiting. Here we demonstrate for the first time that a nauseating drug produces an elevation of serotonin in the brain region that mediates nausea in humans, the interoceptive insular cortex (IIC). This elevated serotonin (and nausea) is prevented by pretreatment with a drug that elevates the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG), in this region. As well, pretreatment with the non-psychoactive cannabinoid, cannabidol, acts to reduce forebrain release of serotonin (and nausea) triggered by the nauseating drug. These results strongly suggest serotonin serves as a trigger to produce the sensation of nausea in the IIC and cannabinoids act to prevent this trigger to regulate nausea.</p>

Abstract<p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs throughout life and is believed to participate in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. A number of genes that regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been identified, though most of these have been implicated in progenitor proliferation and survival, but not on the development into fully differentiated neurons. Among these genes, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is particularly compelling because the human ApoE isoform, E4, is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease where hippocampal neurogenesis is reported to be dysfunctional. To investigate the effects of ApoE and its human isoforms on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal development, retroviruses carrying a GFP-expressing vector were injected into wildtype (WT), ApoE-deficient, and human targeted-replacement (ApoE3 and ApoE4) mice to infect progenitors in the dentate gyrus and analyze the morphology of fully developed GFP-expressing neurons. Analysis of these adult-born neurons revealed significant decreases in the complexity of dendritic arborizations and spine density in ApoE-deficient mice compared to wildtype, as well as in ApoE4 mice compared to ApoE3. These findings demonstrate that ApoE deficiency and the ApoE4 human isoform both impair hippocampal neurogenesis and give insight into how ApoE may influence hippocampal-related neurological diseases.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Apolipoprotein E is known to regulate postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus by directly affecting the proliferation of early progenitor cells. We found reduced complexity of adult-born granule cell dendritic arborizations as well as reduced spine density in ApoE-deficient and ApoE4 mice dentate gyrus neurons. These results provide strong evidence of impaired development of adult-born neurons in ApoE-deficient and ApoE4 mouse hippocampus, which may help explain the higher risk of hippocampal-related neuropsychiatric diseases in humans carrying the E4 allele.</p>

Abstract<p>β-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) is required for the production of β-amyloid (Aβ), one of the major pathogenic molecules of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and is therefore being actively pursued as a drug target for AD. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a lifelong process that is known to be important for learning and memory and may have the potential to regenerate damaged neural tissue. In this study, we examined whether BACE1 regulates AHN, which holds important implications for its suitability as a drug target in AD. Cohorts of 2-month-old wild-type (BACE1+/+), heterozygous, and homozygous BACE1 knockout mice (BACE1+/- and BACE1-/-, respectively) were injected with BrdU and sacrificed 1 day later to examine the impact of loss of BACE1 on neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation in the adult brain. Parallel cohorts of mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after BrdU injection to determine the effects of BACE1 on survival and differentiation of newborn NPCs. We found that NPC proliferation was increased in BACE1-/- mice compared to BACE1+/+ mice, while no difference was observed in NPC survival across genotypes. Differentiation of NPCs to neuronal lineage was impaired in BACE1-/- mice. However, no differences were observed in astrogenesis, in the proportion of immature neurons, or in the production of oligodendrocytes across genotypes. Importantly, corresponding with a decrease in neuronal differentiation in the absence of a complementary increase in an alternate cell fate, BACE1-/- mice were found to have a pool of undifferentiated NPCs in the hippocampus compared to BACE1+/+ and BACE1+/- mice.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The present findings not only demonstrate that BACE1 regulates AHN, but also raise a note of caution that therapeutic inhibition of its enzymatic activity might have potential to produce a pool of adult-generated undifferentiated cells in the hippocampus. Our data strongly suggest that the complete loss of BACE1 activity dysregulates AHN in the adult mouse hippocampus. Alternatively, partial inhibition of BACE1 activity, e.g. in BACE1± mice, may mirror a more suitable therapeutic approach that would not impact AHN or NPC differentiation, for when BACE1 inhibition is being pursued as an effective means of lowering Aβ levels in AD.</p>

Abstract<p>The mammalian visual system has a remarkable capacity to detect differences in contrast across time, known as temporal contrast sensitivity (TCS). Details of the underlying neural mechanisms are rapidly emerging as a result of a series of elegant electrophysiological studies performed largely with mouse as an experimental model. However rigorous psychophysical methods are necessary to pair the electrophysiology with temporal visual behavior in mouse. The optomotor response is frequently used as a proxy for retinal temporal processing in rodents. However, subcortical reflexive pathways drive the optomotor response rather than cortical and decision-making areas. To address this problem, we have developed an operant behavior assay that measures temporal contrast sensitivity in behaving mice. Mice were trained to perform a forced-choice visual task and tested daily their ability to distinguish flickering from non-flickering overhead lights. Correct responses (Hit and Correct Rejections) were rewarded. Contrast, temporal frequency and mean illumination of the flicker were the independent variables. We validated and applied the Theory of Signal Detection (TSD) to estimate the discriminability factor d’, a measure of performance that is independent of response bias and motivation. The empirical contrast threshold was defined as the contrast necessary to elicit a d’ = 1 and TCS as the inverse of the contrast threshold. With this approach we established in mouse a model of human vision that shares fundamental properties of human temporal psychophysics such as Weber adaptation in response to low temporal frequency flicker and illumination-dependent increases in Critical Flicker Frequency as predicted by Ferry-Porter’s Law.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Rigorous psychophysical methods are necessary to pair the power of mouse genetics and electrophysiological studies with temporal visual behavior using mouse as an experimental model. To address this problem, we have developed an operant behavior assay that measures TCS in mice. Our assay is based on a forced-choice alternative response protocol and applies the Theory of Signal Detection to generate an unbiased measure of sensitivity. With this approach, we measured TCS and established in mouse a model of human vision that shares fundamental properties of human temporal psychophysics. This finding fills in a major gap in our knowledge that is of general interest to the visual science community studying retinal and central visual processing using mouse as an experimental model.</p>

Abstract<p>Newborn granule cells are continuously produced in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus throughout life. Once these cells mature, they integrate into pre-existing circuits modulating hippocampus-dependent memory. Subsequently, mechanisms controlling generation and maturation of newborn cells are essential for proper hippocampal function. Therefore, we have studied the role of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated bHLH-PAS transcription factor, in hippocampus-dependent memory and granule neuronal morphology and function using genetic loss-of-function approaches based on constitutive and inducible-nestin AhR<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The results presented here show that the impaired hippocampus-dependent memory in AhR absence is not due to its effects on neurogenesis but to aberrant dendritic arborisation and to an increased spine density albeit with a lower number of mature mushrooms spines in newborn granule cells, a finding that is associated to an immature electrophysiological phenotype. Together, our data strongly suggest that AhR plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hippocampal function, by controlling hippocampal granule neuron morphology and synaptic maturation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Hippocampus-dependent memory depends on the generation and maturation of dentate gyrus (DG) newborn granule cells. Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated bHLH-PAS transcription factor recently implicated in dendrite branching in the CNS. Since its role in the modulation of dendrite branching and plasticity of adult hippocampal newborn granule neurons and subsequent impact on hippocampus-dependent memory remains unknown, we have undertaken its study using genetic loss-of-function approaches in adult mice. Our study provides evidence indicating that AhR is a regulator of dendrite arborisation and proper synaptic maturation of adult hippocampal newborn neurons and showing its critical role for learning and memory function. These findings point out AhR as a new potent druggable target for the treatment of several cognitive disorders.</p>

<p>Searching for a target object in a cluttered scene constitutes a fundamental
challenge in daily vision. Visual search must be selective enough to
discriminate the target from distractors, invariant to changes in the
appearance of the target, efficient to avoid exhaustive exploration of the
image, and must generalize to locate novel target objects with zero-shot
training. Previous work has focused on searching for perfect matches of a
target after extensive category-specific training. Here we show for the first
time that humans can efficiently and invariantly search for natural objects in
complex scenes. To gain insight into the mechanisms that guide visual search,
we propose a biologically inspired computational model that can locate targets
without exhaustive sampling and generalize to novel objects. The model provides
an approximation to the mechanisms integrating bottom-up and top-down signals
during search in natural scenes.

<p>The hypothesis considered here is that cognition is based on a small set of
systems-level computational primitives that are defined at a level higher than
single neurons. It is pointed out that for one such set of primitives, whose
quantitative effectiveness has been demonstrated by analysis and computer
simulation, emerging technologies for stimulation and recording are making it
possible to test directly whether cortex is capable of performing them.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37184">An alternative splicing switch in FLNB promotes the mesenchymal cell state in human breast cancer</a></h4>

Alternative splicing of mRNA precursors represents a key gene expression regulatory step and permits the generation of distinct protein products with diverse functions. In a genome-scale expression screen for inducers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we found a striking enrichment of RNA-binding proteins. We validated that QKI and RBFOX1 were necessary and sufficient to induce an intermediate mesenchymal cell state and increased tumorigenicity. Using RNA-seq and eCLIP analysis, we found that QKI and RBFOX1 coordinately regulated the splicing and function of the actin-binding protein FLNB, which plays a causal role in the regulation of EMT. Specifically, the skipping of FLNB exon 30 induced EMT by releasing the FOXC1 transcription factor. Moreover, skipping of FLNB exon 30 is strongly associated with EMT gene signatures in basal-like breast cancer patient samples. These observations identify a specific dysregulation of splicing, which regulates tumor cell plasticity and is frequently observed in human cancer.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36572">Differential expression of Lutheran/BCAM regulates biliary tissue remodeling in ductular reaction during liver regeneration</a></h4>

Under chronic or severe liver injury, liver progenitor cells (LPCs) of biliary origin are known to expand and contribute to the regeneration of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. This regeneration process is called ductular reaction (DR), which is accompanied by dynamic remodeling of biliary tissue. Although the DR shows apparently distinct mode of biliary extension depending on the type of liver injury, the key regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Lutheran (Lu)/Basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) regulates the morphogenesis of DR depending on liver disease models. Lu<sup>+</sup> and Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells isolated from injured liver exhibit opposite phenotypes in cell motility and duct formation capacities <i>in vitro</i>. By overexpression of Lu, Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells acquire the phenotype of Lu<sup>+</sup> biliary cells. Lu-deficient mice showed severe defects in DR. Our findings reveal a critical role of Lu in the control of phenotypic heterogeneity of DR in distinct liver disease models.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35755">Coalescing beneficial host and deleterious antiparasitic actions as an antischistosomal strategy</a></h4>

Conventional approaches for antiparasitic drug discovery center upon discovering selective agents that adversely impact parasites with minimal host side effects. Here, we show that agents with a broad polypharmacology, often considered 'dirtier' drugs, can have unique efficacy if they combine deleterious effects on the parasite with beneficial actions in the host. This principle is evidenced through a screen for drugs to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic flatworm disease that impacts over 230 million people. A target-based screen of a <i>Schistosoma</i> serotoninergic G protein coupled receptor yielded the potent agonist, ergotamine, which disrupted worm movement.<i> In vivo</i>, ergotamine decreased mortality, parasite load and intestinal egg counts but also uniquely reduced organ pathology through engagement of host GPCRs that repressed hepatic stellate cell activation, inflammatory damage and fibrosis. The unique ability of ergotamine to engage both host and parasite GPCRs evidences a future strategy for anthelmintic drug design that coalesces deleterious antiparasitic activity with beneficial host effects.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/380741v1?rss=1">Connectivity dynamics from wakefulness to sleep</a></h4>

Interest in time-resolved connectivity in fMRI has grown rapidly in recent years. The most widely used technique for studying connectivity changes over time utilizes a sliding windows approach. There has been some debate about the utility of shorter versus longer windows, the use of fixed versus adaptive windows, as well as whether observed resting state dynamics during wakefulness may be predominantly due to changes in sleep state and subject head motion. In this work we use an independent component analysis (ICA)-based pipeline applied to concurrent EEG/fMRI data collected during wakefulness and various sleep stages and show: 1) connectivity states obtained from clustering sliding windowed correlations of resting state functional network time courses well classify the sleep states obtained from EEG data, 2) using shorter sliding windows instead of longer non-overlapping windows improves the ability to capture transition dynamics even at windows as short as 30 seconds, 3) motion appears to be mostly associated with one of the states rather than spread across all of them 4) a fixed tapered sliding window approach outperforms an adaptive dynamic conditional correlation approach, and 5) consistent with prior EEG/fMRI work, we identify evidence of multiple states within the wakeful condition which are able to be classified with high accuracy. Classification of wakeful only states suggest the presence of time-varying changes in connectivity in fMRI data beyond sleep state or motion. Results also inform about advantageous technical choices, and the identification of different clusters within wakefulness that are separable suggest further studies in this direction.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/380659v1?rss=1">Exogenous attention facilitates performance through dissociable sensitivity and bias mechanisms</a></h4>

Selective attention enables prioritizing the most important information for differential sensory processing and decision-making. Here, we address an active debate regarding whether attention reflects a unitary phenomenon or involves the operation of dissociable sensory enhancement (perceptual sensitivity) and decisional gating (choice bias) processes. We developed a multialternative task in which participants detected and localized orientation changes in gratings at one of four spatial locations. Exogenous attention cues (high contrast flashes) preceded or followed the change events in close temporal proximity. Analysis of participants' behavior with a multidimensional signal detection model revealed markedly distinct effects of exogenous cueing on perceptual sensitivity and choice bias. Whereas sensitivity enhancement was localized to the stimulus proximal to the exogenous cue, bias enhancement occurred even for distal stimuli in the cued hemifield. Modulations of sensitivity and bias were uncorrelated at both cued and uncued locations. Finally, exogenous cueing produced reaction time benefits only at the cued location and costs only at locations contralateral to the cue. These disparate effects of exogenous cueing on sensitivity, bias and reaction times could be parsimoniously explained within the framework of a diffusion-decision model, in which the drift rate was determined by a linear combination of sensitivity and bias at each location. Exogenous cueing effects on sensitivity and bias differed systematically from previously reported effects of endogenous cueing. We propose that the search for shared neural substrates of exogenous and endogenous attention would benefit from investigating neural correlates of their component sensory and decisional mechanisms.

The quality of visual information that is available to an animal is limited by the size of its eyes. Differences in eye size can be observed even between closely related individuals but we understand little about how this affects visual quality. Insects are good models for exploring the effects of size on visual systems because many species exhibit size polymorphism, which modifies both the size and shape of their eyes. Previous work in this area has been limited, however, due to the challenge of determining the 3D structure of eyes. To address this, we have developed a novel method based on x-ray tomography to measure the 3D structure of insect eyes and calculate their visual capabilities. We investigated visual allometry in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and found that size affects specific aspects of visual quality including binocular overlap, optical sensitivity across the field of view, and visual resolution in the dorsofrontal visual field. This holistic study on eye allometry reveals that differential scaling between different eye areas provides substantial flexibility for larger bumblebees to have improved visual capabilities.

The proper staining of the plasma membrane (PM) is critical in bioimaging as it delimits the cell. Herein, we developed MemBright: a family of six cyanine-based fluorescent turn-on PM probes that emit from orange to near-infrared when reaching the PM, and enable homogeneous and selective PM staining with excellent contrast in mono and two-photon microscopy. These probes are compatible with long-term live cell imaging and immunostaining. Moreover, MemBright label neurons in a brighter manner than surrounding cells allowing identification of neurons in acute brain tissue section and neuromuscular-junctions without any use of transfection or transgenic animals. At last, MemBright were used in super-resolution imaging to unravel the dendritic spines neck. 3D multicolor dSTORM in combination with immunostaining revealed en-passant synapse displaying endogenous glutamate receptors clustered at the axonal-dendritic contact site. MemBright probes thus constitute a universal toolkit for cell biology and neuroscience biomembrane imaging with a variety of microscopy techniques.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/380402v1?rss=1">Brain dynamics and temporal trajectories during task and naturalistic processing</a></h4>

Human functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data are acquired while participants engage in diverse perceptual, motor, cognitive, and emotional tasks. Although data are acquired temporally, they are most often treated in a quasi-static manner. Yet, a fuller understanding of the mechanisms that support mental functions necessitates the characterization of dynamic properties. Here, we describe an approach employing a class of recurrent neural networks called reservoir computing, and show the feasibility and potential of using it for the analysis of temporal properties of brain data. We show that reservoirs can be used effectively both for classification and for characterizing lower-dimensional "trajectories" of temporal data. Classification accuracy was approximately 85% for short clips of "social interactions" and above 70% for clips extracted from movie segments. Data representations with 10 or fewer dimensions (from an original space with over 300) attained classification accuracy within 5% of the full data. We hypothesize that such low-dimensional trajectories may provide "signatures" that can be associated with tasks and/or mental states. The approach was applied across participants (that is, training in one set of participants, and testing in a separate group), showing that representations generalized well to unseen participants. Taken together, we believe the present approach provides a promising framework to characterize dynamic fMRI information during both tasks and naturalistic conditions.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates the function of many ion channels, including M-type (KCNQ, Kv7) K+ channels; however the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. To resolve this issue for M-channels, we focused on the KCNQ3 subtype that has the highest apparent affinity of PIP2 and performed extensive mutagenesis in regions suggested to be involved in PIP2 interactions among the KCNQ family. Using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) voltage-sensitive phosphatase to deplete PIP2 as a probe, we found that PIP2 modulates KCNQ3 channels through four different domains: 1) the A-B helix linker that we previously identified as important for both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, 2) the junction between S6 and the A helix, 3) the S2-S3 linker and 4) the S4-S5 linker. We found that PIP2 interactions within none of these domains were coupled to the voltage dependence of activation. Extensive homology modeling and docking simulations between the wild-type or mutant KCNQ3 channels and PIP2 correlated with the experimental data. Our results indicate that PIP2 modulates KCNQ3 channel function by interacting synergistically with a minimum of four cytoplasmic domains.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/380162v1?rss=1">Predicting Individual Psychotic Experiences on a Continuum Using Machine Learning</a></h4>

Previous studies of psychosis using machine learning methods have primarily been concerned with binary classification of patients and healthy controls. The aim of this study was to use electroencephalographic (EEG) data and pattern recognition to predict individual psychotic experiences on a continuum between these two extremes in otherwise healthy people. From responses evoked by an auditory oddball paradigm, behavioural measures, neural activity, and effective connectivity were extracted as potential contributing features. Optimal performance was achieved using spatiotemporal maps of neural activity in response to frequent sounds, with late-P50 and early-N100 time windows contributing most to higher schizotypy scores. Effective connectivity estimates, in particular top-down frontotemporal connections, were also predictive of psychotic symptoms. As a proof-of-concept, these findings demonstrate that individual psychotic experiences in healthy people can be predicted from EEG data alone, whilst also supporting the idea of altered sensory responses and the dysconnection hypothesis in schizophrenia, as well as the notion that psychosis may exist on a continuum.

The recent availability of comprehensive, brain-wide gene expression atlases such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) has opened new opportunities for understanding how spatial variations on the molecular scale relate to the macroscopic neuroimaging phenotypes. A rapidly growing body of literature is demonstrating relationships between gene expression and diverse properties of brain structure and function, but approaches for combining expression atlas data with neuroimaging are highly inconsistent, with substantial variations in how the expression data are processed. The degree to which these methodological variations affect findings is unclear. Here, we outline a seven-step analysis pipeline for relating brain-wide transcriptomic and neuroimaging data and compare how different processing choices influence the resulting data. We suggest that studies using AHBA should work towards a unified data processing pipeline to ensure consistent and reproducible results in this burgeoning field.

The connectivity and information pathways of visual cortex are well studied, as are observed physiological phenomena, yet a cohesive model for explaining visual cortex processes remains an open problem. For a comprehensive understanding, we need to build models of the visual cortex that are capable of robust real-world performance, while also being able to explain psychophysical and physiological observations. To this end, we demonstrate how the Recursive Cortical Network (George et al., 2017) can be used as a computational model to reproduce and explain subjective contours, neon color spreading, occlusion vs. deletion, and the border-ownership competition phenomena observed in the visual cortex.

We present a comparative analysis of cerebral size and neocortical folding. Magnetic resonance imaging data was collected from 54 individuals belonging to 33 different primate species. We measured several neocortical folding parameters and studied their evolution using phylogenetic comparative methods. Our results suggest that the most likely model is one where phenotypical differences vary randomly through evolution (the Brownian Motion model). We present estimations of the ancestral primate phenotypes as well as estimations of the rates of phenotypic change.

<p>by Ida Friis, Ilia A. Solov’yov</p>

The non-homologous end joining of a DNA double strand break is initiated by the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 complex whose subunits are the first three proteins to arrive to the breakage site thereby making the recruitment time of MRE11, NBS1 and RAD50 essential for cell survival. In the present investigation, the nature of MRE11 and NBS1 transportation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, hosting the damaged DNA strand, is hypothesized to be a passive diffusive process. The feasibility of such a mechanism is addressed through theoretical and computational approaches which permit establishing the characteristic recruitment time of MRE11 and NBS1 by the nucleus. A computational model of a cell is constructed from a set of biological parameters and the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm is used to simulate the diffusing MRE11 and NBS1 particles as a random walk process. To accurately describe the experimented data, it is discovered that MRE11 and NBS1 should start diffusion from significantly different starting positions which suggests that diffusion might not be the only transport mechanism of repair protein recruitment to the DNA break.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Goom-28bvCg" width="1" />

<p>by Luigi Acerbi, Kalpana Dokka, Dora E. Angelaki, Wei Ji Ma</p>

The precision of multisensory perception improves when cues arising from the same cause are integrated, such as visual and vestibular heading cues for an observer moving through a stationary environment. In order to determine how the cues should be processed, the brain must infer the causal relationship underlying the multisensory cues. In heading perception, however, it is unclear whether observers follow the Bayesian strategy, a simpler non-Bayesian heuristic, or even perform causal inference at all. We developed an efficient and robust computational framework to perform Bayesian model comparison of causal inference strategies, which incorporates a number of alternative assumptions about the observers. With this framework, we investigated whether human observers’ performance in an <i>explicit</i> cause attribution and an <i>implicit</i> heading discrimination task can be modeled as a causal inference process. In the explicit causal inference task, all subjects accounted for cue disparity when reporting judgments of common cause, although not necessarily all in a Bayesian fashion. By contrast, but in agreement with previous findings, data from the heading discrimination task only could not rule out that several of the same observers were adopting a forced-fusion strategy, whereby cues are integrated regardless of disparity. Only when we combined evidence from both tasks we were able to rule out forced-fusion in the heading discrimination task. Crucially, findings were robust across a number of variants of models and analyses. Our results demonstrate that our proposed computational framework allows researchers to ask complex questions within a rigorous Bayesian framework that accounts for parameter and model uncertainty.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZGcPnbf7Gpw" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: February 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54</p><p>Author(s): Aparna Suvrathan</p><div><p>Synaptic plasticity, induced by the close temporal association of two neural signals, supports associative forms of learning. However, the millisecond timescales for association often do not match the much longer delays for behaviorally relevant signals that supervise learning. In particular, information about the behavioral outcome of neural activity can be delayed, leading to a problem of temporal credit assignment. Recent studies suggest that synaptic plasticity can have temporal rules that not only accommodate the delays relevant to the circuit, but also be precisely tuned to the behavior the circuit supports. These discoveries highlight the diversity of plasticity rules, whose temporal requirements may depend on circuit delays and the contingencies of behavior.</p></div>

Abstract<p>Alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) have been considered to reflect microstructural white matter changes in disease conditions, however no study to date has examined white matter changes using diffusion tensor imaging in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of the present study was two-fold: 1) to determine whether differences in FA, and other non-FA metrics, were present in adolescents with IBS compared to healthy controls using a whole-brain analysis and a ROI-restricted tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and canonical ROI-based DTI analysis for the cingulum bundle, and 2) to determine if these metrics were related to clinical measures of disease duration and pain intensity in the IBS group. A total of 16 adolescents with a ROME III diagnosis of IBS (females = 12; mean age = 16.29, age range: 11.96-18.5 yrs) and 16 age- and gender-matched controls (females = 12; mean age = 16.24; age range: 11.71-20.32 yrs) participated in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a Siemens 3-T Trio Tim Syngo MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. The ROI-restricted TBSS and canonical ROI-based DTI analyses revealed that adolescents with IBS showed decreased FA in the right dorsal cingulum bundle compared to controls. No relationship between FA and disease severity measures was found. Microstructural white matter alterations in the right dorsal cingulum bundle in adolescents with IBS may reflect the emergence of a premorbid brain state or a disease-driven process that results from complex changes in pain- and affect-related processing via spinothalamic and corticolimbic pathways.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In the present study we observed white matter abnormalities indexed by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right dorsal cingulum in adolescents with IBS compared to a healthy cohort. However, this decrease in white matter FA was not related to disease severity measures. These findings represent the first report of white matter brain changes in an adolescent population with IBS.</p>

<p>Background: We sought to determine if ripple oscillations (80-120Hz),
detected in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of epilepsy patients, correlate
with an enhancement or disruption of verbal episodic memory encoding. Methods:
We defined ripple and spike events in depth iEEG recordings during list
learning in 107 patients with focal epilepsy. We used logistic regression
models (LRMs) to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of ripple
and spike events during word presentation and the odds of successful word
recall following a distractor epoch, and included the seizure onset zone (SOZ)
as a covariate in the LRMs. Results: We detected events during 58,312 word
presentation trials from 7,630 unique electrode sites. The probability of
ripple on spike (RonS) events was increased in the seizure onset zone (SOZ,
p&lt;0.04). In the left temporal neocortex RonS events during word presentation
corresponded with a decrease in the odds ratio (OR) of successful recall,
however this effect only met significance in the SOZ (OR of word recall 0.71,
95% CI: 0.59-0.85, n=158 events, adaptive Hochberg p&lt;0.01). Ripple on
oscillation events (RonO) that occurred in the left temporal neocortex non-SOZ
also correlated with decreased odds of successful recall (OR 0.52, 95% CI:
0.34-0.80, n=140, adaptive Hochberg , p&lt;0.01). Spikes and RonS that occurred
during word presentation in the left middle temporal gyrus during word
presentation correlated with the most significant decrease in the odds of
successful recall, irrespective of the location of the SOZ (adaptive Hochberg,
p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: Ripples and spikes generated in left temporal neocortex
are associated with impaired verbal episodic memory encoding.

(arXiv:1807.10137v1 [q-bio.SC])</a></h4>

<p>Micromanipulations, perfusions and measurements performed using glass
microelectrodes filled with an electrolyte is a conventional technique for
experimental morphological and membrane electrophysiological studies at a
single cell and membrane surface level. The typical (effective) diameter of the
end of the glass microelectrode is from 500 up to less than 100 nm, which
prevents one from observing it using a standard optical microscope in
accordance with the optical resolution criteria, since the diameter less than
500 nm is indistinguishable within the interference zone. Microprocessor
programming of the puller (microforge) that provides pulling and tearing allows
to obtain in certain regimes the adjusted diameter and shape of the
micropipette tip, although this result is not fully controlled due to the above
limitations. In this connection it is necessary to design the control devices
for the micropipette tips both at the preparation and operation stages
(intracellular or extracellular insertion). This method also should provide
visualization of the processes occurring upon interaction of the microelectrode
tip with the cell in real time, depending on the electrode type and state,
which allows to level the artifacts arising with the systematic error frequency
from the uncontrolled operation of the micropipette tip after different ways of
the microelectrode filling with the electrolyte. We propose an installation
scheme that solves the above problems by means of introducing an
interferometric device for microscopic control of the microelectrode and
micromanipulator or microperfusor, for the first time for a given type of
optical instruments combined with the interferometric optical scheme.

<p>This is a continuation of a recent study on the modeling of the information
coding in sensory system in the brain. The data from a sensory neurons are
available as discrete spike timings with no amplitude information. In the
simulations, these are generated from a data generator model which has certain
differences from the model being estimated. The model under consideration is
simpler than the one used as a data generator as it has no sigmoidal gain
function parameters. This choice is based on a suggestion from a recent study
which states that inclusion of gain functions to the estimation algorithm
increases issues such as parameter confounding which leads to performance
degradation issues like increased or unpredictable variance changes with
different stimuli configurations. To resolve this issue we consider a more
generic model that has no sigmoidal gain functions to be estimated. Like that
of the first research, we applied a Fourier series stimulus to both data
generator and the estimated network. In order to test the performance of the
proposed scheme, we have repeated the simulations with different sample sizes,
stimulus component counts, amplitude and base frequencies. Mean values of
estimation are presented as tables and the statistical analysis results are
presented in graphical forms. In addition, since we do not have any true
parameter data (for the estimated model) we compare the firing rate responses
of both data generator and estimated models to different stimuli. It appeared
that the responses of both models are almost the same.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36523">Focal optogenetic suppression in macaque area MT biases direction discrimination and decision confidence, but only transiently</a></h4>

Insights from causal manipulations of brain activity depend on targeting the spatial and temporal scales most relevant for behavior. Using a sensitive perceptual decision task in monkeys, we examined the effects of rapid, reversible inactivation on a spatial scale previously achieved only with electrical microstimulation. Inactivating neurons in area MT with consistent direction tuning produced systematic effects on choice and confidence. Behavioral effects were attenuated over the course of each session, suggesting compensatory adjustments in the downstream readout of MT over tens of minutes. Compensation also occurred on a sub-second time scale: behavior was largely unaffected when the visual stimulus (and concurrent suppression) lasted longer than 350 ms. These trends were similar for choice and confidence, consistent with the idea of a common mechanism underlying both measures. The findings demonstrate the utility of hyperpolarizing opsins for linking neural population activity at fine spatial and temporal scales to cognitive functions in primates.

Genome-wide screens in <i>Drosophila</i> cells have offered numerous insights into gene function, yet a major limitation has been the inability to stably deliver large multiplexed DNA libraries to cultured cells allowing barcoded pooled screens. Here, we developed a site-specific integration strategy for library delivery and performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in <i>Drosophila</i> S2R+ cells. Under basal growth conditions, 1235 genes were essential for cell fitness at a false-discovery rate of 5%, representing the highest-resolution fitness gene set yet assembled for <i>Drosophila</i>, including 407 genes which likely duplicated along the vertebrate lineage and whose orthologs were underrepresented in human CRISPR screens. We additionally performed context-specific fitness screens for resistance to or synergy with trametinib, a Ras/ERK/ETS inhibitor, or rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, and identified key regulators of each pathway. The results present a novel, scalable, and versatile platform for functional genomic screens in invertebrate cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35927"><i>Npas4</i> recruits CCK basket cell synapses and enhances cannabinoid-sensitive inhibition in the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

Experience-dependent expression of immediate-early gene transcription factors (IEG-TFs) can transiently change the transcriptome of active neurons and initiate persistent changes in cellular function. However, the impact of IEG-TFs on circuit connectivity and function is poorly understood. We investigate the specificity with which the IEG-TF NPAS4 governs experience-dependent changes in inhibitory synaptic input onto CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs). We show that novel sensory experience selectively enhances somatic inhibition mediated by cholecystokinin-expressing basket cells (CCKBCs) in an NPAS4-dependent manner. NPAS4 specifically increases the number of synapses made onto PNs by individual CCKBCs without altering synaptic properties. Additionally, we find that sensory experience-driven NPAS4 expression enhances depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a short-term form of cannabinoid-mediated plasticity expressed at CCKBC synapses. Our results indicate that CCKBC inputs are a major target of the NPAS4-dependent transcriptional program in PNs and that NPAS4 is an important regulator of plasticity mediated by endogenous cannabinoids.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key structure implicated in the regulation of cognitive control (CC). Previous studies suggest that variability in the ACC sulcal pattern—a neurodevelopmental marker unaffected by maturation or plasticity after birth—is associated with intersubject differences in CC performance. Here, we investigated whether bilingual experience modulates the effects of ACC sulcal variability on CC performance across the lifespan. Using structural MRI, we first established the distribution of the ACC sulcal patterns in a large sample of healthy individuals (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 270) differing on gender and ethnicity. Second, a participants’ subsample (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 157) was selected to test whether CC performance was differentially affected by ACC sulcation in bilinguals and monolinguals across age. A prevalent leftward asymmetry unaffected by gender or ethnicity was reported. Sulcal variability in the ACC predicted CC performance differently in bilinguals and monolinguals, with a reversed pattern of structure–function relationship: asymmetrical versus symmetrical ACC sulcal patterns were associated with a performance advantage in monolinguals and a performance detriment to bilinguals and vice versa. Altogether, these findings provide novel insights on the dynamic interplay between early neurodevelopment, environmental background and cognitive efficiency across age.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Oscillations in the hippocampal network during sleep are proposed to play a role in memory storage by patterning neuronal ensemble activity. Here we show that following single-trial fear learning, sleep deprivation (which impairs memory consolidation) disrupts coherent firing rhythms in hippocampal area CA1. State-targeted optogenetic inhibition of CA1 parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons during postlearning NREM sleep, but not REM sleep or wake, disrupts contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation in a manner similar to sleep deprivation. NREM-targeted inhibition disrupts CA1 network oscillations which predict successful memory storage. Rhythmic optogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons following learning generates CA1 oscillations with coherent principal neuron firing. This patterning of CA1 activity rescues CFM consolidation in sleep-deprived mice. Critically, behavioral and optogenetic manipulations that disrupt CFM also disrupt learning-induced stabilization of CA1 ensembles’ communication patterns in the hours following learning. Conversely, manipulations that promote CFM also promote long-term stability of CA1 communication patterns. We conclude that sleep promotes memory consolidation by generating coherent rhythms of CA1 network activity, which provide consistent communication patterns within neuronal ensembles. Most importantly, we show that this rhythmic patterning of activity is sufficient to promote long-term memory storage in the absence of sleep.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>After spinal cord injury (SCI), the motor-related cortical areas can be a potential substrate for functional recovery in addition to the spinal cord. However, a dynamic description of how motor cortical circuits reorganize after SCI is lacking. Here, we captured the comprehensive dynamics of motor networks across SCI in a nonhuman primate model. Using electrocorticography over the sensorimotor areas in monkeys, we collected broadband neuronal signals during a reaching-and-grasping task at different stages of recovery of dexterous finger movements after a partial SCI at the cervical levels. We identified two distinct network dynamics: grasping-related intrahemispheric interactions from the contralesional premotor cortex (PM) to the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) in the high-γ band (&gt;70 Hz), and motor-preparation-related interhemispheric interactions from the contralesional to ipsilesional PM in the α and low-β bands (10–15 Hz). The strengths of these networks correlated to the time course of behavioral recovery. The grasping-related network showed enhanced activation immediately after the injury, but gradually returned to normal while the strength of the motor-preparation-related network gradually increased. Our findings suggest a cortical compensatory mechanism after SCI, where two interdependent motor networks redirect activity from the contralesional hemisphere to the other hemisphere to facilitate functional recovery.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent reading research implicates executive control regions as sites of difference in struggling readers. However, as studies often employ only reading or language tasks, the extent of deviation in control engagement in children with reading difficulties is not known. The current study investigated activation in reading and executive control brain regions during both a sentence comprehension task and a nonlexical inhibitory control task in third–fifth grade children with and without reading difficulties. We employed both categorical (group-based) and individual difference approaches to relate reading ability to brain activity. During sentence comprehension, struggling readers had less activation in the left posterior temporal cortex, previously implicated in language, semantic, and reading research. Greater negative activity (relative to fixation) during sentence comprehension in a left inferior parietal region from the executive control literature correlated with poorer reading ability. Greater comprehension scores were associated with less dorsal anterior cingulate activity during the sentence comprehension task. Unlike the sentence task, there were no significant differences between struggling and nonstruggling readers for the nonlexical inhibitory control task. Thus, differences in executive control engagement were largely specific to reading, rather than a general control deficit across tasks in children with reading difficulties, informing future intervention research.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Whisker-guided decision making in mice is thought to critically depend on
information processing occurring in the primary somatosensory cortex. However,
it is not clear if neuronal activity in this “early”
sensory region contains information about the timing and speed of motor
response. To address this question we designed a new task in which freely moving
mice learned to associate a whisker stimulus to reward delivery. The task was
tailored in such a way that a wide range of delays between whisker stimulation
and reward collection were observed due to differences of motivation and
perception. After training, mice were anesthetized and neuronal responses evoked
by stimulating trained and untrained whiskers were recorded across several
cortical columns of barrel cortex. We found a strong correlation between the
delay of the mouse behavioral response and the timing of multiunit activity
evoked by the trained whisker, outside its principal cortical column, in layers
4 and 5A but not in layer 2/3. Circuit mapping ex vivo revealed this effect was
associated with a weakening of layer 4 to layer 2/3 projection. We conclude that
the processes controlling the propagation of key sensory inputs to naive
cortical columns and the timing of sensory-guided action are linked.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>While matched crossmodal information is known to facilitate object recognition, it is unclear how our perceptual systems encode the more gradual congruency variations that occur in our natural environment. Combining visual objects with odor mixtures to create a gradual increase in semantic object overlap, we demonstrate high behavioral acuity to linear variations of olfactory–visual overlap in a healthy adult population. This effect was paralleled by a linear increase in cortical activation at the intersection of occipital fusiform and lingual gyri, indicating linear encoding of crossmodal semantic overlap in visual object recognition networks. Effective connectivity analyses revealed that this integration of olfactory and visual information was achieved by direct information exchange between olfactory and visual areas. In addition, a parallel pathway through the superior frontal gyrus was increasingly recruited towards the most ambiguous stimuli. These findings demonstrate that cortical structures involved in object formation are inherently crossmodal and encode sensory overlap in a linear manner. The results further demonstrate that prefrontal control of these processes is likely required for ambiguous stimulus combinations, a fact of high ecological relevance that may be inappropriately captured by common task designs juxtaposing congruency and incongruency.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A frequently repeated finding is that the default mode network (DMN) shows activation decreases during externally focused tasks. This finding has led to an emphasis in DMN research on internally focused self-relevant thought processes. A recent study, in contrast, implicates the DMN in substantial externally focused task switches. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 24 participants performing a task switch experiment. Whilst replicating previous DMN task switch effects, we also found large DMN increases for brief rests as well as task restarts after rest. Our findings are difficult to explain using theories strictly linked to internal or self-directed cognition. In line with principal results from the literature, we suggest that the DMN encodes scene, episode or context, by integrating spatial, self-referential, and temporal information. Context representations are strong at rest, but rereference to context also occurs at major cognitive transitions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Preparing for a challenging task can increase physiological arousal, in particular when potential incentives are large (e.g., a solo musical performance in front of an audience). Here, we examine how potential reward and its influence on arousal, measured by pupil dynamics, are represented in the brain while preparing for a challenging task. We further ask how neural representations during preparation relate to actual performance. Trials resulting in performance failure were characterized by increased pupil dilation as a function of increasing reward magnitude during preparation. Such failure trials were also associated with activation of the right amygdala representing pupil dilation, and the left caudate representing reward magnitude. Notably, increases in functional connectivity between amygdala and caudate preceded performance failure. These findings highlight increased connectivity between neural regions representing reward and arousal in circumstances where reward-driven arousal impairs performance.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is thought to encode and represent the number of objects in a visual scene (i.e., numerosity). Whether this representation is shared for simultaneous and sequential stimuli (i.e., mode independency) is debated. We tested the existence of a common neural substrate for the encoding of these modes using fMRI. While both modes elicited overlapping BOLD response in occipital areas, only simultaneous numerosities significantly activated PPC. Unique activation for sequential numerosities was found in bilateral temporal areas. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed numerosity selectivity in PPC only for simultaneous numerosities and revealed differential encoding of presentation modes. Voxel-wise numerosity tuning functions for simultaneous numerosities in occipital and parietal ROIs revealed increasing numerosity selectivity along an occipito-to-parietal gradient. Our results suggest that the parietal cortex is involved in the extraction of spatial but not temporal numerosity and question the idea of commonly used cortical circuits for a mode-independent numerosity representation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Despite decades of science investigating the neural underpinnings of episodic memory retrieval, a critical question remains: how does stress influence remembering and the neural mechanisms of recollection in humans? Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analyses to examine the effects of acute stress during retrieval. We report that stress reduced the probability of recollecting the details of past experience, and that this impairment was driven, in part, by a disruption of the relationship between hippocampal activation, cortical reinstatement, and memory performance. Moreover, even memories expressed with high confidence were less accurate under stress, and this stress-induced decline in accuracy was explained by reduced posterior hippocampal engagement despite similar levels of category-level cortical reinstatement. Finally, stress degraded the relationship between the engagement of frontoparietal control networks and retrieval decision uncertainty. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the widespread consequences of acute stress on the neural systems of remembering.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Mitochondria play a key role in energy production and calcium buffering, among many other functions. They provide most of the energy required by neurons, and they are transported along axons and dendrites to the regions of higher energy demands. We have used focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) to obtain stacks of serial sections from the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat. We have estimated the volume fraction occupied by mitochondria and their distribution between dendritic, axonal, and nonsynaptic processes. The volume fraction of mitochondria increased from layer I (4.59%) to reach its maximum in layer IV (7.74%) and decreased to its minimum in layer VI (4.03%). On average, 44% of mitochondrial volume was located in dendrites, 15% in axons and 41% in nonsynaptic elements. Given that dendrites, axons, and nonsynaptic elements occupied 38%, 23%, and 39% of the neuropil, respectively, it can be concluded that dendrites are proportionally richer in mitochondria with respect to axons, supporting the notion that most energy consumption takes place at the postsynaptic side. We also found a positive correlation between the volume fraction of mitochondria located in neuronal processes and the density of synapses.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The Ras-MAPK pathway has an established role in neural development and synaptic signaling. Mutations in this pathway are associated with a collection of neurodevelopmental syndromes, Rasopathies; among these, Noonan syndrome (NS) is the most common (1:2000). Prior research has focused on identifying genetic mutations and cellular mechanisms of the disorder, however, effects of NS on the human brain remain unknown. Here, imaging and cognitive data were collected from 12 children with <span style="font-style: italic;">PTPN11</span>-related NS, ages 4.0–11.0 years (8.98 ± 2.33) and 12 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (8.79 ± 2.17). We observe reduced gray matter volume in bilateral corpus striatum (Cohen’s <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span> = −1.0:−1.3), reduced surface area in temporal regions (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span> = −1.8:−2.2), increased cortical thickness in frontal regions (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span> = 1.2–1.3), and reduced cortical thickness in limbic regions (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span> = −1.6), including limbic structures integral to the circuitry of the hippocampus. Further, we find high levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and memory deficits in children with NS. Taken together, these results identify effects of NS on specific brain regions associated with ADHD and learning in children. While our research lays the groundwork for elucidating the neural and behavioral mechanisms of NS, it also adds an essential tier to understanding the Ras-MAPK pathway’s role in human brain development.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical plasticity in congenitally blind individuals leads to cross-modal activation of the visual cortex and may lead to superior perceptual processing in the intact sensory domains. Although mental imagery is often defined as a quasi-perceptual experience, it is unknown whether it follows similar cortical reorganization as perception in blind individuals. In this study, we show that auditory versus tactile perception evokes similar intra-modal discriminative patterns in congenitally blind compared with sighted participants. These results indicate that cortical plasticity following visual deprivation does not influence broad intra-modal organization of auditory and tactile perception as measured by our task. Furthermore, not only the blind, but also the sighted participants showed cross-modal discriminative patterns for perception modality in the visual cortex. During mental imagery, both groups showed similar decoding accuracies for imagery modality in the intra-modal primary sensory cortices. However, no cross-modal discriminative information for imagery modality was found in early visual cortex of blind participants, in contrast to the sighted participants. We did find evidence of cross-modal activation of higher visual areas in blind participants, including the representation of specific-imagined auditory features in visual area V4.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sensory processing relies on fast detection of changes in environment, as well as integration of contextual cues over time. The mechanisms by which local circuits of the cerebral cortex simultaneously perform these opposite processes remain obscure. Thalamic “specific” nuclei relay sensory information, whereas “nonspecific” nuclei convey information on the environmental and behavioral contexts. We expressed channelrhodopsin in the ventrobasal specific (sensory) or the rhomboid nonspecific (contextual) thalamic nuclei. By selectively activating each thalamic pathway, we found that nonspecific inputs powerfully activate adapting (slow-responding) interneurons but weakly connect fast-spiking interneurons, whereas specific inputs exhibit opposite interneuron preference. Specific inputs thereby induce rapid feedforward inhibition that limits response duration, whereas, in the same cortical area, nonspecific inputs elicit delayed feedforward inhibition that enables lasting recurrent excitation. Using a mean field model, we confirm that cortical response dynamics depends on the type of interneuron targeted by thalamocortical inputs and show that efficient recruitment of adapting interneurons prolongs the cortical response and allows the summation of sensory and contextual inputs. Hence, target choice between slow- and fast-responding inhibitory neurons endows cortical networks with a simple computational solution to perform both sensory detection and integration.</span>

Integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to fully characterize the cause-effect structure of a physical system. Here, we introduce <i>PyPhi</i>, a Python software package that implements this framework for causal analysis and unfolds the full cause-effect structure of discrete dynamical systems of binary elements. The software allows users to easily study these structures, serves as an up-to-date reference implementation of the formalisms of integrated information theory, and has been applied in research on complexity, emergence, and certain biological questions. We first provide an overview of the main algorithm and demonstrate PyPhi’s functionality in the course of analyzing an example system, and then describe details of the algorithm’s design and implementation. PyPhi can be installed with Python’s package manager via the command ‘pip install pyphi’ on Linux and macOS systems equipped with Python 3.4 or higher. PyPhi is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3; the source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi. Comprehensive and continually-updated documentation is available at https://pyphi.readthedocs.io. The pyphi-users mailing list can be joined at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyphi-users. A web-based graphical interface to the software is available at http://integratedinformationtheory.org/calculate.html.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/E2D_ME0roU4" width="1" />

<p>by Edvin Fuglebakk, Nathalie Reuter</p>

With remarkable spatial and temporal specificities, peripheral membrane proteins bind to biological membranes. They do this without compromising solubility of the protein, and their binding sites are not easily distinguished. Prototypical peripheral membrane binding sites display a combination of patches of basic and hydrophobic amino acids that are also frequently present on other protein surfaces. The purpose of this contribution is to identify simple but essential components for membrane binding, through structural criteria that distinguish exposed hydrophobes at membrane binding sites from those that are frequently found on any protein surface. We formulate the concepts of <i>protruding hydrophobes</i> and <i>co-insertability</i> and have analysed more than 300 families of proteins that are classified as peripheral membrane binders. We find that this structural motif strongly discriminates the surfaces of membrane-binding and non-binding proteins. Our model constitutes a novel formulation of a structural pattern for membrane recognition and emphasizes the importance of subtle structural properties of hydrophobic membrane binding sites.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2OkhnFitdjc" width="1" />

Movement is fundamental to human and animal life, emerging through interaction of complex neural, muscular, and skeletal systems. Study of movement draws from and contributes to diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, mechanics, and robotics. OpenSim unites methods from these fields to create fast and accurate simulations of movement, enabling two fundamental tasks. First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human–device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis. OpenSim is an extensible and user-friendly software package built on decades of knowledge about computational modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems. OpenSim’s design enables computational scientists to create new state-of-the-art software tools and empowers others to use these tools in research and clinical applications. OpenSim supports a large and growing community of biomechanics and rehabilitation researchers, facilitating exchange of models and simulations for reproducing and extending discoveries. Examples, tutorials, documentation, and an active user forum support this community. The OpenSim software is covered by the Apache License 2.0, which permits its use for any purpose including both nonprofit and commercial applications. The source code is freely and anonymously accessible on GitHub, where the community is welcomed to make contributions.

Abstract<p>Noise exposure is one of the most common causes of hearing loss and peripheral damage to the auditory system. A growing literature suggests that the auditory system can compensate for peripheral loss through increased central neural activity. The current study sought to investigate the link between noise exposure, increases in central gain, synaptic reorganization, and auditory function. All axons of the auditory nerve project to the cochlear nucleus, making it a requisite nucleus for sound detection. As the first synapse in the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus is well-positioned to respond plastically to loss of peripheral input. To investigate noise-induced compensation in the central auditory system, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), auditory perception, and collected tissue from mice exposed to broadband noise. Noise-exposed mice showed elevated ABR thresholds, reduced ABR wave 1 amplitudes, and spiral ganglion neuron loss. Despite peripheral damage, noise-exposed mice were hyper-reactive to loud sounds and showed nearly normal behavioral sound detection thresholds. Ratios of late ABR peaks (2-4) relative to the first ABR peak indicated that brainstem pathways were hyperactive in noise-exposed mice, while anatomical analysis indicated there was an imbalance between expression of excitatory and inhibitory proteins in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The results of the current study suggest that a reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus may drive hyperactivity in the central auditory system. This increase in central gain can compensate for peripheral loss to restore some aspects of auditory function.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Noise exposure can cause significant damage to the peripheral auditory system. Previous work has shown that the dorsal cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, auditory thalamus, and auditory cortex become hyperactive following damage to the peripheral auditory system, which may compensate for decreased sensory input. Here we show that after noise exposure, hyperactivity develops in the auditory brainstem as a result of reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The compensatory plasticity observed at this early stage of the primary auditory pathway may contribute to the hyperactivity reported at later stages. Further, we show that this hyperactivity can compensate for reduced sensory input to partially restore some aspects of auditory function.</p>

Abstract<p>Sensory adaptation is a source of experience-dependent feedback that impacts responses to environmental cues. In the mammalian main olfactory system (MOS), adaptation influences sensory coding at its earliest processing stages. Sensory adaptation in the accessory olfactory system (AOS) remains incompletely explored, leaving many aspects of the phenomenon unclear. We investigated sensory adaptation in vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) using a combination of <i>in situ</i> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and electrophysiology. Parallel studies revealed prominent short-term sensory adaptation in VSNs upon repeated stimulation with mouse urine and monomolecular bile acid ligands at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) less than 30 s. In such conditions, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and spike rates were often reduced by more than 50%, leading to dramatically reduced chemosensory sensitivity. Short-term adaptation was reversible over the course of minutes. Population Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments revealed the presence of a slower form of VSN adaptation that accumulated over dozens of stimulus presentations delivered over tens of minutes. Most VSNs showed strong adaptation, but in a substantial VSN subpopulation adaptation was diminished or absent. Investigation of same- and opposite-sex urine responses in male and female VSNs revealed that adaptation to same-sex cues occurred at ISIs up to 180 s, conditions that did not induce adaptation to opposite-sex cues. This result suggests that VSN sensory adaptation can be modulated by sensory experience. These studies comprehensively establish the presence of VSN sensory adaptation and provide a foundation for future inquiries into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this phenomenon and its impact on mammalian behavior.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Peripheral sensory adaptation is an initial mechanism for experience-driven feedback in the nervous system. In the mammalian accessory olfactory system, which senses many social chemosignals, peripheral adaptation remains a subject of some debate. We investigated sensory adaptation to natural cues and monomolecular ligands in acute preparations of the vomeronasal organ, finding evidence for short- and long-term adaptation on repeated stimulation at defined intervals. We further tested whether adaptation differed to same-sex versus opposite-sex cues, finding that sensory adaptation was more prominent for same-sex cues in both males and females. These inquiries into accessory olfactory system adaptation provide a foundation for future inquiries into this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Simulation models of facial expressions propose that sensorimotor regions may
increase the clarity of facial expressions representations in extrastriate
areas. We monitored the event-related potential marker of visual working memory
(VWM) representations, namely the sustained posterior contralateral negativity
(SPCN), also termed contralateral delay activity (CDA), while participants
performed a change detection task including to-be-memorized faces with
different intensities of anger. In one condition participants could freely use
their facial mimicry during the encoding/VWM maintenance of the faces, while in
a different condition, participants had their facial mimicry blocked by a gel.
Notably, SPCN amplitude was reduced for faces in the blocked mimicry condition
when compared to the free mimicry condition. This modulation interacted with
the empathy levels of participants such that only participants with medium-high
empathy scores showed such reduction of the SPCN amplitude when their mimicry
was blocked. The SPCN amplitude was larger for full expressions when compared
to neutral and subtle expressions, while subtle expressions elicited lower SPCN
amplitudes than neutral faces. These findings provide evidence of a functional
link between mimicry and VWM for faces, and further shed light on how this
memory system may receive feedbacks from sensorimotor regions during the
processing of facial expressions.

Yeh et al. demonstrate that mossy cells regulate adult NSCs through direct glutamatergic and indirect GABAergic pathways. Functionally, mossy cells at various activity states control NSC quiescence and maintenance through a dynamic balance of glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling onto NSCs.

<p>After ischemic stroke, apoptosis of neurons is a primary factor in determining outcome. Wnt3a is a naturally occurring protein that has been shown to have protective effects in the brain for traumatic brain injury. Although wnt3a has been investigated in the phenomena of neurogenesis, anti-apoptosis, and anti-inflammation, it has never been investigated as a therapy for stroke. We hypothesized that the potential neuroprotective agent wnt3a would reduce infarction and improve behavior following ischemic stroke by attenuating neuronal apoptosis and promoting cell survival through the Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 pathway in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. A total of 229 Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to male, female, and 9-month-old male MCAO or sham groups followed by reperfusion 2 h after MCAO. Animals assigned to MCAO were either given wnt3a or its control. To explore the downstream signaling of wnt3a, the following interventions were given: Frizzled-1 siRNA, PIWI1a siRNA, and PIWI1a-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, along with the appropriate controls. Post-MCAO assessments included neurobehavioral tests, infarct volume, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Endogenous levels of wnt3a and Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 were lowered after MCAO. The administration of intranasal wnt3a, 1 h after MCAO, increased PIWIL1a and FOXM1 expression through Frizzled-1, reducing brain infarction and neurological deficits at 24 and 72 h. Frizzled-1 and PIWI1a siRNAs reversed the protective effects of wnt3a after MCAO. Restoration of PIWI1a after knockdown of Frizzled-1 increased FOXM1 survival protein and reduced cleaved caspase-3 levels. In summary, wnt3a decreases neuronal apoptosis and improves neurological deficits through Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 pathway after MCAO in rats. Therefore, wnt3a is a novel intranasal approach to decrease apoptosis after stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Only 5% of patients receive recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after stroke, and few qualify for mechanical thrombectomy. No neuroprotective agents have been successfully translated to promote neuronal survival in stroke. Thus, using a clinically relevant rat model of stroke, middle cerebral artery occlusion, we explored a novel intranasal administration of wnt3a. wnt3a naturally occurs in the body and crosses the blood–brain barrier, supporting the clinically translatable approach of intranasal administration. Significant neuronal apoptosis occurs during stroke, and wnt3a shows promise due to its antiapoptotic effects. We investigated whether wnt3a mediates its poststroke effects via Frizzled-1 and the impact on its downstream signaling molecules, PIWI1a and FOXM1, in apoptosis. Elucidating the mechanism of wnt3a will identify additional pharmacological targets and further understanding of stroke.</p>

<p>Alterations in motivated behavior are a hallmark of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in controlling goal-directed behavior, but the link between OFC dysfunction and behavioral deficits in ADHD, particularly in adolescence, remains poorly understood. Here we used advanced high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human OFC in adolescents with ADHD and typically developing (TD) controls (<i>N</i> = 39, age 12–16, all male except for one female per group) to study reward-related OFC responses and how they relate to behavioral dysfunction in ADHD. During fMRI data acquisition, participants performed a simple decision-making task, allowing us to image expectation-related responses to small and large monetary outcomes. Across all participants, we observed significant signal increases to large versus small expected rewards in the OFC. These responses were significantly enhanced in ADHD relative to TD participants. Moreover, stronger reward-related activity was correlated with individual differences in hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the ADHD group, whereas high cognitive ability was associated with normalized OFC responses. These results provide evidence for the importance of OFC dysfunctions in the neuropathology of ADHD, highlighting the role of OFC-dependent goal-directed control mechanisms in this disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by alterations in motivated behavior which can be understood as diminished goal-directed control. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in controlling goal-directed behavior, but its potential contribution to ADHD symptomatology remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI, we show that adolescent ADHD patients display enhanced OFC signaling of future rewards and that these increased reward-related responses are correlated with the severity of hyperactivity/impulsivity. These findings suggest that an inability to adequately evaluate future outcomes may translate into maladaptive behavior in ADHD patients. They also challenge the idea that dysfunctions in dopaminergic brain areas are the sole contributor to reward-related symptoms in ADHD and point to a central contribution of goal-directed control circuits in hyperactivity.</p>

<p>Spatial location in the environment can be defined in relation to specific landmarks or in relation to the global context, and is estimated from both the sensing of landmarks and the inner sense of cumulated locomotion referred to as path-integration. The respective contribution of landmark and path-integration to place-cell activity in the hippocampus is still unclear and complicated by the fact that the two mechanisms usually overlap. To bias spatial mechanisms toward landmark or path-integration, we use a treadmill equipped with a long belt on which male mice run sequentially through a zone enriched and a zone impoverished in visual-tactile cues. We show that inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which is known to disrupt the periodic activity of grid cells, impairs mice ability to anticipate the delivery of a reward in the cue-impoverished zone and transiently alter the spatial configuration of place fields in the cue-impoverished zone selectively: following MS inactivation, place fields in the cue-impoverished zone progressively shift backward and stabilize near the cues, resulting in the contraction of the spatial representation around cues; following MS recovery, the initial spatial representation is progressively restored. Furthermore, we found that place fields in the cue-rich and cue-impoverished zones are preferentially generated by cells from the deep and superficial sublayers of CA1, respectively. These findings demonstrate with mechanistic insights the contribution of MS to the spread of spatial representations in cue-impoverished zones, and indicate a segregation of landmark-based and path-integration-assisted spatial mechanisms into deep and superficial CA1, respectively.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cells encoding a cue-impoverished zone and the vicinity of landmarks responded differentially to septal inactivation and resided in distinct sublayers of CA1. These findings provide new insights on place field mechanisms: septal activity is critical for maintaining the spread of place fields in cue-impoverished areas, but not for the generation of place fields; Following MS inactivation, trial-by-trial network modifications by activity-dependent mechanisms are responsible for the gradual collapse of spatial representations. Furthermore, the findings suggest parallel coding streams for landmark and self-motion information. Superficial CA1 cells are better suited for encoding global position via the assist of path-integration, whereas deep CA1 cells can support spatial memory processes on an object-specific basis.</p>

<p>Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its type 1 receptor (CRFR<sub>1</sub>) play an important role in the responses to stressful challenges. Despite the well established expression of CRFR<sub>1</sub> in granular cells (GrCs), its role in procedural motor performance and memory formation remains elusive. To investigate the role of CRFR<sub>1</sub> expression in cerebellar GrCs, we used a mouse model depleted of CRFR<sub>1</sub> in these cells. We detected changes in the cellular learning mechanisms in GrCs depleted of CRFR<sub>1</sub> in that they showed changes in intrinsic excitability and long-term synaptic plasticity. Analysis of cerebella transcriptome obtained from KO and control mice detected prominent alterations in the expression of calcium signaling pathways components. Moreover, male mice depleted of CRFR<sub>1</sub> specifically in GrCs showed accelerated Pavlovian associative eye-blink conditioning, but no differences in baseline motor performance, locomotion, or fear and anxiety-related behaviors. Our findings shed light on the interplay between stress-related central mechanisms and cerebellar motor conditioning, highlighting the role of the CRF system in regulating particular forms of cerebellar learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although it is known that the corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRFR<sub>1</sub>) is highly expressed in the cerebellum, little attention has been given to its role in cerebellar functions in the behaving animal. Moreover, most of the attention was directed at the effect of CRF on Purkinje cells at the cellular level and, to this date, almost no data exist on the role of this stress-related receptor in other cerebellar structures. Here, we explored the behavioral and cellular effect of granular cell-specific ablation of CRFR<sub>1</sub>. We found a profound effect on learning both at the cellular and behavioral levels without an effect on baseline motor skills.</p>

<p>Macrophages/microglia with M2-activation phenotype are thought to play important anti-inflammatory and tissue reparative functions in the brain, yet the molecular bases of their functions in the CNS remain to be clearly defined. In a preclinical model of neurocysticercosis using brain infection with a parasite <i>Mesocestoides corti</i>, we previously reported the presence of large numbers of M2 cells in the CNS. In this study using female mice, we report that M2 macrophages in the parasite-infected brain display abundant galectin-3 expression. Disease severity was increased in <i>Galectin-3</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice correlating with increased neurological defects, augmented cell death and, importantly, massive accumulation of neutrophils and M2 macrophages in the CNS of these mice. Because neutrophil clearance by efferocytosis is an important function of M2 macrophages, we investigated a possible role of galectin-3 in this process. Indeed, galectin-3-deficient M2 macrophages exhibited a defect in efferocytic clearance of neutrophils <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of M2 macrophages from galectin-3-sufficient WT mice reduced neutrophilia in the CNS and ameliorated disease severity in parasite-infected <i>Galectin-3</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, a novel role of galectin-3 in M2 macrophage function in neutrophil turnover and resolution of inflammatory pathology in the CNS. This likely will have implications in neurocysticercosis and neuroinflammatory diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Macrophages/microglia with M1-activation phenotype are thought to promote CNS pathology, whereas M2-anti-inflammatory phenotype promote CNS repair. However, the mechanisms regulating M2 cell-protective functions in the CNS microenvironment are undefined. The current study reports that helminth infection of the brain induces an increased expression of galectin-3 in M2 macrophages accumulated in the CNS. Using multiple experimental models <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, they show that galectin-3 in M2 macrophages functions to clear neutrophils accumulated in the CNS. Importantly, galectin-3 in M2 macrophages plays a central role in the containment of neuropathology and disease severity. These results provide a direct mechanistic evidence of the protective function of M2 macrophages in the CNS.</p>

<p>Exposure to low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) before cerebral ischemia is neuroprotective in stroke models, a phenomenon termed preconditioning (PC). Although it is well established that LPS-PC induces central and peripheral immune responses, the cellular mechanisms modulating ischemic injury remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of immune cells in the brain protection afforded by PC and tested whether monocytes may be reprogrammed by <i>ex vivo</i> LPS exposure, thus modulating inflammatory injury after cerebral ischemia in male mice. We found that systemic injection of low-dose LPS induces a Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocyte response that protects the brain after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. Remarkably, adoptive transfer of monocytes isolated from preconditioned mice into naive mice 7 h after transient MCAO reduced brain injury. Gene expression and functional studies showed that IL-10, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and CCR2 in monocytes are essential for neuroprotection. This protective activity was elicited even if mouse or human monocytes were exposed <i>ex vivo</i> to LPS and then injected into male mice after stroke. Cell-tracking studies showed that protective monocytes are mobilized from the spleen and reach the brain and meninges, where they suppress postischemic inflammation and neutrophil influx into the brain parenchyma. Our findings unveil a previously unrecognized subpopulation of splenic monocytes capable of protecting the brain with an extended therapeutic window and provide the rationale for cell therapies based on the delivery of autologous or allogeneic protective monocytes in patients after ischemic stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inflammation is a key component of the pathophysiology of the brain in stroke, a leading cause of death and disability with limited therapeutic options. Here, we investigate endogenous mechanisms of protection against cerebral ischemia. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning (PC) as an approach to induce ischemic tolerance in mice, we found generation of neuroprotective monocytes within the spleen, from which they traffic to the brain and meninges, suppressing postischemic inflammation. Importantly, systemic LPS-PC can be mimicked by adoptive transfer of <i>in vitro</i>-preconditioned mouse or human monocytes at translational relevant time points after stroke. This model of neuroprotection may facilitate clinical efforts to increase the efficacy of BM mononuclear cell treatments in acute neurological diseases such as cerebral ischemia.</p>

<p>Leukocyte common antigen-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are hub proteins that organize excitatory and inhibitory synapse development through binding to various extracellular ligands. Here, we report that knockdown (KD) of the LAR-RPTP family member PTP reduced excitatory synapse number and transmission in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, whereas KD of PTP produced comparable decreases at inhibitory synapses, in both cases without altering expression levels of interacting proteins. An extensive series of rescue experiments revealed that extracellular interactions of PTP with Slitrks are important for excitatory synapse development. These experiments further showed that the intracellular D2 domain of PTP is required for induction of heterologous synapse formation by Slitrk1 or TrkC, suggesting that interaction of LAR-RPTPs with distinct intracellular presynaptic proteins, drives presynaptic machinery assembly. Consistent with this, double-KD of liprin-α2 and -α3 or KD of PTP substrates (N-cadherin and p250RhoGAP) in neurons inhibited Slitrk6-induced, PTP-mediated heterologous synapse formation activity. We propose a synaptogenesis model in presynaptic neurons involving LAR-RPTP-organized retrograde signaling cascades, in which both extracellular and intracellular mechanisms are critical in orchestrating distinct synapse types.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we sought to test the unproven hypothesis that PTP and PTP are required for excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation/transmission, respectively, in cultured hippocampal neurons, using knockdown-based loss-of-function analyses. We further performed extensive structure–function analyses, focusing on PTP-mediated actions, to address the mechanisms of presynaptic assembly at excitatory synaptic sites. Using interdisciplinary approaches, we systematically applied a varied set of PTP deletion variants, point mutants, and splice variants to demonstrate that both extracellular and intracellular mechanisms are involved in organizing presynaptic assembly. Strikingly, extracellular interactions of PTP with heparan sulfates and Slitrks, intracellular interactions of PTP with liprin-α and its associated proteins through the D2 domain, as well as distinct substrates are all critical.</p>

<p>Lysosomes play a central role in cellular homeostasis by regulating the cellular degradative machinery. Because aberrant lysosomal function has been associated with multiple lysosomal storage and neurodegenerative disorders, enhancement of lysosomal clearance has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is known as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and, here, we reveal that aspirin, one of the most widely used medications in the world, upregulates TFEB and increases lysosomal biogenesis in brain cells. Interestingly, aspirin induced the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and stimulated the transcription of <i>Tfeb</i> via PPARα. Finally, oral administration of low-dose aspirin decreased amyloid plaque pathology in both male and female 5X familial Alzheimer's disease (5XFAD) mice in a PPARα-dependent fashion. This study reveals a new function of aspirin in stimulating lysosomal biogenesis via PPARα and suggests that low-dose aspirin may be used in lowering storage materials in Alzheimer's disease and lysosomal storage disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developing drugs for the reduction of amyloid β containing senile plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is an important area of research. Aspirin, one of the most widely used medications in the world, activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) to upregulate transcription factor EB and increase lysosomal biogenesis in brain cells. Accordingly, low-dose aspirin decreases cerebral plaque load in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease via PPARα. These results reveal a new mode of action of aspirin that may be beneficial for AD and lysosomal storage disorders.</p>

<p>Humans possess three genetic isoforms of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)—ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4—that confer differential risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study sought to investigate the impact of human ApoE isoforms on brain energy metabolism, an area significantly perturbed in preclinical AD. A TaqMan custom array was performed to examine the expression of a total of 43 genes involved in glucose and ketone body transport and metabolism, focusing on pathways leading to the generation of acetyl-CoA, in human ApoE gene-targeted replacement female mice. Consistent with our previous findings, brains expressing ApoE2 exhibited the most robust profile, whereas brains expressing ApoE4 displayed the most deficient profile on the uptake and metabolism of glucose, the primary fuel for the brain. Specifically, the three ApoE brains differed significantly in facilitated glucose transporters, which mediate the entry of glucose into neurons, and hexokinases, which act as the "gateway enzyme" in glucose metabolism. Interestingly, on the uptake and metabolism of ketone bodies, the secondary energy source for the brain, ApoE2 and ApoE4 brains showed a similar level of robustness, whereas ApoE3 brains presented a relatively deficient profile. Further, ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that the PPAR-/PGC-1α signaling pathway could be activated in the ApoE2 brain and inhibited in the ApoE4 brain. Notably, PGC-1α overexpression ameliorated ApoE4-induced deficits in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Overall, our data provide additional evidence that human ApoE isoforms differentially modulate brain bioenergetic metabolism, which could serve as a potential mechanism contributing to their discrete risk impact in AD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We uncovered hexokinase as a key cytosolic point in the glucose metabolism that is differentially modulated by the three ApoE genotypes. The differences in hexokinase expression and activity exhibited in the three ApoE brains may underlie their distinct impact on brain glucose utilization and further susceptibility to AD. Therefore, a therapeutic approach that could circumvent the deficiencies in the cytosolic metabolism of glucose by providing glucose metabolizing intermediates, e.g., pyruvate, may hold benefits for ApoE4 carriers, who are at high risk for AD. The bioenergetic robustness may translate into enhanced synaptic activity and, ultimately, reduces the risk of developing AD and/or delays the onset of clinical manifestation.</p>

<p>Perceiving an object as salient from its surround often requires a preceding process of grouping the object and background elements as perceptual wholes. In humans, motion homogeneity provides a strong cue for grouping, yet it is unknown to what extent this occurs in nonprimate species. To explore this question, we studied the effects of visual motion homogeneity in barn owls of both genders, at the behavioral as well as the neural level. Our data show that the coherency of the background motion modulates the perceived saliency of the target object. An object moving in an odd direction relative to other objects attracted more attention when the other objects moved homogeneously compared with when moved in a variety of directions. A possible neural correlate of this effect may arise in the population activity of the intermediate/deep layers of the optic tectum. In these layers, the neural responses to a moving element in the receptive field were suppressed when additional elements moved in the surround. However, when the surrounding elements all moved in one direction (homogeneously moving), they induced less suppression of the response compared with nonhomogeneously moving elements. Moreover, neural responses were more sensitive to the homogeneity of the background motion than to motion-direction contrasts between the receptive field and the surround. The findings suggest similar principles of saliency-by-motion in an avian species as in humans and show a locus in the optic tectum where the underlying neural circuitry may exist.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A critical task of the visual system is to arrange incoming visual information to a meaningful scene of objects and background. In humans, elements that move homogeneously are grouped perceptually to form a categorical whole object. We discovered a similar principle in the barn owl's visual system, whereby the homogeneity of the motion of elements in the scene allows perceptually distinguishing an object from its surround. The novel findings of these visual effects in an avian species, which lacks neocortical structure, suggest that our basic visual perception shares more universal principles across species than presently thought, and shed light on possible brain mechanisms for perceptual grouping.</p>

<p>The human <i>16p11.2</i> microdeletion is one of the most common gene copy number variations linked to autism, but the pathophysiology associated with this chromosomal abnormality is largely unknown. The 593 kb deletion contains the ERK1 gene and other genes that converge onto the ERK/MAP kinase pathway. Perturbations in ERK signaling are linked to a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders hallmarked by intellectual disability, including autism. We report that mice harboring the <i>16p11.2</i> deletion exhibit a paradoxical elevation of ERK activity, cortical cytoarchitecture abnormalities and behavioral deficits. Importantly, we show that treatment with a novel ERK pathway inhibitor during a critical period of brain development rescues the molecular, anatomical and behavioral deficits in the <i>16p11.2</i> deletion mice. The ERK inhibitor treatment administered to adult mice ameliorates a subset of these behavioral deficits. Our findings provide evidence for potential targeted therapeutic intervention in <i>16p11.2</i> deletion carriers.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ERK/MAPK pathway is genetically linked to autism spectrum disorders and other syndromes typified by intellectual disability. We provide direct evidence connecting the ERK/MAP kinases to the developmental abnormalities in neurogenesis and cortical cytoarchitecture associated with the <i>16p11.2</i> chromosomal deletion. Most importantly, we demonstrate that treatment with a novel ERK-specific inhibitor during development rescues aberrant cortical cytoarchitecture and restores normal levels of cell-cycle regulators during cortical neurogenesis. These treatments partially reverse the behavioral deficits observed in the <i>16p11.2del</i> mouse model, including hyperactivity, memory as well as olfaction, and maternal behavior. We also report a rescue of a subset of these deficits upon treatment of adult <i>16p11.2del</i> mice. These data provide a strong rationale for therapeutic approaches to this disorder.</p>

<p>Highly correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic activity evokes spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP) at primary afferent synapses onto spinal projection neurons. While prior evidence indicates that t-LTP depends upon an elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> within projection neurons, the downstream signaling pathways that trigger the observed increase in glutamate release from sensory neurons remain poorly understood. Using <i>in vitro</i> patch-clamp recordings from female mouse lamina I spino-parabrachial neurons, the present study demonstrates a critical role for prostaglandin synthesis in the generation of t-LTP. Bath application of the selective phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) inhibitor arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF<sub>3</sub>) or the cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) inhibitor nimesulide prevented t-LTP at sensory synapses onto spino-parabrachial neurons. Similar results were observed following the block of the EP2 subtype of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) receptor with PF 04418948. Meanwhile, perfusion with PGE<sub>2</sub> or the EP2 agonist butaprost potentiated the amplitude of monosynaptic primary afferent-evoked EPSCs while decreasing the paired-pulse ratio, suggesting a presynaptic site of action. Cox-2 was constitutively expressed in both spinal microglia and lamina I projection neurons within the superficial dorsal horn (SDH). Suppression of microglial activation with minocycline had no effect on the production of t-LTP, suggesting the possibility that prostaglandins produced within projection neurons could contribute to an enhanced probability of glutamate release at primary afferent synapses. Collectively, the results suggest that the amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission by the spinal SDH network is governed by PLA<sub>2</sub>–Cox-2–PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long-term potentiation (LTP) of primary afferent synapses contributes to the sensitization of spinal nociceptive circuits and has been linked to greater pain sensation in humans. Prior work has implicated elevated glutamate release in the generation of spike timing-dependent LTP (t-LTP) at sensory synapses onto ascending spinal projection neurons, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we provide evidence that the activation of EP2 prostaglandin receptors by prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, occurring downstream of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and cyclooxygenase 2 activation, mediates t-LTP at these synapses via changes in presynaptic function. This suggests that prostaglandins can increase the flow of nociceptive information from the spinal cord to the brain independently of their known ability to suppress synaptic inhibition within the dorsal horn.</p>

<p>Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and the <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> current they generate contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of absence seizures (ASs), but their precise role in neocortical and thalamic neuronal populations, the main components of the network underlying AS generation, remains controversial. In diverse genetic AS models, <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> amplitude is smaller in neocortical neurons and either larger or unchanged in thalamocortical (TC) neurons compared with nonepileptic strains. A lower expression of neocortical HCN subtype 1 channels is present in genetic AS-prone rats, and HCN subtype 2 knock-out mice exhibit ASs. Furthermore, whereas many studies have characterized <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> contribution to "absence-like" paroxysmal activity <i>in vitro</i>, no data are available on the specific role of cortical and thalamic HCN channels in behavioral seizures. Here, we show that the pharmacological block of HCN channels with the antagonist ZD7288 applied via reverse microdialysis in the ventrobasal thalamus (VB) of freely moving male Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg decreases TC neuron firing and abolishes spontaneous ASs. A similar effect is observed on -hydroxybutyric acid-elicited ASs in normal male Wistar rats. Moreover, thalamic knockdown of HCN channels via virally delivered shRNA into the VB of male Stargazer mice, another genetic AS model, decreases spontaneous ASs and <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>-dependent electrophysiological properties of VB TC neurons. These findings provide the first evidence that block of TC neuron HCN channels prevents ASs and suggest that any potential anti-absence therapy that targets HCN channels should carefully consider the opposite role for cortical and thalamic <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> in the modulation of absence seizures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels play critical roles in the fine-tuning of cellular and network excitability and have been suggested to be a key element of the pathophysiological mechanism underlying absence seizures. However, the precise contribution of HCN channels in neocortical and thalamic neuronal populations to these nonconvulsive seizures is still controversial. In the present study, pharmacological block and genetic suppression of HCN channels in thalamocortical neurons in the ventrobasal thalamic nucleus leads to a marked reduction in absence seizures in one pharmacological and two genetic rodent models of absence seizures. These results provide the first evidence that block of TC neuron HCN channels prevents absence seizures.</p>

Abstract
<p>Brain imaging studies indicate that chronic cocaine users display altered functional connectivity between prefrontal cortical, thalamic, striatal, and limbic regions; however, the use of cross-sectional designs in these studies precludes measuring baseline brain activity prior to cocaine use. Animal studies can circumvent this limitation by comparing functional connectivity between baseline and various time points after chronic cocaine use. In the present study, adult male Long–Evans rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously for 6 h sessions daily over 14 consecutive days. Two additional groups serving as controls underwent sucrose self-administration or exposure to the test chambers alone. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted before self-administration and after 1 and 14 d of abstinence (1d and 14d Abs). After 1d Abs from cocaine, there were increased clustering coefficients in brain areas involved in reward seeking, learning, memory, and autonomic and affective processing, including amygdala, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus. Similar changes in clustering coefficient after 1d Abs from sucrose were evident in predominantly thalamic brain regions. Notably, there were no changes in strength of functional connectivity at 1 or 14 d after either cocaine or sucrose self-administration. The results suggest that cocaine and sucrose can change the arrangement of functional connectivity of brain regions involved in cognition and emotion, but that these changes dissipate across the early stages of abstinence. The study also emphasizes the importance of including baseline measures in longitudinal functional neuroimaging designs seeking to assess functional connectivity in the context of substance use.</p>

<p>The emergence of syntax during childhood is a remarkable example of how
complex correlations unfold in nonlinear ways through development. In
particular, rapid transitions seem to occur as children reach the age of two,
which seems to separate a two-word, tree-like network of syntactic relations
among words from a scale-free graphs associated to the adult, complex grammar.
Here we explore the evolution of syntax networks through language acquisition
using the {\em chromatic number}, which captures the transition and provides a
natural link to standard theories on syntactic structures. The data analysis is
compared to a null model of network growth dynamics which is shown to display
nontrivial and sensible differences. In a more general level, we observe that
the chromatic classes define independent regions of the graph, and thus, can be
interpreted as the footprints of incompatibility relations, somewhat as opposed
to modularity considerations.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08952">Sampling-based probabilistic inference emerges from learning in neural circuits with a cost on reliability. (arXiv:1807.08952v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Neural responses in the cortex change over time both systematically, due to
ongoing plasticity and learning, and seemingly randomly, due to various sources
of noise and variability. Most previous work considered each of these
processes, learning and variability, in isolation -- here we study neural
networks exhibiting both and show that their interaction leads to the emergence
of powerful computational properties. We trained neural networks on classical
unsupervised learning tasks, in which the objective was to represent their
inputs in an efficient, easily decodable form, with an additional cost for
neural reliability which we derived from basic biophysical considerations. This
cost on reliability introduced a tradeoff between energetically cheap but
inaccurate representations and energetically costly but accurate ones. Despite
the learning tasks being non-probabilistic, the networks solved this tradeoff
by developing a probabilistic representation: neural variability represented
samples from statistically appropriate posterior distributions that would
result from performing probabilistic inference over their inputs. We provide an
analytical understanding of this result by revealing a connection between the
cost of reliability, and the objective for a state-of-the-art Bayesian
inference strategy: variational autoencoders. We show that the same cost leads
to the emergence of increasingly accurate probabilistic representations as
networks become more complex, from single-layer feed-forward, through
multi-layer feed-forward, to recurrent architectures. Our results provide
insights into why neural responses in sensory areas show signatures of
sampling-based probabilistic representations, and may inform future deep
learning algorithms and their implementation in stochastic low-precision
computing systems.

<p>In this study, we analyzed the activity of monkey V1 neurons responding to
grating stimuli of different orientations using inference methods for a
time-dependent Ising model. The method provides optimal estimation of
time-dependent neural interactions with credible intervals according to the
sequential Bayes estimation algorithm. Furthermore, it allows us to trace
dynamics of macroscopic network properties such as entropy, sparseness, and
fluctuation. Here we report that, in all examined stimulus conditions, pairwise
interactions contribute to increasing sparseness and fluctuation. We then
demonstrate that the orientation of the grating stimulus is in part encoded in
the pairwise interactions of the neural populations. These results demonstrate
the utility of the state-space Ising model in assessing contributions of neural
interactions during stimulus processing.

Neuromodulators such as dopamine can transform neural circuit function, but the mechanisms underlying such transformations are incompletely understood. A recent study introduced dLight1, a genetically encoded fluorescent dopamine indicator. dLight1 allows the optical measurement of dopamine sensed by isolated target circuits with high spatiotemporal resolution and has unique advantages for the study of neuromodulatory mechanisms.

<p>by Magdalena San Roman, Andreas Wagner</p>

Microorganisms modify their environment by excreting by-products of metabolism, which can create new ecological niches that can help microbial populations diversify. A striking example comes from experimental evolution of genetically identical <i>Escherichia coli</i> populations that are grown in a homogeneous environment with the single carbon source glucose. In such experiments, stable communities of genetically diverse cross-feeding <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> cells readily emerge. Some cells that consume the primary carbon source glucose excrete a secondary carbon source, such as acetate, that sustains other community members. Few such cross-feeding polymorphisms are known experimentally, because they are difficult to screen for. We studied the potential of bacterial metabolism to create new ecological niches based on cross-feeding. To do so, we used genome scale models of the metabolism of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and metabolisms of similar complexity, to identify unique pairs of primary and secondary carbon sources in these metabolisms. We then combined dynamic flux balance analysis with analytical calculations to identify which pair of carbon sources can sustain a polymorphic cross-feeding community. We identified almost 10,000 such pairs of carbon sources, each of them corresponding to a unique ecological niche. Bacterial metabolism shows an immense potential for the construction of new ecological niches through cross feeding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4j1AnbKj0ts" width="1" />

<p>by Michelle R. Greene, Bruce C. Hansen</p>

Visual scene category representations emerge very rapidly, yet the computational transformations that enable such invariant categorizations remain elusive. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform visual categorization at near human-level accuracy using a feedforward architecture, providing neuroscientists with the opportunity to assess one successful series of representational transformations that enable categorization <i>in silico</i>. The goal of the current study is to assess the extent to which sequential scene category representations built by a CNN map onto those built in the human brain as assessed by high-density, time-resolved event-related potentials (ERPs). We found correspondence both over time and across the scalp: earlier (0–200 ms) ERP activity was best explained by early CNN layers at all electrodes. Although later activity at most electrode sites corresponded to earlier CNN layers, activity in right occipito-temporal electrodes was best explained by the later, fully-connected layers of the CNN around 225 ms post-stimulus, along with similar patterns in frontal electrodes. Taken together, these results suggest that the emergence of scene category representations develop through a dynamic interplay between early activity over occipital electrodes as well as later activity over temporal and frontal electrodes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZEQaAbJ1Wsg" width="1" />

<p>by Chia-Chin Wu, Hannah C. Beird, Jianhua Zhang, P. Andrew Futreal</p>

Numerous gene fusions have been uncovered across multiple cancer types. Although the ability to target several of these fusions has led to the development of some successful anti-cancer drugs, most of them are not druggable. Understanding the molecular pathways of a fusion is important in determining its function in oncogenesis and in developing therapeutic strategies for patients harboring the fusion. However, the molecular pathways have been elucidated for only a few fusions, in part because of the labor-intensive nature of the required functional assays. Therefore, we developed a domain-based network approach to infer the pathways of a fusion. Molecular interactions of a fusion are first predicted by using its protein domain composition, and its associated pathways are then inferred from these molecular interactions. We demonstrated the capabilities of this approach by primarily applying it to the well-studied BCR-ABL1 fusion. The approach was also applied to two undruggable fusions in sarcoma, EWS-FL1 and FUS-DDIT3. We successfully identified known genes and pathways associated with these fusions and satisfactorily validated these predictions using several benchmark sets. The predictions of EWS-FL1 and FUS-DDIT3 also correlate with results of high-throughput drug screening. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach for inferring pathways of fusions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AlUtclLYt3M" width="1" />

In the event of a new infectious disease outbreak, mathematical and simulation models are commonly used to inform policy by evaluating which control strategies will minimize the impact of the epidemic. In the early stages of such outbreaks, substantial parameter uncertainty may limit the ability of models to provide accurate predictions, and policymakers do not have the luxury of waiting for data to alleviate this state of uncertainty. For policymakers, however, it is the selection of the optimal control intervention in the face of uncertainty, rather than accuracy of model predictions, that is the measure of success that counts. We simulate the process of real-time decision-making by fitting an epidemic model to observed, spatially-explicit, infection data at weekly intervals throughout two historical outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, UK in 2001 and Miyazaki, Japan in 2010, and compare forward simulations of the impact of switching to an alternative control intervention at the time point in question. These are compared to policy recommendations generated in hindsight using data from the entire outbreak, thereby comparing the best we could have done at the time with the best we could have done in retrospect.
Our results show that the control policy that would have been chosen using all the data is also identified from an early stage in an outbreak using only the available data, despite high variability in projections of epidemic size. Critically, we find that it is an improved understanding of the locations of infected farms, rather than improved estimates of transmission parameters, that drives improved prediction of the relative performance of control interventions. However, the ability to estimate undetected infectious premises is a function of uncertainty in the transmission parameters. Here, we demonstrate the need for both real-time model fitting and generating projections to evaluate alternative control interventions throughout an outbreak. Our results highlight the use of using models at outbreak onset to inform policy and the importance of state-dependent interventions that adapt in response to additional information throughout an outbreak.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ssEqx6ziHQk" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: December 2018</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53</p><p>Author(s): Maxime Chevée, Solange P Brown</p><div><p>Precise synaptic connections among neurons in the neocortex generate the circuits that underlie a broad repertoire of cortical functions including perception, learning and memory, and complex problem solving. The specific patterns and properties of these synaptic connections are fundamental to the computations cortical neurons perform. How such specificity arises in cortical circuits has remained elusive. Here, we first consider the cell-type, subcellular and synaptic specificity required for generating mature patterns of cortical connectivity and responses. Next, we focus on recent progress in understanding how the synaptic connections among excitatory cortical projection neurons are established during development using the primary visual cortex of the mouse as a model.</p></div><h5>Graphical abstract</h5><div><p></p><figure><img alt="Graphical abstract for this article" src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300655-fx1.jpg" title="" width="301" /></figure><p></p></div>

<p>We first review traditional approaches to memory storage and formation,
drawing on the literature of quantitative neuroscience as well as statistical
physics. These have generally focused on the fast dynamics of neurons; however,
there is now an increasing emphasis on the slow dynamics of synapses, whose
weight changes are held to be responsible for memory storage. An important
first step in this direction was taken in the context of Fusi's cascade model,
where complex synaptic architectures were invoked, in particular, to store
long-term memories. No explicit synaptic dynamics were, however, invoked in
that work. These were recently incorporated theoretically using the techniques
used in agent-based modelling, and subsequently, models of competing and
cooperating synapses were formulated. It was found that the key to the storage
of long-term memories lay in the competitive dynamics of synapses. In this
review, we focus on models of synaptic competition and cooperation, and look at
the outstanding challenges that remain.

<p>Our eyes sample a disproportionately large amount of information at the
centre of gaze with increasingly sparse sampling into the periphery. This
sampling scheme is widely believed to be a wiring constraint whereby high
resolution at the centre is achieved by sacrificing spatial acuity in the
periphery. Here we propose that this sampling scheme may be optimal for object
recognition because the relevant spatial content is dense near an object and
sparse in the surrounding vicinity. We tested this hypothesis by training deep
convolutional neural networks on full-resolution and foveated images. Our main
finding is that networks trained on images with foveated sampling show better
object classification compared to networks trained on full resolution images.
Importantly, blurring images according to the human blur function yielded the
best performance compared to images with shallower or steeper blurring. Taken
together our results suggest that, peripheral blurring in our eyes may have
evolved for optimal object recognition, rather than merely to satisfy wiring
constraints.

<p>This paper outlines the implications of neural-level accounts of insight, and
models of the conceptual interactions that underlie creativity, for a theory of
cultural evolution. Since elements of human culture exhibit cumulative,
adaptive, open-ended change, it seems reasonable to view culture as an
evolutionary process, one fueled by creativity. Associative memory models of
creativity and mathematical models of how concepts combine and transform
through interaction with a context, support a view of creativity that is
incompatible with a Darwinian (selectionist) framework for cultural evolution,
but compatible with a non-Darwinian (Self-Other Reorganization) framework. A
theory of cultural evolution in which creativity is centre stage could provide
the kind of integrative framework for the behavioral sciences that Darwin
provided for the life sciences.

<p>Neuronal network dynamics depends on network structure. It is often assumed
that neurons are connected at random when their actual connectivity structure
is unknown. Such models are then often approximated by replacing the random
network by an all-to-all network, where every neuron is connected to all other
neurons. This mean-field approximation is a common approach in statistical
physics. In this paper we show that such approximation can be invalid. We solve
analytically a neuronal network model with binary-state neurons in both random
and all-to-all networks. We find strikingly different phase diagrams
corresponding to each network structure. Neuronal network dynamics is not only
different within certain parameter ranges, but it also undergoes different
bifurcations. Our results therefore suggest cautiousness when using mean-field
models based on all-to-all network topologies to represent random networks.

<p>Estimation of mutual information between random variables has become crucial
in a range of fields, from physics to neuroscience to finance. Estimating
information accurately over a wide range of conditions relies on the
development of flexible methods to describe statistical dependencies among
variables, without imposing potentially invalid assumptions on the data. Such
methods are needed in cases that lack prior knowledge of their statistical
properties and that have limited sample numbers. Here we propose a powerful and
generally applicable information estimator based on non-parametric copulas.
This estimator, called the non-parametric copula-based estimator (NPC), is
tailored to take into account detailed stochastic relationships in the data
independently of the data's marginal distributions. The NPC estimator can be
used both for continuous and discrete numerical variables and thus provides a
single framework for the mutual information estimation of both continuous and
discrete data. By extensive validation on artificial samples drawn from various
statistical distributions, we found that the NPC estimator compares well
against commonly used alternatives. Unlike methods not based on copulas, it
allows an estimation of information that is robust to changes of the details of
the marginal distributions. Unlike parametric copula methods, it remains
accurate regardless of the precise form of the interactions between the
variables. In addition, the NPC estimator had accurate information estimates
even at low sample numbers, in comparison to alternative estimators. The NPC
estimator therefore provides a good balance between general applicability to
arbitrarily shaped statistical dependencies in the data and shows accurate and
robust performance when working with small sample sizes.

<p>by Haitao Chai, Hongmei Jiang, Lu Lin, Lei Liu</p>

In microbiome studies, an important goal is to detect differential abundance of microbes across clinical conditions and treatment options. However, the microbiome compositional data (quantified by relative abundance) are highly skewed, bounded in [0, 1), and often have many zeros. A two-part model is commonly used to separate zeros and positive values explicitly by two submodels: a logistic model for the probability of a specie being present in Part I, and a Beta regression model for the relative abundance conditional on the presence of the specie in Part II. However, the regression coefficients in Part II cannot provide a marginal (unconditional) interpretation of covariate effects on the microbial abundance, which is of great interest in many applications. In this paper, we propose a marginalized two-part Beta regression model which captures the zero-inflation and skewness of microbiome data and also allows investigators to examine covariate effects on the marginal (unconditional) mean. We demonstrate its practical performance using simulation studies and apply the model to a real metagenomic dataset on mouse skin microbiota. We find that under the proposed marginalized model, without loss in power, the likelihood ratio test performs better in controlling the type I error than those under conventional methods.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PdhaI1pPOFI" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Recent work suggests that the brain represents probability distributions and performs Bayesian integration during sensorimotor learning. However, our understanding of the neural representation of this learning remains limited. To begin to address this, we performed two experiments. In the first experiment, we replicated the key behavioral findings of Körding and Wolpert (2004), demonstrating that humans can perform in a Bayes-optimal manner by combining information about their own sensory uncertainty and a statistical distribution of lateral shifts encountered in a visuomotor adaptation task. In the second experiment, we extended these findings by testing whether visuomotor learning occurring during the same task generalizes from one limb to the other, and relatedly, whether this learning is represented in an extrinsic or intrinsic reference frame. We found that the learned mean of the distribution of visuomotor shifts generalizes to the opposite limb only when the perturbation is congruent in extrinsic coordinates, indicating that the underlying representation of learning acquired during training is available to the untrained limb and is coded in an extrinsic reference frame.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Generalization provides unique insights into the motor learning process. However, this type of learning has typically been investigated using fixed or deterministic perturbations and noise-free feedback information, which are not naturalistic. Here we replicate important findings indicating that information is integrated in a Bayes-optimal manner during sensorimotor learning under uncertainty. We then extend these findings by showing that this learning generalises to the opposite limb. These results have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of motor learning as well as practical application to the contexts of sport training and motor rehabilitation.</p>

Abstract<p>Both the function of hippocampal neurons and hippocampus-dependent behaviors are dependent on changes in gene expression, but the specific mechanisms that regulate gene expression in hippocampus are not yet fully understood. The stable, activity-dependent transcription factor FosB plays a role in various forms of hippocampal-dependent learning and in structural plasticity of synapses onto CA1 neurons. The authors examined the consequences of viral-mediated overexpression or inhibition of FosB on the function of adult mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons using <i>ex vivo</i> slice whole-cell physiology. We found that overexpression of FosB decreased excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, while inhibition increased excitability. Interestingly, these manipulations did not affect resting membrane potential or spike frequency adaptation, but FosB overexpression reduced hyperpolarization-activated current. Both FosB overexpression and inhibition decreased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, while only FosB inhibition affected AMPA/NMDA ratio which was mediated by decreased NMDA receptor current, suggesting complex effects on synaptic inputs to CA1 that may be driven by homeostatic cell-autonomous or network-driven adaptations to the changes in CA1 cell excitability. Because FosB is induced in hippocampus by drugs of abuse, stress, or antidepressant treatment, these results suggest that FosB-driven changes in hippocampal cell excitability may be critical for learning and, in maladaptive states, are key drivers of aberrant hippocampal function in diseases such as addiction and depression.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Memory consolidation is a key component of adaptive learned behavior which can be disrupted in psychiatric conditions, and regulated gene expression in hippocampus is critical for learning and memory. FosB is a highly stable, activity-dependent transcription factor that regulates hippocampus-dependent memory, yet its specific role in hippocampal neuronal function is unclear. The authors use whole-cell slice electrophysiology to uncover a novel role for FosB in regulating neuronal excitability in the CA1 region of hippocampus. These findings suggest that FosB-driven changes in gene expression drive intrinsic excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, potentially regulating learning, antidepressant responses, and psychiatric diseases such as drug addiction and depression.</p>

Abstract<p>A developing brain shows intense re-organization and heightened neuronal plasticity allowing for environmental modulation of its development. During early life, maternal care is a key factor of this environment and defects in this care can derail adaptive brain development and may result in susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which those maternal interactions immediately impact the offspring’s brain activity to initiate the pathway to pathology are not well understood. We do know that multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved, including the serotonergic system, a key neuromodulator involved in brain development and emotional regulation. We tested the importance of the serotonergic system and pups’ immediate neural response to maternal presence using wireless electrophysiological recordings, a novel approach allowing us to record neural activity during pups’ interactions with their mother.</p><p>We found that maternal contact modulates the P10-P12 rat pups’ anterior cingulate cortex activity by notably increasing local field potential power in low-frequency bands. We demonstrated, by blocking serotonergic receptors, that this increase is mediated through 5-HT2 receptors. Finally, we showed in isolated pups that enhancing serotonergic transmission, using a selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor, is sufficient to enhance local field potential power in low frequency bands in a pattern similar to that observed when the mother is in the nest. Our results highlight a significant contribution of the serotonergic system in mediating changes of cortical activity in pups related to maternal presence.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Maternal care is a major environmental factor influencing brain development and deficits in this care can result in maladaptive behaviors in the offspring. While maternal interaction is crucial, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which it modulates infant/pup brain activity. In this study, using wireless electrophysiological recordings, we show that the mother’s contact regulates the activity of key prefrontal regions of 10-12 D-old rat pups. Regarding mechanisms, we found that the serotonergic system contributes to this modulation, notably through 5HT2 receptors. These results suggest maternal care affects serotonergic neural activity during early life and provide key insights into how maternal care affects the adaptive/maladaptive development of brain circuits implicated in adult pathology.</p>

<p>What is intuitive: pro-social or anti-social behaviour? To answer this
fundamental question, recent studies analyse decision times in game theory
experiments under the assumption that intuitive decisions are fast and that
deliberation is slow. Lacking any knowledge of the underlying dynamics, such
simplistic approach might however lead to erroneous interpretations. Here we
model the cognitive basis of strategic cooperative decision making using the
Drift Diffusion Model to discern between deliberation and intuition and
describe the evolution of the decision making in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
experiments. We find that rational deliberation quickly becomes dominant over
an initial intuitive bias towards cooperation, which is fostered by positive
interactions as much as frustrated by a negative one. However, this initial
pro-social tendency is resilient, as after a pause it resets to the same
initial value. These results illustrate the new insight that can be achieved
thanks to a quantitative modelling of human behavior.

<p>Higher socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood is associated with increased
cognitive abilities, higher academic achievement, and decreased incidence of
mental illness later in development. Accumulating evidence suggests that these
effects may be due to changes in brain development induced by environmental
factors. While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES
and brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and
intrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based
sample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n=1012) to
examine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated
from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We
quantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network
segregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for
a greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation
captured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age,
high-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and
this effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and
ventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in
clustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length,
consistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in
low-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of
regional homogeneity. Our findings suggest that neighborhood SES may
fundamentally alter intrinsic patterns of inter-regional interactions in the
human brain in a manner that is consistent with greater segregation of
information processing in late childhood and adolescence.

<p>I start from the fundamental principles of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, without probability, and interpret them using the notion of
coexistence: a quantum state can be read, not uniquely, as a coexistence of
other quantum states, which are pairwise orthogonal. In this formalism, I prove
that a conscious observer is necessarily a physical object that can memorize
local events by setting one of its parts in an exactly specified constant
quantum state (hypotheses H1, H2 and H3). Then I define the probability of a
future event as the proportion of initial observers, all identical, who will
actually experience that event. It then becomes possible to establish the usual
results of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, I detail the link between
probabilities and relative frequencies. Additionally, I study the biological
feasibility of this modelling of observer's mind.
</p>
<p>The second part of this paper completes the neuronal description of the mind
functions, based on current neuroscientific knowledge. It provides a model that
is compatible with the assumptions of the first part and consistent with our
daily conscious experience. In particular, it develops a model of
self-consciousness based on an explicit use of the random component of neuron
behaviour; according to the first part, that random is in fact the coexistence
of a multiplicity of possibilities. So, when the mind measures the random part
of certain neurons in the brain, he goes himself within each of these
possibilities. The mind has a decision-making component that is active in this
situation, appearing then as the cause of the choice of this possibility among
all the others. This models the self-consciousness which then ensures the unity
of our conscious experience by equating this experience with ``what the ego is
conscious about''. The conclusion details the points that remain to be
developed.

In particular, it is now possible to connect cellular and circuit mechanisms of integration, firing, and plasticity discovered in brain slices, to processes taking place <em>in vivo</em> as animals learn and encode novel environments.

<p>by Xiaojie Chen, Attila Szolnoki</p>

Utilizing common resources is always a dilemma for community members. While cooperator players restrain themselves and consider the proper state of resources, defectors demand more than their supposed share for a higher payoff. To avoid the tragedy of the common state, punishing the latter group seems to be an adequate reaction. This conclusion, however, is less straightforward when we acknowledge the fact that resources are finite and even a renewable resource has limited growing capacity. To clarify the possible consequences, we consider a coevolutionary model where beside the payoff-driven competition of cooperator and defector players the level of a renewable resource depends sensitively on the fraction of cooperators and the total consumption of all players. The applied feedback-evolving game reveals that beside a delicately adjusted punishment it is also fundamental that cooperators should pay special attention to the growing capacity of renewable resources. Otherwise, even the usage of tough punishment cannot save the community from an undesired end.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2SnwQ8vO1ew" width="1" />

<p>by Bita Khalili, Laura Merlini, Vincent Vincenzetti, Sophie G. Martin, Dimitrios Vavylonis</p>

In mating fission yeast cells, sensing and response to extracellular pheromone concentrations occurs through an exploratory Cdc42 patch that stochastically samples the cell cortex before stabilizing towards a mating partner. Active Ras1 (Ras1-GTP), an upstream regulator of Cdc42, and Gap1, the GTPase-activating protein for Ras1, localize at the patch. We developed a reaction-diffusion model of Ras1 patch appearance and disappearance with a positive feedback by a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) and Gap1 inhibition. The model is based on new estimates of Ras1-GDP, Ras1-GTP and Gap1 diffusion coefficients and rates of cytoplasmic exchange studied by FRAP. The model reproduces exploratory patch behavior and lack of Ras1 patch in cells lacking Gap1. Transition to a stable patch can occur by change of Gap1 rates constants or local increase of the positive feedback rate constants. The model predicts that the patch size and number of patches depend on the strength of positive and negative feedbacks. Measurements of Ras1 patch size and number in cells overexpressing the Ras1 GEF or Gap1 are consistent with the model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ekpK2OCnuMg" width="1" />

<p>by Ximo Pechuan, Raymond Puzio, Aviv Bergman</p>

Protocell multilevel selection models have been proposed to study the evolutionary dynamics of vesicles encapsulating a set of replicating, competing and mutating sequences. The frequency of the different sequence types determines protocell survival through a fitness function. One of the defining features of these models is the genetic load generated when the protocell divides and its sequences are assorted between the offspring vesicles. However, these stochastic assortment effects disappear when the redundancy of each sequence type is sufficiently high. The fitness dependence of the vesicle with its sequence content is usually defined without considering a realistic account on how the lower level dynamics would specify the protocell fitness. Here, we present a protocell model with a fitness function determined by the output flux of a simple metabolic network with the aim of understanding how the evolution of both kinetic and topological features of metabolism would have been constrained by the particularities of the protocell evolutionary dynamics. In our model, the sequences inside the vesicle are both the carriers of information and Michaelis-Menten catalysts exhibiting saturation. We found that the saturation of the catalysts controlling the metabolic fluxes, achievable by modifying the kinetic or stoichiometric parameters, provides a mechanism to ameliorate the assortment load by increasing the redundancy of the catalytic sequences required to achieve the maximum flux. Regarding the network architecture, we conclude that combinations of parallel network motifs and bimolecular catalysts are a robust way to increase the complexity of the metabolism enclosed by the protocell.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/50Cx1p0DxGg" width="1" />

<p>by Malbor Asllani, Paul Expert, Timoteo Carletti</p>

Many collective phenomena in Nature emerge from the -partial- synchronisation of the units comprising a system. In the case of the brain, this self-organised process allows groups of neurons to fire in highly intricate partially synchronised patterns and eventually lead to high level cognitive outputs and control over the human body. However, when the synchronisation patterns are altered and hypersynchronisation occurs, undesirable effects can occur. This is particularly striking and well documented in the case of epileptic seizures and tremors in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. In this paper, we propose an innovative, minimally invasive, control method that can effectively desynchronise misfiring brain regions and thus mitigate and even eliminate the symptoms of the diseases. The control strategy, grounded in the Hamiltonian control theory, is applied to ensembles of neurons modelled via the Kuramoto or the Stuart-Landau models and allows for heterogeneous coupling among the interacting unities. The theory has been complemented with dedicated numerical simulations performed using the small-world Newman-Watts network and the random Erdős-Rényi network. Finally the method has been compared with the gold-standard Proportional-Differential Feedback control technique. Our method is shown to achieve equivalent levels of desynchronisation using lesser control strength and/or fewer controllers, being thus minimally invasive.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HZMLntdffDE" width="1" />

<p>by Antoine de Weck, Javad Golji, Michael D. Jones, Joshua M. Korn, Eric Billy, E. Robert McDonald III, Tobias Schmelzle, Hans Bitter, Audrey Kauffmann</p>

Cell autonomous cancer dependencies are now routinely identified using CRISPR loss-of-function viability screens. However, a bias exists that makes it difficult to assess the true essentiality of genes located in amplicons, since the entire amplified region can exhibit lethal scores. These false-positive hits can either be discarded from further analysis, which in cancer models can represent a significant number of hits, or methods can be developed to rescue the true-positives within amplified regions. We propose two methods to rescue true positive hits in amplified regions by correcting for this copy number artefact. The Local Drop Out (LDO) method uses the relative lethality scores within genomic regions to assess true essentiality and does not require additional orthogonal data (e.g. copy number value). LDO is meant to be used in screens covering a dense region of the genome (e.g. a whole chromosome or the whole genome). The General Additive Model (GAM) method models the screening data as a function of the known copy number values and removes the systematic effect from the measured lethality. GAM does not require the same density as LDO, but does require prior knowledge of the copy number values. Both methods have been developed with single sample experiments in mind so that the correction can be applied even in smaller screens. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of both methods at removing the copy number effect and rescuing hits from some of the amplified regions. We estimate a 70–80% decrease of false positive hits with either method in regions of high copy number compared to no correction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HKcn4ktDbyU" width="1" />

Two papers in Neuron provide compelling new indications of a link between herpesviruses and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Readhead et al. report an increased abundance of human herpesviruses 6A and 7 (HHV-6A/7) in AD brain, whereas Eimer et al. show that binding of the AD signature protein, Aβ, to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HHV-6 surface glycoproteins causes fibrillar Aβ agglutination that can protect against viral challenge.

Hearing loss in mammals is an irreversible process caused by degeneration of the hair cells of the inner ear. Current therapies for hearing loss include hearing aids and cochlear implants that provide substantial benefits to most patients, but also have several shortcomings. There is great interest in the development of regenerative therapies to treat deafness in the future. Cell-based therapies, based either on adult, multipotent stem, or other types of pluripotent cells, offer promise for generating differentiated cell types to replace lost or damaged hair cells of the inner ear.

<p>by Onno van der Groen, Matthew F. Tang, Nicole Wenderoth, Jason B. Mattingley</p>

Perceptual decision-making relies on the gradual accumulation of noisy sensory evidence. It is often assumed that such decisions are degraded by adding noise to a stimulus, or to the neural systems involved in the decision making process itself. But it has been suggested that adding an optimal amount of noise can, under appropriate conditions, enhance the quality of subthreshold signals in nonlinear systems, a phenomenon known as <i>stochastic resonance</i>. Here we asked whether perceptual decisions made by human observers obey these stochastic resonance principles, by adding noise directly to the visual cortex using transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) while participants judged the direction of coherent motion in random-dot kinematograms presented at the fovea. We found that adding tRNS bilaterally to visual cortex enhanced decision-making when stimuli were just below perceptual threshold, but not when they were well below or above threshold. We modelled the data under a drift diffusion framework, and showed that bilateral tRNS selectively increased the drift rate parameter, which indexes the rate of evidence accumulation. Our study is the first to provide causal evidence that perceptual decision-making is susceptible to a stochastic resonance effect induced by tRNS, and to show that this effect arises from selective enhancement of the rate of evidence accumulation for sub-threshold sensory events.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hJxUrn196_0" width="1" />

<p>by Darshan Mandge, Rohit Manchanda</p>

Bladder small DRG neurons, which are putative nociceptors pivotal to urinary bladder function, express more than a dozen different ionic membrane mechanisms: ion channels, pumps and exchangers. Small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels which were earlier thought to be gated solely by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca]<sub>i</sub>) have recently been shown to exhibit inward rectification with respect to membrane potential. The effect of SK<sub>Ca</sub> inward rectification on the excitability of these neurons is unknown. Furthermore, studies on the role of K<sub>Ca</sub> channels in repetitive firing and their contributions to different types of afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in these neurons are lacking. In order to study these phenomena, we first constructed and validated a biophysically detailed single compartment model of bladder small DRG neuron soma constrained by physiological data. The model includes twenty-two major known membrane mechanisms along with intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics comprising Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion, cytoplasmic buffering, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial mechanisms. Using modelling studies, we show that inward rectification of SK<sub>Ca</sub> is an important parameter regulating neuronal repetitive firing and that its absence reduces action potential (AP) firing frequency. We also show that SK<sub>Ca</sub> is more potent in reducing AP spiking than the large-conductance K<sub>Ca</sub> channel (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) in these neurons. Moreover, BK<sub>Ca</sub> was found to contribute to the fast AHP (fAHP) and SK<sub>Ca</sub> to the medium-duration (mAHP) and slow AHP (sAHP). We also report that the slow inactivating A-type K<sup>+</sup> channel (slow K<sub>A</sub>) current in these neurons is composed of 2 components: an initial fast inactivating (time constant ∼ 25-100 ms) and a slow inactivating (time constant ∼ 200-800 ms) current. We discuss the implications of our findings, and how our detailed model can help further our understanding of the role of C-fibre afferents in the physiology of urinary bladder as well as in certain disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w7djXqEISFc" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.</p>

Abstract
<p>Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning (RL). These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted-U shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.</p>

<p>The prevalence of nicotine dependence is higher than that for any other substance abuse disorder; still, the underlying mechanisms are not fully established. To this end, we studied acute effects by nicotine on neurotransmission in the dorsolateral striatum, a key brain region with respect to the formation of habits. Electrophysiological recordings in acutely isolated brain slices from rodent showed that nicotine (10 nm to 10 μm) produced an LTD of evoked field potentials. Current-clamp recordings revealed no significant effect by nicotine on membrane voltage or action potential frequency, indicating that the effect by nicotine is primarily synaptic. Nicotine did not modulate sIPSCs, or the connectivity between fast-spiking interneurons and medium spiny neurons, as assessed by whole-cell recordings combined with optogenetics. However, the frequency of sEPSCs was significantly depressed by nicotine. The effect by nicotine was mimicked by agonists targeting α7- or α4-containing nAChRs and blocked in slices pretreated with a mixture of antagonists targeting these receptor subtypes. Nicotine-induced LTD was furthermore inhibited by dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and occluded by D2 receptor agonist. In addition, modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission suppressed the responding to nicotine, which might reflect upon the postulated role for nAChRs as a presynaptic filter to differentially govern dopamine release depending on neuronal activity. Nicotine-induced suppression of excitatory inputs onto medium spiny neurons may promote nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation and putatively initiate neuroadaptations that could contribute to the transition toward compulsive drug taking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To decrease smoking, prevalence factors that may contribute to the development of nicotine addiction need to be identified. The data presented here show that nicotine suppresses striatal neurotransmission by selectively reducing the frequency of excitatory inputs to medium spiny neurons (MSNs) while rendering excitability, inhibitory neurotransmission, and fast-spiking interneuron-MSN connectivity unaltered. In addition, we show that the effect displayed by nicotine outlasts the presence of the drug, which could be fundamental for the addictive properties of nicotine. Considering the inhibitory tone displayed by MSNs on dopaminergic cell bodies and local terminals, nicotine-induced long-lasting depression of striatal output could play a role in behavioral transformations associated with nicotine use, and putatively elicit neuroadaptations underlying compulsive drug-seeking habits.</p>

<p>In the nervous system, myelination of axons enables rapid impulse conduction and is a specialized function of glial cells. Myelinating glia are the last cell type to emerge in the evolution of vertebrate nervous systems, presumably in ancient jawed vertebrates (gnathostomata) because jawless vertebrates (agnathans) lack myelin. We have hypothesized that, in these unmyelinated species, evolutionary progenitors of myelinating cells must have existed that should still be present in contemporary agnathan species. Here, we used advanced electron microscopic techniques to reveal axon–glia interactions in the sea lamprey <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>. By quantitative assessment of the spinal cord and the peripheral lateral line nerve, we observed a marked maturation-dependent growth of axonal calibers. In peripheral nerves, all axons are ensheathed by glial cells either in bundles or, when larger than the threshold caliber of 3 μm, individually. The ensheathing glia are covered by a basal lamina and express <i>SoxE</i>-transcription factors, features of mammalian Remak-type Schwann cells. In larval lamprey, the ensheathment of peripheral axons leaves gaps that are closed in adults. CNS axons are also covered to a considerable extent by glial processes, which contain a high density of intermediate filaments, glycogen particles, large lipid droplets, and desmosomes, similar to mammalian astrocytes. Indeed, by <i>in situ</i> hybridization, these glial cells express the astrocyte marker <i>Aldh1l1</i>. Specimens were of unknown sex. Our observations imply that radial sorting, ensheathment, and presumably also metabolic support of axons are ancient functions of glial cells that predate the evolutionary emergence of myelin in jawed vertebrates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We used current electron microscopy techniques to examine axon–glia units in a nonmyelinated vertebrate species, the sea lamprey. In the PNS, lamprey axons are fully ensheathed either individually or in bundles by cells ortholog to Schwann cells. In the CNS, axons associate with astrocyte orthologs, which contain glycogen and lipid droplets. We suggest that ensheathment, radial sorting, and metabolic support of axons by glial cells predate the evolutionary emergence of myelin in ancient jawed vertebrates.</p>

<p>As the major glia in PNS, Schwann cells play a critical role in peripheral nerve injury repair. Finding an efficient approach to promote Schwann cell activation might facilitate peripheral nerve repair. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression and take part in many biological processes. However, the role of lncRNAs in peripheral nerve regeneration is not fully understood. In this study, we obtained a global lncRNA portrayal following sciatic nerve injury in male rats using microarray and further investigated one of these dys-regulated lncRNAs, TNXA-PS1, confirming its vital role in regulating Schwann cells. Silencing TNAX-PS1 could promote Schwann cell migration and mechanism analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might exert its regulatory role by sponging miR-24–3p/miR-152–3p and affecting dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) expression. Systematic lncRNA expression profiling of sciatic nerve segments following nerve injury in rats suggested lncRNA TNXA-PS1 as a key regulator of Schwann cell migration, providing a potential therapeutic target for nerve injury repair.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The PNS has an intrinsic regeneration capacity after injury in which Schwann cells play a crucial role. Therefore, further exploration of functional molecules in the Schwann cell phenotype modulation is of great importance. We have identified a set of dys-regulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in rats following sciatic nerve injury and found that the expression of TNXA-PS1 was significantly downregulated. Mechanically analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might act as a competing endogenous RNA to affect dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) expression, regulating migration of Schwann cells. This study provides for the first time a global landscape of lncRNAs following sciatic nerve injury in rats and broadens the known functions of lncRNA during nerve injury. The investigation of TNXA-PS1 might facilitate the development of novel targets for nerve injury therapy.</p>

<p>Motor thalamus (Mthal) comprises the ventral anterior, ventral lateral, and ventral medial thalamic nuclei in rodents. This subcortical hub receives input from the basal ganglia (BG), cerebellum, and reticular thalamus in addition to connecting reciprocally with motor cortical regions. Despite the central location of Mthal, the mechanisms by which it influences movement remain unclear. To determine its role in generating ballistic, goal-directed movement, we recorded single-unit Mthal activity as male rats performed a two-alternative forced-choice task. A large population of Mthal neurons increased their firing briefly near movement initiation and could be segregated into functional groups based on their behavioral correlates. The activity of "initiation" units was more tightly locked to instructional cues than movement onset, did not predict which direction the rat would move, and was anticorrelated with reaction time (RT). Conversely, the activity of "execution" units was more tightly locked to movement onset than instructional cues, predicted which direction the rat would move, and was anticorrelated with both RT and movement time. These results suggest that Mthal influences choice RT performance in two stages: short latency, nonspecific action initiation followed by action selection/invigoration. We discuss the implications of these results for models of motor control incorporating BG and cerebellar circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor thalamus (Mthal) is a central node linking subcortical and cortical motor circuits, though its precise role in motor control is unclear. Here, we define distinct populations of Mthal neurons that either encode movement initiation, or both action selection and movement vigor. These results have important implications for understanding how basal ganglia, cerebellar, and motor cortical signals are integrated. Such an understanding is critical to defining the pathophysiology of a range of BG- and cerebellum-linked movement disorders, as well as refining pharmacologic and neuromodulatory approaches to their treatment.</p>

To study synaptic plasticity in human neuronal circuits poses a huge challenge, since live human neurons and synapses are not readily accessible. Despite this, various lines of research have provided insights in properties of adult human synapses and their plasticity both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>, with some unexpected surprises. We first discuss the experimental approaches to study activity-dependent plasticity of adult human synapses, and then highlight rules and mechanisms of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) found in these synapses. Finally, we conclude with thoughts on how these synaptic principles can underlie human learning and memory.</p></div>
