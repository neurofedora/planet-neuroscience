                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 16 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57855-x">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-57855-x</a></p>Despite the well-known functional group tolerance of palladium catalysis, which makes it valuable in late-stage functionalization, a palladium-catalyzed deuteration of aryl halides with deuterium oxide has remained elusive. Herein, the authors report a palladium catalyzed deuteration reaction of aryl bromides, chlorides, and triflates with deuterium oxide.

However, it is important that our policies do not forget about those who are immobile to migration. This perspective explores different forms of involuntary immobility and how climate policy can address this.

">C9orf72 Repeat Expansion Induces Metabolic Dysfunction in Human iPSC- Derived Microglia and Modulates Glial-Neuronal Crosstalk</a></h4>

              
                The C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, but its cell type-specific effects on energy metabolism and immune pathways remain poorly understood. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, astrocytes and microglia from C9orf72 patients and their isogenic controls, we investigated metabolic changes at the single-cell level under basal and inflammatory conditions. Our results showed that microglia are particularly susceptible to metabolic disturbances. While C9orf72 motor neurons exhibited impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced ATP production, C9orf72 microglia presented pronounced increases in glycolytic activity and oxidative stress, accompanied by the upregulation of the expression of key metabolic enzymes. These metabolic changes in microglia were exacerbated by inflammatory stimuli. To investigate how these changes affect the broader cellular environment, we developed a human iPSC-derived triculture system comprising motor neurons, astrocytes and microglia. This model revealed increased metabolic activity in all cell types and highlighted that microglia-driven metabolic reprogramming in astrocytes contributes to the vulnerability of motor neurons under inflammatory conditions. Our findings highlight the central role of microglia in driving metabolic dysregulation and intercellular crosstalk in ALS pathogenesis and suggest that targeting metabolic pathways in immune cells may provide new therapeutic avenues.

">Nanoscale Lattice Organization of Molecular Condensates Drives Compositional Degeneracy in Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity is essential for neuronal communication, involving coordinated structural, molecular and functional changes that are shaped by the nanoscale alterations of the active zone and postsynaptic density. Emerging evidence suggests that synapses function as complex information processing machines, where unique molecular assemblies shape transmission properties. Central to this is the organization of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and Bassoon within active zones. Utilizing advanced techniques like liquid-liquid phase separation, super-resolution microscopy, and data-driven models of synaptic transmission, we reveal how nanoscale "compositional degeneracy" in Bassoon and VGCCs enables synapses to achieve functional adaptability through multiple molecular configurations. By modulation of local uncertainty and implementing probabilistic inference, synapses fine-tune transmission efficiency by regulating dynamic entropy and free energy. These principles are especially evident during homeostatic scaling, where synaptic scaling mechanisms differ with neuronal maturity. This study highlights how distinct thermodynamic states in VGCC and Bassoon organization optimize information transfer at different plasticity stages. Our findings propose a refined framework for understanding synaptic transmission as an adaptable, entropy-modulated process, balancing resilience and efficiency.

">Three types of remapping with linear decoders: a population-geometric perspective</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal remapping, in which place cells form distinct activity maps across different environments, is a robustly-observed phenomenon with many theories and interpretations. Some theories view remapping as the mechanism behind reduced interference between competing spatial memories, whereas others associate it with changes in an underlying latent state representation. However, it remains unclear how these interpretations of remapping relate to one another, and what types of activity changes they are compatible with. To shed some light on these questions, here we propose a neural coding and population geometry perspective to unify and elucidate the mechanisms behind remapping. Assuming that hippocampal population activity can be understood through a linearly-decodable latent space, we show that there are three possible mechanisms to induce activity changes that resemble remapping. Remapping can be due to (i) a true change in the mapping between neural and latent space, (ii) modulation of activity due to non-spatial mixed selectivity of place cells, or (iii) neural variability outside of the latent space that reflects a redundant code. We simulate and visualize examples of these remapping types in a network model, and relate the resultant remapping behavior to various models and experimental findings in the literature. Overall, our work serves as a unifying framework with which to visualize, understand, and compare the wide array of theories and experimental observations about remapping, and may serve as a testbed for understanding neural response variability under various experimental conditions.

">Proteomic Subtyping of Alzheimer's Disease CSF links Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction to Reduced levels of Tau and Synaptic Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant clinical and molecular heterogeneity, influenced by genetic and demographic factors. Using an unbiased, network-driven approach, we analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome from 431 individuals (483 samples), including 111 African American participants, to identify core protein modules associated with AD, race, sex, and age. Our analysis revealed ten co-expression modules linked to distinct biological pathways and cell types, many of which correlated with established AD biomarkers such as {beta}-amyloid, tau, and phosphorylated tau. To further resolve disease heterogeneity, we applied a proteomic subtyping approach, identifying six distinct CSF subtypes spanning the clinical and pathological spectrum. These subtypes were validated across independent cohorts, with many aligning with previously defined AD subtypes, including those linked to neuronal hyperplasticity, immune activation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Notably, the BBB subtype, enriched with African Americans and men, was characterized by low CSF tau, high CSF/serum albumin ratios, and reduced synaptic protein levels. This subtype also exhibited increased levels of proteolytic enzymes, including thrombin and matrix metalloproteases, that cleave tau. Plasma dilution into the neuronal hyperplastic AD subtype CSF led to reduced tau and synaptic protein module levels, indicating that plasma protease activity contributes to tau and synaptic protein depletion independent of underlying brain pathology. These findings highlight the impact of BBB integrity on CSF tau levels, particularly in men and African Americans, and underscore the need for diversity-informed AD biomarker strategies to improve diagnostics and therapeutic targeting across populations.

">Unleashing the potential of OPM-MEG to study event-related fields against low-frequency artifacts: the case of sentence processing</a></h4>

              
                OPM-MEG (optically pumped magnetometers-magnetoencephalography) offers un-precedented opportunity in its proximity to the brain and in mobility, outperforming other human MEG systems. However, movements induce low-frequency artifacts (up to ~ 3 Hz) in this system, calling for pipelines that could efficiently reduce these low-frequency noises. Although a high-pass filter of e.g., 4 Hz may minimize these artifacts, it may also eliminate many event-related field (ERF) components, such as the N400 response in sentence processing studies. Moreover, as an emerging technology with expensive sensors, many labs are starting with an experimental setup with fewer sensors (e.g., ~ 10), making it challenging to reject principal components based on visually inspecting the topographic field maps. In the current paper, we show that a combination of moderate high-pass filtering (1 Hz) and evoked-biased denoising source separation (evoked-biased DSS) can effectively reveal typical N400 deflections and effects (between nouns and verbs), with a nine-sensor OPM-MEG setup. Our current pipeline paves the way to studying ERFs with OPM-MEG in more budget-friendly setups with a small number of sensors.

">Correlative light and electron microscopy reveals the fine circuit structure underlying evidence accumulation in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating information is a critical component of most circuit computations in the brain across species, yet its precise implementation at the synaptic level remains poorly understood. Dissecting such neural circuits in vertebrates requires precise knowledge of functional neural properties and the ability to directly correlate neural dynamics with the underlying wiring diagram in the same animal. Here we combine functional calcium imaging with ultrastructural circuit reconstruction, using a visual motion accumulation paradigm in larval zebrafish. Using connectomic analyses of functionally identified cells and computational modeling, we show that bilateral inhibition, disinhibition, and recurrent connectivity are prominent motifs for sensory accumulation within the anterior hindbrain. We also demonstrate that similar insights about the structure-function relationship within this circuit can be obtained through complementary methods involving cell-specific morphological labeling via photo-conversion of functionally identified neuronal response types. We used our unique ground truth datasets to train and test a novel classifier algorithm, allowing us to assign functional labels to neurons from morphological libraries where functional information is lacking. The resulting feature-rich library of neuronal identities and connectomes enabled us to constrain a biophysically realistic network model of the anterior hindbrain that can reproduce observed neuronal dynamics and make testable predictions for future experiments. Our work exemplifies the power of hypothesis-driven electron microscopy paired with functional recordings to gain mechanistic insights into signal processing and provides a framework for dissecting neural computations across vertebrates.

">Vagal afferent activation induces a NREM-sleep-like state with brain-body cooling, but locus coeruleus activation</a></h4>

              
                Parasympathetic nervous system activity, vital for restorative sleep, is influenced by vagal sensory afferents, but how these shape brain-body correlates of sleep remains open. We investigated this by combining vagal sensory neuron (VSN) stimulation with EEG/EMG, heart rate, brain-body temperature, and noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neuron population activity measures. Opto-/chemogenetic VSN manipulations in Vglut2-Cre mice were validated via in vitro synaptic physiology, cFos expression, and heart rate measures. Chemogenetic VSN stimulation during the resting phase induced a non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS)-like state with enriched, but homeostatically regulated, low-frequency (0.75-4 Hz) EEG activity, yet suppressed REMS. Simultaneously, brain-body temperatures dropped while LC activity increased. Recovery was gradual towards normal NREMS-REMS-cycles but accelerated by external warming, identifying cooling as key factor. We conclude that VSN activation can promote brain-body correlates as a continuum of normal NREM sleep while engaging forebrain neuromodulation, offering insights into mechanisms of sleep disruptions linked to autonomic dysregulation.

">Temporally and Functionally Distinct Contributions to Value Based Choice Along the Anterior-Posterior Dorsomedial Striatal Axis</a></h4>

              
                While the dorsoventral and mediolateral organization of striatum has resolved clear functional distinctions, far less is known about how the anterior-posterior striatal axis contributes to behavioral control. We explore this within the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), a key region for value-based choice, by comparing population neuronal activity and function within anterior (A-DMS) and posterior (P-DMS) subregions while mice operantly seek reward. Neural recordings show that P-DMS encoded action values and strategy information prior to choice selection while A-DMS activity represented recently selected choices and their anticipated values via a dynamic population reorganization immediately following action selection. Optogenetic perturbations were consistent with these temporally distinct coding properties as unilateral manipulation of the P-DMS prior to choice biased choice contralaterally in a value-dependent manner and unilateral inhibition of the A-DMS following choice impaired future value-based action selection. Using anterograde tracing, we found that the A-DMS and P-DMS projected to a common region within the ventromedial substantia nigra pars reticulata (vmSNr), which contained value-related signals combining aspects of upstream DMS processing. Together, our results support a model for temporally distributed influence on value-based choice across the anterior-posterior axis of the DMS.

">Are online corrections really a distinct class of movement?</a></h4>

              
                Humans have a remarkable capacity to adjust reaching movements rapidly and accurately when visual targets jump to a new location. The short latency of such online corrections has led to the hypothesis that they constitute a distinct class of movement and arise from an automatic pilot that is selectively engaged only during ongoing movements. However, concrete evidence for this hypothesis is scarce. Here, we test this idea by measuring muscle recruitment, force, and kinematics in a jumping target reaching task. In separate blocks of trials, participants were instructed to respond to target jumps by (1) following the jumped target, (2) stopping the on-going movement, or (3) ignoring the jumped target. This allowed us to establish the automaticity and timing of responses to target jumps and to compare such measures to the original reaching movement initiated from rest. We find that the earliest phase of muscle recruitment elicited by the jumped target corresponds to a subcortical reflex, beginning at ~80ms and ending by ~120ms, preceding the onset of voluntary recruitment at ~130ms. This reflex inexorably drives a reaching adjustment towards the new target in all three blocks; it is only somewhat reduced in the stop and ignore blocks. Critically, this earliest phase of muscle recruitment was also present at the exact same latency (80ms) for the original reaching movement initiated from rest. Thus, rather than supporting the model of online corrections as distinct class of movement that is mediated by an automatic pilot, our results suggest that all reaches, whether adjusted in mid-flight or initiated from rest, arise from a common nested control system featuring subcortical and cortical components whose influence can be strategically preset by task demands.

">Retrieval practice prevents stress-induced inference impairment by restoring rapid memory reactivation</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of human memory is its ability to form novel inferences by linking discrete but related events. Our study examined whether acute stress impairs memory inference in humans and assessed the potential of retrieval practice to buffer this effect. Participants were trained on pairs of images, AB and BC, to establish interconnected triads (ABC) with a shared bridge element B. Twenty-four hours later, we induced acute stress in half of the participants and then tested for their capacity to infer the indirect AC associations. Behavioral results indicated that acute stress impaired memory inference, yet targeted retrieval practice of the AB and BC pairs after encoding could prevent the stress-induced impairment in A-C inference. Using multivariate decoding analysis of human electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we provided neural evidence that bridge element B is rapidly reactivated during the inferential process, a neural signature that is predictive for subsequent successful inference. Importantly, we showed that stress disrupts this rapid neural reactivation of the brdige element, but retrieval practice can buffer the stress effect and even enhanced the strength of reactivation signals beyond the non-stress condition. Collectively, our findings pinpoint rapid memory reactivation of bridge information as an essential neural mechanism underpinning memory-based inference, which, although susceptible to stress, can be enhanced through retrieval practice. These insights suggest that building robust memory traces could enable subsequent memory inferences to be resilient to stress, highlighting that retrieval practice could sustain normal flexible cognitions under stress.

">The Adolescent Functional Connectome is Dynamically Controlled by a Sparse Core of Cognitive and Topological Hubs</a></h4>

              
                Fundamental mechanisms that control the brain's ability to dynamically respond to cognitive demands are poorly understood, especially during periods of accelerated neural and cognitive maturation, such as adolescence. Using a sparsity-promoting feedback control framework we investigated the controllability of the adolescence functional connectome. Critical feedback costs associated with a region's control action on itself and the rest of the brain were estimated using resting-state fMRI data from an early longitudinal sample in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n = 1394; median (IQR) age = 10.1 (1.1) years at baseline and 12.1 (1.1) years at follow-up). A highly reproducible, core set of predominantly highly connected regions retained their control action over the connectome under high feedback costs. They included posterior visual areas, retrosplenial cortex, cuneus and precuneus, superior parietal lobule, temporal ventral cortex and dorsolateral and lateral prefrontal cortices, i.e., both developed and developing brain regions. These regions were central to the topological organization of the connectome, consistently engaged during spontaneous coordination of resting-state networks, and overlapped with cognitive and topological brain hubs that play ubiquitous roles in cognitive function and the organization of the connectome. Also, most received (integrated) and distributed approximately equal amounts of neural information. These regions' control action was developmentally stable, i.e., critical feedback costs did not change significantly during puberty, suggesting that, despite ongoing maturation and topological changes in the adolescent brain, fundamental mechanisms of system controllability may be well developed to facilitate information processing and response to cognitive demands.

">Schwann cells modified to secrete MANF is a potential cellular therapy for peripheral nerve regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Despite several decades of research, an effective therapy for peripheral nerve regeneration is still lacking. The lack of knowledge of molecular candidates that equally promote axon regeneration and glial cell dynamics essential for regeneration poses challenges in developing effective therapies. Improper optimization of potential therapies leading to failures in ensuring their local availability in nerves also poses additional challenges. Here, we showed that the neurotrophic factor, the mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), equally promotes axon regeneration and glial cell dynamics favorable for nerve regeneration. We showed that while endogenous expression of MANF is primarily restricted to non-peptidergic sensory neurons in adult rats, exogenous MANF promotes the growth of all subtypes of adult rat sensory neurons. We also demonstrated that exogenous MANF promotes the proliferation and migration of adult rat primary Schwann Cells (SCs). Further, we found that local and repeated administration of exogenous MANF to injured mouse nerve promote axon regeneration. Finally, we devised a therapeutic approach by programming nerve resident SCs to locally and continuously deliver MANF to injured rat nerves and showed that this approach improved nerve regeneration indices. Overall, this work developed a therapeutic approach by harnessing the power of SCs as a local delivery system of MANF for improving nerve regeneration.

">Radial astroglia cooperate with microglia to clear neuronal cell bodies during zebrafish optic tectum development</a></h4>

              
                The clearance of dead cells by phagocytes is an essential component of neural development in many organisms. Microglia are the main phagocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), but the extent of participation by other glial cells remains unclear, especially under homeostatic conditions. During zebrafish optic tectum (OT) development, we observed radial astroglia forming dynamic, spherical projections from their basal processes. These projections, which we call scyllate heads, coincide with a wave of neuronal cell death in the OT. We show that scyllate heads surround the majority of dying neurons soon after phosphatidylserine exposure. However, unlike traditional phagosomes, scyllate heads persist for many hours and are rarely acidified or internalized. Instead, microglia invade scyllate heads and remove their contents for terminal degradation. Our study reveals an active role for radial astroglia in homeostatic cell clearance and cooperation between microglia and radial astroglia during zebrafish OT development.

">Temporal misalignment in scene perception: Divergent representations of locomotive action affordances in human brain responses and DNNs</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system processes scenes with remarkable speed, enabling the extraction of essential information to navigate our surroundings in a single glance. To elucidate how the brain transforms visual inputs into neural representations of navigationally relevant information, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) responses to diverse indoor and outdoor scenes along with behavioral annotations of locomotive action affordances (e.g., walking, cycling), object annotations, and low-level image features to model distinct types of scene information. Using representational similarity analysis, we examined the neural representation of locomotive action affordances over time, their co-localization within scene-selective cortex, and their computational alignment with deep neural networks (DNNs). Our results show that locomotive action affordance representations emerge within 200 ms of visual processing, showing unique contributions to EEG responses at temporally distinct time-points from objects and low-level properties. Spatiotemporal fusion with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in scene-selective brain regions reveals that both the parahippocampal (PPA) and occipital place region (OPA), but not the medial place region (MPA), contribute to locomotive action affordance representations, with a distinct temporal hierarchy between them. While DNNs exhibit good predictivity of early EEG responses, they primarily capture low-level features and show limited alignment with affordance processing. These findings reveal a temporally distinct neural representation of action affordances and highlight a limitation of current DNNs in modeling affordance perception.

">SpikeMAP: An unsupervised spike sorting pipeline for cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons in high-density multielectrode arrays with ground-truth validation</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale extracellular recording techniques represent a major advance in interrogating the structure and dynamics of neuronal circuits. However, methods that can resolve cell-type identity in a principled way, while simultaneously scaling to thousands of neurons, are currently lacking. Here, we introduce spikeMAP, a pipeline for the analysis of large-scale recordings of in vitro cortical activity that not only allows for the detection of spikes produced by single neurons (spike sorting), but also allows for the reliable distinction between genetically determined cell types by utilizing viral and optogenetic strategies as ground-truth validation. This approach tightly integrates the data analysis pipeline to an optogenetic, viral, and pharmacological protocol allowing for the dynamical probing of distinct cell-types while simultaneously recording from large populations. The novelty of spikeMAP is to combine a stream of well-established analysis techniques in an end-to-end fashion, creating a unified framework as follows. First, individual spike waveforms are fitted by spline interpolation to estimate their half-amplitude and peak-to-peak durations. These values are then entered in a principal component analysis with k-means clustering to identify uncorrelated signals from single channels on the array. Optimal separability of clusters is assessed by linear discriminant analysis. Finally, each channels source location is identified using spatiotemporal characteristics of spike waveforms across the array. We show that spikeMAP can resolve cell type identity in high-density arrays by analyzing activity monitored from mouse prefrontal cortex in vitro slices with an array of 4,096 closely-spaced channels. Using an optotagging functional strategy, we show an effective distinction of regular-spiking excitatory neurons from fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons using measures of action potential waveform, Fano factor, and spatially-dependent cross-correlations. In sum, the approach introduces a toolbox, validated by an experimental pipeline, that allows for a comprehensive characterization of neuronal activity obtained from different cell-types in high-density multielectrode recordings. This provides a scalable approach to investigate the interplay between distinct cell types in microcircuits of the brain.

                Semilunar Granule Cells (SGCs) are sparse dentate gyrus projection neurons whose role in the dentate circuit, including pathway specific inputs, remains unknown. We report that SGCs receive more frequent spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs than granule cells (GCs). Dual GC-SGC recordings identified that SGCs receive stronger medial entorhinal cortex and associational synaptic drive but lack short-term facilitation of lateral entorhinal cortex inputs observed in GCs. SGCs dendritic spine density in proximal and middle dendrites was greater than in GCs. However, the strength of commissural inputs and dendritic input integration, examined in passive morphometric simulations, were not different between cell types. Activity dependent labeling identified an overrepresentation of SGCs among neuronal ensembles in both mice trained in a spatial memory task and task naive controls. The divergence of modality specific inputs to SGCs and GCs can enable parallel processing of information streams and expand the computational capacity of the dentate gyrus.

">Muscarinic type 1 receptor activated effectors in principal neurons of the rat basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a crucial role in context-specific learning and memory by integrating valence-specific stimuli with internal physiological states. Cholinergic signaling systems modulate neural excitability to influence information processing in the BLA. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are of particular interest because aberrant mAChR signaling in BLA circuits is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, substance use, and age-related cognitive decline. This study evaluates mAChR activation in BLA principal neurons (PNs) in juvenile rat brain slices using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We found that carbachol (CCh, a selective mAChR agonist) excites BLA PNs voltage clamped near the resting potential (as indicated by a downward shift in holding current), but produces a biphasic change in membrane resistance, indicating an involvement of multiple effectors. More specifically, we observed that CCh excites BLA PNs by inhibiting the afterhyperpolarization (AHP), by reducing a steady state inhibitory current, and by promoting an afterdepolarization (ADP). We further identify and characterize a CCh-induced and calcium-activated non-selective cation current (ICAN) that underlies the ADP in voltage clamp. Overall, our findings provide new insights into specific effectors modulated by activation of pirenzepine sensitive mAChRs expressed by BLA PNs. We also reveal new details about the time- and voltage-dependence of current carried by the CCh/M1R-activated ICAN like current in BLA PNs, and highlight its ability to promote a suprathreshold ADP capable of generating sustained firing after a brief excitatory stimulus. Improved understanding of these effectors will provide potentially valuable new insights on the wide range of mechanisms through which cholinergic system dysfunction can lead to impaired executive function.

">Neural network-based encoding in free-viewing fMRI with precision models</a></h4>

              
                Representations learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit a remarkable resemblance to information processing patterns observed in the primate visual system on large neuroimaging datasets collected under diverse, naturalistic visual stimulation but with instruction for participants to maintain central fixation. However, this condition diverges significantly from ecologically valid visual behaviour, suppresses activity in visually active regions, and imposes substantial cognitive load on the viewing task. We present a modification of the encoding model framework, adapting it for use with naturalistic vision datasets acquired under fully natural viewing conditions -- without fixation -- by incorporating eye-tracking data and receptive field maps. Our precision encoding models were trained on the StudyForrest dataset, which features fully naturalistic movie viewing. By combining voxel-specific population receptive field estimates with eye-tracking data for each frame, we generate subject- and voxel-specific feature time series. These time series are constructed by sampling only the locally and temporally relevant elements of the CNN feature map for each voxel. Our results demonstrate that precision encoding models outperform conventional encoding models. This framework provides a strong foundation and justification for future large-scale data collection under fixation-free, fully naturalistic viewing conditions.

">HIPPIE: A Multimodal Deep Learning Model for Electrophysiological Classification of Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular electrophysiological recordings present unique computational challenges for neuronal classification due to noise, technical variability, and batch effects across experimental systems. We introduce HIPPIE (High-dimensional Interpretation of Physiological Patterns In Extracellular recordings), a deep learning framework that combines self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled datasets with supervised fine-tuning to classify neurons from extracellular recordings. Using conditional convolutional joint autoencoders, HIPPIE learns robust, technology-adjusted representations of waveforms and spiking dynamics. This model can be applied to electrophysiological classification and clustering across diverse biological cultures and technologies. We validated HIPPIE on both in vivo mouse recordings and in vitro brain slices, where it demonstrated superior performance over other unsupervised methods in cell-type discrimination and aligned closely with anatomically defined classes. Its latent space organizes neurons along electrophysiological gradients, while enabling batch and individual corrected alignment of recordings across experiments. HIPPIE establishes a general framework for systematically decoding neuronal diversity in native and engineered systems.

">Network geometry shapes multi-task representational transformations across human cortex</a></h4>

              
                The human brain's ability to perform a wide variety of possible tasks raises fundamental questions about how distributed neural circuits transform and integrate diverse task-related information. Using fMRI data from participants performing 16 diverse tasks and at rest, we investigated how intrinsic connectivity patterns shape task representations across the human cortex. We found that cross-region connectivity dimensionality strongly predicts representational transformations between brain regions: low-dimensional connectivity corresponds to representational compression, while high-dimensional connectivity corresponds to expansion. Modeling activity flow over these connections, we determined that task-evoked activity flows over intrinsic connections generate diverse representational geometries along the cortical hierarchy. Critically, in nearly all brain regions, connectivity-based transformations produced activity patterns that more closely matched their targets than their source representations, demonstrating that connectivity patterns actively transform neural representations. Additionally, we found that regions with lower dimensional connectivity show stronger cross-task similarities, indicative of shared latent task features that generalize neural processing across tasks. In contrast, we found that regions with higher-dimensional connectivity exhibit strong conjunctive coding of task variables, enabling representations for task-specific scenarios. These findings demonstrate how the network geometry of the brain's intrinsic connectivity architecture systematically shapes the transformation of task representations across the cortex to support performance of diverse tasks.

">Ontogeny of the spinal cord dorsal horn</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal horn of the mammalian spinal cord is an exquisite example of form serving function. It is comprised of diverse neuronal populations stacked into laminae, each of which receives different circuit connections and plays specialized roles in behavior. An outstanding question is how this organization emerges during development from an apparently homogeneous pool of neural progenitors. Here, we found that dorsal neurons are diversified by time, with families of related cell types born as temporal cohorts, and by a spatial-molecular gradient that specifies the full array of individual cell types. Excitatory dorsal neurons then settle in a chronotopic arrangement that transforms their progressive birthdates into anatomical order. This establishes the dorsal horn laminae, as these neurons are also required for spatial organization of inhibitory neurons and sensory axons. This work reveals essential ontogenetic principles that shape dorsal progenitors into the diverse cell types and architecture that subserve sensorimotor behavior.

">Co-Activation Patterns in Neonates using High-Density Diffuse Optical Tomography: Insights into Early Dynamic Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic functional connectivity (FC) in neonates is a growing area of interest due to the developmental significance of early functional networks. There are several emerging techniques to measure dynamic FC, adding new perspectives to well-studied static FC networks. Recent dynamic FC studies suggest that adult resting state networks are driven by key moments of dynamic activity rather than sustained correlations. Co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis leverages this theory, clustering high-activity frames to identify recurring configurations of significant activity. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) is an infant-friendly modality that measures hemodynamic changes in the cortex. HD-DOT has been used to investigate static FC in term-aged infants. The CAP approach is a promising avenue to examine dynamic FC in neonates, but it is yet untested in neonatal HD-DOT. This study validates the CAP approach for neonatal HD-DOT and presents novel decompositions of neonate FC networks. HD-DOT data were acquired from a cohort of sleeping term newborns at the Rosie Hospital, Cambridge UK (n = 44, postmenstrual age = 40+3 (range: 38+2 - 42+6) weeks). The top 15% of seed-selected frames were clustered using the K-means algorithm for three regions of interest (ROIs: frontal, central, and parietal) to identify significant seed-associated patterns of co-activation or co-deactivation. These patterns (CAPs) were characterized using four metrics: consistency, fractional occupancy, dwell time, and transition likelihood. Distinct CAPs were identified for frontal, central, and parietal regions of interest. These CAPs had high consistency scores, validating the efficacy of the CAP methodology for newborn HD-DOT. The CAP decomposition revealed significant patterns obscured by static analysis. Several neonate CAPs illustrate frontoparietal activity, potentially reflecting early default mode network activity, which is immature and modular for the first year after birth. This work demonstrates the utility of CAP analysis with newborn HD-DOT and provides new insight into brain dynamics of early resting state networks.

">A FMRF-amide peptide that regulates cell non-autonomous protein homeostasis in C. elegans.</a></h4>

              
                The coordination of protein homeostasis from the brain to periphery is essential for the health and survival of all animals. In C. elegans, glia serve a central role in coordinating organismal protein homeostasis and longevity via the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER). However, the full extent of the cell non-autonomous response and the identity of the signaling molecules required remained unknown. Here, we show that glial UPRER activation induces robust transcriptomic changes in specific tissue types across the animal, particularly in pathways related to neuropeptide signaling. We performed neuropeptidomics and loss and gain-of-function genetic screens and identified a single neuropeptide, FLP-17, that is sufficient but not necessary to induce cell non-autonomous activation of the UPRER. FLP-17 is sufficient to protect against chronic ER stress and age-dependent protein aggregation. We determined that FLP-17 acts through the receptor, EGL-6, to activate cell non-autonomous UPRER. This work reveals a complex peptidergic signaling network initiated by glial activation of the UPRER to regulate organismal protein homeostasis.

">Somatostatine interneurons mediate dopamine-dependent sensory gating in the orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex continuously filters irrelevant stimuli, and deficits in this sensory gating predispose to psychotic disorders. In schizophrenia, the normally observed suppression of second response to two paired sounds is drastically reduced. Apart from sensitivity to critical schizophrenia players as NMDA and dopamine, the microcircuitry behind gating remains unknown. We found that the first sound excitatory response recruits, via NMDA receptors, local inhibition to gate the second response via GABAB receptors. Optogenetic inhibition of somatostatine-interneurons counteracted gating more effectively compared to parvalbumine-positive interneurons. Dopamine local blockade also counteracted gating, and dopamine effect was prevented by somatostatine-, but not parvalbumine-, optoactivation. Thus, prefrontal gating is mediated by NMDA-dependent recruitment of dendrite-targeting, somatostatine-interneurons, facilitated by dopamine. The results identify a critical synapse to better target psychose-prone disorders.

	<p>Background: Recent research suggests that an athlete&amp;amp;rsquo;s gaze behavior plays a significant role in expert sport performance. However, there is a lack of studies investigating sex differences in gaze behavior during technical and tactical actions. Objectives: Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the eye movements of elite female and male handball goalkeepers during penalty throws. Methods: In total, 40 handball goalkeepers participated in the study (female: n = 20; male: n = 20). Eye movements were recorded during a series of five penalty throws in real-time conditions. The number of fixations and dwell time, including quiet eye, for selected areas of interest were recorded using a mobile eye-tracking system. Results: Significant differences were found in quiet-eye duration between effective and ineffective goalkeeper interventions (females: mean difference (MD) = 92.26; p = 0.005; males: MD = 122.83; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Significant differences in gaze behavior between female and male handball goalkeepers were observed, specifically in the number of fixations and fixation duration on the selected areas of interest (AOIs). Male goalkeepers primarily observed the throwing upper arm AOI, the throwing forearm (MD = 15.522; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), the throwing arm AOI (MD = 6.83; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and the ball (MD = 7.459; z = 3.47; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), whereas female goalkeepers mainly observed the torso AOI (MD = 14.264; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and the head AOI (MD = 11.91; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) of the throwing player. Conclusions: The results suggest that female goalkeepers&amp;amp;rsquo; gaze behavior is based on a relatively constant observation of body areas to recall task-specific information from memory, whilst male goalkeepers mainly observe moving objects in spatio-temporal areas. From a practical perspective, these results can be used to develop perceptual training programs tailored to athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; sex.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder, with onset typically occurring in late adolescence or early adulthood. Early identification of psychotic symptoms, especially those occurring before age 12, has been linked to better long-term outcomes. This study aims to assess the presence of psychotic spectrum symptoms before the age of 12 in adult schizophrenia patients and explore their clinical implications for early detection and intervention. Methods: This retrospective, observational study included 170 adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, confirmed by the SCID-5. Patients were recruited from the University of Siena Medical Center and completed the modified lifetime version of the Psychotic Spectrum Self-Report (PSY-SR) questionnaire, which assessed the onset of specific psychotic symptoms before and after age 12. Symptom severity was evaluated using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). This study also examined the impact of the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) on symptom severity. Results: In our cohort, 21% of patients exhibited prodromal symptoms before age 12 (95% CI: 15&amp;amp;ndash;27%). Prodromal symptoms were linked to a 9.53-point increase in the BPRS scores (p = 0.0478) and a 0.50-point increase in the CGI scores (p = 0.0347). The age of symptom onset negatively correlated with the BPRS scores (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), with each year of delay resulting in a 1.33-point decrease. The DUP correlated significantly with both the BPRS (&amp;amp;rho; = 0.97) and CGI scores (&amp;amp;rho; = 0.94). The multivariate analysis revealed that a longer DUP was associated with significant increases in both scores: a 27.16-point increase in the BPRS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) for a moderate DUP and a 67.51-point increase (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) for a severe DUP. The CGI scores increased by 1.11 points with a moderate DUP and 3.17 points with a severe DUP (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). However, the interaction between the DUP and prodromal symptoms at age 12 was not significant, indicating similar impacts of the DUP regardless of early symptom onset. Conclusions: The results support the critical importance of early detection and intervention in schizophrenia. Early psychotic spectrum symptoms, particularly those occurring before age 12, are significant predictors of later severity and functional impairment. This study underscores the value of screening tools like the PSY-SR for identifying prodromal symptoms and facilitating timely intervention. Our findings highlight the need for the early identification of psychotic symptoms, particularly in at-risk populations, to improve long-term outcomes. Intervening before the onset of full-blown psychosis may reduce the severity of schizophrenia and promote better clinical outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Olfactory decline is common in normal aging and frequent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Therefore, it has been suggested as a marker for the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) progression to AD. Although suggested, the relationship between olfactory deficits and cerebral atrophy in MCI conversion to AD is still debated. This study aims at investigating the olfaction-related morphological and behavioural alterations in MCI in order to understand whether they can predict the progression to AD. Methods: Twenty-seven MCI patients and thirty-five healthy controls (HCs) took part in the study, with follow-up showing conversion to AD in thirteen patients (converter-MCI, cMCI). The Burgarth Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks Tests (threshold&amp;amp;mdash;TT, discrimination&amp;amp;mdash;DT, identification&amp;amp;mdash;IT) assessed the olfactory capacities. The Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis investigated the atrophic patterns. Results: The Receiving Operating Characteristics analyses demonstrated that DT and IT could distinguish HC from MCI (DT Area Under Curve&amp;amp;mdash;AUC = 0.8; IT AUC = 0.8), as well as cMCI from sMCI (stable) patients (DT AUC = 0.7; IT AUC = 0.6), similarly to memory and executive functions tests. Olfactory performance positively correlated with memory tests in sMCI (all rhos &amp;amp;ge; 0.8, all ps &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), whereas it positively correlated with executive functions in cMCI (all rhos &amp;amp;ge; 0.6, all ps &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). VBM results revealed distinct atrophic patterns in cMCI, especially in the olfactory cortex, that were already present at the MCI diagnosis, before AD conversion. A larger volume of the olfactory cortex was associated with better memory and executive functions. Conclusions: Quantitative olfactory and morphological patterns represent non-invasive, predictive biomarkers of the MCI progression to AD; thus, their assessments at MCI onset allows earlier interventions for MCI patients.</p>

                Background The global shift in corporate philosophy from wealth maximization to share value creation has propelled sustainable finance into the forefront of research endeavours. Despite its significance, the realm of sustainable finance, especially in the context of mergers and acquisitions, remains relatively underexplored. Objective This research intends to identify the gap by conducting a cutting-edge and expansive systematic review, unravelling the intricate layers of sustainable finance concerning mergers and acquisitions. Data source The data source is Web of Science to start with, yielding 41 publications. A similar search on Scopus yielded 52 articles. Not surprisingly, the 41 publications discovered via the Web of Science search were also found in the Scopus results. Study eligibility criteria Papers on business, management, environmental studies, corporate finance, economics, and ethics are featured. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Employing advanced methodologies including machine learning tools, our research delves into domain specific influential papers, top-contributing journals, noteworthy authors, institutions, and nations. By dissecting the context and methodologies employed in scholarly works, we aim to instil a through overview of the current body of knowledge. our study categorizes the selected scholarly research into four distinct objectives, facilitating a nuanced understanding of the diverse perspectives within the field. Each stratum of papers is meticulously analysed and discussed, offering insights into key themes and patterns. To guide future research initiatives, we present a synthesis of pertinent research questions, exploring avenues such as the incorporation of innovative financial instruments like green bonds and artificial intelligence. Results Since the Sustainable Development Goals were introduced in 2016, sustainable finance has become an increasingly important topic in merger and acquisition research. Research is progressing at a rapid pace in China and Australia, while emerging nations are falling behind. In addition, this study specifies the necessity of conducting a more comprehensive examination of the habits of company representatives regarding sustainable investments. This aspect has been neglected in earlier research. Additionally, because global M&As are becoming more common, research on cross-border M&As must take precedence over domestic ones. Finally, there is a gap in the current body of knowledge about greenwashing, green audits, and the use of AI in sustainable finance. Conclusions and implications of key findings Machine learning and big data analytics may help scholars get a more thorough grasp of the historical and present significance of sustainability in M&A. New era researchers may advance the potential yet unexplored topics.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. This study’s aim was to compare the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20–40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between the number of periodontopathogens and the amount of nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected, DNA was isolated, the entire 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, and sample libraries were prepared in accordance to the Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology procedure. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity in saliva samples that were pooled according to three groups; T2DM patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3), was measured using bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the relationships between the periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium spp.) and denitrifying community (Haemophilus, Neisseria, Rothia, and Veillonella) were assessed. Results Alpha-diversity analysis revealed, the G1 group had significantly lower bacterial diversity and abundance than groups G2 and G3 (p< 0.0001). However, the microbiota profiles of diabetic patient groups with periodontitis and gingivitis were comparable. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, potential biomarkers for differentiating between gingivitis and periodontitis were discovered. Areas under the curve (AUC) between Fusobacterium spp. and Neisseria were found to be 0.94 (p = 0.43), while the AUC between P. gingivalis and Rothia was not significant (0.84, p = 0.08). Conclusion People with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis exhibit different relationships between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in their salivary microbiome. These features might be essential indicators for early identification and treatment of gingivitis in order to prevent periodontitis.

                Background Posthepatectomy liver dysfunction can lead to fatal outcomes, making it a highly undesirable complication. Numerous studies have attempted to mitigate liver dysfunction after hepatectomy. However, in the context of hepatectomy, Royal Jelly, previously known for its various benefits to liver health, has not been studied. Methods In this study, thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups. Just before undergoing 80% hepatectomy, 16 rats received intravenous Royal Jelly (RJ group), while the remaining 16 rats were administered intravenous phosphate-buffered saline in a blinded manner (PBS group). Four rats died before the scheduled time for specimen collection, leaving 28 rats for analysis. Forty-eight hours after hepatectomy, liver function (bilirubin and prothrombin time) was evaluated in all rats. Additionally, hepatocyte proliferation was examined using the Ki67 marker, which was obtained from the remaining liver specimens. The difference in bilirubin levels and prothrombin time between the two groups was tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. The difference in Ki-67 percentage between the two groups was analyzed using the t-test. Results The RJ group exhibited a lower median total bilirubin level compared to the PBS group (p<0.001). Additionally, the prothrombin time in the RJ group was lower than that of the PBS group (p<0.05). The Ki-67 percentage in the RJ group was also lower than in the PBS group (p<0.05). These findings suggest that the rats administered Royal Jelly demonstrated better liver function compared to the other group. Conclusions Administer intravenous Royal Jelly to rats undergoing 80% hepatectomy helps to protect liver function. This study indicates the potential for further research on Royal Jelly as a possible alternative for reducing liver dysfunction following surgery or other medical conditions.

                Background: Early studies found that the mental health problems rate was relatively high in university students. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental problems and associated factors in university students. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study at Supara mental health service in the Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital between February 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The secondary assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 8 items from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess suicidal risk (8Q), , and the Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-15). The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. In addition, multivariable regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results: A total of 184 participants (62% female; mean age = 22.49 years (SD 3.93) were recruited. The depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and anxiety disorders rates were 57.1%, 15.2% and 13.6%, respectively. Grade point averages (GPAs) below 3.0 (OR=3.09, 95%CI: 1.17-8.14) and a family history of mental disorder (OR=3.40, 95%CI: 1.10-10.48) were significant associated factors of moderate to severe mental health problems. Detecting and screening these factors may help the university to provide early detection and treatment for students. Conclusions: Depressive disorders were the most common mental health disorders. Females, low GPAs and a family history of mental disorder were predictors of moderate to severe mental health problems.

                Background There is evidence that patients with COVID-19 have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than the normal population. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems and their associated factors in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospitel in Thailand. Methods Mental health problems were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 items, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. McNemar's test was used to compare the prevalence of mental health problems between day 1 and day 7. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results A total of 186 participants (68.3% female; mean age = 37.21 years (SD 13.66) were recruited. The depression, anxiety, and stress rate on day 1 of admission was 26.9%, 32.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Having mild COVID-19 symptoms was a significantly associated factor with anxiety (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.05-6.89) and stress (OR=4.53, 95%CI: 1.32-15.55). Conclusions There was a high rate of mental health problems in COVID-19 patients. Detecting and managing mental health problems should be considered standard care for COVID-19 patients.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal was to examine the effect of sociodemographic variables, Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical stages and pathology on brain metabolism in Down syndrome (DS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD. Hypometabolism is more tightly related to CSF NfL levels than to core AD biomarkers. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The Earth continues to suffer from the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak even now, particularly due to the absence of appropriate theoretical frameworks for related emergency responses. In this study, we provided a simplified model for the emergency response to the coronavirus infection. We employed a qualitative content analysis, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist and flow diagram. Specifically, we examined eight underlying factors (leaders’ inability, focus on economic recovery, controversies regarding the usage of face masks, unprecedented reliance on herd immunity, hasty research and development, late decision-making, coordination failure, and occurrence of natural hazards) and eight selected overarching factors (global leadership, national policies, individual strategies, culture, research and development, timing, communication, and contingency). Considering these factors, we proposed the “Earth as a comprehensive system” approach, under which elements of the pandemic response are comprehensively included to facilitate problem-solving, social support, strategic use, assistance from various professionals, and education. The operational mechanism of this approach clearly emphasizes unified efforts for responding to a pandemic by systematically including various interdependent components of the Earth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-294/v1?src=rss">Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Case series of extensive resections and reconstructions with literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. Head and neck involvement accounts for only 10–15% of cases. Achieving clear margins in this region is challenging owing to anatomical constraints. Such cases often require extensive resection and complex reconstructions. This study presents a case series of extensive dermatofibrosarcoma resections in the head and neck, focusing on the surgical margins, reconstruction strategies, recurrence rates, and adjuvant therapy. We report four cases of head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma involving the cheek and scalp. Surgery included wide local excision with margins of 3–5 cm, which was confirmed intraoperatively by frozen section analysis. Reconstruction involved free flaps, local flaps, and healing with secondary intention. The choice depends on the defect size and location. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to selected cases. All patients achieved negative margins. One patient developed flap necrosis that required revision surgery. No local recurrence was observed during the follow-up (1–7 years). Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma justifies aggressive surgical resection to achieve clear margins, which is the key to reducing the risk of recurrence. Free flaps and local reconstruction techniques ensure good functional and aesthetic outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated in patients with close margins or deep invasion. Long-term follow-up is essential owing to its high recurrence potential.

                The enteric nervous system (ENS), an elaborate network of neurons and glia woven through the gastrointestinal tract, is integral for digestive physiology and broader human health. Commensurate with its importance, ENS dysfunction is linked to a range of debilitating gastrointestinal disorders. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), with their pleiotropic roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, serve as key developmental effectors within the ENS. Herein, we review the regulatory dynamics of miRNAs in ENS ontogeny, showcasing specific miRNAs implicated in both congenital and acquired enteric neuropathies, such as Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR), achalasia, intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND), chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), and slow transit constipation (STC). By delineating miRNA-mediated mechanisms in these diseases, we underscore their importance for ENS homeostasis and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets.

                Ali et al. investigate proteomic changes in cerebrospinal fluid across multiple Alzheimer’s disease cohorts. They identify 2,029 dysregulated proteins that cluster into four groups, enriched in different biological processes compromised during different stages of AD continuum. They create and validate robust models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status.

                Whether tissue stem cells balance self-renewal with multipotent differentiation through successive binary steps or a multiple-option choice is unclear. Puig-Barbe and colleagues find a dimerization network of bHLH factors in the Drosophila intestine that provides unified regulation to the choice between stem, absorptive, and secretory fates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93063">Microprism-based two-photon imaging of the mouse inferior colliculus reveals novel organizational principles of the auditory midbrain</a></h4>

              
                To navigate real-world listening conditions, the auditory system relies on the integration of multiple sources of information. However, to avoid inappropriate cross-talk between inputs, highly connected neural systems need to strike a balance between integration and segregation. Here, we develop a novel approach to examine how repeated neurochemical modules in the mouse inferior colliculus lateral cortex (LC) allow controlled integration of its multimodal inputs. The LC had been impossible to study via imaging because it is buried in a sulcus. Therefore, we coupled two-photon microscopy with the use of a microprism to reveal the first-ever sagittal views of the LC to examine neuronal responses with respect to its neurochemical motifs under anesthetized and awake conditions. This approach revealed marked differences in the acoustic response properties of LC and neighboring non-lemniscal portions of the inferior colliculus. In addition, we observed that the module and matrix cellular motifs of the LC displayed distinct somatosensory and auditory responses. Specifically, neurons in modules demonstrated primarily offset responses to acoustic stimuli with enhancement in responses to bimodal stimuli, whereas matrix neurons showed onset response to acoustic stimuli and suppressed responses to bimodal stimulation. Thus, this new approach revealed that the repeated structural motifs of the LC permit functional integration of multimodal inputs while retaining distinct response properties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97189">Receptor tyrosine kinases CAD96CA and FGFR1 function as the cell membrane receptors of insect juvenile hormone</a></h4>

              
                Juvenile hormone (JH) is important to maintain insect larval status; however, its cell membrane receptor has not been identified. Using the lepidopteran insect <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> (cotton bollworm), a serious agricultural pest, as a model, we determined that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) cadherin 96ca (CAD96CA) and fibroblast growth factor receptor homologue (FGFR1) function as JH cell membrane receptors by their roles in JH-regulated gene expression, larval status maintaining, rapid intracellular calcium increase, phosphorylation of JH intracellular receptor MET1 and cofactor Taiman, and high affinity to JH III. Gene knockout of <i>Cad96ca</i> and <i>Fgfr1</i> by CRISPR/Cas9 in embryo and knockdown in various insect cells, and overexpression of CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mammalian HEK-293T cells all supported CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmitting JH signal as JH cell membrane receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101851">Dual role of FOXG1 in regulating gliogenesis in the developing neocortex via the FGF signalling pathway</a></h4>

              
                In the developing vertebrate central nervous system, neurons and glia typically arise sequentially from common progenitors. Here, we report that the transcription factor Forkhead Box G1 (<i>Foxg1</i>) regulates gliogenesis in the mouse neocortex via distinct cell-autonomous roles in progenitors and postmitotic neurons that regulate different aspects of the gliogenic FGF signalling pathway. We demonstrate that loss of <i>Foxg1</i> in cortical progenitors at neurogenic stages causes premature astrogliogenesis. We identify a novel FOXG1 target, the pro-gliogenic FGF pathway component <i>Fgfr3</i>, which is suppressed by FOXG1 cell-autonomously to maintain neurogenesis. Furthermore, FOXG1 can also suppress premature astrogliogenesis triggered by the augmentation of FGF signalling. We identify a second novel function of FOXG1 in regulating the expression of gliogenic cues in newborn neocortical upper-layer neurons. Loss of FOXG1 in postmitotic neurons non-autonomously enhances gliogenesis in the progenitors via FGF signalling. These results fit well with the model that newborn neurons secrete cues that trigger progenitors to produce the next wave of cell types, astrocytes. If FGF signalling is attenuated in <i>Foxg1</i> null progenitors, they progress to oligodendrocyte production. Therefore, loss of FOXG1 transitions the progenitor to a gliogenic state, producing either astrocytes or oligodendrocytes depending on FGF signalling levels. Our results uncover how FOXG1 integrates extrinsic signalling via the FGF pathway to regulate the sequential generation of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the cerebral cortex.

                Historically, the creation of the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system of the vertebrates is inextricably linked to the unification of the cranial and sacral autonomic outflows. There is an intriguing disproportion between the entrenchment of the notion of a ‘cranio-sacral’ pathway, which informs every textbook schematic of the autonomic nervous system since the early XX<sup>th</sup> century, and the wobbliness of its two roots: an anatomical detail overinterpreted by Walter Holbrook Gaskell (the ‘gap’ between the lumbar and sacral outflows), on which John Newport Langley grafted a piece of physiology (a supposed antagonism of these two outflows on external genitals), repeatedly questioned since, to little avail. I retrace the birth of a flawed scientific concept (the cranio-sacral outflow) and the way in which it ossified instead of dissipated. Then, I suggest that the critique of the ‘cranio-sacral outflow’ invites, in turn, a radical deconstruction of the very notion of a ‘parasympathetic’ outflow, and a more realistic description of the autonomic nervous system.

                Somatic genetic heterogeneity resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations is widespread in human tissues and can cause diseases, however, few studies have investigated its role in neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients. Although the natural history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in humans, microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100218">Expression of a single inhibitory member of the Ly49 receptor family is sufficient to license NK cells for effector functions</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells recognize target cells through germline-encoded activation and inhibitory receptors enabling effective immunity against viruses and cancer. The Ly49 receptor family in the mouse and killer immunoglobin-like receptor family in humans play a central role in NK cell immunity through recognition of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and related molecules. Functionally, these receptor families are involved in the licensing and rejection of MHC-I-deficient cells through missing-self. The Ly49 family is highly polymorphic, making it challenging to detail the contributions of individual Ly49 receptors to NK cell function. Herein, we showed mice lacking expression of all Ly49s were unable to reject missing-self target cells in vivo, were defective in NK cell licensing, and displayed lower KLRG1 on the surface of NK cells. Expression of Ly49A alone on an H-2D<sup>d</sup> background restored missing-self target cell rejection, NK cell licensing, and NK cell KLRG1 expression. Thus, a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is sufficient to license NK cells and mediate missing-self in vivo.

">Distinct Alpha Networks Modulate Different Aspects of Perceptual Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                Why do we sometimes perceive a faint stimulus but miss it at other times? One explanation is that conscious perception fluctuates with the brains internal state, influencing how external stimuli are processed. Ongoing brain oscillations in the alpha band (8 to 13 Hz), thought to reflect neuronal excitability levels and play a role in functional inhibition, have been shown as a key contributor to such perceptual variability. Under high alpha conditions, faint stimuli are more likely to be missed. Some studies suggested alpha oscillations modulate perceptual criterion, shifting the threshold for interpreting sensory information; while others (including our prior work) suggested alpha modulates sensitivity, changing the precision of sensory encoding. Few studies observed modulations in both metrics, making these results appear mutually exclusive. Most studies have focused solely on overall alpha activity, whether within a region of interest or across the whole brain, and overlooked the coexistence of multiple distinct alpha networks, which fluctuate in terms of predominance and adapt to behavioural demands. Hence, it remained unclear whether different networks contributions to perception vary with their momentary state. Here, aiming to characterize how different alpha networks influence perceptual decision-making, we analyzed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded while participants performed a visual detection task with threshold-level stimuli. We found that while the visual alpha network modulates perceptual sensitivity, the sensorimotor alpha network modulates criterion in perceptual decision-making. These findings reconcile previous conflicting results and highlight the functional diversity of alpha networks in shaping perception.

">Intranasal administration of isradipine preferentially targets the brain</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Despite a concerted effort on the part of the scientific community, there is no proven strategy for slowing PD progression. Nevertheless, there are several potential drug targets that if functionally modified could alter disease course. Preclinical, epidemiological and clinical trial data suggest that Cav1 Ca2+ channels are one such target. Dihydropyridines (DHPs) are voltage-dependent, negative allosteric modulators of Cav1 Ca2+ channels that are approved for human use. However, the brain concentration of DHPs that can be safely achieved in humans with oral dosing is limited because of the widespread distribution of these channels, particularly in the vasculature. Intranasal administration of DHPs is a potential alternative delivery strategy that has been used with compounds that have similar limitations. To test the viability of this drug administration strategy, mice were intranasally or orally administered the DHP isradipine mixed in one of three vehicles. Plasma and brain concentrations of isradipine were then determined using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy at subsequent times. These studies demonstrated that intranasal administration of isradipine was able to achieve higher brain concentrations than those in the plasma, and these differences persisted for hours. Thus, intranasal administration of DHPs could be used to achieve high levels of Cav1 Ca2+ channel inhibition in the brain without producing unwanted peripheral side-effects.

">A Bitopic mTORC Inhibitor Reverses Neural Phenotypes in a Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Murine Model of SEGA-like Hamartomas</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cells (NSCs) of the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) generate diverse cell types including striatal glia during the neonatal period. NSC progeny uncouple stem cell-related mRNA transcripts from being translated during differentiation. We previously demonstrated that Tsc2 inactivation, which occurs in the neurodevelopmental disorder Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), prevents this from happening. Loss of Tsc2 causes hyperactivation of the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), altered translation, retention of stemness in striatal glia, and the production of misplaced cytomegalic neurons having hypertrophic dendrite arbors. These phenotypes model characteristics of TSC hamartomas called subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). mTORC1 inhibitors called rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are currently used to treat TSC and to assess the role of mTORC1 in regulating TSC-related phenotypes. Rapalogs are useful for treating SEGAs. However, they require lifelong application, have untoward side effects, and resistance may occur. They also incompletely inhibit mTORC1 and have limited efficacy. Rapalink-1 is a bitopic inhibitor developed to overcome the limitations of rapalogs by linking rapamycin to a second-generation mTOR ATP competitive inhibitor, MLN0128. Here we explored the effect of Rapalink-1 on a TSC hamartoma model. The model is created by neonatal electroporation of mice having conditional Tsc2 genes. Prolonged Rapalink-1 treatment could be achieved with 1.5 or 3.0 mg/Kg injected intraperitoneally every five days. Rapalink-1 inhibited the mTORC1 pathway, decreased cell size, reduced neuron dendrite arbors, and reduced hamartoma size. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that cellular phenotypes in a TSC SEGA model are reversed by Rapalink-1 which may be useful to resolve TSC brain hamartomas.

">Long-term neuron tracking reveals balance of stability and plasticity in functional properties</a></h4>

              
                Neural stability is essential for executing learned motor behaviors while plasticity provides the flexibility needed to adapt to new tasks and environments. Although low-dimensional neural population dynamics exhibit long-term stability, the extent to which individual neurons retain their functional properties over time and balance the need for both stability and plasticity remains an open question. Tracking individual neurons across multiple recording sessions is crucial to addressing this question, yet conventional methods face challenges such as electrode drift, waveform variability, and large inter-electrode distances that limit the number of channels a neuron is observed on. Here, we introduce a waveform-based neuron tracking method optimized for standard microelectrode arrays, enabling the identification of the same neurons across sessions without relying on spatial overlap, a strategy commonly leveraged with high-density electrode arrays. We apply this method to assess the longitudinal stability of multiple neural properties, including firing rates, inter-spike intervals, tuning properties, and spike-field interactions. Our findings reveal that while spike waveform properties remain stable, certain functional properties such as ISI and tuning can exhibit gradual shifts, suggesting a balance between neural stability and plasticity. Understanding the persistence of individual neural signals provides insight into learning and adaptation while advancing the study of neural stability and plasticity over extended timescales. Beyond basic neuroscience, this framework has potential to enhance the long-term reliability of brain-machine interfaces and closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems that rely on chronic neural sensing.

">Validating FOXO4 as a therapeutic target for protecting against ischemia-reperfusion-caused neuronal injury</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous data suggest that in the conditions of I/R in mice and the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in cell cultures, FOXO4 facilitates inflammation and oxidative stress in non-brain tissues, indicating that downregulation of FOXO4 may be neuroprotective in I/R-induced injury in the brain. However, this possibility has not been tested in the cerebral I/R condition. Method: FOXO4 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) primary neuronal cultures were treated with an oxidative stress inducer, menadione (MD), or OGD, and then cell viability was assessed via ATP and MTT assays. The KO and WT mice at 2-3 months were subjected to one-hour (h) transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Mice were sacrificed after 24 h for TTC staining or after 48 h for immunohistochemical staining. Alternatively, animals were allowed to survive for 1-10 days after tMCAO to test their functional recovery. Furthermore, using a structure-based approach combined with cell-based assays, we screened FOXO4 inhibitors and identified actinomycin D (ActD) as a potent FOXO4 inhibitor. We also tested the therapeutic role of ActD in both in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke. Result: KO of FOXO4 reduced the infarct volume, improved animal survival, decreased neurological deficits, and enhanced functional recovery compared to WT mice. Immunohistochemical staining of astrocytes and microglia revealed that KO brains showed a reduced number of astrocytes and microglia in the peri-infarcted area two days after I/R. Western blot analysis of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1?, IL-6, and TNF-?, indicated decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines two days following I/R. The identified FOXO4 inhibitor, ActD, attenuated oxidative stress and OGD-induced neuronal death. ActD also reduced neuronal injury of the brain and enhanced functional recovery in WT mice following tMCAO. Conclusion: We conclude that disrupting FOXO4 is neuroprotective and the identified inhibitor, ActD, may be a therapeutic agent for treating ischemic stroke induced brain injury.

">An In Vivo Model of Alpha-Synuclein Spread from Gut to Brain</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of pathological aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. There is evidence that misfolding and propagation of alpha-synuclein aggregates through networks of interconnected neurons is responsible for the pathological spread and progress neuron loss. However, in vivo models demonstrating such pathological progression remain elusive. Results: This study utilizes a zebrafish model in order to interrogate the mechanisms of alpha- synuclein toxicity and spread. We describe the development of a zebrafish model of endogenous neuronal human alpha-synuclein expression that causes, in young fish, behavioral and neuronal changes as well as microglia activation. In aged fish, alpha-synuclein expression induces a slow but progressive pathological phenotype manifesting in neuron loss within the gut and the CNS. This model is further utilized to seed gut pathology by incorporating a novel method of feeding human alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils in order to initiate protein misfolding at an early age. The combination of endogenous neuronal expression of alpha-synuclein and the exogenous addition of misfolded protein facilitates the development of brain pathology and subsequent neuron loss in the CNS. In addition to the pathological alterations induced with the fibril feeding model, genetic changes were identified by single cell RNA sequencing. These gene changes resulted in pathway alteration that implicate neurodegenerative disease processes. Conclusion: This model of alpha-synuclein pathology is useful for understanding mechanisms underlying disease initiation and can replicate the progressive development of pathological synuclein accumulation. It has the potential to induce neuron to neuron spread and also offers a way to explore what interventions may prevent such pathological progression.

However, there is still a limited number of studies that comprehensively assess (i) amplitudes, latencies, and sensory gating effects in all early components of auditory processing (M50–M100–M200 complex) at the source level in magnetoencephalography with their relation to structural anatomy (gray matter volume, thickness, gyrification) (ii) and the association between brain metrics and clinical phenotype in the same group of children. To address this question, we used a standard paired-clicks paradigm in magnetoencephalography and brain morphometry analysis in children with and without ASD (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><sub>ASD</sub> = 20, <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><sub>TD</sub> = 20). First, the results revealed a reduction of M200 and altered M200 sensory gating effect in the left auditory cortex in children with ASD. Second, these alterations were related to lower language comprehension skills and higher autistic symptom severity. Finally, altered MEG responses were associated with gray matter thickness reduction as well as abnormal gyrification in the primary auditory cortex in ASD. The study revealed low-level functional and structural atypicalities in children with ASD and their relation to clinical phenotype.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Auditory selective spatial attention (ASSA) plays an important role in “cocktail party” scenes, but the effects of spatial separation between target and distractor sources and background noise on the associated brain responses have not been thoroughly investigated. This study utilized the multilayer time-varying brain network to reveal the effect patterns of different separation degrees and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels on brain functional connectivity during ASSA. Specifically, a multilayer time-varying brain network with six time-windows equally divided by each epoch was constructed to investigate the segregation and integration of brain functional connectivity. The results showed that the inter-layer connectivity strength was consistently lower than the intra-layer connectivity strength for various separation degrees and SNR levels. Moreover, the connectivity strength of the multilayer time-varying brain network increased with decreasing separation degrees and initially increased and subsequently decreased with decreasing SNR levels. The second time-window of the network showed the most significant variation under some conditions and was determined as the core layer. The topology within the core layer was mainly reflected in the connectivity between the frontal and parietal-occipital cortices. In conclusion, these results suggest that spatial separation and background noise significantly modulate brain functional connectivity during ASSA.</span>

	<p>Background and Objective: The discovery of novel molecular biomarkers via next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized how glioblastomas (GBMs) are classified nowadays. This has resulted in more precise diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches to address this malignancy. The present work examines the applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in GBM, focusing on its potential to address tumor complexity and therapeutic resistance and improve patient outcomes. Methods: A scoping review of original studies published between 2009 and 2024 was conducted using the PUBMED and EMBASE databases. Studies in English or Spanish related to single-cell analysis and GBM were included. Key Findings: The database search yielded 453 publications. Themes related to scRNA-seq applied for the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and understanding of the cancer biology of GBM were used as criteria for article selection. Of the 24 studies that were included in the review, 11 focused on the tumor microenvironment and cell subpopulations in GBM samples, 5 investigated the use of sequencing to elucidate the GBM cancer biology, 3 examined disease prognosis using sequencing models, 3 applied translational research through scRNA-seq, and 2 addressed treatment-related problems in GBM elucidated by scRNA-seq. Conclusions: This scoping review explored the various clinical applications of scRNA-seq technologies in approaching GBM. The findings highlight the utility of this technology in unraveling the complex cellular and immune landscapes of GBM, paving the way for improved diagnosis and personalized treatments. This cutting-edge approach might strengthen treatment strategies against tumor progression and recurrence, setting the stage for multi-targeted interventions that could significantly improve outcomes for patients with aggressive, treatment-resistant GBMs.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Pain memory refers to the ability to encode, store, and recall information related to a specific pain event. Reviewing its common features is crucial, as it provides researchers with a foundational guide for designing studies that assess pain memory in individuals with chronic pain. The primary objective of this study was to examine the common characteristics&amp;amp;mdash;particularly the methodological approaches&amp;amp;mdash;of existing research on pain memory in adults with chronic pain. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using PubMed and Embase as search databases. Studies were included if they met the following criteria. (a) It involved only adults with chronic pain and (b) assessed at least one of the following parameters: pain intensity or pain unpleasantness. The exclusion criteria were the following: (a) not having pain memory assessment as a primary objective, (b) including participants under 18 years of age, (c) involving individuals without chronic pain (e.g., those with acute pain or healthy participants), (d) lacking essential information, or (e) unavailability of the full text. Results: From an initial pool of 4585 papers, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies exclusively involved adults with chronic pain, and all reported pain intensity, while only 27% assessed pain unpleasantness. Additionally, psychosocial variables were the most frequently reported non-pain-related outcomes. Regarding study protocols, most relied on daily data collection, with the most common recall period being within the first 48 h. Conclusions: The methodological characteristics identified in this review&amp;amp;mdash;particularly those with a high frequency of occurrence&amp;amp;mdash;should serve as fundamental guidelines for future research on pain memory in adults with chronic pain, and should be carefully considered by investigators in this field.</p>

	<p>Background: The beat-by-beat fluctuation of heart rate (HR) in its temporal sequence (HR dynamics) provides information on HR regulation by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and its dysregulation in pathological states. Commonly, linear analyses of HR and its variability (HRV) are used to draw conclusions about pathological states despite clear statistical and translational limitations. Objective: The main aim of this study was to compare linear and nonlinear HR measures, including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), based on ECG recordings by radiotelemetry in C57BL/6N mice to identify pathological HR dynamics. Methods: We investigated different behavioral and a wide range of pharmacological interventions which alter ANS regulation through various peripheral and/or central mechanisms including receptors implicated in psychiatric disorders. This spectrum of interventions served as a reference system for comparison of linear and nonlinear HR measures to identify pathological states. Results: Physiological HR dynamics constitute a self-similar, scale-invariant, fractal process with persistent intrinsic long-range correlations resulting in physiological DFA scaling coefficients of &amp;amp;alpha;~1. Strongly altered DFA scaling coefficients (&amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;ne; 1) indicate pathological states of HR dynamics as elicited by (1) parasympathetic blockade, (2) parasympathetic overactivation and (3) sympathetic overactivation but not inhibition. The DFA scaling coefficients are identical in mice and humans under physiological conditions with identical pathological states by defined pharmacological interventions. Conclusions: Here, we show the importance of tonic vagal function for physiological HR dynamics in mice, as reported in humans. Unlike linear measures, DFA provides an important translational measure that reliably identifies pathological HR dynamics based on altered ANS control by pharmacological interventions. Central ANS dysregulation represents a likely mechanism of increased cardiac mortality in psychiatric disorders.</p>

	<p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a group of conditions that arise early in development and are characterized by deficits in personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. These disorders frequently co-occur and include conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Mood disorders (MDs), such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, also pose significant global health challenges due to their high prevalence and substantial impact on quality of life. Emerging evidence highlights overlapping neurobiological mechanisms between NDDs and MDs, including shared genetic susceptibilities, neurotransmitter dysregulation (e.g., dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways), neuroinflammation, and hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. Environmental factors such as early-life adversity further exacerbate these vulnerabilities, contributing to the complexity of their clinical presentation and comorbidity. Functional neuroimaging studies reveal altered connectivity in brain regions critical for emotional regulation and executive function, such as the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, across these disorders. Despite these advances, integrative diagnostic frameworks and targeted therapeutic strategies remain underexplored, limiting effective intervention. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the shared neurobiological underpinnings of NDDs and MDs, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary research, including genetic, pharmacological, and psychological approaches, for unified diagnosis and treatment. Addressing these intersections can improve clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by these disorders.</p>

                Pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, often associated with metastatic spread at diagnosis. We report the case of a 61-year-old male with a history of renal stones who presented with a four-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and declining visual acuity in the right eye. Imaging revealed a left hilar tumor with carcinomatous consolidation, bilateral parenchymal nodules, and left pleural effusion. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed choroidal lesions in the right eye, confirmed by orbital MRI as a subretinal intraocular lesion. Biopsies confirmed pulmonary SCC. The patient received six cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy alongside choroidal radiotherapy. After four cycles, choroidal metastases regressed, and visual acuity improved. Post-treatment imaging showed complete resolution of the intraocular lesion and a 34% reduction in tumor burden per RECIST 1.1. This case underscores the efficacy of combined systemic and localized therapies in managing advanced metastatic pulmonary SCC.

Therefore, the present article investigated the reliability of the data and its method. Methods I performed a series of searches again and provided a new dataset on the number of articles in the three national newspapers. I followed the same procedure one year after the prior search. Results I found very strong correlations in article counts between the previous and current datasets, confirming their high reliability. Although there were some years when the number of articles differed between the two datasets, their differences were small. Conclusions Therefore, their reliability was confirmed to be high. Taken together, both the validity and reliability of the data and its generation method were confirmed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-290/v1?src=rss">The environmental and economic impacts of urban development in mountainous areas of Africa – with special reference to Ghana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study reviewed the environmental and economic impacts of urban development in mountainous areas, with special attention to the impacts on the livelihoods of people and biodiversity in Ghana. Forests in mountainous areas provide essential economic and ecosystem services ranging from food, medicinal plants, wood (for wood, construction, furniture, fuel for cooking and heating) and clean water. Economic benefits in the form of tourism are also important. The situation in Ghana is compared to global situations and trends. While few studies are conducted globally to protect mountain resources, in Ghana there is dearth of literature for this kind of study. Ironically, building on mountains is gradually becoming an acceptable practice in Ghana. Methods A descriptive design was adopted in this study which comprises monitoring and observing the rate of decline of forest resources within a specified period of time. The study also made use of mixed method approach which combined numerical data and textual information. Literature on the impacts of urban development on the livelihoods of mountain people and environment were reviewed. The general economy and environmental impact of mountainous infrastructure on mountain people were also reviewed. Results The study showed that fast urban development in mountainous areas has negative consequences for the livelihoods of forest dwellers, ecosystem services, and forest resources. Policies related to land use in mountainous areas were also reviewed, as well as the challenges faced by municipal assemblies’ planning departments. It was found that the work of municipal planning officials is influenced by political elites at the national level. Conclusions In order to discourage urban development on mountains, the planning department of municipal assemblies should be seen as autonomous, where independence should be given to the professionals involved.

                Background Radon gas, a decay product of radium, is a significant environmental health risk due to its radioactive properties. Understanding the radium content and radon exhalation rates in soil is crucial for evaluating potential radiological hazards and ensuring environmental safety. Methods Soil samples were collected from twelve different locations in Wukro, Tigray, representing various soil types. The sealed can technique, using LR-115 Type-II plastic track detectors, was employed to measure radium concentrations and radon exhalation rates over a four-month exposure period. Radon mass exhalation rates, surface exhalation rates, and radium concentrations were calculated, and the Alpha Index was also determined to assess radiological risk. Results and Discussion The radon mass exhalation rates ranged from 0.18 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1 to 0.82 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1, with a mean of 0.48 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1. Surface exhalation rates varied from 0.38 × 10−6Bq.m−2.d−1 to 1.72 × 10−6 Bq.m−2.d−1, averaging 1.02 × 10−6 Bq.m−2.d−1. Radium concentrations ranged from 0.33 to 1.47 Bq.kg−1, with an average of 0.87 Bq.kg−1. A significant positive correlation between radium content and radon exhalation rates was observed, indicating a direct relationship between these variables. Clay soils exhibited the highest radium concentrations, while sandy soils had the lowest. All measured values were below the safety limit of 370 Bq.kg−1 recommended by OECD and UNSCEAR, suggesting no significant radiological risk in the study area. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of monitoring natural radiation levels for environmental safety. The findings provide a baseline for future studies and emphasize the need for continuous assessment to detect any long-term changes in soil radioactivity.

                The article introduces the concept of ‘intellectual neighbourhood,’ a historical-philosophical framework emphasising the collaborative nature of knowledge production across time in Eurasia, where respect for diverse ideas flourished. The study traces the contributions of Ali Qushji and his followers, illustrating how their works emerged from this interconnected intellectual milieu. The analysis further highlights how cosmopolitan cities like Samarkand and Istanbul functioned as conduits for knowledge exchange and acknowledges the influence of key Islamic scholars such as Nasir al-Din Tusi. Ultimately, the article advocates for a deeper appreciation of historical contexts to inform the reconstruction of contemporary intellectual neighbourhoods. It underscores the critical importance of trust and collaboration in navigating today’s complex global landscape.

                Introduction Leptin, along with its receptor, are linked with mechanisms affecting a diverse array of pregnancy-specific pathologies that include gestational diabetes and intrauterine growth restriction. The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance. Methods 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62±29.23 and 59.88±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, ‘AA’ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

                Novel object recognition tasks are commonly used to assess memory in rodents. These tests rely on an innate preference for exploring objects that are new or have been moved or changed. However, this preference, while normally seen in control conditions, is not immutable. Stressful experiences as well as lesions and genetic mutations can lead mice and rats to show clear preferences for exploring familiar objects and familiar locations. This opinion article discusses the evidence for changes in novelty preference, implications of this lability for assessing memory, and the significance of shifts in novelty preference as a readout of changes in curiosity with implications in approach–avoidance behavior and explore–exploit decision-making. Finally, we provide some recommendations for reporting and interpreting novelty preference task findings moving forward.

                Cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells are known to interact within the tumor microenvironment and influence each other to impact on tumor progression. Here, Kay et al. discuss how they can also potentially metabolically interact with each other to alter the overall phenotype of the tumor and influence response to therapy.
