Then we explore the changes in the cortical wave of anticipation when V1 is triggered by retina-driven anticipatory mechanisms: gain control and lateral inhibition by amacrine cells. Here, we show how retinal and cortical anticipation combine to provide an efficient processing where the simulated cortical response is in advance over the moving object that triggers this response, compensating the delays in visual processing.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neurons process sensory stimuli efficiently, showing sparse yet highly variable ensemble spiking activity involving structured higher-order interactions. Notably, while neural populations are mostly silent, they occasionally exhibit highly synchronous activity, resulting in sparse and heavy-tailed spike-count distributions. However, its mechanistic origin—specifically, what types of nonlinear properties in individual neurons induce such population-level patterns—remains unclear. In this study, we derive sufficient conditions under which the joint activity of homogeneous binary neurons generates sparse and widespread population firing rate distributions in infinitely large networks. We then propose a subclass of exponential family distributions that satisfy this condition. This class incorporates structured higher-order interactions with alternating signs and shrinking magnitudes, along with a base-measure function that offsets distributional concentration, giving rise to parameter-dependent sparsity and heavy-tailed population firing rate distributions. Analysis of recurrent neural networks that recapitulate these distributions reveals that individual neurons possess threshold-like nonlinearity, followed by supralinear activation that jointly facilitates sparse and synchronous population activity. These nonlinear features resemble those in modern Hopfield networks, suggesting a connection between widespread population activity and the network’s memory capacity. The theory establishes sparse and heavy-tailed distributions for binary patterns, forming a foundation for developing energy-efficient spike-based learning machines.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Number sense, the ability to rapidly estimate object quantities in a visual scene without precise counting, is a crucial cognitive capacity found in humans and many other animals. Recent studies have identified artificial neurons tuned to numbers of items in biologically inspired vision models, even before training, and proposed these artificial neural networks as candidate models for the emergence of number sense in the brain. But real-world numerosity perception requires abstraction from the properties of individual objects and their contexts, unlike the simplified dot patterns used in previous studies. Using novel synthetically generated photorealistic stimuli, we show that deep convolutional neural networks optimized for object recognition encode information on approximate numerosity across diverse objects and scene types, which could be linearly read out from distributed activity patterns of later convolutional layers of different network architectures tested. In contrast, untrained networks with random weights failed to represent numerosity with abstractness to other visual properties and instead captured mainly low-level visual features. Our findings emphasize the importance of using complex, naturalistic stimuli to investigate mechanisms of number sense in both biological and artificial systems, and they suggest that the capacity of untrained networks to account for early-life numerical abilities should be reassessed. They further point to a possible, so far underappreciated, contribution of the brain's ventral visual pathway to representing numerosity with abstractness to other high-level visual properties.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force makes them far from negative examples. Noncontrastive learning, represented by BYOL and SimSiam, gets rid of negative examples and improves computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al. (<a href="#bib41" class="reflinks">2021</a>) revealed through learning dynamics analysis that the representations can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account commonly used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may still collapse the dynamics, an unnatural behavior under the presence of feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2 loss by considering the cosine loss instead, which involves feature normalization. We show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus, we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.</span>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) has high mortality and relapse rates, yet no accepted pharmacotherapies. Reports based on six individuals suggest that ketogenic diet (KGD) combined with sub-anesthetic ketamine (KET) is an effective treatment. The animal model, Activity-Based Anorexia (ABA), captures AN's maladaptive behaviors of voluntary food restriction, excessive exercise, severe weight loss, heightened anxiety and relapse vulnerability. Using ABA, we tested whether (1) KGD, alone, can protect against relapses after a severe anorexia-like experience; (2) KGD must be maintained to prevent relapses; (3) sub-anesthetic KET combined with KGD is more ameliorative than KGD alone. We also (4) explored KGD's mechanism for protecting against relapses by electron microscopic (EM) analysis of synapses in the hippocampus. To simulate AN relapses, we imposed ABA induction twice (ABA1, ABA2), with 10 recovery days in between. Animals were fed a standard diet (SD, pellet plus wet food) during ABA1 and KGD during ABA2 (SD ➔ KGD). ABA vulnerability, measured by food restriction-evoked hyperactivity and weight loss, was severe during ABA1 but significantly less during ABA2, compared to those fed SD throughout ABA1 and ABA2 (SD ➔ SD). KGD withdrawal after ABA1 (KGD ➔ SD) caused vulnerability during ABA2 to become as severe as for the SD ➔ SD, indicating that KGD must be maintained to be protective. We tested whether KET plus KGD during ABA1 can protect against ABA2 relapse in the absence of KGD or KET (KGD + KET ➔ SD). During ABA2, KGD + KET ➔ SD exhibited low maladaptive behaviors, similarly to those maintained on KGD throughout ABA1 and ABA2 (KGD ➔KGD), with greater weight during recovery. Thus, KET sustains and boosts KGD's benefits for &gt; 10 days, supporting clinical findings that short-term KGD + KET may be an effective treatment for preventing AN relapses. EM revealed that KGD increases GABAergic synapse lengths and may reduce ABA vulnerability by increasing excitatory synaptic drive of GABAergic interneurons and increasing E-to-E synapses' role in body weight regulation.</p>

                arXiv:2510.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to match brain activities during a range of cognitive tasks. Our findings demonstrate that even basic linear machine learning models can effectively classify brain states and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly for tasks related to motor functions and language processing. Feature importance ranking allows to identify distinct sets of brain regions whose activation patterns are uniquely associated with specific cognitive functions. These discriminative features provide strong support for the hypothesis of functional specialization across cortical and subcortical areas of the human brain.
  Additionally, we investigate the temporal dynamics of the identified brain regions, demonstrating that the time-dependent structure of fMRI signals are essential for shaping functional connectivity between regions: uncorrelated areas are least important for classification. This temporal perspective provides deeper insights into the formation and modulation of brain neural networks involved in cognitive processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05815">Multiscale dynamical characterization of cortical brain states: from synchrony to asynchrony</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cerebral cortex spontaneously displays different patterns of activity that evolve over time according to the brain state. Sleep, wakefulness, resting states, and attention are examples of a wide spectrum of physiological states that can be sustained by the same structural network. Furthermore, additional states are generated by drugs (e.g., different levels of anesthesia) or by pathological conditions (e.g., brain lesions, disorders of consciousness). While the significance of understanding brain states in relation to brain dynamics and behavior has become increasingly evident over the past two decades, a unified definition of brain states remains elusive. In this review, we focus on two extremes of this spectrum: synchronous versus asynchronous states. These functional states predominantly underlie unconsciousness and consciousness, respectively, although exceptions exist. Our aim is to integrate data from different levels into a multiscale understanding, ranging from local circuits to whole-brain dynamics, including properties such as cortical complexity, functional connectivity, synchronization, wave propagation, and excitatory-inhibitory balance that vary across states and characterize them. Experimental and clinical data, as well as computational models (at micro-, meso-, and macrocortical levels) associated with the discussed brain states, are made available to readers.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06091">Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems (MoLDS) via Hybrid Tensor-EM Method</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories. However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings, limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data, and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10663">Optimal Transport for Brain-Image Alignment: Unveiling Redundancy and Synergy in Neural Information Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.10663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure of the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and understand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with stimulus signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which focuses only on local point-wise alignment and ignores global matching, leading to coarse interpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.
  In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and theoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy than MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We apply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding brain signals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11\% in single-subject training and 3.81\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We unveil the redundancy and synergy of brain information processing through region masking and data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments. We believe our approach paves the way for a more precise understanding of brain signals in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/OT-Alignment4brain-to-image.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a biologically grounded approach to reservoir computing (RC), in which a network of cultured biological neurons serves as the reservoir substrate. This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing (BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked activity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous stimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a subset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural responses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature space. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification using a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the biological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural activity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the performance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a standard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate that the biological reservoir can effectively support classification, highlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational substrate. We believe this work contributes to the broader effort of integrating biological principles into machine learning and aligns with the goals of human-inspired vision by exploring how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically plausible models.

Abstract: We present AgentZero++, an agent-based model that integrates cognitive, emotional, and social mechanisms to simulate decentralized collective violence in spatially distributed systems. Building on Epstein's Agent\_Zero framework, we extend the original model with eight behavioral enhancements: age-based impulse control; memory-based risk estimation; affect-cognition coupling; endogenous destructive radius; fight-or-flight dynamics; affective homophily; retaliatory damage; and multi-agent coordination. These additions allow agents to adapt based on internal states, previous experiences, and social feedback, producing emergent dynamics such as protest asymmetries, escalation cycles, and localized retaliation. Implemented in Python using the Mesa ABM framework, AgentZero++ enables modular experimentation and visualization of how micro-level cognitive heterogeneity shapes macro-level conflict patterns. Our results highlight how small variations in memory, reactivity, and affective alignment can amplify or dampen unrest through feedback loops. By explicitly modeling emotional thresholds, identity-driven behavior, and adaptive networks, this work contributes a flexible and extensible platform for analyzing affective contagion and psychologically grounded collective action.

                arXiv:2505.06617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms seek to discover diverse, high-performing solutions across a behavior space, contrasting with conventional optimization methods that target a single optimum. Adversarial problems present unique challenges for QD approaches, as the competing nature of opposing sides creates interdependencies that complicate the evolution process. Existing QD methods applied to such scenarios typically fix one side, constraining behavioral diversity. We present Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME), a coevolutionary QD algorithm that evolves both sides by alternating which side is evolved at each generation. By integrating a vision embedding model, our approach eliminates the need for domain-specific behavior descriptors and instead operates on video. We validate GAME across three distinct adversarial domains: a multi-agent battle game, a soft-robot wrestling environment, and a deck building game. Our experiments reveal several evolutionary phenomena, including arms-race-like dynamics, enhanced novelty through generational extinction, and the preservation of neutral mutations as crucial stepping stones toward the highest performance. While GAME successfully illuminates all adversarial problems, its capacity for truly open-ended discovery remains constrained by the finite nature of the underlying search spaces. These findings establish GAME's broad applicability while highlighting opportunities for future research into open-ended adversarial coevolution.

                arXiv:2509.23762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.

Abstract: Renewable energy forecasting is attaining greater importance due to its constant increase in contribution to the electrical power grids. Solar energy is one of the most significant contributors to renewable energy and is dependent on solar irradiation. For the effective management of electrical power grids, forecasting models that predict solar irradiation, with high accuracy, are needed. In the current study, Machine Learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Genetic Algorithm Optimization are used to forecast solar irradiation. The data used for training and validation is recorded from across three different geographical stations in the United States that are part of the SURFRAD network. A Global Horizontal Index (GHI) is predicted for the models built and compared. Genetic Algorithm Optimization is applied to XGB to further improve the accuracy of solar irradiation prediction.

                <p>The parabrachial (PB) nucleus participates in taste processing and integration with other senses. PB neurons that express the <I>Calca</I> gene support sensory-integrative responses, albeit only limited data have addressed their influence on taste. Here we investigated how chemogenetic dampening of PB-<I>Calca</I> neurons affected mouse orosensory preferences for diverse taste stimuli in brief-access fluid exposure tests, which capture oral sensory/tongue control of licking behavior. Intracranial delivery of Cre-dependent viruses in female and male <I>Calca</I><sup>Cre/+</sup> mice induced expression of the inhibitory designer receptor hM4Di:mCherry (hM4Di mice) or fluorophore mCherry alone (mCherry control mice) in PB-<I>Calca</I> neurons. Several weeks later, hM4Di and mCherry mice entered brief-access tests where they could lick solutions during discrete, seconds-long trials. Stimuli included concentration series of the behaviorally avoided bitter taste stimuli quinine and cycloheximide, the appetitive sugar sucrose, and mildly cool water and less preferred innocuous warm water. Blinded experimenters administered the hM4Di ligand clozapine-<I>N</I>-oxide (CNO) to all hM4Di and mCherry mice prior to daily tests. With CNO, hM4Di mice displayed greater average licking (i.e., less avoidance) of quinine than mCherry mice (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, male hM4Di mice selectively showed reduced mean licking preferences for sucrose under CNO (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that PB-<I>Calca</I> neurons participate in both aversive and appetitive taste-guided behaviors, with their role in appetitive taste dependent on sex. Finally, orosensory responses to cycloheximide and thermal-controlled water did not differ (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05) between hM4Di and mCherry mice under CNO. Results are discussed considering functional differences among stimuli and study limitations.</p>

                <p>Despite various histological, electrophysiological, and imaging studies, the topographic organization of saccade-related activity in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been notoriously difficult to characterize. In part, this is because areas of interest in PPC are often embedded deep in sulci in macaques and humans. Understanding the extent of topographic organization in PPC can provide insights into the computation contributions of PPC. The lissencephalic cortex of the common marmoset offers a unique opportunity to investigate fine-scale topographic organization in PPC. Recordings were obtained from the PPC of two male marmosets performing a visually guided center-out saccade task with 8 or 36 peripheral targets using multichannel electrode arrays with 100&nbsp;&mu;m spacing. By plotting the pattern of saccade direction tuning preferences across all penetrations and cortical depths, we uncovered topographic organizational features within the PPC. Like other primates, multiunits in marmoset PPC tend to prefer saccade targets in the contralateral visual field. The results detail how preference for saccadic direction changes in a systematic manner across cortical distance, such that response units closer in proximity tend to show systematic changes in their tuning preferences. Across cortical distance, the visual field was also systematically encoded but reversals in direction varied across penetrations. The analysis highlights the likelihood of multiple representations of the visual field for saccade direction preference across PPC. These novel findings suggest a possible functional organization of saccade-related activity in marmoset PPC, giving insights into the computational capacity of the PPC.</p>

                Background Chronic arsenic exposure interferes with hippocampal-dependent cognition through glutamate excitotoxicity, which in turn interferes with the regulation of receptors and transporters. Bromelain, a combination of proteolytic enzymes derived from Ananas comosus, is known to have neuroprotective effects; however, the mechanisms by which it counteracts glutamate-mediated toxicity in the brain are poorly understood. This study investigated the potential of bromelain to normalize glutamatergic homeostasis and cognitive function in arsenic-treated rats by specifically examining the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A and glutamate transporters GLT-1, EAAC1, and xCT. Methods Seventy-two adult male Wistar rats (200-220 g) were randomly divided into nine groups (n=8 each): control, arsenic-only (20 mg/kg/day sodium arsenite, administered via oral gavage for 14 days), bromelain-only (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg/day, oral gavage), arsenic plus bromelain (at the same doses), and arsenic plus donepezil (2 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal). Arsenic was coadministered with bromelain and donepezil for 14 consecutive days. The Morris water maze test was used to assess the cognitive performance. Glutamate concentration was measured using sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay [ELISA] and total RNA was isolated to perform RT-qPCR to evaluate the expression of NR2A, GLT-1, EAAC1, and xCT. Results Exposure to arsenic impaired spatial memory, increased glutamate levels, and downregulated the expression of NR2A and transporter genes. These effects were reversed by co-treatment with bromelain, especially at 10 mg/kg, which re-established gene expression and lowered glutamate levels. Bromelain at 15 mg/kg was more effective than donepezil in improving glutamate clearance and cognitive performance. Conclusions Bromelain provides multi-target neuroprotection in arsenic neurotoxicity, rescuing glutamatergic homeostasis by coordinated upregulation of NMDA receptor NR2A and the transport network (GLT-1, EAAC1, xCT), accompanied by spatial learning and memory improvement. The demonstrated dose-response, dosing-related superiority over 15 mg/kg donepezil, and lack of overt adverse effects support its translational potential as a safe, plant-based adjunct to excitotoxic diseases and toxin-exposed populations.

                This policy brief investigates the impact of membership in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the East African Community (EAC) on export promotion and household welfare in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, and Burundi. The analysis reveals a positive association between export performance and investment, imports, consumption, political stability, and government effectiveness. Notably, traditionally relevant factors like GDP and FDI lacked statistically significant associations with export performance. The impact of EAC and AfCFTA membership on exports remains inconclusive. Regarding household welfare, a positive correlation emerged with GDP, domestic savings, trade (imports and exports), rule of law, and corruption control. Counterintuitively, EAC membership displayed a negative and significant impact on household welfare, while AfCFTA membership had a positive but insignificant effect. Policymakers should prioritize investments boosting domestic savings and productive capacity, cultivate a rule-of-law business environment, and implement strategic export promotion informed by import composition analysis. Future research should adopt a disaggregated approach to explore the insignificant effects of economic factors and EAC membership on EAC export performance, while investigating AfCFTA’s true impact and the negative EAC-welfare association.

                Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) is a rare and anatomically specific form of stroke that occurs in the cerebral veins, with pregnant and postpartum women at particular risk. Obstetric CVT carries high mortality due to its atypical presentation, often mimicking or being masked by other conditions such as preeclampsia. We report a case of a 37-year-old Sasak woman who, on the 32nd day postpartum following a cesarean section, experienced more than five seizures beginning with left arm weakness and heaviness. Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient was conscious but complained of a severe headache and left-sided limb weakness. Her vital signs showed blood pressure of 152/87 mmHg, pulse of 84 beats/min, and a temperature of 37.1°C. During her stay in the ER, she experienced three additional seizures. Initially treated as eclampsia with magnesium sulfate by the obstetrics team, the patient underwent urgent brain MRI and MR venography, which confirmed a diagnosis of CVT in the superior sagittal sinus, complicated by intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and uncal herniation. The patient did not respond to anticoagulant therapy and subsequently underwent delayed decompressive craniectomy. To further manage elevated intracranial pressure, barbiturates were administered as a third-tier treatment. This case emphasizes the diagnostic challenges and high-risk nature of postpartum CVT, underlining the need for rapid neuroimaging and multidisciplinary intervention in postpartum women presenting with seizures and neurological deficits.

Lymph nodes are continuously exposed to such signals through the flow of afferent lymph, allowing the potential reprograming of lymphoid tissue stroma in support of metastases or immunosuppression. The objective of this study was therefore to better characterize tumor-driven transcriptomic changes occurring to specific stromal populations within the tumor-draining lymph node. Methods We utilize single cell RNA sequencing of dissociated LN tissue extracted from tumor-bearing and naïve mice to profile the reprograming of tissue stroma within the pre-metastatic lymph node. Results Resulting data provides transcriptomic evidence of tumor-induced imprinting on marginal reticular cells (MRCs) and floor lymphatic endothelial cells (fLECs) populating the subcapsular sinus. These alterations appear to be unique to the tumor-draining LN and are not observed during inflammatory antigenic challenge. Notably, MRCs exhibit characteristics reminiscent of early desmoplastic CAF differentiation, fLECs engage distinct chemoattractant pathways thought to facilitate recruitment of circulating cancer cells, and both stromal populations exhibit signs of metabolic reprograming and immune-modulating potential. Conclusions Cumulatively, these findings build upon existing literature describing pre-metastatic niche formation and offer several promising avenues for future exploration.

                Background This study explores the lived experiences of individuals recovering from COVID-19, aiming to deepen understanding and inform supportive measures in future health crises. Methods Fifteen participants were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and non-aggregated behavioral observations. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) guided the analytic process, allowing for in-depth exploration of participants’ meaning-making. Reporting adhered to the COREQ qualitative research guidelines. Results Five superordinate themes emerged: stress, economic and social disruption, social stigma, social support, and the reappraisal of adversity (“finding meaning in misfortune”). Participants’ narratives revealed complex adaptive processes shaped by contextual challenges and relational resources. Conclusion The findings highlight the need for multidisciplinary care approaches that attend to psychosocial and economic dimensions of illness. Insights from this study may inform post-COVID-19 recovery policies, including targeted psychosocial training for health and community workers, and the development of integrated response frameworks for future public health emergencies.

                Background Pulmonary congestion, as opposed to low cardiac output, is the predominant cause of hospitalizations for heart failure and is associated with elevated mortality rates. Persisting congestion symptoms at discharge and during outpatient follow-ups are critical predictors of adverse outcomes. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a simple, non-invasive tool for assessing pulmonary congestion. Objectives This study aims to evaluate the prognostic significance of pulmonary congestion detected via LUS in predicting short-term adverse events in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure (AHF). Methods We conducted a bi-centric prospective observational study involving consecutive patients admitted for AHF at two hospitals in Tunisia. Each participant underwent a thorough clinical assessment, biological evaluation, chest X-ray, LUS, and echocardiography. LUS operators were blinded to clinical data and examined eight thoracic zones. The primary outcomes included a composite of urgent care visits, rehospitalization due to acute heart failure decompensation, or cardiac death within a six-month follow-up. Results A total of 116 patients (median age: 69 years; 53% male; mean ejection fraction: 40%) were included. At discharge, the mean number of B-lines observed was 6.6 ± 3.3. During the follow-up period, we recorded 72 adverse events, with 52 patients experiencing severe heart failure symptoms requiring hospitalization and 20 dying from cardiac causes. Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of ≥3 B-lines bilaterally significantly predicted the combined endpoint of rehospitalization or cardiac death at the six-month mark (HR: 11.024; 95% CI: 5.542-21.926; P < 0.001). Additionally, the number of B-lines decreased from 31.9 ± 12.7 upon admission to 6.6 ± 3.1 at discharge (P < 0.001). Conclusions The application of an 8-zone LUS protocol is effective in assessing the severity and monitoring the resolution of pulmonary congestion in heart failure patients. Persistent pulmonary congestion at discharge, as evaluated by LUS, correlates with a poorer prognosis.

                <p>by June Hyung Kim, Taeyoon Kim</p>

Lamellipodia are quasi-two-dimensional actin projections formed on the leading edge of the cell, playing an important role in sensing surrounding mechanical environments by forming focal adhesions. A branched actin network in the lamellipodia exhibits a stable, yet dynamic steady state characterized by a retrograde flow, which is attributed to a balance between network assembly at the leading edge and disassembly at the rear. Although the molecular players and architecture of the lamellipodia have been investigated extensively during recent decades, it still remains elusive how the dynamic steady state with continuous retrograde flow is achieved and robustly maintained. Using an agent-based computational model, we probed how physical interactions between subcellular components in the lamellipodia mediate and sustain the dynamic steady state. We simulated the branched network found in the lamellipodia, consisting of F-actin, myosin motor, Arp2/3 complex, and actin cross-linking protein, on an elastic substrate. We reproduced a steady retrograde flow induced by myosin activity and balanced by the interplay between network assembly and disassembly, but hindered by resistances from adhesions formed on the underlying substrate. We found that F-actin severing is crucial for maintaining a continuous, uniform retrograde flow because it enhances the disassembly of actin bundle/arc formed due to network contraction at the rear. In addition, we demonstrated that different modes of dynamic steady states are possible, and that a network which failed to show the retrograde flow due to perturbations can be rescued by altering other factors. Our study provides insights into understanding how cells maintain the dynamic steady state of the lamellipodia in highly varying microenvironments.

Background <p>It is urgent to explore the potential biomarkers of PC prognosis and treatment to improve patients’ outcomes with pancreatic cancer (PC).</p> Methods <p>Firstly, we performed an integrated bioinformatics analysis based on extensive transcriptome data from 615 PC tumors and 329 adjacent tissues, screening for genes with prognostic value. We then validated the prognostic value of <i>OCIAD2</i>, <i>DCBLD2</i>, and <i>SAMD9</i> in different datasets and analyzed their expression levels in single-cell sequencing datasets of normal, paracancer, primary, and metastatic tissues. Next, we further explored the carcinogenic effect after knocking down the expression of <i>OCIAD2</i> in PC cancer cell line. Finally, a drug sensitivity analysis was conducted.</p> Results <p>Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis identified 22 DEGs: <i>ACSL5</i>, <i>ANTXR1</i>, <i>AP1S3</i>, <i>ATP2C2</i>, <i>B3GNT5</i>, <i>C15orf48</i>, <i>CAPG</i>, <i>CTSK</i>, <i>DAPP1</i>, <i>DCBLD2</i>, <i>GPX8</i>, <i>HEPH</i>, <i>IFI44</i>, <i>KRT23</i>, <i>NCF2</i>, <i>OCIAD2</i>, <i>SAMD9</i>, <i>SLC39A10</i>, <i>ST6GALNAC1</i>, <i>TBC1D2</i>, <i>TMSB10</i> and <i>TSPAN5</i> with prognostic value in PC, though the related function and mechanism are still unclear. Single-cell sequencing results indicated that <i>OCIAD2</i> was prominently expressed in ductal cells of primary and metastatic tumors. The expression levels of <i>OCIAD2</i> mRNA and protein were the highest in pancreatic tumor tissues. Mechanism studies revealed that <i>STAT1</i> and <i>STAT2</i> in the JAK-STAT pathway and <i>CCND1</i>, <i>CDK1,</i> and <i>CDK2</i> in the cell cycle pathway were significantly down-regulated after <i>OCIAD2</i> knockdown. Drug sensitivity analysis identified 25 compounds significantly associated with <i>OCIAD2</i>.</p> Conclusions <p>These results indicate that OCIAD2 is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PC patients.</p>

Deep learning for protein function prediction faces significant challenges in identifying disease-specific proteins. We present Extracellular Matrix Protein Predictor (EPOP), an advanced transfer learning framework leveraging protein language models to decode disease mechanisms. Focusing on pelvic organ prolapse (POP), which affects up to 50% of women worldwide, EPOP demonstrates AI’s power to reveal novel therapeutic targets. We developed a sophisticated fine-tuning protocol for the ESM-2 model, optimized for ECM protein prediction. Our architecture integrates specialized attention mechanisms with interpretability modules, trained on expertly curated and balanced datasets totaling 80,000 proteins (40,000 ECM and 40,000 non-ECM). The framework employs a novel validation strategy using a 16,000-sample independent test set and clinical proteomics data. EPOP achieved unprecedented performance (99.40% accuracy) in ECM protein classification, significantly surpassing traditional deep learning architectures (10.81% improvement over Transformer models, 21.71% over Long Short-Term Memory). Applied to clinical samples, our model revealed a previously unknown pattern of ECM remodeling, identifying 24 novel disease-associated proteins. Model interpretability analysis uncovered specific sequence motifs and structural features critical for ECM protein function, providing mechanistic insights into disease progression. EPOP demonstrates how advanced AI bridges molecular analysis and clinical applications, uncovering novel therapeutic targets. Its success suggests broader applications across ECM-related disorders, potentially transforming approaches to diseases affecting connective tissue architecture.

Highly multiplexed imaging assays allow simultaneous quantification of multiple protein and phosphorylation markers, providing a static snapshots of cell types and states. Pseudo-time techniques can transform these static snapshots of unsynchronized cells into dynamic trajectories, enabling the study of dynamic processes such as development trajectories and the cell cycle. Such ordering also enables training of mathematical models on these data, but technical challenges have hitherto made it difficult to integrate multiple experimental conditions, limiting the predictive power and insights these models can generate. In this work, we propose data processing and model training approaches for integrating multiplexed, multi-condition immunofluorescence data with mathematical modelling. We devise training strategies for mathematical models that are applicable to datasets where cells exhibit oscillatory as well as arrested dynamics and use them to train a cell cycle model on a dataset of MCF-10A mammary epithelial exposed to cell-cycle arresting small molecules. We validate the model by investigating predicted growth factor sensitivities and responses to inhibitors of cells at different initial conditions. We anticipate that our framework will generalise to other highly multiplexed measurement techniques such as mass-cytometry, rendering larger bodies of data accessible to dynamic modelling and paving the way to deeper biological insights.

                <p>by Aswathi Shiju, Samantha D. M. Arras, Allen G. Rodrigo, Anthony M. Poole</p>

In biology, changes to a DNA sequence can impact protein sequence but changes to protein sequences (phenotype) do not flow back into DNA (genotype). A system with bidirectional information flow (i.e., both translation and ‘reverse translation’) remains a theoretical possibility for an independent origin of life or an artificial biosystem, but the recent development of digital data storage in DNA does just this: changes made to a digital file can be written back into DNA, meaning changes to ‘phenotype’ can be written back to ‘genotype’. To explore the evolutionary properties of such a system, we created an artificial system where synthetic DNA serves as genotype and music as phenotype. Audio can be output from a DNA sequence, then recorded and written to DNA as ‘codons’, enabling bidirectional information flow (DNA→music and music→DNA). Our results show that the mutation rate in a bidirectional system is much higher than for unidirectional information flow, and that, under reverse translation there is no mechanism for preservation of codon choice across generations. This has the effect of eliminating the impact of spontaneous synonymous mutations, a key benefit of a redundant genetic code. As a result, non-synonymous mutations are the only DNA-level changes that are transmitted across generations, and, as non-synonymous mutations can emerge at both ‘genotypic’ and ‘phenotypic’ levels, these occur at a two-fold higher frequency than in a unidirectional system. Our system holds some practical insight. First, for DNA read/write systems, it may be wise to avoid designing systems with ‘<i>de novo</i> reverse translation’ because the opportunities for mutation are higher; tracking genotype information from the preceding generation to guide this process may reduce error. Second, our system helps clarify how a ‘Lamarckian’ biological system might operate. We conclude that, were a ‘Lamarckian’ system of inheritance a feature of early genetic systems, it would likely have been short lived as the high frequency of mutation would risk driving the system to extinction. A system based on unidirectional information flow thus appears superior as there are fewer opportunities for mutational error.

Sleep is essential for optimal functioning and health. Interconnected to multiple biological, psychological, and socio-environmental factors (i.e., biopsychosocial factors), the multidimensional nature of sleep is rarely capitalized on in research. Here, we deployed a data-driven approach to identify sleep-biopsychosocial profiles that linked self-reported sleep patterns to inter-individual variability in health, cognition, and lifestyle factors in 770 healthy young adults. We uncovered five profiles, including two profiles reflecting general psychopathology associated with either reports of general poor sleep or an absence of sleep complaints (i.e., sleep resilience), respectively. The three other profiles were driven by the use of sleep aids and social satisfaction, sleep duration, and cognitive performance, and sleep disturbance linked to cognition and mental health. Furthermore, identified sleep-biopsychosocial profiles displayed unique patterns of brain network organization. In particular, somatomotor network connectivity alterations were involved in the relationships between sleep and biopsychosocial factors. These profiles can potentially untangle the interplay between individuals’ variability in sleep, health, cognition, and lifestyle—equipping research and clinical settings to better support individual’s well-being.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Volumetry of subregions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) computed from automatic segmentation in MRI can track neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. However, poor quality MR images can lead to unreliable segmentation of MTL subregions. Considering that different MRI contrast mechanisms and field strengths (jointly referred to as “modalities” here) offer distinct advantages in imaging different parts of the MTL, we developed a multi-modality segmentation model using both 7T and 3T structural MRI to obtain robust segmentation in poor-quality images. MRI modalities including 3T T1-weighted, 3T T2-weighted, 7T T1-weighted and 7T T2-weighted (7T-T2w) of 197 participants were collected from a longitudinal aging study at the Penn Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Among them, 7T-T2w was used as the primary modality, and all other modalities were rigidly registered to the 7T-T2w. A model derived from nnU-Net took these registered modalities as input and outputted subregion segmentation in 7T-T2w space. 7T-T2w images most of which had high quality from 25 selected training participants were manually segmented to train the multi-modality model. Modality augmentation, which randomly replaced certain modalities with Gaussian noise, was applied during training to guide the model to extract information from all modalities. The multi-modality model delivered good performance regardless of 7T-T2w quality, while the single-modality model under-segmented subregions in poor-quality images. The multi-modality model generally demonstrated stronger discrimination of A + MCI versus A-CU. Intra-class correlation and Bland–Altman plots demonstrate that the multi-modality model had higher longitudinal segmentation consistency in all subregions while the single-modality model had low consistency in poor-quality images. The multi-modality MRI segmentation model provides an improved biomarker for neurodegeneration in the MTL that is robust to image quality. It also provides a framework for other studies which may benefit from multimodal imaging.</p>

<p>In snakes, profound differences in retinal architecture are observed between diurnal and nocturnal species. Additionally, in the rod-dominated retinas of nocturnal snakes, coexpression of the cone opsins SWS1 and LWS in individual cones is common, while rhodopsin (RH1) is restricted to typical rods. In the cone-dominated retinas of diurnal species, rhodopsin is expressed in transmuted, cone-like rods and frequently coexpressed with SWS1 in some single cones, with some instances of triple coexpression (SWS1, RH1, and LWS) in single cones.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Snakes are a valuable yet understudied taxon for investigating evolutionary adaptations in the vertebrate retina. They possess up to three visual pigments: a short-wavelength-sensitive opsin (SWS1), a medium/long-wavelength-sensitive opsin (LWS), and rhodopsin (RH1). Nocturnal snakes have duplex retinas containing both rod and cone photoreceptors, whereas diurnal caenophidian (“advanced”) snakes exhibit simplex “all-cone” retinas, lacking morphologically typical rods. In this study, we analyzed photoreceptor morphology in the retinas of caenophidian snakes using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and examined visual-opsin expression patterns with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Our analyses revealed remarkable interspecific variability in visual-cell morphology. Light microscopy showed that in all sampled diurnal caenophidians, photoreceptors expressing RH1 exhibit a gross cone-like morphology. However, SEM analysis revealed a subset of photoreceptors with distinct features—thinner inner segments and rod-like synaptic terminals—suggesting they are transmuted, cone-like rods. In retinal sections from nocturnal caenophidian snakes, coexpression of the cone opsins SWS1 and LWS in individual cones was observed, whereas rhodopsin expression remained restricted to morphologically typical rods and showed no coexpression. In contrast, diurnal caenophidians commonly coexpress rhodopsin and SWS1 in single cones, with some instances of triple coexpression (SWS1, RH1, and LWS) in single cones. We evaluated the patterns of spatial distribution of RH1- and SWS1-expressing photoreceptors, as well as SWS1 + RH1 multiopsin cones, in wholemounted retinas of ten species. Our findings revealed considerable species-specific variation in photoreceptor density, topography, and opsin coexpression patterns. IHC results suggest that in some species, rhodopsin is not only expressed in transmuted, cone-like rods but may also be co-opted by UV/violet-sensitive (SWS1-expressing) cones. These findings underscore the exceptional diversity and adaptive innovation in snake visual systems. The unique features and striking interspecific differences in their photoreceptors highlight snakes as an outstanding taxon for studying vertebrate visual-system function and evolution.</p>

<p>Hypothetical network of audio-vocal integration of motor neurons (twin circles) and interneurons (circles) in the medulla oblongata of the toad.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anurans are an established paradigm to study vocal mechanisms in vertebrates. Regarding the motor patterns, airborne vocalization of most evolutionarily old anurans (Archaeobatrachia) resembles breathing—that is, lung inflation is used to generate sound. Vocal behavior and call timing can be rapidly elicited or modulated by auditory stimulation so that, for example, calls are uttered antiphonally in a chorus to avoid acoustic overlap. Accordingly, in an in vitro preparation of the isolated whole brain of the Chinese fire-bellied toad, <i>Bombina orientalis</i>, motor patterns similar to those of respiration and vocalization can be elicited reliably by stimulation of the posterior (auditory) branchlet of the statoacoustic nerve (N. VIII). Here, we show that audio–vocal integration does not exclusively involve higher brain centers such as mesencephalic torus semicircularis (colliculus inferior) but is in parallel and more rapidly accomplished within the medulla oblongata. We recorded 228 neurons in the areas of motor nuclei of Nn. V, X, and XII. Hypoglossal motor neurons showed fast activation (latency of the first action potential: 9.9 ± 2.3 ms), exceeded by the very fast activation of interneurons within the hypoglossal area (minimum latency of action potential peak 2.9 ms) after N. VIII stimulation. These data support the idea that the area between the roots of the vagal (N. X) and hypoglossal (N. XII) nerves may be a crucial part of the breathing rhythm generator. It suggests that the hypoglossal area plays an important role in controlling the other motor nuclei involved in vocalization. Thus, this post-vagal area may be an important supplementary interface of audio–vocal integration to initiate and coordinate vocal motor patterns and probably inhibit buccal respiration. With this information, a hypothetical motor network of buccal and lung ventilation, as well as vocalization, was constructed.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autophagy is a fundamental biological pathway with vital roles in intracellular homeostasis. During autophagy, defective cargoes including mitochondria are targeted to lysosomes for clearance and recycling. Recessive truncating variants in the autophagy gene <i>EPG5</i> have been associated with Vici syndrome, a severe early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with extensive multisystem involvement. Here, we aimed to delineate the extended, age-dependent <i>EPG5</i>-related disease spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated clinical, radiological, and molecular features from the largest cohort of <i>EPG5</i>-related patients identified to date, complemented by experimental investigation of cellular and animal models of EPG5 defects.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Through worldwide collaboration, we identified 211 patients, 97 of them previously unpublished, with recessive <i>EPG5</i> variants. The phenotypic spectrum ranged from antenatally lethal presentations to milder isolated neurodevelopmental disorders. A novel Epg5 knock-in mouse model of a recurrent <i>EPG5</i> missense variant featured motor impairments and defective autophagy in brain areas particularly relevant for the neurological disorders in milder presentations. Novel age-dependent neurodegenerative manifestations in our cohort included adolescent-onset parkinsonism and dystonia with cognitive decline, and myoclonus. Radiological features suggested an emerging continuum with brain iron accumulation disorders. Patient fibroblasts showed defects in PINK1-Parkin-dependent mitophagic clearance and α-synuclein overexpression, indicating a cellular basis for the observed neurodegenerative phenotypes. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <i>EPG5</i> knockdown caused motor impairments, defective mitophagic clearance, and changes in mitochondrial respiration comparable to observations in <i>C. elegans</i> knockdown of parkinsonism-related genes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings illustrate a lifetime neurological disease continuum associated with pathogenic <i>EPG5</i> variants, linking neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders through the common denominator of defective autophagy. ANN NEUROL 2025 ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

Despite a proinflammatory transcriptional profile, RIPK3 in astrocytes can attenuate neuroinflammation and reduce leucocyte infiltration through upregulation of Serpin clade A member 3N (SerpinA3N), protecting mice from excessive neuroinflammation and increasing overall survival.

                The mechanisms by which the protein kinase NIK controls numerous immunoregulatory functions are currently described as being closely interlinked. However, this study demonstrates that different immune functions are regulated by NIK via the partly independent activation of different NF-κB proteins.

                The Escherichia coli bacillus morphology is thought to be determined by the shape of the peptidoglycan macromolecule, although the underlying polymerization mechanism remains elusive. Anoyatis-Pelé et al. show that lateral cell wall expansion at a constant diameter depends upon the endopeptidase-dependent insertion of single glycan strands into the peptidoglycan mesh.

                Pelzer et al. identify PHF19 to nucleate endogenous, micron-sized PRC2 clusters in triple-negative breast cancer cells, organizing local H3K27me3 macro-domains and promoting cell motility. This work highlights the importance of spatially confined PRC2 regulation as a distinct layer of chromatin control with specific functional consequences for cancer cell behavior.

                Li et al. demonstrate that SlCAK1 is a key signaling component in csp22-triggered immunity in tomato. Upon csp22 perception, SlCAK1 is rapidly recruited into the SlCORE/SlBAK1a receptor complex, and then SlBAK1a mediates the phosphorylation at Ser60 in the N terminus of SlCAK1, thereby activating SlCAK1 and initiating downstream immune responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105185">Structure-guided secretome analysis of gall-forming microbes offers insights into effector diversity and evolution</a></h4>

              
                Phytopathogens secrete effector molecules to manipulate host immunity and metabolism. Recent advances in structural genomics have identified fungal effector families whose members adopt similar folds despite sequence divergence, highlighting their importance in virulence and immune evasion. To extend the scope of comparative structure-guided analysis to more evolutionarily distant phytopathogens with similar lifestyles, we used AlphaFold2 to predict the 3D structures of the secretome from selected plasmodiophorid, oomycete, and fungal gall-forming pathogens. Clustering protein folds based on structural homology revealed species-specific expansions and a low abundance of known orphan effector families. We identified novel sequence-unrelated but structurally similar (SUSS) effector clusters, rich in conserved motifs such as 'CCG' and 'RAYH'. We demonstrate that these motifs likely play a central role in maintaining the overall fold. We also identified a SUSS cluster adopting a nucleoside hydrolase-like fold conserved among various gall-forming microbes. Notably, ankyrin proteins (ANK) were significantly expanded in gall-forming plasmodiophorids, with most being highly expressed during clubroot disease, suggesting a role in pathogenicity. Subsequently, we screened ANK proteins against <i>Arabidopsis</i> immunity hubs using AlphaFold-Multimer and verified one of the positive results by Y2H and BiFC assays to show that the ankyrin effector PbANK1 targets host MPK3 and a zinc-binding dehydrogenase. These findings suggest a potential new mechanism in which ANK effectors target multiple host proteins involved in stress sensing, opening a novel avenue to study the role of ANK in host–pathogen interactions. Altogether, this study advances our understanding of secretome landscapes in gall-forming microbes and provides a valuable resource for broadening structural phylogenomic studies across diverse phytopathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105432">Balancing stability and flexibility when reshaping archaeal membranes</a></h4>

              
                Cellular membranes differ across the tree of life. In most bacteria and eukaryotes, single-headed lipids self-assemble into flexible bilayer membranes. By contrast, thermophilic archaea tend to possess bilayer lipids together with double-headed, monolayer spanning bolalipids, which are thought to enable cells to survive in harsh environments. Here, using a minimal computational model for bolalipid membranes, we explore the trade-offs at play when forming membranes. We find that flexible bolalipids form membranes that resemble bilayer membranes because they are able to assume a U-shaped conformation. Conversely, rigid bolalipids, which resemble the bolalipids with cyclic groups found in thermophilic archaea, take on a straight conformation and form membranes that are stiff and prone to pore formation when they undergo changes in shape. Strikingly, however, the inclusion of small amounts of bilayer lipids in a bolalipid membrane is enough to achieve fluid bolalipid membranes that are both stable and flexible, resolving this trade-off. Our study suggests a mechanism by which archaea can tune the material properties of their membranes as and when required to enable them to survive in harsh environments and to undergo essential membrane remodelling events like cell division.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104212">Social experience shapes fighting strategies in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Social isolation generally increases aggression but decreases mating competition, resulting in an intricate and ambiguous relationship between social experience, aggression, and reproductive success. In male <i>Drosophila</i>, aggression is often characterized by lunging, a frequent and comparatively low-intensity combat behavior. Here, we provide a behavioral paradigm for studying a less frequent but more vigorous fighting form known as tussling. While social enrichment decreases lunging, aligning with past observations, it heightens the more forceful tussling behavior. These two forms of aggression rely on different olfactory receptor neurons, specifically Or67d for lunging and Or47b for tussling. We further identify three pairs of central pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, shifting from lunging to tussling in socially enriched males is accompanied by better territory control and mating success. Our findings identify distinct sensory and central neurons for two fighting forms and suggest that social experience may shape fighting strategies to optimize reproductive success.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107470">DIRseq as a method for predicting drug-interacting residues of intrinsically disordered proteins from sequences</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are now well-recognized as drug targets. Identifying drug-interacting residues is valuable for both optimizing compounds and elucidating the mechanism of action. Currently, NMR chemical shift perturbation and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are the primary tools for this purpose. Here, we present DIRseq, a fast method for predicting drug-interacting residues from the amino-acid sequence. All residues contribute to the propensity of a particular residue to be drug-interacting; the contributing factor of each residue has an amplitude that is determined by its amino-acid type and attenuates with increasing sequence distance from the particular residue. DIRseq predictions match well with drug-interacting residues identified by NMR chemical shift perturbation and other methods, including residues L<sub>22</sub>WK<sub>24</sub> and Q<sub>52</sub>WFT<sub>55</sub> in the tumor suppressor protein p53. These successes augur well for deciphering the sequence code for IDP-drug binding. DIRseq is available as a web server at <a href="https://zhougroup-uic.github.io/DIRseq/">https://zhougroup-uic.github.io/DIRseq/</a> and has many applications, such as virtual screening against IDPs and designing IDP fragments for in-depth NMR and MD studies.

                The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is a region in the brainstem comprised of an intricate network of specialized cells responsible for sensing and propagating many appetite-related cues. Understanding the dynamics controlling appetite requires deeply exploring the cell types and transitory states harbored in this brain site. We generated a multi-species DVC cell atlas using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing, by curating and harmonizing mouse and rat data, which includes &gt;180,000 cells and 123 cell identities at 5 granularities of cellular resolution. We report unique DVC features such as <i>Kcnj3</i> expression in Ca<sup>+</sup>-permeable astrocytes as well as new cell populations like neurons co-expressing <i>Th</i> and <i>Cck</i>, and a leptin receptor-expressing neuron population in the rat area postrema which is marked by expression of the progenitor marker, <i>Pdgfra</i>. In summary, our findings demonstrate a high degree of complexity within the DVC and provide a valuable tool for the study of this metabolic center.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97270">Distributed subthreshold representation of sharp wave-ripples by hilar mossy cells</a></h4>

              
                In neural information processing, the nervous system transmits neuronal activity between layers of neural circuits, occasionally passing through small layers composed only of sparse neurons. Hippocampal hilar mossy cells (MCs) constitute such a typical bottleneck layer. However, how efficient information encoding is achieved within such constrained layers remains poorly understood. To address this, we focused on sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) – synchronous neural events originating in the CA3 region – and investigated functional diversity within MC populations using in vivo/in vitro patch-clamp recordings in mice. By combining machine learning algorithms, we developed a model to predict CA3 SWR waveforms based on the synaptic response waveforms of MCs, suggesting that SWR-related information is indeed encoded in their subthreshold activity. While individual MCs were generally associated with specific SWR clusters, partial overlap across some MCs was also observed, indicating that CA3 activity is distributed across the MC population. Our findings suggest that CA3 SWR activity is represented in a pseudo-orthogonal manner across MC populations, allowing the small MC layer to effectively compress and relay hippocampal information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107352">Distinct waves of ovarian follicles contribute to mouse oocyte production</a></h4>

              
                The earliest growing mouse follicles, wave 1, rapidly develop in the ovarian medulla, while the great majority, wave 2, are stored for later use as resting primordial follicles in the cortex. Wave 1 follicles are known to mostly undergo atresia, a fate sometimes associated with the persistence of steroidogenic theca cells, but this connection is poorly understood. We characterized wave 1 follicle biology using tissue clearing, lineage tracing, and scRNA-seq to clarify their contributions to offspring and steroidogenesis. Wave 1 follicles, lineage-marked by E16.5 <i>Foxl2</i> expression in granulosa cells, reach preantral stages containing theca cell layers by 2 weeks. Atresia begins about a week later, during which 80–100% of wave 1 follicles degrade their oocytes, turn over most granulosa cells, but retain theca cells which expand in number together with interstitial gland cells in the medulla. During puberty (5 weeks), these cells ultrastructurally resemble steroidogenic cells and highly express androgen biosynthetic genes. Unexpectedly, the <i>Foxl2</i> lineage tag also marked about 400 primordial follicles, located near the medullary–cortical boundary, that become the earliest activated wave 2 follicles. These ‘boundary’ or ‘wave 1.5’ follicles generate 70–100% of the earliest mature oocytes, while fewer than 26 wave 1 follicles with oocytes survive. Consistent with their largely distinct fates in steroid or oocyte production, granulosa cells of antral wave 1 and 2 follicles differentially express multiple genes, including <i>Wnt4</i> and <i>Igfbp5</i>.

">Behavioral evidence for visually dominant audiovisual motion integration</a></h4>

              
                Accurate motion perception is crucial for navigating complex environments, where sensory information is often derived from multiple modalities. While multisensory cues improve performance in tasks involving stationary stimuli, the integration of dynamic motion cues is less understood. Here, we examined the nature of auditory and visual motion integration and determined whether attentional instructions modulate integration. Sixty participants performed direction discrimination tasks under auditory, visual, and audiovisual conditions, with cueing instructions to attend to one or both modalities. Results showed that visual motion direction estimates were more reliable than auditory ones, and audiovisual estimates were superior to either modality alone. Additionally, visual motion estimates were more stable that auditory motion estimates during direction conflict trials. Reliability-weighted models of integration closely predicted audiovisual performance, demonstrating optimal integration. Sensory dominance (visual vs. auditory) influenced sensitivity to audiovisual motion, with visual dominant participants performing better overall. Our results demonstrate that the perception of audiovisual motion is dominated by vision and is shaped by top-down attention.

">Neural Computational Model Predicts Attentional Dynamics during Immersive Search in Virtual Reality</a></h4>

              
                Much of the scientific understanding of visual attention has come from desktop paradigms where body, head, and eye movements are restricted. This stands in contrast to the ability to search and navigate with few constraints in the real world. To bridge this gap, a computational model parametrized on a wide range of well-controlled desktop search tasks was evaluated on its ability to predict search behaviors in a less constrained, immersive environment in virtual reality. A set of validation metrics showed that the model attention map could predict empirical behaviors such as eye gaze and manual responses in VR despite the field-of-view varying from one moment to another from the participant movements. The present work quantifies the real-world applicability of laboratory-based theory and highlights ways to address outstanding limitations in explaining naturalistic visual search behaviors.

">iGABASnFR Imaging Reveals Diffusion-Driven GABA Clearance in the Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic signaling consists of presynaptic release, synaptic and extra-synaptic receptor activation, and signal termination by one of several mechanisms including receptor desensitization, diffusion of GABA, and active clearance by GABA transporters (GATs). Understanding how long GABA is free in the extracellular space is key to understanding how inhibition controls activity but has been technically challenging. Estimates of GABAs persistence from GABAA and GABAB recordings range from tens of milliseconds to multiple seconds, but may reflect receptor properties rather than extracellular GABA dynamics. Using the fluorescent GABA sensor, iGABASnFr, in the mouse cerebral cortex, we show that GABA rapidly disperses (tens of milliseconds) from sites of release sites via diffusion rather than GATs. This GABA then accumulates in the extracellular space, where GATs require hundreds of milliseconds to remove extracellular GABA following its release, and even longer when the local density of GABA release is elevated. This extracellular summation of GABA can act hetero-synaptically by activating and/or desensitizing both extra-synaptic and neighboring synaptic receptors. Together these findings reveal a stark disconnect between phasic IPSC signals, which rapidly depress, and extracellular GABA, which strongly accumulates, raising new questions about how GABAergic inhibition works to shape network function.

">Aggregation-prone alpha-synuclein proteoforms and dysregulated molecular signatures in the vermiform appendix of synucleinopathy patients</a></h4>

              
                Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease, are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by intracellular inclusions containing the amyloidogenic protein alpha-synuclein. While classically considered to be brain disorders, increasing evidence suggests involvement of the gut, with alpha-synuclein aggregates potentially propagating to the brain via the vagus nerve. Evidence also suggests that the vermiform appendix is particularly susceptible to alpha-synuclein aggregation, and appendectomy impacts the onset of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the vermiform appendix remains poorly understood. To explore this, we assessed aggregation properties in postmortem appendix tissues from healthy controls and synucleinopathy patients using the alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (alpha-synuclein-SAA) and performed total RNA sequencing alongside differential bisulfite-hybridization-based DNA methylation analysis in the same tissues to investigate the molecular underpinnings. Moreover, we determined alpha-synuclein cleavage patterns by cataloging soluble alpha-synuclein proteoforms from postmortem substantia nigra and post-surgical appendix tissues using top-down mass spectrometry (TD-MS). Alpha-synuclein-SAA was positive in appendix samples for 68.75% of synucleinopathy patients and 6.6% of controls. Genomic profiling revealed dysregulated expression of genes linked to protein folding/degradation, immune/inflammatory responses, and ciliary dynamics in synucleinopathy appendix tissues. TD-MS identified 65 distinct alpha-synuclein proteoforms in the substantia nigra and appendix, with 9 unique to the appendix. Further, in silico modeling revealed higher aggregation propensity of alpha-synuclein proteoforms in the appendix versus substantia nigra. Together, our findings suggest that a tissue environment of alpha-synuclein dysproteostasis in the appendix has the potential to contribute to the development of synucleinopathies.

">Sildenafil-driven cone PDE6 inhibition alters receptive-field properties of retinal ganglion cells ex vivo</a></h4>

              
                Suppressing the phototransduction cascade has a profound impact on visual information processing in the retina. Here, we examined how acute silencing of photoreceptors alters stimulus preference of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) without affecting retinal anatomy. Using ex vivo recordings from C57BL/6 mouse retinas, we applied the phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) inhibitor Sildenafil and compared responses to flash and drifting-grating stimuli before and after treatment. Flash responses revealed six physiological RGC populations under control conditions. After Sildenafil, Off-responses were completely abolished, and most cells adopted On-like profiles with markedly prolonged response latencies. At the population level, orientation selectivity was preserved; however, RGCs lost the ability to detect spatial frequencies above 0.05 cycle/deg and temporal frequencies above 2 cycle/s. A subset of cells increased their firing rates and transformed from orientation-selective into direction-selective cells, indicating reorganization of tuning properties. To assess photoreceptor specificity of Sildenafil, we tested Gnat1 (rod-deficient, cone-only) and Gnat2 (cone-deficient, rod-only) mouse models. Sildenafil completely removed visually evoked responses in Gnat1 retinas, but not in Gnat2, demonstrating preferential inhibition of cone PDE6. These results show that cone-selective suppression of phototransduction is sufficient to abolish Off-pathway signaling, reduce high-frequency visual sensitivity, and alter RGC receptive-field tuning. Beyond providing a mechanistic explanation for the visual side effects of PDE5/6 inhibitors, this establishes a pharmacological model to mimic early cone dysfunction and study inner retinal adaptation.

">Disinhibition of a recurrent attractor gates a persistent goal signal for navigation</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent attractor networks are widely thought to form the basis of working memory, but how stable attractor activity can be rapidly switched on and off is unclear. Here we investigate how stability and rapid switching can be combined in a discrete recurrent circuit of the fly navigation center. h{triangleup}K and PFG neurons are recurrently connected in a ring structure. Using in vivo imaging, we find that these two populations exhibit shared persistent bump activity that turns on with odor and terminates at the end of a goal-directed upwind run. Using whole-cell recordings, we show that persistence in h{triangleup}K depends on recurrent signalling, and that h{triangleup}K receives slow recurrent excitation and fast inhibition from its synaptic partners. Computational modeling reveals that this combination of slow excitation with fast inhibition yields stable and tuneable persistent attractor dynamics. Next we examine the mechanisms that allow this activity bump to be rapidly turned on and off. We find that while the PFG bump tracks heading continuously, the h{triangleup}K bump is suppressed during turns, and only becomes active during straight goal-directed runs. We can reproduce these dynamics in our model by using inhibition to dynamically uncouple activity in h{triangleup}K from PFG. When h{triangleup}K is inhibited, PFG neurons follow their inputs from the compass system; when h{triangleup}K is disinhibited, recurrent interactions lock this input into place, forming a heading memory. Consistent with this model, we find that inhibitory inputs onto h{triangleup}K increase during turns and are suppressed during odor input and goal-directed upwind runs. Our work reveals how disinhibition can serve as a gate to rapidly write an ongoing measurement to a recurrent memory circuit.

                The amygdala helps prioritize emotional over neutral information but responds similarly to positive and negative stimuli, making it unlikely to drive valence-specific effects within affective networks. We hypothesized that the locus coeruleus (LC) is a key contributor to negative biases in attention. Using ultra-high field 7T MRI in humans, we tested how arousal modulates emotional face processing in an oddball task. Arousal induced by isometric handgrip increased LC cerebral blood flow and amplified brain responses to target and angry faces, but not to happy faces. The amygdala exhibited valence-general responses unaffected by arousal. LC connectivity with the default mode network decreased during processing target and angry faces, and arousal further modulated responses in the salience network and visual cortex. Behaviorally, arousal enhanced recognition of angry faces and performance was linked to left LC activation. These findings highlight the LC as a key structure through which arousal shapes valence processing, biases attention, and informs mechanisms related to affective disorders.

">Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Targets APP and LRRK2 to Improve Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Models</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder lacking therapies that can halt its progression, driven by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and pathological protein accumulation. Our previous research uncovered a critical pathogenic feed-forward loop between the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), where they mutually drive each other's expression, culminating in mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Targeting this vicious cycle represents a promising therapeutic strategy. To discover a potent inhibitor of this axis, we performed high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library. This identified Mitoxantrone hydrochloride (MH), an antineoplastic agent, as a lead compound. We demonstrate that MH dually suppresses both APP transcription and LRRK2 expression/kinase activity, the latter via direct binding to the LRRK2 kinase domain. In cellular models, including patient-derived neurons, MH mitigated neurotoxicity by reducing apoptosis. Critically, in both toxin-induced and genetic PD mouse models, MH treatment rescued dopaminergic neuron loss, reduced phospho--synuclein, and reversed motor deficits. Oral administration was particularly effective, showing superior neuroprotection and behavioral recovery with no detectable cardiotoxicity or gastrointestinal damage. Our findings establish MH as a compelling, repurposable therapeutic candidate capable of disrupting a core pathogenic mechanism in PD.

">Mechanical Properties of the Developing Brain in a Model of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and Relationships to Perineuronal Net Integrity</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging is a useful tool for examining altered neurodevelopmental trajectories in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD affects 1 in 20 infants in the United States with higher prevalence in specific regions across the globe. Advanced neuroimaging methods, such as volumetric morphometry and diffusion-weighted imaging, are critical for determining the effectiveness of interventions that support neurodevelopment in FASD. In this study, we introduce the use of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique used to measure the mechanical properties of brain tissue, to assess the impact of alcohol exposure and combined exercise and environmental complexity intervention on neurodevelopment in a rat model of FASD. Our results indicate that brain stiffness is reduced in juvenile alcohol-exposed rats which is recovered to baseline by adulthood, and damping ratio increases in all rats with age. Additionally, we quantified cortical perineuronal net (PNN) density which follows similar trends to shear stiffness and damping ratio, suggesting MRE may be an effective method for noninvasively monitoring FASD progression related to extracellular matrix integrity.

However, current replacement strategies often rely on radiation or transgenic models, limiting their clinical relevance. CSF1R inhibitors offer a more translational approach to microglia ablation, though surviving host cells can compete with transplanted microglia during repopulation. In this study, we successfully ablated endogenous microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor in adult mice and developed a method to transplant engineered microglia expressing Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in a doxycycline-inducible manner. To enhance engraftment, transplanted cells also expressed a constitutively active CSF1R mutant (caCSF1R). BDNF-expressing transplanted microglia spread through large areas of host mice brains, displayed similar morphology and transcriptional profile to repopulating host microglia, and responded to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Treatment with doxycycline resulted in increased BDNF expression and TrkB phosphorylation in the host brain. Expression of caCSF1R provided transplanted cells with a competitive advantage over endogenous repopulating cells, resulting in the accelerated spread of the transplants. Our results demonstrate the functional integration and therapeutic potential of microglia as vehicles for delivering neurotrophic factors to the brain in a controllable manner. Furthermore, we show that caCSF1R expression is able to enhance the spread of transplanted microglia.

">Glial cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity in a Drosophila C9orf72 neurodegeneration model</a></h4>

              
                The most common genetic cause of both familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an expanded G4C2 repeat in the first intron of the gene C9orf72. The C9orf72 repeat expansion is bidirectionally transcribed into sense and anti-sense RNA foci, and also produces dipeptide repeats (DPRs) via a non-canonical translation mechanism known as repeat-associated (RAN) translation. Each of these components of the G4C2 repeat expansion cause neurodegenerative effects in animal models when expressed in neurons, but impacts from glial expression are more poorly understood. Here, we use glial cell type-specific expression of individual DPRs, of RNA repeat-only, or of the G4C2 repeat that is capable of producing both DPRs and RNA repeats to systematically investigate both the glial cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity of each of these components. Our results show that as with neurons, the GR and G4C2 transgenes, produce the highest degree of cell-intrinsic toxicity when expressed in glia. Both of these transgenes are capable of producing the GR DPR, which is also typically found to be the most toxic factor in neurons. We demonstrate that both the GR and G4C2 transgenes cause activation of mdg4, an endogenous retrovirus (ERV). Such ERV expression is a hallmark of TDP-43 dysfunction that is commonly observed in C9orf72 patients and contributes to both cell intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity. We find that only the G4C2 transgene produces measurable non-cell autonomous effects that result in loss of nearby neurons. But manipulations of apoptosis reveal non-cell autonomous or systemic effects from either GR or G4C2 expressing glia. Blocking apoptotic cell death of either GR or G4C2 expressing glia via the p35 caspase inhibitor further exacerbates effects on lifespan and ablating such glia via expression of the proapoptotic reaper gene partially ameliorates these effects.

">Mu suppression reveals auditory-motor predictions after short motor training in non-musicians</a></h4>

              
                Auditory-motor coupling is a bidirectional neural mechanism that supports speech and music, as demonstrated by motor system activation during passive listening to learned melodies. Such activation is predictive, occurs in non-musicians after a single motor training session, and can be elicited at the single-note level of the practiced melody. These findings support the idea that motor activity guides auditory perception by relaying predictive timing information. However, the evidence remains incomplete, as the neural processes underlying this anticipatory motor activity are not fully understood. EEG studies in musicians have linked it to mu-band suppression, but the temporal scale at which suppression occurs has not been established, and its generalizability to the broader population remains unclear. To address these gaps, we recruited 25 non-musicians who learned to play a simple melody on a piano-like keyboard. Before and after training, participants passively listened to the trained melody and control melodies. Offline, EEG data from the motor training were used to create a time-frequency mask identifying channels, frequencies, and timepoints likely to display mu suppression during passive listening. Significant mu suppression emerged before each note onset only during post-training exposure to the practiced melody, with no effects in other frequency bands. Results prove that mu suppression occurs at the single-note level following short auditory-motor training and is not dependent on prior musical training. Thus, mu suppression appears tied to the anticipatory motor activity observed in prior studies, supporting the notion that motor activity aids perception by anticipating the unfolding of learned auditory-motor sequences.

">Computational characterization of decision making during trans-saccadic visual perception</a></h4>

              
                When sampling visual information from the environment, humans execute fast sequential saccadic eye movements and yet preserve stability in their visual percept. This ability relies on the continuous integration of external sensory information (e.g., visual displacements) and internal monitoring signals. At the time of the saccade subjects often experience saccadic suppression of displacement--a failure to notice changes in the location of visual objects slightly shifted during the eye movement. Although well studied, questions remain regarding how and when external sensory signals lead to perceptual judgment alterations following saccadic eye movements. Here we used a drift diffusion modeling (DDM) framework to systematically examine the extent to which sensory information biased perceptual judgments when detecting trans-saccadic shifts of visual targets. Healthy human participants (N = 30, 21 female) completed a visual perception task in which a visual target was shifted following a prompted saccadic eye movement (4o or 8o). Target displacements occurred up to +2.5o along the horizontal axis, and participants reported the shift direction with a button press response. Incorporating the perceptual response and visual error between the displaced target and end-movement fixation location, the DDM accounted for the visuospatial biasing effects of sensory processing on decision-making. The modeling framework based on the visual error could also capture individual positive and negative biasing effects across backward shifts (i.e., towards the initial fixation location) and forward shifts (i.e., further away from initial fixation). Furthermore, participants whose perceptual bias was more pronounced in either the backward or forward directions tended to show a greater visuospatial offset in evidence accumulation preceding perceptual judgments due to an overreliance on the visual error information. The DDM computational modeling approach described here shows promise as an explanatory framework to account for sensorimotor integration impairments based on perceptual deficits demonstrated in certain patient populations.

">Behavioral unresponsiveness and impaired auditory event-related potentials in the anterior insula during rat absence seizures</a></h4>

              
                Absence epilepsy is marked by sudden lapses in consciousness accompanied by spike-wave discharges (SWDs), yet the neural mechanisms underlying impaired sensorimotor processing in these episodes remain unresolved. Prior work has shown that normal-appearing signals can persist in primary sensory cortical areas during seizures, suggesting that impaired behavioral responsiveness may arise from disruptions in higher-order association cortex. To investigate this hypothesis, we combined behavioral testing with simultaneous local field potential recordings in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). Rats were trained in an auditory conditioned response task, allowing comparison of tone-evoked responses during interictal baseline and ictal SWDs. We found that behavioral performance collapsed during SWDs, with correct responses falling from ~88% at baseline to <1% during SWDs (p < 0.001). Nevertheless, auditory event-related potentials in primary auditory cortex (Au1) during SWDs were not significantly decreased. In contrast, we identified a novel oscillatory evoked potential in the anterior insular cortex (AIC) that was robust in controls, attenuated in GAERS at baseline, and markedly reduced during SWDs. Notably, reductions in AIC response magnitude also occurred during satiated, unmotivated states, but waveform structure was preserved, distinguishing motivational modulation from seizure-related disruption. These results demonstrate that absence seizures selectively impair signals in the anterior insula rather than in primary auditory cortex, identifying the AIC as a potentially critical hub for gating auditory conscious awareness. Beyond refining models of seizure-related unconsciousness, the discovery of an insular oscillatory potential highlights a candidate biomarker and intervention target for absence epilepsy, with broader implications for understanding impaired consciousness in anesthesia, sleep, and brain injury.

">Developmentally timed sensory integration enables efficient larval dispersal</a></h4>

              
                Animals integrate internal and external sensory information to adjust movement gait according to the physical constraints imposed by body-environment interactions. Efficient locomotion is especially important in small organisms where the motile phase is ontogenetically restricted. Motile larvae of otherwise sessile cnidarians must disperse and identify a suitable habitat in a restricted timeframe. Here we show that dispersal in Nematostella vectensis larvae is accomplished by a constant ciliary sensory-motor system that produces stimulus-induced movement. In contrast, neuro-muscular and sensory systems gradually increase in complexity during development, enabling movement-associated gait control through reafferent matching of external and internal information. Together with ciliary propulsion, the developmentally timed appearance of sensory and neuronal structures endows the animal with the ability to integrate information to shape swimming behavior and achieve dispersal in a timely manner, appropriate to the physical challenges of its specific ecological niche.

">Neuropathic pain drives time-dependent reorganization of corticostriatal circuits</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain fundamentally alters sensorimotor integration and motivated behaviors, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this transition remain poorly understood. The striatum, composed of dopamine receptor type 1 (D1)- and type 2 (D2)- expressing spiny projection neurons (SPN), integrates cortical sensory and motor inputs to coordinate movement and motivation, making it a critical candidate for mediating pain-induced behavioral adaptations. Although spinal and cortical pain circuits are well-characterized in limited phases of pain, how corticostriatal pathways and distinct striatal cell populations contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain states remains unclear. Here we show that neuropathic pain, after spared nerve injury in mice, produces temporally distinct, cell-type-specific changes in striatal SPN activity and corticostriatal plasticity that evolve across acute to chronic pain phases. D1 SPNs exhibit smaller amplitude and slower calcium signals during acute pain stages that persist through early chronic phases, while D2 SPNs show delayed response timing during later chronic stages, but also stimulus-specific alterations in neural activity throughout acute and chronic pain states. Critically, primary somatosensory cortex inputs to D2 SPNs develop depressing synapses specifically during intermediate chronic pain phases (~25 days post-injury) that disappear during more severe chronic stages (>3 months), suggesting a failed compensatory mechanism. These findings reveal that striatal circuits undergo dynamic, time-dependent reorganization after peripheral injury, with D1 and D2 pathways contributing distinct temporal signatures to pain-related behavior. The identification of critical windows of striatal plasticity provides new targets for therapeutic interventions that could prevent or reverse chronic pain states by modulating specific corticostriatal circuits during vulnerable transition periods.

">Foraging in conceptual spaces: hippocampal oscillatory dynamics underlying searching for concepts in memory</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain access stored knowledge? It has been proposed that conceptual search engages neurocognitive processes similar to foraging in physical space. We tested this idea using intracranial EEG in patients performing a verbal fluency task, where they spontaneously explored their own knowledge of the world, sampling words from semantic memory. We found that hippocampal theta power increased during conceptual search and scaled with the semantic distance between successive words, paralleling dynamics observed in spatial navigation. Critically, people transitioned between conceptual clusters, resembling transitions between resource patches in foraging behavior. These shifts were marked by enhanced theta-gamma coupling, both within the hippocampus and between the hippocampus and lateral temporal cortex, a key hub of the semantic network. These findings support a mechanistic account of memory search grounded in navigation and foraging principles, suggesting that the hippocampus orchestrates local computations and long-range interactions to enable flexible retrieval of conceptual knowledge.

                Modifying behavior in response to changing environmental conditions is a crucial adaptive function. This capacity is exemplified when animals curtail pursuit of a valued outcome that risks being punished by aversive consequences, but the mediating brain mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, using in vivo cellular-resolution calcium (Ca2+) imaging, optogenetics and chemogenetics, we show that risk of punishment dramatically alters choice between a large/risky and small/safe reward and produces novel, causally necessary, patterns of activity in basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons. We find that experience of a punished outcome generates a BLA representation that is selectively replayed when animals subsequently abort choice of the large/risky reward option. Additionally, we show that risk leads to the incorporation of newly encoding BLA neurons into the pre-choice representation, which predicts shifting away from the large/risky option. These findings reveal how dynamic reshaping of BLA representations underpins behavioral flexibility in the face of risk.

">A regulatory loop regulating signaling between LRRK2 and PP2A in cellular models of Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of late-onset familial and idiopathic Parkinsons disease (PD), known to date. Importantly, recent data from post-mortem tissue as well as biomarker studies suggest that independent of mutations, increased kinase activity of LRRK2 plays an essential role in idiopathic PD pathogenesis. Despite extensive research on LRRK2, its activation mechanism(s) and how the various mutations result in increased kinase activity and neuronal death is still not completely understood. Accumulating evidence points to LRRK2 phospho-regulation, both auto-phosphorylation and phosphorylation by other kinases, as one potential molecular trigger of its activation. LRRK2 activation and localization is regulated by phosphatases such as Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), however the exact mechanism of this phospho-regulation is not known. Our data reveal that PP2A dephosphorylates sites within the RocCOR-GTPase domain of LRRK2 and as a result de-stabilizes LRRK2 dimers, with consequent reduction of its kinase activity. Strikingly, our data further highlight that LRRK2 in turn phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme PPP2CA at its critical residue T304, crucial for both holoenzyme formation and catalytic activity. Importantly, expression of WT-PPP2CA protects from LRRK2-G2019S induced neuronal cell death, while PPP2CA-T304 mutants fail to do so, suggesting that impaired PP2A holoenzyme formation might be detrimental for LRRK2-PD.

">Hemifield-Specific Motion Extrapolation Reveals Limits of Interhemispheric Integration</a></h4>

              
                The accurate perception of moving objects is a fundamental challenge for the visual system, which must compensate for neural processing delays. Motion extrapolation is a proposed mechanism whereby the brain predicts an object's future position. We investigated how an object's motion history shapes its perceived position using the flash-jump illusion, in which a brief color change in a moving bar is mislocalized as further along the direction of motion. Across two experiments, we found that longer preceding motion sequences improved localization accuracy, consistent with motion adaptation. This effect occurred regardless of whether motion continued after the flash. Notably, mislocalization transiently reappeared as the object crossed the vertical midline, suggesting that motion adaptation and motion extrapolation operate independently between within each hemifield. Manipulating the length of the sequence in each hemifield in Experiment 2 confirmed that this adaptation is spatially confined to each hemifield, with limited interhemispheric transfer. The results align with a Bayesian framework in which the brain integrates signals from both hemispheres, with midline crossings triggering a shift from adapted to unadapted neural populations. We identify motion extrapolation, supported by hemifield-specific adaptation in area MT and integration in area MST, as the mechanism behind these midline discontinuities. This work reframes smooth pursuit not just as a tracking behaviour, but as a functional solution to overcome the inherent limits of interhemispheric motion processing.

">Bone conducted responses using the parallel auditory brainstem response (pABR) paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are used to diagnose hearing loss across multiple frequencies in infants and others who cannot participate in behavioral testing. The parallel ABR (pABR) paradigm measures response waveforms to all frequencies from 500 ot 8000 Hz in both ears all at once, rather than serially in one ear at a time. Work so far has been with air conducted stimuli through insert earphones, but bone conducted stimuli are also an essential part of diagnosing the type of hearing loss by determining the relative contributions of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. This study aimed to confirm the feasibility of bone conduction pABR. Design: We recruited a cohort of young adults with normal hearing. An intensity series of two-channel ABRs were measured to pABR stimuli played through ER-2 insert earphones as well as with a B-71 bone vibrator with contralateral masking. Behavioral thresholds were also measured to compare dB nHL correction factors. To keep sessions under 3.5 hours only one ear was tested with bone conduction. The ear with bone conduction and the order of transducers was counterbalanced across participants. Waveform morphologies for each transducer were compared by their wave V latencies and amplitudes and residual noise. Results: For the same dB nHL levels, responses to both transducers aligned well and wave V amplitudes and latencies were similar. While stimulus artifacts can be an issue with bone conduction, the steps taken to mitigate it in air conduction pABR were also effective for bone conduction: clear bone conducted responses were measured and residual noise was similar for both transducers. Bone conducted responses to 8 kHz were weak, which was not surprising given the physics of bone conduction and the output capabilities of the bone vibrator. As expected, behavioral thresholds were higher for pABR than pure tone stimuli, and by the same offset for both transducers. The dB nHL values differed due to the difference in reference equivalent threshold levels for inserts and the bone vibrator. Conclusions: Air and bone conduction provided similar waveforms, indicating that bone conduction pABR is feasible. Together with establishing dB nHL values, this work represents an important step towards translating the pABR for diagnosing all types of hearing loss.

">Functional specialization of the hippocampus along its dorso-ventral axis: from span to supraspan in working memory capacity</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is characterized by a limited capacity or span, beyond which performance deteriorates, the supraspan condition. Human neuropsychology and neuroimaging studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus (HPC), in WM particularly when memory load exceeds span, yet no animal model has been established to investigate supraspan mechanisms. Here, we present a novel rodent model of supraspan memory and examine the distinct roles of dorsal and ventral HPC. Using selective NMDA lesions in mice combined with object recognition tasks and a modified radial arm maze (RAM), we manipulated memory load and strategy constraints to assess span and supraspan performance. Dorsal HPC lesions impaired object memory span, while ventral lesions spared this ability. In the RAM, span performance (number of correct arm visits before the first error) was unaffected by either lesion under allocentric conditions. However, once animals exceeded span, following the first error, here defined as the supraspan condition, both dorsal and ventral lesions caused catastrophic disorientation and error escalation. Under free-choice conditions, ventral HPC lesions selectively reduced the occurrence of trials with no errors in the first 5 choices, increased errors overall, and disrupted sequential egocentric strategies. Together, these results demonstrate that supraspan performance can be modeled in rodents, revealing a dorsal contribution to object memory under high load, a ventral contribution to egocentric spatial strategies, and a shared hippocampal role in supraspan memory performance. This paradigm provides a translational framework for investigating supraspan deficits observed in MTL patients and Alzheimer's disease.

">Deveolopment of patient-derived neuroprogenitor cells (hNPCs), neurons, and astrocytes to explore the etiology of Guam Parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC)</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (PDC) is one phenotype of a disappearing neurodegenerative disease (Guam ALS-PDC) that shows clinical and neuropathological relationships with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), atypical parkinsonism and Alzheimer disease. ALS-PDC has been linked with exposure to environmental factors (notably cycad plant neurotoxins), but evidence from human and animal studies is inconclusive. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a powerful in vitro system to explore the underlying cause of PDC. iPSC lines were derived from lymphocytes of a PDC-affected Guamanian Chamorro female patient and an age- and gender-matched healthy Chamorro resident of PDC-unaffected Saipan using non-integrating episomal plasmids. iPSCs derived from both patients expressed pluripotency markers (Oct4, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, Sox2) prior to the generation of neuroprogenitor cells (hNPCs), neurons and astrocytes. An embryoid body protocol was used to derive hNPCs from both iPSC lines while a differentiation media was used to generate neurons from hNPCs. hNPCs derived from both iPSC lines displayed established neuroprogenitor markers (nestin, Sox2), while the differentiated hNPCs exhibited both neuronal (beta-tubulin III, Map2, doublecortin) and synaptic (synaptophysin, PSD-95) markers. Expression of these protein markers in hNPCs and neurons by dot blotting was also observed for both lines. Astrocyte progenitor cells and mature astrocytes with appropriate markers were also developed from the hNPCs of both lines using commercial kits. Development of these patient-derived iPSCs provides a human model for evaluating the role of environmental (e.g., cycad toxins) and genetic factors in ALS-PDC and possibly other related neurodegenerative diseases.

">Neuromodulation of zebrafish primary motoneuron firing is shaped by developmental changes in the M-current</a></h4>

              
                Movements during development are refined through the ongoing maturation of the spinal circuits that mediate them. In many vertebrates, including zebrafish, this maturation process involves neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and dopamine; however, the targets of this neuromodulation remain largely unknown. Recent work has revealed distinct developmental dynamics of the non-inactivating subthreshold potassium current, the M-current, in primary motoneurons of larval zebrafish. Considering that neuromodulators play a role in the maturation of locomotor control in larval zebrafish, we asked whether neuromodulators might target the M-current in primary motoneurons during development. Our patch-clamp experiments in primary motoneurons of zebrafish aged 3 to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) reveal distinct modulation of the M-current by serotonin and acetylcholine that is age-dependent. Our data demonstrates an inhibitory influence of serotonin signaling via 5HT1A receptors that promotes repetitive firing in primary motoneurons specifically at 3 dpf. We also show that acetylcholine, likely via M2/M4 receptors, enhances the M-current and limits repetitive firing in primary motoneurons but does so only after 3 dpf. Modulation of the M-current in primary motoneurons was not observed across all neuromodulators as dopamine had no effect at any age. Considering that the M-current transiently peaks at 3 dpf and is reduced at 4 and 5 dpf, our findings suggest that the developmental changes in this current can shape how neuromodulators modulate firing properties of primary motoneurons.

">Impact of serotonin transporter deficiency on parvalbumin- and neuropeptide Y-producing interneurons of the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactivity of the basolateral amygdaloid nuclear complex (BLA) is a hallmark of anxiety-related disorders in humans. Excitation of BLA projection neurons (PN) is fine-tuned by inhibitory interneurons (INs). Monoaminergic afferents to the BLA modulate PN and IN activity. In the present study, BLA-INs immunoreactive(ir) for parvalbumin (PV) or neuropeptide Y (NPY) and their interrelations with serotonergic and catecholaminergic afferents were analyzed in wildtype (WT) and serotonin transporter knockout (5-HTT KO) mice, a model for anxiety- and stress-related disorders. In WT mice, PV- and NPY-ir INs fall into morphological subgroups which possess perisomatic appositions by serotonergic and tyrosine hydroxylase-ir afferents. Dual immunolabeling shows no colocalization of PV and NPY. NPY/somatostatin(SOM) dual labeling documents colocalization of the peptides in some neurons, and single labeling for NPY or SOM in others. These features appear largely preserved in 5-HTT KO mice. However, quantification of PV- and NPY-ir neurons documents a reduction in number and density of NPY-ir neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the amygdala in 5-HTT KO mice. PV-ir neurons remain unchanged. Quantitative PCR shows increased expression of Npy receptor 2, Som receptor 4, and corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1 in the BLA of 5-HTT KO mice. mRNA for the three peptides is unchanged, indicating that it may be NPY propeptide translation which is reduced in 5-HTT KO mice. Taken together, the results document an effect of life-long serotonin imbalance on the BLA NPY-system, which may contribute to previously observed morphological alterations in BLA PNs and increased anxiety-like behavior in 5-HTT KO mice.

                Leptin receptor-expressing hypothalamic neurons (LepRHypo) are key regulators of energy balance, yet a comprehensive, cell type-resolved, chromatin accessibility map of these neurons is lacking. We profiled ~20,000 LepRHypo nuclei using single-nucleus multiome (snRNA-seq/snATAC-seq), identifying 39 transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct clusters, including AgRP (two subtypes), Pomc (two subtypes), Foxb1, Irx5/3 (three subtypes), Nts, PNOC (two subtypes), Kiss1/Pdyn (KNDy, two subtypes), Ghrh, Tcf7l2, and Sf1/Nr5a1 (three subtypes) populations. We also identified three Glp1r-expressing clusters with the highest Lepr enrichment, each marked by distinct molecular signatures. Cluster-specific open chromatin regions (OCRs) delineated putative cis-regulatory elements unique to each LepRHypo subtype. Mouse cell-type specific OCRs conserved in the human genome were identified; a subset were proximal to genes with high Human Genetic Evidence (HuGE) scores for obesity-related traits, overlapped obesity-associated GWAS loci, and/or coincided with eQTLs, including variants with the potential to influence human energy balance. Together, these data provide cell type-specific cis-regulatory atlas of LepRHypo neuronal subtypes, including Glp1r/Lepr-enriched populations, and highlight evolutionarily conserved, subtype-specific regulatory elements, associated candidate genes, and putative functional variants that may modulate LepRHypo subtype function and influence energy homeostasis and obesity susceptibility in humans.

">Direct encoding of new visual concepts in early visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical memories are assumed to rely on slow systems consolidation through hippocampal offline reactivation. However, recent studies show rapid neocortical integration of new memories for information associated with prior knowledge. Testing the limits of rapid neocortical learning, we tracked memory formation across 24h with functional and diffusion-weighted MRI in subjects acquiring either conceptual or detailed knowledge of novel objects from identical visual stimulation. Concept learning-induced rapid, 24h-stable changes in strength and pattern of functional early visual cortex responses. These were co-localized with microstructural changes, correlated positively with categorization performance and negatively with context recognition. Detailed item-context learning elicited analogous changes in posterior parietal areas. Results show that the neocortex can rapidly learn without prior knowledge and that concept learning can occur in early sensory regions that process corresponding visual features. Thus, we substantiate the possibility of direct or parallel neocortical encoding without offline abstraction from individual episodes.

">Repetitive Trans-spinal magnetic stimulation Promotes Repair in Inflammatory Spinal Cord Injury Through Sex-Dependent Immune Modulation</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injuries (SCI), whether traumatic or inflammatory such as transverse myelitis (TM), are characterized by severe neuroinflammation, demyelination, and long-term disabilities. Current treatments remain limited, highlighting the need for novel non invasive therapeutic approaches. Repetitive magnetic stimulation (RMS) has emerged as a promising strategy, but its mechanisms and efficacy in inflammatory contexts remain poorly described. Here, we investigated the effects of RMS applied as trans spinal RMS (rTSMS) in a mouse model of focal spinal cord demyelination induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). When applied one day after LPC injection, rTSMS reduced inflammation, demyelination, and fibroglial scar formation, while promoting early locomotor recovery in both sexes. In contrast, when treatment was initiated three days after LPC injection, corresponding to the peak of motor deficits, rTSMS conferred tissue protection and functional benefits only in female mice. RNA sequencing analyses revealed sex dependent immune modulation: in females, rTSMS primarily regulated adaptive T cell related pathways, whereas in males, it mainly targeted innate immune responses such as neutrophil activity and phagocytosis. Complementary in vitro experiments using microglial and macrophage cultures further demonstrated that RMS modulates transcriptomic responses differently depending on cell type and inflammatory state. Specifically, RMS attenuated IL1 induced pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages and completely abolished these effects in microglia. Altogether, our findings establish rTSMS as a non invasive therapy capable of reducing neuroinflammation and demyelination in inflammatory SCI, with pronounced sex dependent effects. By uncovering distinct immune pathways engaged in male and female mice, this study provides mechanistic insights into rTSMS action and opens perspectives for its translational use in neuroinflammatory diseases.

">Compositional Recombination Relies on a Distributed Cortico-Cerebellar Network</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition depends on the ability to flexibly recombine existing knowledge in new ways. Although this capacity for compositionality has traditionally been attributed to cortical networks, its broader neural basis remains unclear. Here, we combined dimensionality reduction of task-based fMRI with recurrent neural network modelling to dissociate two processes underlying compositional cognition: the recruitment of specialised components; and the more general process of recombination. Across 87 participants performing a well-established compositional task, component processes were supported by domain-selective cortical and anterior cerebellar regions, whereas recombination engaged a distributed cortico-cerebellar network that was low-dimensional, highly integrated, and generalised across contexts. Similar functional signatures were also observed in recurrent neural networks trained to perform multiple cognitive tasks, suggesting that low-dimensional recombination is a general solution for flexible compositional cognition. Our findings revise existing models of compositional cognition by highlighting cortico-cerebellar interactions as a mechanism for flexible, integrative task generalisation.

">Transcriptomic and network analyses of an alcohol-induced peripheral neuropathy model identify putative role for histone demethylase Jmjd1c</a></h4>

              
                Background Alcohol-induced peripheral neuropathy (AIPN) is a painful and prevalent condition associated with chronic alcohol use, yet its molecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. Because the analgesic effects of ethanol may reinforce alcohol consumption, elucidating the mechanisms driving AIPN is essential. This study aimed to identify ethanol-regulated gene expression patterns in the nervous system of a mouse model of AIPN. Methods Male (n = 10) and female (n = 12) C57BL/6J mice were administered either an ethanol-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet at 5% or an isocaloric control diet for four weeks. Ethanol consumption was recorded daily for the experimental group. After the drinking protocol, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia tissues were collected for RNA sequencing. Results Ethanol-regulated genes were identified for each sex-tissue group using DESeq2, and results were compared to known rodent neuropathic pain gene signatures. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified modules of co-expressed genes associated with ethanol administration. Hub genes with high intramodular connectivity were identified for ethanol-correlated modules. Of the 14 identified hub genes, 10 have been previously implicated in pain or neuropathy, including Jmjd1c, Phf8, and Gas6, which emerged as particularly strong candidates for involvement in AIPN pathophysiology. Conclusions These findings provide novel insights into the gene networks underlying AIPN and nominate specific genes for future functional studies.

                Background The Ichu River serves as the primary water source for urban and agricultural use and industrial operations, but anthropogenic pollution has a serious negative impact on its water quality. Methods The investigation measured water quality and health-related risks by analyzing physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants at eight sampling points, site 1 (S1) through (S8). Results The research data showed that water quality worsened progressively from upstream to downstream locations such as turbidity, TDS, conductivity, and BOD levels increased. Oil pollution and oxygen depletion arose from a reduction in dissolved oxygen from 6.3 to 4.5 mg/L at the different sampling sites (S1 to S8). Heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples exceeded the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) established standards because of mining and industrial wastewater and local wastewater discharge. The presence of excessive Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms in microbial tests proved that the water was severely contaminated by fecal matter. Principal Component Analysis showed that heavy metals exist with microbial pollution and organic load as the main sources of water quality decline, and pollution indicators were found to establish powerful relationships with depleted oxygen levels. Conclusion The severe contamination risks found in this study justify immediate pollution control measures, wastewater treatment enforcement, and sustainable watershed management practices. Urgent action is necessary because vital parameters surpass the standards set by the WHO and (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to avoid enduring environmental damage and health problems. This research demonstrates the value of continuing water quality assessments while enforcing policies and raising public awareness to improve the water quality of the Ichu River.

                Background There is a limited range of treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a cancer known for its aggressiveness; therefore, innovative alternative therapies are required. A link between TNBC progression and bacterial dysbiosis in the gut microenvironment has been demonstrated. Thai traditional formulary medicine (TTFM), comprising bioactive natural products and medicinal plants, exhibits anti-cancer properties. However, the effectiveness of TTFM against breast cancer (BC) has not been clarified. The present study aimed to identify the secondary metabolites of TTFM and investigate its effects on BC both in vitro and in vivo. Methods The metabolite profiles of TTFM extracts were investigated using LC-MS/MS analysis. The anti-cancer activities were examined using a cell viability assay. The effects on the apoptosis pathway and gene expression profiles were also investigated using an apoptosis assay and RNA sequencing analysis. Next, TTFM extracts were examined in 4T1 xenografted mouse models. The gut microbiota profiles and tumor gene expression were investigated by 16S rDNA sequencing and nanoString, respectively. Results LC-MS/MS identified 302 compounds in the TTFM extract. In breast cancer cells, TTFM inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Additionally, TTFM treatment partially restored the gut microbiota balance, increasing the abundance of Butyrivibrio hungatei and reducing Clostridium saccharolyticum. NanoString analysis showed that TTFM modulated immune responses by upregulating the Pias1 gene and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1r2, IL-1β, IL-2) and cancer-related genes (Ccno, Nkd1). Conclusion This study highlights the anti-cancer potential of TTFM extracts, suggesting its future use in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.

                Tuberculosis of the parotid is an uncommon presentation, as the gland is rarely a primary site of infection. It is often confused with malignant tumors because of the similarity of the clinical presentation (the presence of a progressive and abscessed parotid swelling) We present the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with chronic indurated right parotid gland swelling evolving from one month with fever. Clinical examination objectified a painful, indurated right parotid mass measuring 7 cm with ipsilateral grade 2 right peripheral facial palsy. Imaging showed a solid-cystic parotid mass with lysis of the mandibular condyle. Malignancy was suspected. However, biopsy confirmed tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was ruled out. The patient responded well to anti-tuberculosis therapy, showing significant improvement after six months. Parotid gland tuberculosis is very rare and can mimic malignant tumors. It is crucial to rule out this diagnosis, especially in countries where tuberculosis is common, during the diagnosis process.

                Background India records the highest number of suicide deaths globally, but suicide prevention efforts are hindered by a lack of trained personnel within the public health system. Given that an index suicide attempt is a strong predictor of future suicide, intervening with individuals who have recently attempted suicide is a targeted prevention approach that can be delivered within the public health system and has potential to be scaled up across low-resource settings. Aim To test the implementation and preliminary effectiveness of Contact and Safety Planning (CASP) in reducing suicidal behaviour and symptoms of depression among adults with a recent suicide attempt in Chhattisgarh. Methods We will carry out a non-randomized, controlled pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, adoption, reach, implementation (including cost) and preliminary effectiveness of CASP when delivered by health workers – emergency nurses and Community Health Officers – in two districts of Chhattisgarh (n=250). The control group will receive Enhanced Usual Care, consisting of telephonic counselling by trained District Mental Health (n=250) program staff. Data will be collected at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow- up. Conclusion This study will shed light on the feasibility of CASP and inform its further refinement to address suicide at scale in India.

                Background The nursing profession is increasingly appealing to male students at the undergraduate level. Society’s demand for nurses, particularly male nurses, is rising; nevertheless, the availability of clinical placements for nursing students is insufficient to meet this demand. Simulation has significantly advanced as an educational method for training healthcare personnel. Simulation makes replicating real-life events and honing skills like clinical decision-making and communication. Using simulation as an adjunct or alternative to clinical practice is now under discussion. Simulation is a resource-intensive pedagogical approach, necessitating careful consideration of its organization and implementation to maximize efficiency without undermining learning outcomes. Objective This study aimed to explore simulation as a teaching pedagogy for male undergraduate nursing students in the United Arab Emirates. Method This study adopted a descriptive qualitative approach. The purposive sampling method recruited 43 male students from nursing programs in the University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, to participate in the individual interviews. In addition, two focus group discussions were conducted on an online meeting platform. Data analysis was done using thematic analysis. Results In this study, we identified four major themes: 1) Students’ perceptions of simulation, 2) Preparation for realistic situations, 3) Feeling of anxiety and stress, and 4) Theory and practice abilities gaps. Conclusion The study findings indicate that male nursing students received the overall simulation experience well. The study highlights the importance of skilled and encouraging simulation instructors who can provide participants with valuable guidance and feedback for more individualized teaching. Study results provide important new information about how simulation-based learning could improve nursing education and further studies in this field. The findings shed light on the problems that male nursing students have been dealing with for years and highlight efforts to make changes as soon as feasible. It may be helpful to revise the simulation to provide more opportunities for independent problem-solving skills and to incorporate more real-life factors and variables into the scenario. Additionally, developing more individualized approaches to building self-confidence may be helpful, such as providing personalized feedback and guidance based on each student’s strengths and weaknesses.

                Background The August Revolution of 1945 established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but the nascent government immediately faced immense challenges from external forces like French colonialists and Chiang Kai-shek’s army, alongside internal difficulties. In this precarious situation, diplomacy emerged as a crucial strategic tool for the Vietnamese revolution during the 1945-1946 period, demonstrating a skillful blend of struggle and negotiation to safeguard independence. Methods This study is grounded in the principles of dialectical and historical materialism, consistent with the viewpoint of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The main methods include: the historical method (systematic examination of events and policies), the logical method (reconstructing diplomatic strategies), intertextual analysis (comparing Party directives with diplomatic actions), critical discourse analysis (Ho Chi Minh’s statements), and comparative assessment (with other decolonization movements). Data were collected from declassified archival materials, legal texts, diplomatic records, and contemporary press. Results During 1945-1946, Vietnam implemented an independent, self-reliant, and open foreign policy based on principles of equality and mutual assistance, with the core objective of protecting independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This policy demonstrated strategic flexibility by conciliating Chiang Kai-shek’s forces to free up resources against the French, and by signing the Preliminary Accord and Provisional Agreement with France to gain time for resistance preparation. Vietnamese diplomacy also proactively established friendly relations with neighboring countries and major powers, sought international recognition, and committed to multilateral cooperation, thereby strengthening the legitimacy of the revolutionary government. Conclusion In an extremely challenging situation, foreign affairs activities, under the leadership of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh, successfully protected Vietnam’s independence and enhanced the Democratic Republic of Vietnam’s prestige. The strategic lessons on foreign policy thinking from 1945-1946 have become a firm foundation for Vietnam’s modern foreign policy. They emphasize the harmonious combination of national independence, socialism, genuine patriotism, and internationalism, striving towards the ultimate goal of building a “prosperous people, strong country, democracy, justice, and civilization” in Vietnam.

                Background Intestinal parasitosis are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in Africa. The tropical climate in the D.R. Congo provides parasites with an environment conducive to their proliferation. The prevalence rates of intestinal parasitosis remain poorly understood in the D.R. Congo. Objective This study aims to estimate the overall and specific prevalence of intestinal parasitosis and to determine an association between intestinal parasitosis and the season at CHUNDE. Methods From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, patients for whom a direct stool examination was requested at the Notre Dame de l’Espérance University Hospital Center were included in this study. Stool samples were collected and examined under an optical microscope. Results During the period of the study, we recorded 187 patients aged 2 to 77 years. The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 75.40%. The specific prevalence rates for parasites were as follows: E. histolytica/dispar, the most common, with a prevalence of 55.08%, followed by P. hominis and G. lamblia with respective prevalence rates of 9.09% and 6.24%. A. lumbricoide had a prevalence of 27.81%, followed by S. mansoni, A. duodenalis, and E. vermicularis with respective prevalence rates of 3.74%, 1.60%, and 1.07%. There was no association between the season and the overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis. Conclusion The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was higher amang symptomatic patients at CHUNDE. There is no statistically valid association between the season and the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis.

                Background Barriers to mental-health care include limited resources and workforce, access constraints, and stigma. Artificial-intelligence (AI)–enabled chatbots may offer low-threshold support. Methods Cross-sectional correlational (comparative) study in one private health-sciences university in the UAE. Proportional stratified random sampling across four colleges yielded n = 298 undergraduates. Instruments: (i) Socio-Demographic Questionnaire; (ii) researcher-developed AI Chatbot Usability questionnaire (content validated by a bilingual specialist); and (iii) Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21; established reliability/validity). Questionnaires were administered face-to-face with standardized instructions. Results 206/298 (69.1%) had ever used an AI chatbot; most used Snapchat AI (76.9%), followed by ChatGPT/Bard (23.4% each). Overall, 57.0% had moderate-to-extremely-severe depression, 68.5% anxiety, and 33.6% stress. Users had higher odds of moderate-to-extremely-severe anxiety and depression than non-users. In multivariable models, higher depression (OR = 1.022; 95% CI 1.01–1.085; p<0.001) and anxiety (OR = 1.05; 95% CI 1.01–1.21; p<0.001) independently predicted chatbot use; stress did not. Conclusion Among UAE health-sciences students, AI-chatbot use is common and associated with higher depression/anxiety severity; this likely reflects help-seeking rather than causation. Universities should integrate early, stigma-sensitive supports, potentially including regulated, evidence-based chatbot tools—within stepped-care services.

                Background Corporate Political Activity (CPA) has gained growing academic attention as a non-market strategy for influencing policy, reducing uncertainty, and enhancing firm-level outcomes. However, existing studies remain fragmented, often confined to single industries, regions, or political mechanisms, with limited cross-country comparisons and minimal exploration of digital political engagement. Moreover, no recent comprehensive synthesis has captured post-2020 developments across diverse institutional and industrial contexts, leaving gaps in understanding the broader patterns and boundary conditions of CPA effectiveness. Methods This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of peer-reviewed empirical articles published between 2020 and 2025, guided by the PRISMA framework. Articles were systematically identified, screened, and synthesized from the Scopus database. Out of 589 initial articles, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Results The findings show that CPA is primarily positioned as an independent variable affecting performance, innovation, and competitiveness. While CPA frequently generates positive outcomes, risks such as agency problems, reputational damage, and bribery emerge in weak governance environments. The review also reveals that integrating Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) with CPA strengthens legitimacy and strategic impact, particularly in politically volatile contexts. Conclusions Theoretically, this study contributes by mapping empirical trends, clarifying contextual boundary conditions, and proposing an integrated conceptual framework that bridges resource-based and institutional perspectives on CPA. Practically, it offers guidelines for aligning political engagement with ethical governance, enabling firms to leverage CPA–CSR integration to navigate complex institutional environments while maintaining legitimacy and stakeholder trust.

                Background The rapid growth of social media has created new opportunities for brands to reach consumers through influencer marketing. While influencers are increasingly recognized as effective opinion leaders, less is known about the psychological mechanisms through which their content shapes purchasing behaviour. This study investigates the impact of influencer marketing on consumers’ purchase intentions, with particular attention to the mediating role of consumer attitude. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May and June 2025. Data were collected from 326 active social media users who follow influencers online. Respondents completed a structured questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed with SPSS and AMOS, employing reliability testing, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and structural equation modelling. Mediation was tested using bootstrapping procedures with 5,000 resamples. Results The measurement models demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity after refinement. The structural model indicated that influencer marketing exerted a strong positive effect on purchase intention (β = 0.83, R2 = 0.68, p < .001). When consumer attitude was introduced as a mediator, the direct effect of influencer marketing on purchase intention decreased (β ≈ 0.44–0.46) but remained significant. The indirect effect through consumer attitude was also significant (≈ 0.39, p < .001), confirming that attitude partially mediates the relationship. Conclusions The findings highlight the dual role of influencer marketing in shaping consumer decisions: directly influencing purchase intention while also operating indirectly through favourable attitudes. For practitioners, the results emphasize the importance of selecting influencers who are credible, authentic, and aligned with the brand, as well as creating engaging, high-quality content that encourages interaction with followers. The study contributes to theory by reinforcing the mediating role of attitude in the persuasion process and offers practical guidance for designing more effective influencer marketing campaigns.

                The importance of urban health in achieving population and planetary health goals is increasingly recognized. Cities offer important opportunities to improve health and wellbeing while also presenting significant challenges. As our understanding of, and evidence, for the importance of determinants of health beyond health care have grown, the need for urban health policies and actions that transcend disciplinary and sectoral boundaries and involve multiple stakeholders in urban decision-making has become clearer. Current urban health practice builds on decades of conceptual and operational work. This paper traces the evolution of the urban health paradigm through research, policy and practice in recent decades. We suggest that, despite the proven utility of urban health as a paradigm and its conceptual and practical evolution for effective urban health governance, significant challenges remain, especially related to implementing the systems approaches needed to improve health and wellbeing amidst the complexity of urban dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1044/v1?src=rss">The role of desire over obligation in explaining continued smoking abstinence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective To assess the role of self-reported desire over obligation in explaining continued smoking abstinence among people who recently stopped smoking. Method An observational study with cross-sectional and 12-month follow up data including 230 (45.2% female; mean age 45.4 years) adults in England who confirmed they had made a serious quit attempt and were not currently smoking at baseline. The predictor variable was assessed at baseline through responses to the statement: “I am stopping smoking because I want to rather than because I feel I have to” on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = ‘strongly disagree’; 7 = ‘strongly agree’). The outcome was smoking status at 12-month follow-up. Covariates were baseline sociodemographic and smoking-related characteristics. Associations were assessed with logistic regression. Results At 12-month follow-up, 59.1% (n=136) reported they were still not smoking and 40.9% (n=94) had restarted smoking. Longer time since quit was positively associated with quit success maintenance at 12-months (adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.28, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.04-1.58). People who were more strongly motivated to quit by desire were equally or less likely to still be abstinent at 12-months than those who were more motivated by obligation (AOR 0.85, 95%CI 0.70-1.01). Conclusion Being more motivated by desire than obligation does not appear to be positively associated with continued smoking abstinence at 12-month follow-up. This suggests obligation over desire may play more of a role in sustaining quit attempts, but more data across multiple time points are needed to understand this association.

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media and web-based platforms were widely used to promote medicinal substances. To assess community perspectives on drug promotions on social media, we conducted qualitative research using three workshops. The workshops aimed to highlight the public understanding of drug advertising focusing on community perceptions of social media drug promotions, their risks and benefits. Discussions were conducted on the importance of adhering to national drug regulation policies and the World Health Organisation ethical criteria for promotion, advertisement, and publicity of medicines. Methods Participants for the workshops were purposively sampled from local community youth groups and healthcare facilities. Two workshops included ten young adults aged 18-35, while the third workshop involved three healthcare professionals and one traditional healer. Results The study participants’ highlighted the value of honesty and trust in the drug promotions. Gaps in the ethical conduct of advertising were observed and concerns were raised about the reliability of social media information and the omission of valuable details on the drug advertisements. Conclusion Individuals have a right to informed choices that ensure their health safety. This study has highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in pharmaceutical and complementary medicine marketing on social media. Collaboration is needed between regulatory bodies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers and community members, to make sure that drug advertising upholds ethical standards and public health.

                This research paper cites the outcomes of complex Morlet wavelet analysis, artificial intelligence techniques, thermography analysis, and SKF-Machine condition advisors for monitoring the conditions of deep groove ball bearings under several faults in different components. The complex Morlet wavelet approach is presented as a crucial technique to specify a complete picture regarding the condition of the deep groove ball bearing in conjunction with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyzer vibration data in the initial stage of the inception of the fault. Subsequently, this study implements two Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), for the identification and classification of bearing faults more effectively in a multi-fault environment. Finally, onsite condition monitoring tools such as thermal imaging cameras and machine condition advisors are found to be potential tools for the indication of defects in deep groove ball bearings in a cost-effective manner and to validate the result after a certain level of severity of the fault. The experimental results showed that the proposed system using a complex Morlet wavelet and support vector machine is effective.

                Background Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is one of the most common reproductive complications among women of childbearing age. Several factors—including genetic, anatomical, endocrine, infectious, environmental, and immunological causes—have been implicated in RSA. This study aimed to explore the potential association between RSA and the expression patterns of selected genes involved in critical biological processes related to pregnancy maintenance and miscarriage. Methods The relative expression levels of matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were evaluated using peripheral blood samples from 30 women with a history of two or more spontaneous abortions (cases) and 30 age-matched non-pregnant women with no history of miscarriage and at least one successful pregnancy (controls). Results No significant differences in the mRNA expression levels of the target genes were observed between women with RSA and the control group. Conclusions Our findings suggest that peripheral blood gene expression profiles of MMP2, MMP9, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and MTHFR may not adequately reflect tissue-specific changes associated with RSA. Further investigations using relevant tissues, such as placental or decidual samples, are warranted to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying RSA.

                <p>by Sultan Sevgi Turgut Ögme, Nizamettin Aydin, Zeyneb Kurt</p>

Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) analyses performed at the cellular level aim to understand the cellular landscape of tissue sections, offer insights into rare cell-types, and identify marker genes for annotating distinct cell types. ScRNAseq analyses are widely applied to cancer research to understand tumor heterogeneity, disease progression, and resistance to therapy. Single-cell data processing is a challenging task due to its high-dimensionality, sparsity, and having imbalanced class(cell-type) distributions. An accurate cell-type identification is highly dependent on preprocessing and quality control steps. To address these issues, generative models have been widely used in recent years. Techniques frequently used include Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Gaussian-based methods, and, more recently, Flow-based (FB) generative models. We developed a Masked Affine Autoregressive transform-embedded FB (MAF-FB) model. Then, to improve MAF-FB further, we incorporated a mixture of experts (MOE) of attention mechanisms on top of it, resulting in our proposed MOE-FB model. We conducted a comparative analysis of fundamental generative models, aiming to serve as a preliminary guidance for developing novel automated scRNAseq data analysis systems. We performed a large-scale analysis by combiningfour datasets derived from pancreatic tissue sections and for further generalizability assessments, we employed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC68K and PBMC3K) and Human Cell Atlas Bone Marrow (HCA-BM10K) datasets. We utilized VAE, GAN, Gaussian Copula, and Automated Cell-Type-informed Introspective Variational Autoencoder (ACTIVA), and compared them against our two novel FB models, MAF-FB and MOE-FB for ScRnaseq synthesis. To evaluate the performances of generative models, we used various discrepancy metrics and performed automated cell-type classification tasks. We also identified differentially expressed genes for each cell type, and inferred cell-cell interactions based on ligand-receptor bindings across distinct cell-type pairs. Among the generative models, FB models, especially MOE-FB, consistently outperformed others across all experimental setups in both discrepancy metrics with comparison to the baseline test set and cell-type classification tasks (with an F1-score of 0.90 precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.92 for the integrated pancreatic datasets). MOE-FB produced biologically more relevant synthetic data, and ligand–receptor–based cell–cell interactions inferred from the synthetic cells closely resemble the original data, achieving an RMSE of 0.65 against the corresponding pancreatic test set. These findings highlight the potential and promising use of FB models, especially MOE-FB, in scRNAseq analyses.

Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation technique, offering a potential alternative to pharmacological treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders. While functional analysis has been instrumental in characterizing the TUS effects, understanding its indirect influence across the network remains challenging. Here, we developed a whole-brain model to represent functional changes as measured by fMRI, enabling us to investigate how TUS-induced effects propagate throughout the brain with increasing stimulus intensity. We implemented two mechanisms: one based on anatomical distance and another on broadcasting dynamics, to explore plasticity-driven changes in specific brain regions. Finally, we highlighted the role of higher-order functional interactions in localizing spatial effects of off-line TUS at two target areas—the right thalamus and inferior frontal cortex—revealing distinct patterns of functional reorganization. This work lays the foundation for mechanistic insights and predictive models of TUS, advancing its potential clinical applications.

                <p>by Claire S. Teitelbaum, Michael L. Casazza, Cory T. Overton, Elliott L. Matchett, Diann J. Prosser</p>

Emerging infectious diseases pose threats to wildlife populations, as exemplified by recent outbreaks of avian influenza viruses in wild birds. Climate change can affect infection dynamics in wildlife through direct effects on pathogens (e.g., environmental decay rates) and changes to host ecology, including shifting migration patterns. Here, we adapt an existing mechanistic model that couples migration and infection to study how traits of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses contribute to HPAI outcomes in migratory waterfowl, then apply this model to explore potential impacts of climate change on HPAI dynamics. We find that the simulated impacts of HPAI on the host population under baseline climate conditions varied from no impact to 100% mortality, depending on viral traits. In most cases, traits related to transmission (i.e., contact rates, shedding rates) were more important for HPAI establishment probability, infection prevalence, and mortality than were other viral traits (e.g., environmental temperature sensitivity, cross-protective immunity). We then simulated the effects of climate change (i.e., altered temperature regimes) on HPAI dynamics both via viral environmental decay and via changes in bird migration phenology. In these simulations, we found that a 9-day advancement in spring migration timing increased the duration of HPAI outbreaks by increasing time birds spent at their breeding grounds, leading to higher mortality and fewer infections. In contrast, increased viral decay in warmer years had a smaller, but opposite impact. These patterns depended on the primary transmission mode of HPAI (i.e., direct vs. environmental) and its sensitivity to environmental temperatures. Together, these results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the impacts of HPAI on waterfowl populations if HPAI relies strongly on direct transmission and birds advance their spring migration. Further integrating host-viral co-evolution and other climatic changes (e.g., salinity, humidity) could provide more precise predictions of how HPAI dynamics could change in the future.

                <p>by Matthew J. Stower, Richard C. V. Tyser, Shifaan Thowfeequ, Felix Zhou, Marta Portela, Konstantinos Miti, Jacintha Sugnaseelan, Xin Lu, Shankar Srinivas</p>

Anterior–posterior axis formation in the mouse embryo requires the active migration of the DVE cell population at E5.5. While intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration. The pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the mouse embryo at early peri-implantation stages is also unknown. Using the GCaMP6f Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter line, we performed a detailed assessment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics between E0.5 and E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in extraembryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multicellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning.

                <p>by Thomas J. Stoll, Nathan D. Vandjelovic, Melissa J. Polonenko, Nadja R. S. Li, Adrian K. C. Lee, Ross K. Maddox</p>

The ability to pick out and attend to one sound in a noisy mixture underpins successful communication in many natural scenarios. Selective attention has been shown to drastically alter sound encoding in the cortex and has been hypothesized to modulate subcortical processing via an extensive efferent network. The body of work investigating this possibility in humans has not resulted in a clear consensus, possibly owing to limitations in the available methodologies. Here, we used new experimental tools that allowed distinct neural responses from across the auditory pathway to be simultaneously acquired from human listeners attending to the sound of one person talking while ignoring a second. Our series of experiments provide convergent evidence that selective attention does not influence sound encoding in the auditory periphery or brainstem, with an effect first appearing in the cortex. Humans’ ability to focus their attention on a single sound even in the presence of many others is as remarkable as it is essential. These findings add needed clarity regarding the mechanisms that make this feat possible.

                In this datanote we present data from 31 iRBD (idiopathic Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder) patients followed throughout three years to assess their eventual phenoconversion to Parkinson’s disease and other established neurodegenerative conditions. iRBD is a prodromal condition of neurological pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease. We evaluated transcription factor mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells as predictive biomarkers of phenoconversion in iRBD, showing that among the transcription factors mRNA levels analysed, STAT1, GATA3 and FOXP3 mRNA levels may be used to predict phenoconversion. In particular, we found that CD4+ T cells from converters had higher STAT1, and lower GATA3 and FOXP3 mRNA levels. According to ROC curve analysis STAT1 levels provided a good discrimination, GATA3 levels an excellent discrimination of future converters and not-converters, while discrimination provided by FOXP3 levels was acceptable.

                Background We have little knowledge about the synchronous occurrence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and other types of histologic tumors. This association is very rare. Case presentation We describe a case of synchronous stromal tumor and adenocarcinoma of the left side colonic localization. Immunohistochemistry identified c-Kit expression. The discovery of colonic adenocarcinoma was on operative specimen after histologic examination. The patient underwent left oncologic colectomy with stoma. Follow-up at one year postoperatively did not detect tumor recurrence. Discussion Clinical implications of the association between these two neoplasms are not clearly described. Treatment depends on the the most aggressive histologic type or obviously highest stage. Knowledge of the genetic data of this association offers opportunity of treatment with the new targeted-therapy molecules. Surgical resection, may remain the curative treatment. Conclusions Synchronous adenocarcinoma and GIST has been more commonly described in the stomach.  The pathogeneses of tumorigenesis may not be the same for the two tumors. More studies seem be necessary to clarify a potential role of different genes in the development of adenocarcinomas. And therefore, above all their therapeutic implications.

                Background Environmental degradation, which is the deterioration of ecological quality due to increased unsustainable economic activities, is a global concern that poses a threat to humanity. Like many African countries, Namibia is severely affected by environmental degradation, an arid, lower-middle-income country in sub-Saharan Africa with 16 percent land covered by desert. Therefore, understanding the dynamics between financial development, institutional quality, and environmental quality. Methods This study examines the impact of financial development and institutional quality on environmental quality in Namibia, using time series data spanning the period from 1990 and 2023. The study used ARDL approach to examine the short and long run relationship. Results The findings show that institutional quality increases environmental degradation, aligning with the notion that climate change is not a result of only economic activities, but also a result of weak institutions. However, financial sector development often supports novel and sophisticated investment products and preserves the environment. Conclusion Therefore, this study recommended that Namibia make collaborative efforts to implement effective regulations to strengthen the role of institutions and support financial innovation to address environmental degradation. Additionally, encouragement of environmental, societal, and governance (ESG) led business investments is needed.

                Background Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a critical barrier in assisted reproductive technology, affecting a significant subset of women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to systematically review and analyze the causes and treatments of RIF, providing evidence-based insights to enhance clinical management. Methods PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched for articles published up to February 29, 2024. Studies were selected if they involved human subjects undergoing IVF, reported pregnancy outcomes, and addressed embryonic or extraembryonic factors influencing implantation. A total of 4,380 articles were screened, and 75 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were pooled using fixed and random effects models, with heterogeneity assessed via I2, τ2, and Cochran's Q test. Key factors analyzed included embryo euploidy, uterine abnormalities, thyroid function, and chronic endometritis, while treatments evaluated included antibiotics, heparin, platelet-rich plasma, and assisted hatching. Results Meta-analyses revealed that embryo euploidy significantly improves the odds of clinical pregnancy, while untreated hydrosalpinx and chronic endometritis significantly decreases the odds of pregnancy. Effective interventions include antibiotics for chronic endometritis, hysteroscopy for uterine abnormalities, and heparin for specific coagulation disorders. Other treatments, such as platelet-rich plasma and assisted hatching, require further evidence. Conclusions RIF management demands a tailored approach, emphasizing comprehensive diagnostics and personalized interventions. Despite the growing recognition of RIF, inconsistencies in its definition and limited high-quality evidence for certain treatments remain challenging. Further research is essential to standardize protocols and improve outcomes.

                Background The functions of pavement-markings are to safely and smoothly guide drivers and vehicles along a road-lane, alert drivers not to leave the lane, and provide traffic information. These functions are directly related to the safety and economy of passengers and vehicles on roads. The visibility of pavement-markings is linked to surface damage during the daytime and is significantly affected by luminance at night. Therefore, damage and luminance should be considered key-factors for maintenance and should be measured in detail. In Seoul, mobile equipment such as image-scanners and damage-detectors has been used to measure damage conditions, and a luminance measurement vehicle has been introduced to observe reflected light intensity from road-markings. The mobile measurement methods are respectively utilized due to their objective difference of the measurement. However, measurement discrepancies in temporal, locational, and environmental conditions can lead to considerable errors. Moreover, a standardized maintenance index is currently lacking for planning repair work in Seoul. In that regards, one objective of this research was to develop a retroreflectivity prediction model using a vehicle that detects pavement and marking damage. Method The model enables the prediction of retroreflectivity without additional measurement equipment. Another objective was to develop degradation models based on the age of pavement-markings and to evaluate their performance for maintenance and budget planning. Results As a result, a regression model was determined to be the optimal predictive model for retroreflectivity. A logarithmic model was selected to predict retroreflectivity degradation. Additionally, the Seoul-Road-Marking-Index was developed. Conclusion The developed models are expected to assist in establishing maintenance plans, formulating budgets, and determining repair work, as well as developing relevant regulations and standards in Seoul.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to compare the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20–40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between the number of periodontopathogens and the amount of nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected, DNA was isolated, the entire 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, and sample libraries were prepared in accordance to the Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology procedure. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity in saliva samples that were pooled according to three groups; T2DM patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3), was measured using bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the relationships between the periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium spp.) and denitrifying community (Haemophilus, Neisseria, Rothia, and Veillonella) were assessed. Results The salivary microbiota among people with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease (gingivitis, G2; periodontitis, G3) showed more bacterial diversity and abundance than that of patients without periodontal disease (G1), according to alpha-diversity analysis (p < 0.0001). The G3 group exhibited the largest abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathogen. Additionally, we discovered that periodontopathic bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria have different interactions. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that, with a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93 (p = 0.04), the connection between Fusobacterium spp. and Neisseria was a powerful indicator for distinguishing between gingivitis and periodontitis. Conclusion Results of this study show that the connection between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in the salivary microbiome varies among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis. These features may be crucial markers for the early detection and management of gingivitis to avoid periodontitis.

                Background Among the key factors for cross-country skier training are high altitude training and strength in double-polling, because has recently been used not only for long-distance races but also for World cup. This study aimed to identify the effects of artificially induced high altitude on acute performance changes during aerobic (AE) and anaerobic (ANE) threshold exercises. Sport-specific tests simulating double-poling cross-country skiing were performed. Methods Eleven (8 ♂ and 3 ♀) highly trained cross-country skiers (age 19±2.81, BMI 21.9±2.1) performed a stress test to determine individual AE and ANE levels and AE and ANE intensity tests at low (500 m ASL) and artificially induced high (2000 m ASL) altitudes. The altitude was simulated using the hypoxic generator HYP-100™. For double-poling, the ergometer SkiErg® was used in the standing position. Heart rate (HR) and lactate concentration (LC) in the capillary blood were monitored. Results For the AE and ANE loads, the average HR values at an artificially induced high altitude were 3–5% higher than those at a low altitude. The differences were significant, both statistically (p<0.05) and substantively. The average LC values were neither statistically significant (p>0.05) nor substantively significant. Conclusions Not-adapted youth elite cross-country skiers have higher HR at artificially induced high altitudes (2000 m ASL) during the test on SkiErg® compare to the same load in lowland (500 m ASL). The absence of alterations in the average LC confirms that it is more appropriate to monitor the HR for altitude acute effect assessment and employ LC only for verification. For the management of endurance sports training at high altitude our research confirmed that exercise must respect the principles of acclimatization processes.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Memory is a cornerstone of human behavior, and addiction offers a compelling model of its persistence and plasticity. The scope of engram research has rapidly expanded to include addiction-related phenomena. Addiction-related memories, like strong aversive memories, are often highly resistant to extinction and can continue to drive relapse long after drug use has ceased. These enduring behavioral effects suggest that drug engrams, sparsely distributed neural ensembles encoding drug-associated experiences, are stabilized by powerful synaptic and molecular plasticity. At the same time, their very malleability may hold the key to developing new treatments. This minireview synthesizes emerging findings on drug engrams, highlighting the specialized circuits, molecular mechanisms, and behavioral consequences tied to addiction-related memory traces. We focus on how engram tagging and reactivation techniques have revealed addiction-specific ensembles across several brain regions and important pathways that promote or attenuate drug-seeking behavior. We also discuss how direct manipulation of drug engrams may hold promise for weakening the influence of drug-associated cues and other relapse triggers, while enhancing protective circuits to reduce relapse risk. Still, fundamental questions remain such as how do drug engrams evolve during the transition from recreational use to addiction? Addressing these questions will be critical for developing circuit-informed, lasting interventions that target the memory systems sustaining addiction.</p>

                The study of foraging is central to a renewed interest in naturalistic behavior in neuroscience. Applying a foraging framework grounded in behavioral ecology has enabled probing of the mechanisms underlying cognitive processes such as decision-making within a more ecological context. Yet, foraging also involves myriad other aspects, including navigation of complex environments, sensory processing, and social interactions. Here, we first provide a brief overview of the neuroscience of foraging decisions, and then combine insights from behavioral ecology and neuroscience to review the role of these additional dimensions of foraging. We conclude by highlighting four opportunities for the continued development of foraging as an ethological framework for neuroscience: integrating normative and implementation-level models, developing new tools, enabling cross-species comparisons, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dyslexia is a neurobiological disorder characterized by reading difficulties, yet its causes remain unclear. Neuroimaging and behavioral studies found anomalous responses in tasks requiring phonological processing, motion perception, and implicit learning, and showed gray and white matter abnormalities in dyslexics compared to controls, indicating that dyslexia is highly heterogeneous and promoting a multifactorial approach. To evaluate whether combining behavioral and multimodal MRI improves sensitivity in identifying dyslexia neurocognitive traits compared to monocomponential approaches, 19 dyslexic and 19 control subjects underwent cognitive assessments, multiple (phonological, visual motion, rhythmic) mismatch-response functional MRI tasks, structural diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T1-weighted imaging. Between group differences in the neurocognitive measures were tested with univariate and multivariate approaches. Results showed that dyslexics performed worse than controls in phonological tasks and presented reduced cerebellar responses to mismatching rhythmic stimuli, as well as structural disorganization in white matter tracts and cortical regions. Most importantly, a machine learning model trained with features from all three MRI modalities discriminated between dyslexics and controls with greater accuracy than single-modality models. The individual classification scores in the multimodal machine learning model correlated with behavioral reading accuracy. These results characterize dyslexia as a composite condition with multiple distinctive cognitive and brain traits.</span>

                In a recent study, Goueytes and colleagues combined computational modeling with intracranial recordings to dissect the neural basis of confidence and changes of mind. They reveal a temporally organized, spatially distributed hierarchy of evidence accumulation, with pre-decisional signals in the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) and post-decisional signals in the insula. This reframes metacognition as a distributed and dynamic process.

                The brain constantly generates predictions based on one’s knowledge of the world, as captured in memory. When these predictions are in error, our knowledge base must be revised to remain relevant. Here, we propose that this error-driven updating of memory depends largely on the interplay between the hippocampus and locus coeruleus (LC), during which the former conveys information about surprise to the latter, signaling the magnitude of prediction error. Small prediction errors promote editing of existing memories, whereas large prediction errors lead to the formation of new episodic memories. We suggest that this memory curation process is central to adaptive behavior, extending classical views on the contributions of the LC to cognition.

                Background Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) incidence in Northeastern Thailand is very high and a major cause of mortality. CCA patients typically have a poor prognosis and short-term survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to approve medicinal cannabis treatment, especially for palliative care with advanced cancer patients. Methods A retrospective cohort study compared survival among 491 newly diagnosed advanced CCA patients between September 2019 and June 2021. Of these, 404 received standard palliative pain management (ST), and 87 received medicinal cannabis treatment (CT). Patients were enrolled from four tertiary hospitals and two secondary hospitals in five provinces of Northeast Thailand. Cumulative survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox regression. Results For ST patients, follow-up time was 790 person-months, with a mortality rate of 48.35/100 person-months. For CT patients, follow-up time was 476 person-months, with a mortality rate of 10.9/100 person-months. The median survival time after registration at a palliative clinic was 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95) for ST and 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38) for CT. Multivariate analysis showed CT was significantly associated with prolonged survival (HRadj = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.20–0.37; p < 0.001). Conclusions The medical cannabis increased overall survival rates among CCA patients. In this retrospective cohort, Medicinal cannabis treatment was associated with more prolonged survival among advanced CCA patients in Northeastern Thailand. While this association remained significant after multivariable adjustment, unmeasured or residual confounding factors may have influenced the observed outcomes. Although the association remained significant after adjustment, unmeasured or residual confounders may have influenced outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore potential mechanisms.

                Background Postoperative immobilization in patients with lower extremity fractures frequently leads to constipation, affecting approximately 50–70% of patients. Non-pharmacological nursing interventions such as Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy are potential approaches to alleviate this problem. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy in reducing constipation scores among patients with postoperative lower extremity fractures. Methods A quasi-experimental pre–posttest design without a control group was conducted with 30 respondents selected using a simple random sampling technique. Constipation was assessed using the Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) before and after intervention. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests, and results were interpreted with attention to baseline differences between groups. Results Both interventions significantly reduced constipation scores. The mean post-intervention CAS score was 4.60 in the warm water group and 3.56 in the Swedish abdominal massage group (p < 0.001). Although Swedish abdominal massage showed a greater within-group reduction, baseline imbalances in constipation scores may have influenced the observed differences. Conclusion Swedish abdominal massage and warm water therapy are effective nurse-led, non-pharmacological interventions for reducing postoperative constipation. The findings should be interpreted cautiously due to baseline differences and small sample size. Future research with larger samples, controlled designs, and statistical adjustments is recommended to confirm these preliminary findings.

                Background It is imperative to deliver exceptional services in order to improve patient contentment and cultivate enduring loyalty in the healthcare sector, which is becoming more competitive. The direct impact of leadership and governance on patient experience and retention remains underexplored, despite the increasing recognition of their role in determining care delivery. This investigation investigates the connections between healthcare organizations’ corporate governance, service quality, patient satisfaction, and loyalty, as well as entrepreneurial leadership. Methods Data were obtained from 384 executive patients in hospitals throughout Indonesia using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results The findings indicate that corporate governance and service quality are considerably improved by entrepreneurial leadership, while patient satisfaction and loyalty are positively impacted by corporate governance. Nevertheless, patient satisfaction was found to be moderately influenced by service quality, while patient loyalty was significantly influenced. As a result, patient satisfaction was demonstrated to be a critical factor in the development of patient loyalty. These results emphasize the importance of high service quality, effective governance, and entrepreneurial leadership in promoting patient satisfaction and loyalty. Conclusions The research offers valuable insights for healthcare managers and policymakers who are interested in enhancing organizational performance and improving patient retention. This research theoretically enhances comprehension of the impact of leadership and governance frameworks on patient retention and service quality. In practical terms, it provides valuable recommendations for hospital administrators and policymakers to improve patient satisfaction and loyalty by implementing effective leadership, robust governance, and continuous service improvement.

                Introduction With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), its integration into medical fields has gained momentum. AI is increasingly applied for diagnosing and managing temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), affecting one of the most complex joints in the body. This review aims to highlight the AI-driven approaches in diagnosing and treating TMD. Methods A comprehensive literature search conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on English-language studies published since 2007. References from relevant articles were also examined. Results A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering diverse AI applications in TMD. These studies included AI-driven medical image segmentation (3), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (3), temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) detection (4), Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) articular disc displacements and deformities (5), decision support systems (5), and AI-based sound analysis for TMJ assessment (1). The findings suggest that AI, particularly deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques, has demonstrated promising accuracy in detecting and classifying TMD and its related pathologies. AI automates segmentation, improves diagnostic consistency, and assists clinicians through predictive modeling. Discussion Despite advancements, challenges remain, as many studies rely on small datasets, limiting generalizability. The absence of standardized evaluation metrics and external validation hinders clinical adoption. Ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and workflow integration pose additional barriers. Future research should focus on larger datasets, model interpretability, and rigorous clinical validation. Conclusion AI is emerging as a valuable tool in TMD diagnosis and management, promising improved accuracy and efficiency, but further development is essential for real-world implementation.

                Background Standard multi-drug therapy (MDT) with duration of 6-12 months is generally effective for treating leprosy. However, in cases of lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) patients with high bacterial loads and complicated circumstances often faces non-adherence. Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, has shown promising efficacy against Mycobacterium leprae in in-vitro and in-vivo studies, therefore accelerates bacterial clearance. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of adding ofloxacin to MDT in 21 patients diagnosed with LL or BL leprosy at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Bacterial load and viability were tracked using the Bacteriological Index (BI) and Morphological Index (MI), and were compared before and after the patients were given ofloxacin. Findings Adding ofloxacin to MDT led to a significant reductions in both BI and MI. The median MI dropped to zero after six months of combined treatment (p<0.001), with significant differences between baseline and 6, 9, and 12-months. BI also significantly declined (p=0.007), with significant reductions between baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12-month assessments. The proportion of patients reaching an MI of zero also steadily increased. Interpretation Ofloxacin as an adjunctive therapy to MDT substantially improves treatment of leprosy with high bacterial and morphological index. Faster bacterial clearance prevent prolonged treatment duration, potentially improving adherence, outcomes and reducing relapse risk. Ofloxacin is the only second-line leprosy treatment covered by the national health insurance in Indonesia. Earlier initiation of this adjunctive therapy may offer greater benefits.

                Objective The rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors, predictive of type 2 diabetes, relates largely to increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyle, but also to early metabolic life events. Considering the consequences on health of developing MetS in young adulthood, the objective of this study is to better characterize and understand MetS phenotypes in a young adult born with small weight for gestational age (SGA). Methods A nested case-control study is designed within the French community-based Haguenau cohort, including 92 male and female young SGA adults divided into cases (with MetS at follow-up, n=46) and controls (free of MetS, n=46), matched for age and sex, all free of MetS at baseline. Serum metabolic signatures will be first determined at the end of follow-up (30 years of age) to characterise phenotypes related to MetS using an untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomic approach. Results will be compared to those obtained in a population of adults born with adequate weight for gestational age (AGA), matched for age and sex, to reveal the specific part of phenotypes related to the imprint of the foetal environment. Lastly, the baseline signatures (20 y.o.) will be identified to explore early dysfunctions around 10 years before diagnosis and evaluate the capacities of serum metabolites to predict evolution towards MetS in SGA. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of the University of Paris-St Louis, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Research findings will be disseminated through peer reviewed publications and at national and international conferences with domain-specific societies, to researchers, clinicians, and policy markers sharing findings. This project was supported by the ‘Fondation Francophone de Recherche sur le Diabète’.

                Background Digital transformation in banking is accelerating, yet internal adoption of key applications remains suboptimal. BRISPOT is a digital credit system used by relationship managers (RMs) in the SME segment of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). Methods Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) integrated with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), this quantitative study surveyed 150 RMs. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions significantly affected behavioral intention to use BRISPOT. Behavioral intention had a strong influence on actual usage. However, trust did not moderate the intention–use relationship. Conclusions The integration of UTAUT and SCT offers a robust explanation of digital adoption behavior among internal users. System usability and institutional support are critical for driving adoption. Trust, while conceptually important, may be context-dependent.

                <p>by Hongru Du, Matthew V. Zahn, Sara L. Loo, Tijs W. Alleman, Shaun Truelove, Bryan Patenaude, Lauren M. Gardner, Nicholas Papageorge, Alison L. Hill</p>

Human behavior plays a crucial role in infectious disease transmission, yet traditional models often overlook or oversimplify this factor, limiting predictions of disease spread and the associated socioeconomic impacts. Here we introduce a feedback-informed epidemiological model that integrates human behavior with disease dynamics in a credible, tractable, and extendable manner. From economics, we incorporate a dynamic decision-making model where individuals assess the trade-off between disease risks and economic consequences, and then link this to a risk-stratified compartmental model of disease spread taken from epidemiology. In the unified framework, heterogeneous individuals make choices based on current and future payoffs, influencing their risk of infection and shaping population-level disease dynamics. As an example, we model disease-decision feedback during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the decision to participate in paid, in-person work was a major determinant of disease risk. Comparing the impacts of stylized policy options representing mandatory, incentivized/compensated, and voluntary work abstention, we find that accounting for disease-behavior feedback has a significant impact on the relative health and economic impacts of policies. Including two crucial dimensions of heterogeneity—health and economic vulnerability—the results highlight how inequities between risk groups can be exacerbated or alleviated by disease control measures. Importantly, we show that a policy of more stringent workplace testing can potentially slow virus spread and, surprisingly, increase labor supply since individuals otherwise inclined to remain at home to avoid infection perceive a safer workplace. In short, our framework permits the exploration of avenues whereby health and wealth need not always be at odds. This flexible and extendable modeling framework offers a powerful tool for understanding the interplay between human behavior and disease spread.

                <p>by Théo Pinettes, Quentin J Leclerc, Kévin Jean, Laura Temime</p>

Nosocomial infections of both patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in hospitals may play an important part in the overall dynamics of a viral pandemic, as evidenced by the recent COVID-19 experience. A strategy to control this risk consists in dedicating some hospitals to the care of infected patients only, with HCWs alternating between shifts of continuous stay within these hospitals and periods of isolation. This strategy has been implemented locally in various settings and generalized in Egypt. Here, using a mathematical model coupling hospitals and community, we assess the impact of this strategy on overall epidemic dynamics. We find that quarantine hospitals may significantly reduce the number of cumulative cases, as well as the peak incidence, when effective control strategies are in place in the community and symptomatic HCWs comply with self-isolation recommendations. Our results, which are robust to variations in assumed biological characteristics of the virus, suggest that the quarantine hospital strategy could be considered in future pandemic contexts to best protect the entire population.

Using data from gene combination double knockout (CDKO) experiments, top ranked synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs were highly inconsistent among different SL scores. This leads to a significant concern that SL prediction models highly depend on SL scores. In this paper, we introduce a new gene combination effect (GCE) measurement, log-fold change of dual-gRNA expression before and after CRISPR-cas9 lentivirus transfection. We show it is a direct and highly consistent measurement of GCE in all CDKO experiments. We therefore develop a multi-layer encoder model for individual sample specific GCE prediction, MLEC-iGeneCombo. Under a deep learning framework, MLEC-iGeneCombo is a systems biology model that contains sample specific multi-omics encoder, network encoder and cell-line encoder. For the first time, MLEC-iGeneCombo predicts GCE for a new cell. Using data from 18 CDKO experiments, MLEC-iGeneCombo achieves an average GCE prediction performance, 71.9%. All three encoders significantly improve the model’s prediction performance (p≤0.01), and their combined use yields the best GCE prediction performance. Our source code is available at https://github.com/karenyun/MLEC-iGeneCombo.

                <p>by Guillermo Martín-Sánchez, Christian K. Machens, William F. Podlaski</p>

Hippocampal remapping, in which place cells form distinct activity maps across different environments, is a well-established phenomenon with a range of theoretical interpretations. Some theories propose that remapping helps to minimize interference between competing spatial memories, whereas others link it to shifts in an underlying latent state representation. However, how these interpretations of remapping relate to one another, and what types of activity changes they are compatible with, remains unclear. To unify and elucidate the mechanisms behind remapping, we here adopt a neural coding and population geometry perspective. Assuming that hippocampal population activity can be understood through a linearly-decodable latent space, we show that there are three possible mechanisms to induce remapping: (i) a true change in the mapping between neural and latent space, (ii) modulation of activity due to non-spatial mixed selectivity of place cells, or (iii) neural variability in the null space of the latent space that reflects a redundant code. We simulate and visualize examples of these remapping types in a network model, and relate the resultant remapping behavior to various models and experimental findings in the literature. Overall, our work serves as a unifying framework with which to visualize, understand, and compare the wide array of theories and experimental observations about remapping, and may serve as a testbed for understanding neural response variability under various experimental conditions.

Protein-RNA interactions are essential in gene regulation, splicing, RNA stability, and translation, making RNA a promising therapeutic agent for targeting proteins, including those considered undruggable. However, designing RNA sequences that selectively bind to proteins remains a significant challenge due to the vast sequence space and limitations of current experimental and computational methods. Traditional approaches rely on in vitro selection techniques or computational models that require post-generation optimization, restricting their applicability to well-characterized proteins.
We introduce RNAtranslator, a generative language model that formulates protein-conditional RNA design as a sequence-to-sequence natural language translation problem for the first time. By learning a joint representation of RNA and protein interactions from large-scale datasets, RNAtranslator directly generates binding RNA sequences for any given protein target without the need for additional optimization. Our results demonstrate that RNAtranslator produces RNA sequences with natural-like properties, high novelty, and enhanced binding affinity compared to existing methods. This approach enables efficient RNA design for a wide range of proteins and even proteins with no RNA-interaction data available, paving the way for new RNA-based therapeutics and synthetic biology applications

                <p>by Daniel Chapman, Flavia Occhibove, James M. Bullock, Pieter S. A. Beck, Juan A. Navas-Cortes, Steven M. White</p>

Mathematical and computational models play a crucial role in understanding the epidemiology of economically important plant disease outbreaks, and in evaluating the effectiveness of surveillance and disease management measures. A case in point is <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, one of the world’s most deadly plant pathogens. Since its European discovery in olives in Puglia, Italy in 2013, there remain key knowledge gaps that undermine landscape-scale containment efforts of the outbreak, most notably concerning the year of introduction, the rate of spread, dispersal mechanisms and control efficacy. To address this, we developed a spatially explicit simulation model for the outbreak spreading among olive groves coupled to a simulation of the real surveillance and containment measures. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit the model to surveillance and remote-sensing infection data, comparing the fits for three alternative dispersal mechanisms (isotropic, wind and road). The model accurately explained the rate and spatiotemporal pattern of the outbreak and found weak support for the wind dispersal model over the isotropic model. It suggests that the bacterium may have been introduced as early as 2003 (95% CI [2000, 2009]), earlier than previous estimates and congruent with anecdotal evidence. The isotropic model estimates the pathogen is spreading at 5.7 km y<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI [5.4-5.9]) under containment measures, down from 7.2 km y<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI [6.9-7.5]) without containment measures. Our estimate of an approximately 10-year lag between introduction and detection highlights the need for stronger biosecurity and surveillance for earlier detection of emerging plant pathogens. The outputs from simulations without any disease management also suggest that while containment measures have caused some slowing of <i>X. fastidiosa</i> spread, stronger measures will be required to contain the outbreak fully.

                <p>by Nicholas Steyn, Marc Chadeau-Hyam, Paul Elliott, Christl A. Donnelly</p>

Epidemic prevalence surveys monitor the spread of an infectious disease by regularly testing representative samples of a population for infection. State-of-the-art Bayesian approaches for analysing epidemic survey data were constructed independently and under pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we compare two existing approaches (one leveraging Bayesian P-splines and the other approximate Gaussian processes) with a novel approach (leveraging a random walk and fit using sequential Monte Carlo) for smoothing and performing inference on epidemic survey data. We use our simpler approach to investigate the impact of survey design and underlying epidemic dynamics on the quality of estimates. We then incorporate these considerations into the existing approaches and compare all three on simulated data and on real-world data from the SARS-CoV-2 REACT-1 prevalence study in England. All three approaches, once appropriate considerations are made, produce similar estimates of infection prevalence; however, estimates of the growth rate and instantaneous reproduction number are more sensitive to underlying assumptions. Interactive notebooks applying all three approaches are also provided alongside recommendations on hyperparameter selection and other practical guidance, with some cases resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster runtime.

                <p>by Peter Scarfe, Paul B. Hibbard</p>

Ocular convergence is one of the critical cues from which to estimate the absolute distance to objects in the world, because unlike most other distance cues a one-to-one mapping exists between absolute distance and ocular convergence. However, even when accurately converging their eyes on an object, humans tend to underestimate its distance, particularly for more distant objects. This systematic bias in distance perception has yet to be explained and questions the utility of vergence as an absolute distance cue. Here we present a probabilistic geometric model that shows how distance underestimation can be explained by the visual system estimating the most likely distance in the world to have caused an accurate, but noisy, ocular convergence signal. Furthermore, we find that the noise in the vergence signal needed to account for human distance underestimation is comparable to that experimentally measured. Critically, our results depend on the formulation of a likelihood function that takes account of the generative function relating distance to ocular convergence.

                <p>by Saeed Mohammadzadeh, Emma Lejeune</p>

In cardiac cells, structural organization is an important indicator of cell maturity and healthy function. Healthy and mature cardiomyocytes exhibit a highly organized structure, characterized by well-aligned almost crystalline morphology with densely packed and organized sarcomeres. Immature and/or diseased cardiomyocytes typically lack this highly organized structure. Critically, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offer a valuable model for studying human cardiac cells in a controlled, patient-specific, and minimally invasive manner. However, these cells often exhibit a disorganized and difficult to quantify structure both in their immature form and as disease models. In this work, we extend the SarcGraph computational framework—designed specifically to assess the structural and functional behavior of hiPSC-CMs—to better accommodate the structural features of immature cells. There are two key enhancements: (1) incorporating a deep learning-based z-disc classifier, and (2) introducing a novel ensemble graph-scoring approach. These modification significantly reduced false positive sarcomere detections, particularly in immature cells, and improved the detection of longer myofibrils in mature samples. With this enhanced framework, we analyze an open-source dataset published by the Allen Institute for Cell Science, where, for the first time, we are able to extract key structural features from these data using information from each individually detected sarcomere. Not only are we able to use these structural features to predict expert scores, but we are also able to use these structural features to identify bias in expert scoring and offer an alternative unsupervised learning approach based on explainable clustering. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our modified SarcGraph algorithm in extracting biologically meaningful structural features, enabling a deeper understanding of hiPSC-CM structural integrity. By making our code and tools open-source, we aim to empower the broader cardiac research community and foster further development of computational tools for cardiac tissue analysis.

                <p>by Yuting Liu, Leiru Huang, Ruipeng Wang, Fukang Qi, Yiwen Liu, Qingyuan Chen, Morgane Mialon, Lili Chen, Berangere Pinan-Lucarre, Shangbang Gao</p>

Nicotine exposure elicits diverse behavioral changes, yet the underlying neural pathways and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that chronic nicotine exposure markedly increases both the initiation and duration of reversals in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Strikingly, these reversals were tightly coupled with the rhythmic body contractions of the defecation motor program (DMP). Through pharmacological, genetic, in situ electrophysiological, and calcium imaging analyses, we show that nicotine enhances the activity of the AVA interneuron via selective upregulation of ACR-16, a nicotinic ACh receptor critical for nicotine-induced motor coupling. Ablation of touch receptor neurons (TRNs) or inhibition of TRNs-mediated mechanosensation completely abolished this coupling. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of TRNs in nicotine-treated animals evoked stronger AVA depolarization, and nicotine amplified gentle touch-evoked reversals. Together, these findings reveal a potential interoceptive effect of nicotine mediated by sensitization of the TRNs-AVA mechanosensory pathway, providing new insight into the neural and molecular basis of nicotine’s modulation of sensory-motor coupling.

                <p>by Marco A. Coelho, Márcia David-Palma, Seonju Marincowitz, Janneke Aylward, Nam Q. Pham, Andrey M. Yurkov, Brenda D. Wingfield, Michael J. Wingfield, Sheng Sun, Joseph Heitman</p>

Sexual reproduction in basidiomycete fungi is governed by <i>MAT</i> loci (<i>P/R</i> and <i>HD</i>), which exhibit remarkable evolutionary plasticity, characterized by expansions, rearrangements, and gene losses often associated with mating system transitions. The sister genera <i>Cryptococcus</i> and <i>Kwoniella</i> provide a powerful framework for studying <i>MAT</i> loci evolution owing to their diverse reproductive strategies and distinct architectures, spanning bipolar and tetrapolar systems with either linked or unlinked <i>MAT</i> loci. Building on recent comparative genomic analyses, we generated additional chromosome-level assemblies, uncovering distinct trajectories shaping <i>MAT</i> loci organization. Contrasting with the small-scale expansions and gene acquisitions observed in <i>Kwoniella</i>, our analyses revealed independent expansions of the <i>P/R</i> locus in tetrapolar <i>Cryptococcus</i>, possibly driven by pheromone gene duplications. Notably, these expansions coincided with a pronounced GC-content reduction best explained by reduced GC-biased gene conversion following recombination suppression, rather than relaxed codon usage selection. Diverse modes of <i>MAT</i> locus linkage were also identified, including three previously unrecognized transitions: one resulting in a pseudobipolar arrangement and two leading to bipolarity. All three transitions involved translocations. In the pseudobipolar configuration, the <i>P/R</i> and <i>HD</i> loci remained on the same chromosome but genetically unlinked, whereas the bipolar transitions additionally featured rearrangements that fused the two loci into a nonrecombining region. Mating assays confirmed a sexual cycle in <i>Cryptococcus decagattii</i>, demonstrating its ability to undergo mating and sporulation. Progeny analysis in <i>Kwoniella mangrovensis</i> revealed substantial ploidy variation and aneuploidy, likely stemming from haploid–diploid mating, yet evidence of recombination and loss of heterozygosity indicates that meiotic exchange occurs despite irregular chromosome segregation. Our findings underscore the importance of continued diversity sampling and provide further evidence for convergent evolution of fused <i>MAT</i> loci in basidiomycetes, offering new insights into the genetic and chromosomal changes driving reproductive transitions.

                <p>by Ashley M. Ingiosi</p>

Astrocytes help control sleep and arousal. A new study in PLOS Biology shows that a wake-promoting signal called histamine affects how astrocytes respond to and modulate other brain signals and reduces time spent awake through astroglial histamine-1-receptors.

Astrocytes are increasingly understood to modulate sleep and arousal. This Primer highlights a recent PLOS Biology study elucidating the mechanisms of this regulation, revealing that histamine-1-receptor signaling in astrocytes modulates intracellular calcium and extracellular adenosine dynamics to regulate arousal.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The growing demand for personalized treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS) highlights the need for more precise biomarkers that can outperform magnetic resonance imaging and clinical assessment in patient stratification. Advances in multiplex proteomic technologies suggest that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis at MS onset may not only improve diagnostic accuracy, but also offer prognostic and staging information, as well as insight into molecular therapeutic targets.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter study retrospectively analyzed cryopreserved CSF samples from 160 individuals undergoing diagnostic evaluation for possible neuroimmunological disorder, and among these, followed a cohort of 96 people with confirmed MS for at least 3 years. The goal was to externally validate previously published CSF-based diagnostic and prognostic classifiers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Upon unblinding, the CSF-based molecular diagnostic test distinguished 96 people with confirmed MS from 30 individuals with other inflammatory neurological diseases, and 34 individuals with non-inflammatory neurological diseases, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 (<i>p</i> = 4.7 × 10<sup>−21</sup>). The test also differentiated 65 individuals with relapsing–remitting MS from 31 individuals with progressive MS, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (<i>p</i> = 1.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). The prognostic classifier predicted prospectively measured Expanded Disability Status Scale scores at follow up (rho = 0.43, <i>p</i> = 2.54 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This multicenter external validation study demonstrates that CSF-based molecular tests can robustly distinguish MS from other neurological conditions, stratify MS subtypes, and predict future disability progression in real-world settings. These results lay the groundwork for development of next-generation molecular tools to personalize care in MS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1036/v1?src=rss">Taking Flight with Aviation English: How are Malaysian Teachers Preparing the Next Generation? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Aviation English, a specialised language field for areas like aircraft maintenance, involves more complex pedagogy than general English, as it addresses specific learner needs within an aviation context. Teachers in this field must understand aviation-specific content and students’ linguistic needs to design courses that meet professional communication demands while adhering to legal and safety standards emphasizing clarity. Methods This study examined Malaysian aviation English teachers’ experiences in developing tailored courses. Using semi-structured interviews with three teachers from aviation schools accredited by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM), data were transcribed and analysed in ATLAS.ti, with rigor ensured through member checking, prolonged engagement, and external audits. Results Findings revealed three key themes: teachers’ understanding of aviation English, integration of aviation content, and instructional challenges. Participants described an extensive learning process in acquiring aviation knowledge and creatively integrating it into lessons through relevant activities and real-life applications. Challenges included varied student abilities, limited resources, and inadequate institutional support. Conclusions The study explored how English teachers acquire and apply aviation knowledge and teaching skills, highlighting areas that could benefit from improved training and credentialing. Limitations include a small sample size and brief data collection period (March to August 2024), restricting generalisability, while the thematic analysis method may limit deeper exploration of nuanced experiences. Nonetheless, the study offers insights to enhance aviation English instruction for aviation students’ linguistic and professional needs.

                Background and Objectives Controlling blood pressure is a central objective in the management of hypertension. However, it is often inadequate due to environmental and/or patient-related factors. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure and to identify the associated risk factors in hypertensive patients followed up in health centers in Settat city. Materials and Methods A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2023 to February 2024 in 21 primary care facilities (12 urban and 9 rural) in Settat, including 1004 hypertensive patients. Data were collected using a validated questionnaire covering medical, therapeutic and knowledge aspects of hypertension. Compliance medication was assessed by the Girerd test, and physical activity by the Global Physical Activity questionnaire recommended by the World Health Organization. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were taken in accordance with international standards. Results Uncontrolled blood pressure affected 57.9% (n=581) of patients. Multivariable analysis revealed a significant association with rural environment (OR = 3.13; 95% CI [2.06-4.74]), advanced age (OR = 1.39; CI95% [1.09-1.63]), low monthly income (OR = 1.37; CI95% [1.21-1.56]), high-salt diet (OR = 1.39; CI95% [1.15-1.69]) and poor compliance with medication (OR = 7.24; CI95% [5.09-10.31]). Conclusion Unsatisfactory blood pressure control in Moroccan hypertensive patients has highlighted the need to take into account the sociodemographic dimension in the management of hypertension, and the role of health centers in supplying patients with antihypertensive drugs and therapeutic and behavioral education to optimize blood pressure control.

                Background While systematic barriers preventing nurses from advancing into research capability and leadership positions have been well-documented, the compounded challenges faced by Global Majority nurses remain underexplored. Purpose This commentary expands upon Vamadevan et al.’s (2025) systematic narrative review to examine intersectional barriers preventing Global Majority nurses from developing research capability and achieving leadership positions within UK healthcare systems. Methods Drawing on recent empirical evidence and workforce statistics, this analysis examines how structural discrimination, cultural isolation, and systemic inequities create additional barriers for Global Majority nurses beyond those identified in existing nursing career development research. Key Arguments Global Majority nurses face intersecting challenges that compound existing structural barriers to research capability development, including systematic discrimination in recruitment and career progression, cultural isolation due to lack of diverse representation in leadership positions, and exclusion from informal networks facilitating professional advancement. Current diversity initiatives operate within systems maintaining structural barriers and adopt deficit models placing change burden on individuals rather than addressing institutional practices. Implications Comprehensive systemic reforms are required including transparent recruitment and promotion processes, targeted mentorship programmes addressing cultural and professional challenges, organisational culture change initiatives addressing systemic racism, and equitable research funding access. Conclusion Excluding Global Majority perspectives from research capability development represents both moral imperative and practical necessity for UK healthcare systems. Transformative action is essential to create inclusive and equitable pathways for all nursing professionals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1033/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Upper Eyelid Blepharoplasty Following Repeated Botulinum Toxin Injections: A Case Report [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatochalasis of the upper eyelids is a frequent age-related condition that may impair vision and pose a major aesthetic concern. Although both surgical and nonsurgical treatments are available, improper or repeated administration of nonsurgical approaches, such as botulinum toxin (BT) injections, can lead to functional issues, including eyelid heaviness, ocular fatigue, and patient dissatisfaction. We report the case of a 45-year-old Syrian man with bilateral upper eyelid dermatochalasis who had received multiple periocular BT injections over two years. Despite initial improvement, he developed recurrent skin redundancy, ocular heaviness, fatigue, headaches, and aesthetic dissatisfaction. Clinical examination revealed bilateral eyelid skin redundancy and superior visual field restriction with preserved levator function. Bilateral upper eyelid blepharoplasty was performed, involving careful excision of redundant skin, removal of excessive preaponeurotic fat likely accentuated by prior BT treatment and partial excision of the orbicularis oculi muscle, while preserving the levator apparatus and orbital septum integrity. The procedure was completed without complications. Postoperatively, the patient experienced complete resolution of eyelid heaviness and subjective improvement in the visual field, as well as a more defined eyelid contour and improved symmetry. Patient satisfaction, measured using the Blepharoplasty Outcomes Evaluation (BOE) questionnaire, increased from 25% preoperatively to 96.8% at three and six months postoperatively. This case demonstrates that upper eyelid blepharoplasty remains the gold standard for managing dermatochalasis, particularly when nonsurgical interventions have failed or produced functional complications. The procedure can successfully restore eyelid function, improve visual performance, and achieve high aesthetic satisfaction, highlighting the importance of proper patient selection and timely surgical intervention in the management of upper eyelid aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1032/v1?src=rss">Between Protection and Destruction: The Legal Tension Between Military Necessity and Cultural Heritage Protection in International Humanitarian Law [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The relationship between military necessity and the protection of cultural heritage under international humanitarian law has been and continues to be governed by a constant tension that has shaped both doctrine and practice. While the principle of military necessity, rooted in and derived from the 1863 Lieber Code and codified in later instruments such as the 1907 Hague Conventions, remains one of the most fundamental principles permitting the adoption of measures necessary to achieve legitimate military objectives, it has also been used to justify the destruction of cultural property. Conversely, cultural heritage, deserving special protection under instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention and its Protocols, represents the collective memory and identity of societies. Methods To evaluate the role of military necessity in the prosecution of crimes against cultural heritage, this paper uses a critical doctrinal and analytical approach, looking at both treaty law and international jurisprudence. It asks whether military necessity is a valid practical safeguard or a legal pretext for destruction. Results The paper contends that the incorporation of “imperative military necessity” has engendered critical legal loopholes resulting from warring parties’ exploitation of the prioritization of military interests over the preservation of cultural heritage, rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflicts. International tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), have endeavoured to restrict these justifications by criminalizing deliberate attacks and applying standards of necessity and proportionality. Conclusions The paper concludes that, despite treaties and jurisprudence limiting the scope of military necessity, the ongoing recognition of the necessity exception reveals structural weaknesses in international humanitarian law, thereby rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflict. Accordingly, it advocates for the strict limitation of the ‘imperative military necessity’ exception to provide better protection for cultural heritage during armed conflict.
