              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06969">Association of Timing and Duration of Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity with Cognitive Function and Brain Aging: A Population-Based Study Using the UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle factor with potential to support cognitive resilience. However, the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intensity, and timing, with cognitive function and region-specific brain structure remain poorly understood. We analyzed data from 45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60 years and older with valid wrist-worn accelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural brain MRI. MVPA was measured both continuously (mins per week) and categorically (thresholded using >=150 min/week based on WHO guidelines). Associations with cognitive performance and regional brain volumes were evaluated using multivariable linear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related covariates. We conducted secondary analyses on MVPA timing and subgroup effects. Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across cognitive domains, including reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed. These associations persisted in fully adjusted models and were higher among participants meeting WHO guidelines. Greater MVPA was also associated with subcortical brain regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus), as well as regional gray matter volumes involved in emotion, working memory, and perceptual processing. Secondary analyses showed that MVPA at any time of day was associated with cognitive functions and brain volume particularly in the midday-afternoon and evening. Sensitivity analysis shows consistent findings across subgroups, with evidence of dose-response relationships. Higher MVPA is associated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in later life. Public health strategies to increase MVPA may support healthy cognitive aging and generate substantial economic benefits, with global gains projected to reach USD 760 billion annually by 2050.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06970">Impact of Neuron Models on Spiking Neural Networks performance. A Complexity Based Classification Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how the selection of neuron models and learning rules impacts the classification performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with a focus on applications in bio-signal processing. We compare biologically inspired neuron models, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), metaneurons, and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neurons, across multiple learning rules, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), tempotron, and reward-modulated updates. A novel element of this work is the integration of a complexity-based decision mechanism into the evaluation pipeline. Using Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), a measure related to entropy rate, we quantify the structural regularity of spike trains and assess classification outcomes in a consistent and interpretable manner across different SNN configurations. To investigate neural dynamics and assess algorithm performance, we employed synthetic datasets with varying temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels. These included Markov and Poisson processes, well-established models to simulate neuronal spike trains and capture the stochastic firing behavior of biological neurons.Validation of synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data reveals clear performance trends: classification accuracy depends on the interaction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule, with the LZC-based evaluation highlighting configurations that remain robust to weak or noisy signals. This work delivers a systematic analysis of how neuron model selection interacts with network parameters and learning strategies, supported by a novel complexity-based evaluation approach that offers a consistent benchmark for SNN performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07001">Artificial Intelligence as an Opportunity for the Science of Consciousness: A Dual-Resolution Framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The encounter of artificial intelligence with consciousness research is often framed as a challenge: could this science determine whether such systems are conscious? We suggest it is equally an opportunity to expand and test the scope of existing theories of consciousness. Current approaches remain polarized. Computational functionalism emphasizes abstract organization, often realized through neural correlates of consciousness, while biological naturalism insists that consciousness is tied to living embodiment. Both positions risk anthropocentrism and limit the possibility of recognizing non-biological forms of subjectivity. To move beyond this impasse, we propose a dual-resolution framework that defines the ontological and epistemic conditions for consciousness. This approach combines the Information Theory of Individuality, which defines the ontological conditions of informational autonomy and self-maintenance, with the Moment-to-Moment theory, which specifies the epistemic conditions of temporal updating and phenomenological unfolding. This integration reframes consciousness as the epistemic expression of individuated systems in substrate-independent informational terms, offering a generalizable theory of consciousness and positioning AI as a promising testbed for its emergence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07009">Computational Concept of the Psyche</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs, taking into account their biological or existential significance for an intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of the model is also provided.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07237">Normative Modelling in Neuroimaging: A Practical Guide for Researchers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.07237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normative modelling is an increasingly common statistical technique in neuroimaging that estimates population-level benchmarks in brain structure. It enables the quantification of individual deviations from expected distributions whilst accounting for biological and technical covariates without requiring large, matched control groups. This makes it a powerful alternative to traditional case-control studies for identifying brain structural alterations associated with pathology. Despite the availability of numerous modelling approaches and several toolboxes with pretrained models, the distinct strengths and limitations of normative modelling make it difficult to determine how and when to implement them appropriately. This review offers practical guidance and outlines statistical considerations for clinical researchers using normative modelling in neuroimaging. We compare several open-source normative modelling tools through a worked example using clinical epilepsy data; outlining decision points, common pitfalls, and considerations for responsible implementation, to support broader and more rigorous adoption of normative modelling in neuroimaging research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07751">ExSEnt: Extrema-Segmented Entropy Analysis of Time Series</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Extrema-Segmented Entropy (ExSEnt), a feature-decomposed framework for quantifying time-series complexity that separates temporal from amplitude contributions. The method partitions a signal into monotonic segments by detecting sign changes in the first-order increments. For each segment, it extracts the interval duration and the net amplitude change, generating two sequences that reflect timing and magnitude variability, respectively. Complexity is then quantified by computing sample entropy on durations and amplitudes, together with their joint entropy. This decomposition reveals whether overall irregularity is driven by timing, amplitude, or their coupling, providing a richer and more interpretable characterization than unidimensional metrics. We validate ExSEnt on canonical nonlinear dynamical systems (Logistic map, Rossler system, Rulkov map), demonstrating its ability to track complexity changes across control parameter sweeps and detect transitions between periodic and chaotic regimes. Then, we illustrate the empirical utility of ExSEnt metrics to isolate feature-specific sources of complexity in real data (electromyography and ankle acceleration in Parkinsons disease). ExSEnt thus complements existing entropy measures by attributing complexity to distinct signal features, improving interpretability and supporting applications in a broad range of domains, including physiology, finance, and geoscience.

                arXiv:2409.08303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motor dysfunction is a common sign of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but may be difficult to detect, especially in the early stages. In this work, we examine the behavior of a wide array of explainable metrics extracted from the handwriting signals of 113 subjects performing multiple tasks on a digital tablet, as part of the Neurological Signals dataset. The aim is to measure their effectiveness in characterizing NDs, including AD and PD. To this end, task-agnostic and task-specific metrics are extracted from 14 distinct tasks. Subsequently, through statistical analysis and a series of classification experiments, we investigate which metrics provide greater discriminative power between NDs and healthy controls and amongst different NDs. Preliminary results indicate that the tasks at hand can all be effectively leveraged to distinguish between the considered set of NDs, specifically by measuring the stability, the speed of writing, the time spent not writing, and the pressure variations between groups from our handcrafted explainable metrics, which shows p-values lower than 0.0001 for multiple tasks. Using various binary classification algorithms on the computed metrics, we obtain up to 87 % accuracy for the discrimination between AD and healthy controls (CTL), and up to 69 % for the discrimination between PD and CTL.

                arXiv:2509.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented that creates a teaching schedule for a university physics department by algorithmically assigning ${\sim}200$ classes to ${\sim}50$ professors for each of three academic terms per year. The algorithm is driven by chromosomes of the GA that encode proposed pairings between enumerated lists of professors and classes. The fitness of the pairings is measured by considering both contractual work constraints and individual teaching preferences. The algorithm uses standard crossover and mutation operations to seek ever more optimal schedules over many generations. Here we detail the implementation and performance of the algorithm, including some interpretability findings. Overall, we are very pleased with the algorithm, as it is typically able to converge within minutes, with over $90\%$ of needed classes assigned. A metric is used to assign each professor's schedule a score, which measures how well their preferences were satisfied. These scores can be used to ensure longitudinal equity in the assignment of classes among professors.

                arXiv:2509.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Variable Interaction Graph Particle Swarm Optimization (VIGPSO), an adaptation to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that dynamically learns and exploits variable interactions during the optimization process. PSO is widely used for real-valued optimization problems but faces challenges in high-dimensional search spaces. While Variable Interaction Graphs (VIGs) have proven effective for optimization algorithms operating with known problem structure, their application to black-box optimization remains limited. VIGPSO learns how variables influence each other by analyzing how particles move through the search space, and uses these learned relationships to guide future particle movements. VIGPSO was evaluated against standard PSO on eight benchmark functions (three separable, two partially separable, and three non-separable) across 10, 30, 50 and 1000 dimensions. VIGPSO achieved statistically significant improvements ($p<0.05$) over the standard PSO algorithm in 28 out of 32 test configurations, with particularly strong performance extending to the 1000-dimensional case. The algorithm showed increasing effectiveness with dimensionality, though at the cost of higher variance in some test cases. These results suggest that dynamic VIG learning can bridge the gap between black-box and gray-box optimization effectively in PSO, particularly for high-dimensional problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07211">A multi-strategy improved gazelle optimization algorithm for solving numerical optimization and engineering applications</a></h4>

Abstract: Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%, respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07236">Breaking the Conventional Forward-Backward Tie in Neural Networks: Activation Functions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based neural network training traditionally enforces symmetry between forward and backward propagation, requiring activation functions to be differentiable (or sub-differentiable) and strictly monotonic in certain regions to prevent flat gradient areas. This symmetry, linking forward activations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the selection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with substantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge this assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise gradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant, provided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted on foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) - confirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional gradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and may even enhance training stability and efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate that neural networks with flat or non-differentiable activation functions, such as the Heaviside step function, can be effectively trained, thereby expanding design flexibility and computational efficiency. Further empirical validation with more complex architectures remains a valuable direction for future research.

                arXiv:2509.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer a promising path toward energy-efficient, brain-like associative memory. This paper introduces Word2Spike, a novel rate coding mechanism that combines continuous word embeddings and neuromorphic architectures. We develop a one-to-one mapping that converts multi-dimensional word vectors into spike-based attractor states using Poisson processes. Using BitNet b1.58 quantization, we maintain 97% semantic similarity of continuous embeddings on SimLex-999 while achieving 100% reconstruction accuracy on 10,000 words from OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large. We preserve analogy performance (100% of original embedding performance) even under intentionally introduced noise, indicating a resilient mechanism for semantic encoding in neuromorphic systems. Next steps include integrating the mapping with spiking transformers and liquid state machines (resembling Hopfield Networks) for further evaluation.

">Legal but immoral: attitudes toward non-invasive brain stimulation for cognitive enhancement</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive enhancement involves using substances or technologies to improve mental performance in healthy individuals. While methods such as caffeine are widely accepted, others, including prescription stimulants and non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS), evoke ethical concern. This study examined how university students evaluate three forms of cognitive enhancement (natural, pharmacological, brain stimulation) across five moral domains: academic fairness, free will, naturalness, self-identity, and safety. We also tested how evaluations were shaped by framing (preservation vs. enhancement) and priming (self-affecting vs. non-self-affecting). A total of 449 students completed an online experiment with a 2 by 2 by 3 mixed design, rating enhancement acceptability after reading intervention-specific scenarios. Natural enhancers were judged most positively, followed by brain stimulation and then pharmacological agents. Importantly, although brain stimulation is legal and marketed as non-invasive, it was evaluated more like pharmacological enhancement than natural methods, indicating that legality does not equate to moral acceptability. Framing effects showed that participants were more accepting of enhancement when it was described as preserving ability rather than augmenting it beyond baseline. Priming participants to consider how others use might affect their own outcomes reduced moral acceptability, particularly for pharmacological and brain stimulation methods in the domain of academic fairness. Overall, public attitudes toward enhancement appeared shaped less by legality or objective safety than by intuitive moral reasoning. These findings highlight the importance of adopting pluralistic, context-sensitive approaches to policy and regulation, as student judgments reflect concerns about fairness, authenticity, and competition in academic life.

">Adaptive Eye Movement Behavior for Actions in Younger and Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Humans typically combine eye and head movements to visually track and interact with moving objects. If the object's trajectory can be predicted, humans can shift gaze to the anticipated object's future location. For instance, when hitting a moving ball, people predictively look at the ball's bouncing location, allowing them to overcome sensorimotor delays that would otherwise limit visual information uptake from that position. Such delays become pronounced with healthy aging, which might drive a behavioral shift towards stronger reliance on predictive gaze allocation to future positions of interest during visuomotor tasks. To investigate this, we examined gaze and hand movements of older and younger adults who played an iPad-based version of the game 'Pong' against an automated opponent. Participants moved a paddle of two different sizes with their finger to intercept a ball moving in two speeds and bouncing off the side walls. We hypothesized that aging would lead to earlier gaze shifts to positions of interest, such as to the final wall bounce location before the ball moved toward the participants' paddle, and to their own paddle around the moment of interception. As expected, both age groups intercepted fewer balls when using smaller paddles. Contrary to our hypothesis, older participants looked later than younger adults to the final wall bounce. However, they shifted their gaze earlier to their own paddle before interception, especially at the beginning of the experiment. This suggests that aging enhances predictive gaze shifts related to the immediate action. While gaze allocation patterns largely overlap between older and younger adults, aging specifically leads to adaptive eye movements just before interacting with the environment.

">Disruption of the developmental factor Otp in the adult forebrain reveals its diverse physiological functions</a></h4>

              
                Orthopedia (Otp) transcription factor is a critical determinant in the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus, and its embryonic deletion results in lethality. Although Otp expression is maintained throughout life, its physiological function in adulthood is not well understood. Here, we generated a forebrain-specific, tamoxifen-inducible, conditional knockout mouse model to investigate the roles of Otp beyond development. Conditional deletion of Otp in two-month-old mice resulted in impaired stress responses, characterized by increased depressive-like behavior and elevated stress-induced cortisol levels. It also led to various metabolic changes, including reduced thyroid hormone levels and body temperature, a higher percentage of fat mass, and diminished responsiveness to ghrelin without affecting food intake, energy expenditure, or body weight. This composite metabolic phenotype was associated with reduced hypothalamic neuropeptides TRH, CRH, AgRP, and NPY expression. Our findings highlight the role of Otp in adult physiological functions as a key neuroendocrine integrator of adaptive stress response and energy balance.

">Nociceptors use multiple neurotransmitters to drive pain</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptors are excitatory neurons that express a range of neuropeptides and have the essential role of detecting noxious mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli. Ablating these neurons profoundly reduces responses to pain. Here we investigated how nociceptive information is transmitted by developing genetic approaches to suppress glutamate transmission and neuropeptide signaling, individually and in combination. Remarkably, many pain responses persisted in mice where either nociceptor glutamate or neuropeptide signaling was blocked. By contrast, mice lacking both glutamate and neuropeptide transmission in nociceptors displayed profound pain insensitivity closely matching the effects of cell ablation. Together our results establish a role for neuropeptides as bone fide pain transmitters and demonstrate redundancy in nociceptor signaling, resolving long-standing questions about how pain is communicated to the brain.

Research into the mechanisms underlying neuromodulation by tES using in-vivo animal models is key to overcoming experimental limitations in humans and essential to building a detailed understanding of the in-vivo consequences of tES. Insights from such animal models are needed to develop targeted and effective therapeutic applications of non-invasive brain stimulation in humans. The sheer difference in scale and geometry between animal models and the human brain contributes to the complexity of designing and interpreting animal studies. Here, we introduce EFMouse, a toolbox that extends previous approaches to model intracranial electric fields and generate predictions that can be tested with in-vivo recordings in mice. Novel functionality includes the ability to capture typical surgical approaches in the mouse (e.g., cranial recording windows), the placement of stimulation electrodes anywhere in or on the animal, and novel ways to report field predictions, including some refined measures of focality and direction homogeneity, and quantification based on regions defined in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. Although the EFMouse toolbox is generally applicable to planning and designing tES studies in mice, we illustrate its use by posing questions about transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments with the goal of targeting the left visual cortex of the mouse. The EFMouse toolbox is publicly available at https://github.com/klabhub/EFMouse.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013432">Shrinking to bird size with dinosaur-level cancer defences: Evolution of cancer suppression over macroevolutionary time</a></h4>

              
                <p>by E. Yagmur Erten, Marc Tollis, Hanna Kokko</p>

Ubiquity of cancer across the tree of life yields opportunities to understand variation in cancer defences across species. Peto’s paradox, the finding that large-bodied species do not suffer from more cancer despite having more cells at risk of oncogenic mutations compared to small species, can be explained if large size selects for better cancer defences. Since birds live longer than non-flying mammals of equivalent size, and are descendants of moderate-sized dinosaurs, we ask whether ancestral cancer defences are retained if body size shrinks in a lineage. Our model derives selection coefficients and fixation events for changes in cancer defences over macroevolutionary time, based on known relationships between body size, cancer risk, extrinsic mortality, metabolic rate, and effective population size. We show that, if mutation rate is sufficiently high and cancer defences are costly, we expect birds to have lower cancer defences than their dinosaurian ancestors. However, if the evolution of cancer suppression is mutation limited, due to e.g. pleiotropy, birds may have kept excessive dinosaurian cancer defences, possibly explaining their low cancer risk. Counterintuitively, birds can then be ‘too robust’ for their own good, if excessive cancer suppression requires compromising reproductive rates. Yet, evolutionary innovations such as flight can increase longevity and keep selection for cancer suppression intact in birds, even if flight requires small body size. Retaining dinosaur-level cancer defences can then be adaptive, particularly if the evolution of flight is accompanied by an increase in cancer risk due to metabolic scaling. Overall, our study suggests that studying cancer suppression in birds can reveal alternative mechanisms to those found in mammals, possibly inherited from birds’ dinosaurian ancestors.

Smith</p>

Tuberculosis (TB) outcomes vary widely, from asymptomatic infection to mortality, yet most animal models do not recapitulate human phenotypic and genotypic variation. The genetically diverse Collaborative Cross mouse panel models distinct facets of TB disease that occur in humans and allows identification of genomic loci underlying clinical outcomes. We previously mapped a TB susceptibility locus on mouse chromosome 2. Here, we identify cathepsin Z (<i>Ctsz</i>) as a lead candidate underlying this TB susceptibility and show that <i>Ctsz</i> ablation leads to increased bacterial burden, pulmonary inflammation and decreased survival in mice. <i>Ctsz</i> disturbance within murine macrophages enhances production of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), a known biomarker of TB severity. From a Ugandan household contact study, we identify significant associations between <i>CTSZ</i> variants and TB disease severity. Finally, we examine patient-derived TB granulomas and report CTSZ localization within granuloma-associated macrophages, placing human CTSZ at the host–pathogen interface. These findings implicate a conserved CTSZ-CXCL1 axis in humans and genetically diverse mice that mediates TB disease severity.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003350">Coupling between spatial compartments integrates morphogenetic patterning in the organ of Corti</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anubhav Prakash, Sukanya Raman, Raman Kaushik, Pallavi Manchanda, Anton S. Iyer, Raj K. Ladher</p>

Morphogenetic information arises from a combination of genetically encoded cellular properties and emergent cellular behaviors. The spatio-temporal implementation of this information is critical to ensure robust, reproducible tissue shapes, yet the principles underlying its organization remain unknown. We investigated this principle using the mouse auditory epithelium, the organ of Corti (OC). OC consists of a sensory domain, which transduces sound through polar mechanosensory hair cells (HC), part of a mosaic with supporting cells (SC). On either side of the sensory domain are non-sensory domains. These domains undergo cellular rearrangements, which, together, lead to a spiral cochlea that contains planar polarized HCs. This makes the mammalian cochlea a compelling system to understand coordination across spatial scales. Using genetic and ex vivo approaches, we found patterning of OC into sensory and non-sensory domains is associated with a combinatorial expression of adhesion molecules, which underpins OC into spatially defined compartments, enabling planar cell polarity (PCP) cues to regulate compartment-specific organization. Through compartment-specific knockouts of the PCP protein, Vangl2, we find evidence of compartment coupling, a non-linear influence on the organization within one compartment when cellular organization is disrupted in another. In the OC, compartment coupling originates from vinculin-dependent junctional mechanics, coordinating cellular dynamics across spatial scales.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01028-9?rss=yes">The E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1 targets a bacterial pore-forming toxin to facilitate xenophagy</a></h4>

              
                Wu et al. reveal that the host E3 ligase SIAH1 recognizes and ubiquitinates streptolysin O (SLO), a pore-forming toxin from group A Streptococcus. This ubiquitination targets the bacteria for xenophagy through LAP-like and canonical autophagy, highlighting a host defense strategy in which bacterial virulence factors are targeted by autophagy.

                Many bacteria use type VI secretion systems to inject toxic proteins into competitor and/or host cells, several of which form pores in cell membranes. Here, Colautti et al. determine the cryo-EM structure of one such toxin, which sheds light on the molecular determinants of its activity.

                The study by Ingersoll et al. identifies the essential E3 ligase TRIP12 as a crucial component of the oxidative stress response. TRIP12 acts as a ubiquitin chain elongation factor that ensures robust NRF2 degradation and stress response silencing when redox homeostasis has been restored.

                Yamasaki et al. find prolonged expression of Cdkn1a in microglia in Cx3cr1CreERT2(Litt) mice, but not in Cx3cr1CreERT2(Jung) mice, after tamoxifen treatment. Elevated CDKN1A expression causes aberrant cellular responses and reduced proliferation of microglia in Cx3cr1CreERT2 mice in a mouse line-specific manner, suggesting that caution must be exercised when using this model.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106239">Genetic parallels in biomineralization of the calcareous sponge Sycon ciliatum and stony corals</a></h4>

              
                The rapid emergence of mineralized structures in diverse animal groups during the late Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods likely resulted from modifications of pre-adapted biomineralization genes inherited from a common ancestor. As the oldest extant phylum with mineralized structures, sponges are key to understanding animal biomineralization. Yet, the biomineralization process in sponges, particularly in forming spicules, is not well understood. To address this, we conducted transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic analyses on the calcareous sponge <i>Sycon ciliatum</i>, supplemented by <i>in situ</i> hybridization. We identified 829 genes overexpressed in regions of increased calcite spicule formation, including 17 calcarins—proteins analogous to corals’ galaxins localized in the spicule matrix and expressed in sclerocytes. Their expression varied temporally and spatially, specific to certain spicule types, indicating that fine-tuned gene regulation is crucial for biomineralization control. Similar subtle expression changes are also relevant in stony coral biomineralization. Tandem gene arrangements and expression changes suggest that gene duplication and neofunctionalization have significantly shaped <i>S. ciliatum</i>’s biomineralization, similar to that in corals. These findings suggest a parallel evolution of carbonate biomineralization in the calcitic <i>S. ciliatum</i> and aragonitic corals, exemplifying the evolution of mechanisms crucial for animals to act as ecosystem engineers and form reef structures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100217">Endothelin B receptor inhibition rescues aging-dependent neuronal regenerative decline</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral sensory neurons regenerate their axons after injury to regain function, but this ability declines with age. The mechanisms behind this decline are not fully understood. While excessive production of endothelin 1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, is linked to many diseases that increase with age, the role of ET-1 and its receptors in axon regeneration is unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that satellite glial cells (SGCs), which completely envelop the sensory neuron soma residing in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), express the endothelin B receptor (ETBR), while ET-1 is expressed by endothelial cells. Inhibition of ETBR ex vivo in DRG explant cultures improves axon growth in both adult and aged conditions. In vivo, treatment with the FDA-approved compound, Bosentan, improves axon regeneration and reverses the age-dependent decrease in axonal regenerative capacity. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing and electron microscopy analyses reveal a decreased abundance of SGCs in aged mice compared to adult mice. Additionally, the decreased expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) in SGCs in aged mice after nerve injury is partially rescued by Bosentan treatment. These results reveal that inhibiting ETBR function enhances axon regeneration and rescues the age-dependent decrease in axonal regenerative capacity, providing a potential avenue for future therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108061">The lipocone superfamily, a unifying theme in metabolism of lipids, peptidoglycan and exopolysaccharides, inter-organismal conflicts and immunity</a></h4>

              
                Wnt proteins are critical signaling molecules in developmental processes across animals. Despite intense study, their evolutionary roots have remained enigmatic. Using sensitive sequence analysis and structure modeling, we establish that the Wnts are part of a vast assemblage of domains, the Lipocone superfamily, defined here for the first time. It includes previously studied enzymatic domains like the phosphatidylserine synthases (PTDSS1/2) and the TelC toxin domain from <i>Streptococcus intermedius</i>, the enigmatic VanZ proteins, the animal Serum Amyloid A (SAA), and a further host of uncharacterized proteins in a total of 30 families. Although the metazoan Wnts are catalytically inactive, we present evidence for a conserved active site across this superfamily, versions of which are consistently predicted to operate on head groups of either phospholipids or polyisoprenoid lipids, catalyzing transesterification and phosphate-containing head group cleavage reactions. We argue that this superfamily originated as membrane proteins, with one branch (including Wnt and SAA) evolving into diffusible versions. By comprehensively analyzing contextual information networks derived from comparative genomics, we establish that they act in varied functional contexts, including regulation of membrane lipid composition, extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis, and biogenesis of bacterial outer-membrane components, like lipopolysaccharides. On multiple occasions, members of this superfamily, including the bacterial progenitors of Wnt and SAA, have been recruited as effectors in biological conflicts spanning inter-organismal interactions and anti-viral immunity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These findings establish a unifying theme in lipid biochemistry, explain the origins of Wnt signaling, and provide new leads regarding immunity across the tree of life.

                Humans order numerosity along a left-to-right mental number line (MNL), traditionally considered culturally rooted. Yet, some species at birth show spatial-numerical associations (SNA), suggesting neural origins. Various accounts link SNA to brain lateralization but lack evidence. We investigated brain lateralization effects on numerical spatialization in 100 newborn domestic chicks. In ovo light exposure yielded strongly lateralized brains in half the chicks and weakly lateralized in the other half. Chicks learned to select the 4th item in a sagittal array. At the test, the array was rotated 90°, with left and right 4th items correct. Strongly lateralized chicks outperformed weakly lateralized ones when ordinal and spatial cues were reliable (experiment 1), but not with unreliable spatial cues (experiment 2). Moreover, only strongly lateralized chicks showed left-to-right directionality, suggesting the right hemisphere’s key role in integrating spatial and numerical cues. We demonstrate that brain lateralization is fundamental for developing a left-to-right oriented SNA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99999">Glia-mediated gut–brain cytokine signaling couples sleep to intestinal inflammatory responses induced by oxidative stress</a></h4>

              
                Sickness-induced sleep is a behavior conserved across species that promotes recovery from illness, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that interleukin-6-like cytokine signaling from the <i>Drosophila</i> gut to brain glial cells regulates sleep. Under healthy conditions, this pathway promotes wakefulness. However, elevated gut cytokine signaling in response to oxidative stress – triggered by immune and inflammatory responses in the intestine – induces sleep. The cytokines Unpaired 2 and –3 are upregulated by oxidative stress in enteroendocrine cells and activate JAK–STAT signaling in glial cells, including those of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). This activity maintains elevated sleep during oxidative-stress-induced intestinal disturbances, suggesting that the JAK–STAT pathway in glia inhibits wake-promoting signaling to facilitate sleep-dependent restoration under these conditions. We find that the enteric peptide Allatostatin A (AstA) enhances wakefulness, and during intestinal oxidative stress, gut-derived Unpaired 2/3 inhibits AstA receptor expression in BBB glia, thereby sustaining an elevated sleep state during gut inflammation or illness. Taken together, our work identifies a gut-to-glial communication pathway that couples sleep with intestinal homeostasis and disease, enhancing sleep during intestinal sickness, and contributing to our understanding of how sleep disturbances arise from gastrointestinal disturbances.

                Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is a crucial target for protective antibodies, yet the development of recombinant NA protein as a vaccine has been held back by instability and variable expression. We have taken a pragmatic approach to improving expression and stability of NA by grafting antigenic surface loops from low-expressing NA proteins onto the scaffold of high-expressing counterparts. The resulting hybrid proteins retained the antigenic properties of the loop donor while benefiting from the high-yield expression, stability, and tetrameric structure of the loop recipient. These hybrid proteins were recognised by a broad set of human monoclonal antibodies elicited by influenza infection or vaccination, with X-ray structures validating the accurate structural conformation of the grafted loops and the enzymatic cavity. Immunisation of mice with NA hybrids induced inhibitory antibodies to the loop donor and protected against lethal influenza challenge. This pragmatic technique offers a robust solution for improving the expression and stability of influenza NA proteins for vaccine development.

                Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) accumulation, tau pathology, and chronic neuroinflammation, yet current therapeutic strategies provide only limited efficacy. Natural compounds with pleiotropic actions have emerged as potential adjunctive interventions. This study evaluated G1899, a standardized American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) extract, for its effects on neuroinflammation, A{beta} clearance, and cognitive function. Methods: Neuronal cultures were exposed to glutamate or A{beta} oligomers (A{beta}o) and pre-treated with G1899 to assess cell viability and excitotoxicity. Primary murine microglia were analyzed for validating expression levels of TMEM119, CD68, NLRP3 inflammasome, IL-1{beta}, Caspase-1, and STAT3 phosphorylation. Behavioral testing was performed in scopolamine-injected mice with short term G1899 treatment and in 5xFAD transgenic mice following long-term G1899 administration at multiple doses. Amyloid burden, microglial recruitment, and plaque morphology were quantified by immunohistochemistry and high-resolution imaging. Human induced microglia (iMG) were examined for neuroinflammatory responses following A{beta}o exposure with or without G1899 treatment. Results: G1899 significantly improved neuronal viability and reduced glutamate- and A{beta}o-induced toxicity. In microglia, G1899 upregulated TMEM119 and CD68, while suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome formation, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and STAT3 phosphorylation. G1899 rescued scopolamine-induced memory deficits and, in 5xFAD mice, reduced hippocampal and cortical A{beta} burden, alleviated neuroinflammatory markers, and improved both spatial/fear learning and memory, with the most consistent efficacy observed at 300 mg/kg. Imaging revealed enhanced microglial recruitment to plaques and facilitated fragmentation of A{beta} deposits. In iMG, G1899 elevated homeostatic and phagocytic markers while attenuating A{beta}o-induced NLRP3/STAT3-mediated neuroinflammatory signaling pathway. Conclusions: G1899 confers multimodal neuroprotection by preserving neuronal survival, modulating microglial activity, and facilitating A{beta} clearance. These findings highlight its potential as a safe and clinically translatable botanical intervention for AD.

">Retention and data exclusion challenges for representative longitudinal neuroimaging in the understanding of addiction</a></h4>

              
                Head motion during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) poses a major challenge for neuroimaging research, often leading to data quality concerns and participant exclusions, particularly among pediatric and clinical populations. Although necessary for ensuring reliable data, motion-related exclusions may inadvertently bias samples by disproportionately excluding certain sociodemographic groups. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to examine how head motion-related exclusions and participant retention shape sample composition over time. At baseline (ages 9-10), Black, Hispanic, and Asian youth were significantly more likely than White youth to be excluded due to excessive head motion; these disparities were not observed at the two-year follow-up (ages 11-13). In contrast, disparities in retention persisted; Black participants were less likely to return for follow-up, even after accounting for socioeconomic factors and motion. Together, these findings highlight how both motion-related exclusions and differential retention can systematically influence the representativeness of longitudinal neuroimaging samples, with important implications for the generalizability of research in addiction neuroscience.

">Ground tilt representation in the rodent cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Information about ground tilt at one's location is indispensable for integrating the body with its surrounding environment. However, how ground-tilt information, together with movement and posture information, is represented in the cerebral cortex remains unclear. To address this issue, we developed a new six-degree-of-freedom platform that can rapidly and precisely impart ground motion to head-fixed mice. Using the Diesel2p large field-of-view two-photon mesoscope, we performed calcium imaging to simultaneously capture activity dynamics across broad cortical areas from the frontal to the parietal cortex while driving the platform through various motion patterns. We found a core area for the ground-tilt information at the parietal cortex, although the tilt-direction neurons were found across the dorsal cortex. Neuronal populations preserved tilt-direction information within a common low-dimensional manifold across three distinct motion conditions, indicating a condition-invariant tilt-code. Furthermore, to investigate shared dynamics across multiple cortical areas, we introduced broadcast-subspace analysis as an extension of communication subspace analysis. This extended framework revealed that tilt information occupied the second principal shared axis, following movement information. These results reveal the core cortical area for processing tilt information, its universal format, and its sharing across the dorsal cortex, thereby providing a framework for cortical information processing that integrates movement, posture, and the environment.

">Computational Modelling of Resistance to Hormone-Mediated Remission in Childhood Absence Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modelling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of regular spiking neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.

">TDP-43 loss of function drives aberrant splicing in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                While mRNA splicing dysregulation is a well-established contributor to neurodegeneration in disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains underexplored. Here, we analyse transcriptomic data from >500 post-mortem human brain samples from individuals with and without PD to show that splicing alterations are frequently detected. Differentially spliced genes were significantly more enriched for those causally-implicated in both PD and ALS than genes that were differentially expressed. Furthermore, we observed a strong association between these splicing alterations and dysfunction of the RNA-binding protein (RBP), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Strikingly, genes and exon junctions affected by TDP-43 knockdown overlapped significantly with those dysregulated across brain regions in PD. In brains from individuals with the LRRK2 c.6055G>A (p.G2019S) mutation, the most common genetic cause of PD, we also observed significant enrichment of TDP-43-dependent splicing changes. This finding was corroborated in human pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a LRRK2 p.G2019S knock-in mouse model, where reduced nuclear TDP-43 levels evidenced the well-recognised loss-of-function mechanism contributing to splicing dysregulation. By leveraging our RNA-based analyses we predicted TDP-43-dependent novel peptide sequences and validated their existence within human LRRK2 mutation mDNs, while also demonstrating an overall loss of protein and mRNA expression in mis-spliced genes. Collectively, our findings reveal that PD is marked by extensive splicing dysregulation dependent on TDP-43, making TDP-43 a promising new therapeutic target in PD.

                Retrotransposons are emerging as novel regulators of embryonic and brain development. We recently demonstrated that the LINE-1 encoded protein ORF1p is abundantly expressed in adult mouse and human neurons, although its function remains unclear. Here, we characterize the ORF1p interactome in differentiated mouse and human neurons using mass spectrometry and identify novel partners implicated in gene regulation and neuron-specific processes. ORF1p localizes not only to neuronal nuclei, where it associates with chromatin under steady-state conditions, but also to neurites, supporting a role in neuronal physiology. To further explore its nuclear functions, we sorted human post-mortem neurons with high or low nuclear ORF1p levels and performed ORF1p knockdown in cultured human neurons, followed by chromatin accessibility assays. Both approaches revealed consistent patterns of differential chromatin accessibility dependent on ORF1p. Loss of ORF1p also led to the downregulation of long, neuron-specific genes and altered neurite morphology. Together, these findings point to a physiological role of ORF1p in post-mitotic neurons, mediated through converging interactions with proteins and chromatin.

">MiR-34a deficiency enhances nucleic acid sensing and type I IFN signaling in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                MiR-34a is implicated in aging, cell senescence, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. In order to investigate the role of miR-34a in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we produced an AD mouse model, Tg-SwDI mice, with whole body/constitutive miR-34a knockout (KO). MiR-34a KO improved long-term memory in Tg-SwDI mice, which was associated with decreases in the ratio of insoluble A{beta}42 to A{beta}40 and with increases in soluble and insoluble A{beta}40 in the cerebral cortex. Anti-Iba1 immunofluorescence revealed increases in activated microglia. Bulk RNA-sequencing of the hippocampus followed by a gene set enrichment analysis (Enrichr) identified '' cellular response to type I interferon '' and '' type I interferon signaling pathway'' as the most prominent gene sets in miR-34a KO Tg-SwDI mice compared to miR-34a wild-type Tg-SwDI mice. Many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that characterize interferon responsive microglia (IRM) were upregulated in miR-34a KO Tg-SwDI mice. MiR-34a knockdown strongly enhanced ISGs expression in TLR7 ligand-stimulated BV2 microglia. These results suggest that miR-34a inhibits the transition of microglia to the IRM state that may modulate synaptic and cognitive functions in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.

">The interaction between aging and DNA damage influences the accumulation of APP in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                DNA damage is a major driver of the aging process. The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) worsens the situation as evidenced by the finding that the neurons of the AD brain have elevated levels of DNA damage. AD is also associated with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) known for its proteolytic peptide fragment, A{beta}. In the current work we find that these three elements - age, DNA damage, and APP - are associated with each other and present evidence in the mouse brain supporting the hypothesis that DNA damage is the likely cause of the increased APP levels. Using the TUNEL reaction to track DNA damage, we show that the TUNEL staining increases significantly with age (6 months to 24 months). Next, we used immunostaining of intracellular APP to show that it too increases over this same time period. To separate correlation from causality we repeated these analyses using tissue from mice genetically deficient in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase, an enzyme associated with part of the DNA damage repair mechanism. TUNEL signal in neurons of 6-month Atm-/- animals was equivalent to that seen in 24-month wild type. Significantly, the APP signal in the Atm-/- cells increased in consort and the relationship between DNA damage and APP was found in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. These results suggest that the loss of genomic integrity associated with aging is a cellular stressor that increases the levels of APP and thus increases vulnerability to the pathogenesis of AD.

">Redox regulation of neuroinflammatory pathways contributes to damage in Alzheimers disease brain</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism(s) whereby redox stress mediates aberrant immune signaling in age-related neurological disorders remains largely unknown. Normally, the innate immune system mounts a robust response to infectious stimuli. However, unintentional activation by host-derived factors, such as aggregated proteins associated with neurodegenerative disorders or by cytoplasmic genomic or mitochondrial DNA, can elicit aberrant immune responses. One such immune response is represented by the cytosolic GMP-AMP synthase stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway. Using redox chemical biology and mass spectrometry approaches, we identified S-nitrosylation of STING cysteine 148 as a novel posttranslational redox modification underlying aberrant type 1 interferon signaling in Alzheimers disease (AD). Critically, we observed S-nitrosylated STING (SNOSTING) in postmortem human AD brains, in hiPSC-derived microglia (hiMG) exposed to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta})/-synuclein (Syn) aggregates, and in 5xFAD transgenic mice. Mechanistically, our findings reveal that STING S-nitrosylation is critical in initiating signaling cascades by promoting the formation of disulfide-bonded STING oligomers. This leads to neuroinflammation early in the course of disease in vivo in 5xFAD mice with consequent synaptic loss. Collectively, our research supports the role of SNO-STING in neuroinflammation associated with AD, and points to a novel druggable cysteine residue in STING to prevent this S nitrosylation reaction with its inherent inflammatory response.

                Axo-axonic synapses can veto, amplify, or synchronize spikes, yet their circuit-scale logic is unknown. Using the complete electron-microscopy connectome of the adult male Drosophila ventral nerve cord (MANC v1.2.1), we charted every axo-axonic input onto the 1,314 descending neurons that carry brain commands to the body. Only 1.0 % of the 861,591 possible Descending-Descending neuron pairs form such contacts, but when present, synaptic weight grows linearly with partner number regardless of transmitter identity. High-degree neurons integrate the network without forming a rich-club core. Large-scale simulations singled out an octet of ascending neurons (AN08B098) whose axo-axonic input to the Giant Fiber descending neurons (DNp01) predicted modulation of escape control. Immunostaining confirms their cholinergic identity, while optogenetic activation confirmed that this excitatory cohort increases Giant Fiber excitability, validating connectome-derived rules. Our work delivers the first map of axo-axonic wiring and constraints for models of fast motor control.

">Characterization of the Lipidome of Neurons in Mouse Brain Nuclei using Imaging Mass Spectrometry</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the molecular composition of the brain at cellular level is essential for deciphering the metabolic alterations associated with brain diseases. Furthermore, the different prevalence of some neurological diseases between males and fe-males highlight the importance of incorporating gender factor in such studies. Here, we demonstrate that using imaging mass spectrometry in negative polarity it is possible to isolate and characterize the lipidome of specific neuronal populations in the mouse brain, including the locus coeruleus (LC), mesencephalic neurons and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Neuronal identity was validated through immunofluorescence on adjacent serial sections. Comparative analysis revealed that each neuronal population presents a distinct and well-defined lipidic profile, with differences extending across all lipid classes analyzed. Regarding sex-based differences, we found discrete differences in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine-ether, phosphatidylinositol and sphingomyelin LC neurons. Lipidomic differences were more pronounced in mesencephalic neurons, whereas no significant sex-defendant differences were observed in SNc lipid composition. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at identifying lipid metabolic dysregulations in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.

">Exploring Brain State Changes Through Reaction Time in a Simultaneity Judgment Task: A Pilot Study on Multisensory Integration</a></h4>

              
                Problem statement: Multisensory Integration (MSI), the brains ability to merge information from different sensory modalities, relies on the Temporal Binding Window (TBW)-the interval during which stimuli are most likely to be perceived as simultaneous. Beyond its role in perception, MSI may also reflect changes in brain state as task difficulty evolves. In this pilot study, we aimed to explore whether behavioral metrics, particularly reaction time (RT), can capture these brain state changes during a Simultaneity Judgment (SJ) task. Understanding this relationship is critical for developing adaptive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that rely on real-time cognitive and perceptual feedback. Approach: To assess how temporal alignment influences both perception and underlying brain state, we employed a Two-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) SJ task using audiovisual stimuli. After estimating individual simultaneity thresholds, we implemented an adaptive task that gradually increased difficulty by manipulating the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) closer to the TBW. We hypothesized that as perceptual uncertainty increased, RTs would reflect evolving cognitive states, serving as an observable indicator of underlying neural activity shifts. Materials and Methods: Two participants were tested with consistent auditory (500 Hz tone) and visual (faded white circle) stimuli. The TE phase used a staircase procedure to determine personalized TBWs. In the subsequent adaptive test phase, SOAs were progressively modulated around these thresholds to induce varying levels of perceptual ambiguity. Behavioral responses were analyzed using psychometric curve fitting, confusion matrices, and detailed RT evolution across trials. Results and Discussion: Participant 1 showed clear RT modulation near the TBW, suggesting heightened cognitive load and decision uncertainty - a potential signature of brain state transitions. In contrast, Participant 2 exhibited less sensitivity, possibly due to suboptimal thresholding. These preliminary findings suggest that RT holds promise as a behavioral correlate of perceptual state; however, further refinement and standardization of the task are needed before it can be reliably scaled to larger and more controlled studies of MSI-linked brain dynamics.

                Homologous ion channels are expressed in sensory neurons across species where they shape responses to varied sensory stimuli, on a wide range of timescales. In grasshoppers, visual detection of looming stimuli which simulate an approaching predator involves the sub-cellular expression pattern of a newly characterized Shaker channel in a single identified neuron, discovered using a newly sequenced genome and single cell RNA sequencing. This channel shapes selectivity for approaching threats and was characterized with electrophysiological recordings, RNA interference, pharmacology and biophysical compartmental simulations. Our results explain how a slowly activating and inactivating potassium conductance common in neuronal dendrites contributes to visual object segmentation and implements a complex neural computation within a single neuron.

                Survival critically depends on maintaining blood glucose to provide essential energy, especially during emergencies such as the fight-or-flight response, when timely glucose control via neural integration is vital. However, pancreatic islets constitute only a small fraction of the pancreas and are dispersed throughout the organ, raising the fundamental question of how the nervous system coordinates synchronized control of multiple islets. Using whole-organ clearing and 3D imaging, we mapped pancreatic sympathetic innervation, revealing specialized anatomical integration between sympathetic nerves and islets. Transplanted islets intrinsically attracted sympathetic nerves independent of their native environment. Chronic islet injury disrupted sympathetic innervation and impaired nerve regeneration after denervation. Sympathetic denervation markedly elevated islet-derived Reg2 and Reg3{beta}; administration of these proteins accelerated sympathetic regeneration and improved islet graft function. Our findings identify an islet-sympathetic architecture actively maintained by islets, uncovering an endocrine-driven mechanism for neural regulation, highlighting Reg2 and Reg3{beta} as therapeutic candidates for diabetes management.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons. Here, we have profiled motor neuron microRNAs (miRNAs) during motor neuron degeneration in vivo to gain a better understanding of ALS pathophysiology. We demonstrate that one miRNA, miR-146a, is downregulated in diseased motor neurons despite upregulation in bulk tissue. Genetic deletion of miR-146a significantly extended survival in SOD1G93A mice with heterozygous animals demonstrating the largest benefit. A corresponding reduction in spinal cord gliosis but not motor neuron loss was observed. Finally, we observed that a proportion of miR-146a knockout animals develop spontaneous paralysis, motor neuron loss and chronic neuroinflammation with advanced age. Together these findings demonstrate that a single miRNA influences multiple aspects of motor neuron disease and highlights the complex role for neuroinflammation in ALS pathogenesis.

">Analyses of exon 4a structure reveal unique properties of Big tau</a></h4>

              
                Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that modulates the dynamic properties of microtubules and is involved in neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. Tau is expressed as multiple low molecular weight (LMW) isoforms in most neurons of the central nervous system but only as a high molecular weight isoform in neurons of the peripheral nervous system and in a few types of central neurons. Big tau is defined by the inclusion of the alternatively spliced exon 4a, which adds about 250 amino acids to the domain of tau that projects away from the microtubule. Despite low sequence conservation of exon 4a, its length remains remarkably consistent across vertebrates. Here, we analyzed the charge distribution, hydrophobicity, and aggregation propensity of the human sequences of LMW tau, Big tau and the stretch of amino acids encoded by exon 4a. The exon 4a amino acids display a pronounced net negative charge (acidic/basic ratio = 1.30), a consistently hydrophilic composition (average Kyte-Doolittle score = -0.9259) and low {beta}-sheet content of 4.78%. This contrasts with LMW tau, which is more hydrophobic (-0.8930) and contains extended aggregation-prone motifs within the microtubule-binding domain including high {beta}-sheet content of 17.33%. The inclusion of exon 4a in Big tau shifts the global hydrophobicity to intermediate values (-0.9036) and reduces predicted {beta}-sheet content to 13.14%, suggesting decreased aggregation potential. Evolutionary analyses across mammals, birds, and amphibians (human, rat, zebra finch, frog) confirms the minimal sequence identity (16-24% identity in non-mammals) and conserved exon size but show preservation of net negative charge (acidic/basic ratio 1.3-2.3), indicating convergent retention of charge-based properties. Hydrophilicity was also broadly conserved, though less invariant across species. These results demonstrate that exon 4a introduces a highly acidic, hydrophilic module that counterbalances the aggregation-prone domains of LMW tau. The conservation of size and structural properties of the exon-4a-encoded stretch of amino acids, despite sequence divergence, implies strong evolutionary pressure to maintain biophysical properties that counteract pathogenic misfolding.

">The 5-HT1A receptor agonist NLX-112 rescues motor swimming deficits in Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 mice</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder which causes progressive motor disturbances. There is no approved drug treatment but selective activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors may be a promising therapeutic strategy to attenuate ataxia symptoms. Methods: NLX-112, a highly selective 5-HT1A full agonist, was tested in the CMVMJD135 transgenic mouse model of SCA3. NLX-112 (1.25 and 5 mg/kg/day) was administered BID intraperitoneally for 14 weeks starting when the mice were 12 weeks of age, i.e., after ataxia signs had become established. The motor swimming test (MST), where mice are required to swim to a raised platform, was used to evaluate the motor behavior of SCA3 mice and their performance was compared with that of wild-type (WT) mice. Results: Both doses of NLX-112 were well tolerated by the SCA3 mice, as assessed by welfare parameters. In the MST, the latency of SCA3 mice to reach the platform was significantly longer than that of WT mice. However, when SCA3 mice were treated with either 1.25 or 5 mg/kg/day of NLX-112, they showed robust improvement of motor performance, with swimming latencies which were similar to those of WT mice. This effect of NLX-112 was maintained throughout the period of the study. Conclusions: The improved motor function of SCA3 mice when treated with NLX-112 supports its investigation as a drug candidate for the treatment of ataxia and related movement disorders.

">Elevated IL-1 beta plasma levels, altered platelet activation and cardiac remodeling lead to moderately decreased LV function in Alzheimer transgenic mice after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Neurodegeneration and dementia are key factors in Alzheimers disease (AD). The deposition of amyloid-beta into senile plaques in the brain parenchyma and in cerebral vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are the main clinical parameters of AD. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and AD share a comparable pathophysiology. In detail, AMI survivors have a higher risk of vascular dementia and AD patients with AMI face a poor prognosis with a high rate of major adverse cardiovascular events. High blood levels of amyloid-beta 40 are identified in patients with high risk for cardiovascular death. However, the underlying mechanisms and the consequences of AMI in AD patients are unclear to date. Methods: AD transgenic APP23 mice were analysed in an experimental AMI using the closed-chest model. Results: APP23 mice displayed significantly decreased left ventricular function as detected by FS/MPI (fractional shortening/myocardial performance index) after 24 h and 3 weeks after ligation of the LAD compared to WT controls. No differences have been observed in infarct and scar size. However, the analysis of cardiac remodeling after 3 weeks showed an altered composition of the collagen tissue of the scar with elevated tight but reduced fine collagen in APP23 mice. Altered scar formation was accompanied by elevated degranulation of platelets following activation of the collagen receptor GPVI. Conclusion: The here presented results suggest that AD patients are at higher risk for cardiac damage after AMI that might increase the risk for cardiovascular death. This implies the need of a personalized therapy of AMI in AD patients.

">3D MINFLUX combined with DNA-PAINT resolves the arrangement of Bassoon at active zones</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter release and membrane retrieval at active zones require precise spatial and temporal coordination relying on an intricate molecular machinery. However, the exact nano-structural organization of this machinery is not yet fully elucidated. Here, we used 3D MINFLUX combined with both spectral demixing and DNA-PAINT to analyze the positioning of the scaffolding protein Bassoon at presynaptic active zones of glutamatergic spine synapses of hippocampal neurons, achieving a localization precision of 5 nm in 3D. This approach allowed us to visualize directly the distribution of N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of Bassoon, and demonstrates that Bassoon exhibits an orientation at the active zone, where the C-terminal region is directed toward the synaptic cleft and the N-terminal region towards synaptic vesicles. Having demonstrated this spatial configuration in an exemplary fashion for endogenous and recombinant Bassoon molecules, our study paves the way towards molecular-scale resolution analysis of other prominent proteins of the presynaptic release machinery.

">Early Diagnosis of Parkinson via Transient Beta Frequencies in a Delayed Van der Pol Model</a></h4>

              
                Biological motor circuits are shaped by pathway-specific delays that generate history-dependent oscillations and short-lived transients not captured by memoryless models. We develop a delayed Van der Pol in which the delay ratio r acts as a control parameter for Hopf bifurcation and internal resonance and we pair it with an auditable, short-window signal-processing pipeline tailored to early beta activity. The pipeline combines Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) ridge tracking, kernel-density estimates (KDE) of the dominant frequency, and algorithmic beta-burst detection under fixed, shared parameters. Transient burden is quantified by a metric triplet with a software-implementable attenuation rule and complemented by an early-detection index-the Transient Persistence Time. Across methods, we observe a monotonic attenuation of short-lived beta transients as r approaches a critical band. A reliable observation window of 0-0.35 s captures compact early packets at low r, progressive ridge stabilization in CWT, KDE narrowing over time, and near-elimination of bursts for near critical r, consistent with a transition to sustained narrowband rhythm. Clinically, these measures enable stage inference, a bedside Move-Stop protocol for rapid readout, and actionable policies for adaptive DBS and medication titration that minimize transient burden without inducing rigid locking. The fixed parameterization and audit-ready outputs support reproducibility and multi-center deployment. This framework advances data-driven, precision neuromodulation by targeting early transients before pathological synchrony becomes entrenched.

">APOE4 promotes cerebrovascular fibrosis and amyloid deposition via a pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular disease is a prominent but poorly understood component of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The strongest genetic risk factor for AD, APOE4, is associated with multiple cerebrovascular pathologies, including vascular amyloid accumulation and fibrosis. APOE4 also renders the cerebrovasculature fragile to the point where the only disease-modifying AD therapeutic, anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, are warned against use in APOE4 carriers due to a high risk of hemorrhage and edema. To determine how APOE4 impacts cerebrovascular cells and pathogenesis, we generated a high-resolution single-cell transcriptomics atlas of human cerebrovasculature from APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. In APOE4 individuals, we found that the number of microvascular pericytes was significantly reduced. Notably, loss of pericytes in APOE4 carriers was accompanied by the emergence of a unique population of mural cells characterized by high expression of contraction and extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, hallmarks of myofibroblasts. Immunostaining revealed the presence of myofibroblasts surrounding the microvasculature in APOE4 human hippocampi that were absent in age-matched APOE3/3 controls, even in cases of AD. Myofibroblast presence coincided with a significant increase in fibronectin and amyloid surrounding the vasculature. Myofibroblasts were also present around the microvasculature of aged APOE4/4 but not APOE3/3 mice, suggesting myofibroblast appearance is a direct effect of the APOE4 genotype and not a technical artifact of processing human tissue. To determine the mechanisms and functional implications of APOE4-mediated myofibroblast, we leveraged a vascularized human brain tissue (miBrain) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Similar to the post-mortem human brain, APOE4/4 miBrains showed significantly reduced microvascular pericyte coverage, coinciding with the emergence of myofibroblasts co-expressing ECM and contractile genes. Lineage tracing and genetic mixing experiments confirmed that the myofibroblasts emerge from APOE4 pericytes and secrete fibronectin-rich ECM. Knocking down fibronectin in APOE4 mural cells significantly reduced vascular amyloid accumulation. To determine how myofibroblast-like cells arise in the APOE4 brain, we performed computational analysis (NicheNet) on our post-mortem human single-cell transcriptomics cerebrovascular atlas. This predicted that TGF-{beta} is the top causal driver of the pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition. Consistent with this prediction, we found that TGF-{beta} ligands in astrocytes and receptors in mural cells are significantly upregulated compared to APOE3 controls. Chemical and genetic inhibition of TGF-{beta} signaling in APOE4 miBrains significantly reduced myofibroblast presence, while concurrently increasing pericyte microvascular coverage and ultimately lowering vascular fibrosis and amyloid accumulation to APOE3 levels. Using a comprehensive three-pronged approach incorporating analysis of human post-mortem brain, APOE humanized mice, and human iPSC-derived vascularized brain tissue, we demonstrate that APOE4 in mouse and human brain tissue causes increased TGF-{beta} signaling, promoting a pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition that leads to vascular fibrosis and amyloid deposition. This provides critical insight into the mechanisms underlying APOE4 cerebrovascular dysfunction, highlighting new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a major AD risk population.

">Recent social experience alters song behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Innate behaviors are hardwired into the nervous system, allowing animals to produce them instinctively and without prior learning. This includes social behaviors (e.g., aggression, courtship) in most animals. If and how learning shapes such innate behaviors has not been systematically explored. Here, we investigate learning from social feedback in Drosophila. We use closed-loop optogenetics to systematically perturb the social experience of individual flies during courtship, and find that altered feedback changes the male fly's innate courtship strategy, opening the door for investigating the neural and molecular basis of social plasticity in flies.

">Trial-by-trial fluctuations in decision criterion shape confidence</a></h4>

              
                Many of the choices we make are accompanied by a sense of confidence. Within classical Signal Detection Theory (SDT), confidence is conceptualized as the absolute distance between a decision variable and a decision criterion. The decision criterion is traditionally modelled as being stable over an experimental session. However, recent work challenges the notion of a static decision criterion, suggesting instead that the criterion undergoes trial-by-trial fluctuations. Combining SDT theory and model simulations, we predict that fluctuations in the decision criterion shape confidence. In 15 human decision-making datasets, trial-by-trial estimates of decision criterion were obtained with the Hierarchical Model for Fluctuations in Criterion (hMFC). Across all datasets, we confirmed our pre-registered hypothesis that confidence is shaped by single-trial criterion state. This effect was found in 14 out of 15 individual datasets, indicating a robust pattern across a variety of task paradigms and confidence reporting scales. Going beyond self-report, the shaping of confidence by criterion fluctuations was replicated in an implicit measure of confidence, RTs, and in two key neurophysiological markers, pupil-linked arousal and a neural signature of confidence. Our results demonstrate that variability in confidence, which has traditionally been treated as noise, actually reflects genuine sensitivity to the current state of the (fluctuating) decision criterion.

">Adaptation of motor control strategies and physiological arousal during repeated blocks of split-belt walking</a></h4>

              
                Physiological arousal, mediated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), is known to co-modulate with adaptation of motor control strategies, governed by the central nervous system (CNS), in response to repeated standing perturbations. However, adaptation of the ANS physiological arousal response during repeat exposure to walking challenges remains unknown. This study examines the physiological arousal response (electrodermal activation, EDA) and motor control strategy of gait during a single session of repeated exposure to blocks of split-belt walking. Twenty young adults completed three repeated blocks (3.5 min each) of split-belt walking (2:1 speed ratio) alternating with three blocks of tied-belt walking. Step length symmetry (SLS), EDA, bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle activation and ground reaction forces (GRFs) were measured. For each walking block, the first (early) and last (late) 15 strides were analyzed. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) tested the effect of repeated blocks and phases (early/late) on SLS. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) examined patterns of within-block changes in EDA, muscle activation, and GRFs. The greatest within-block adaptation of SLS occurred during first exposure to split-belt walking (S1; p<.001). Similarly, the largest magnitude of within-block adaptation in muscle activation, GRFs, and EDA occurred during S1 (p<.05). Attenuated EDA responses together with lower magnitude of motor adaptation in subsequent split blocks 2 and 3 were observed, indicating savings across the ANS and CNS. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the ANS-mediated physiological arousal response modulates alongside the CNS-driven locomotor adaptation to repeated exposure to blocks of split-belt walking.

">Muscle Stiffness, Not Force, Limits Human Force Production</a></h4>

              
                Humans have a remarkable ability to manage physical interaction despite a tremendously complex musculoskeletal system, comparatively slow muscles and slow neural communication. Most physical interaction tasks require force generation, and that can compromise stability. To ensure stability, muscles are required to produce a certain mechanical impedance (especially stiffness and damping). In this work we investigate the human limits of force generation and test whether and how those limits are constrained by our ability to stabilize the task. Moreover, we also study how strongly limb configuration - known to play a key role in transmitting muscle tension to hand force - matters in the generation of force. We devised an experiment in which healthy individuals performed a maximum voluntary pushing task using a custom-designed gimbal apparatus which allowed us to conditionally change the ability to transmit torque at the wrist, thus enabling or disabling stabilization via wrist pronation-supination, ulnar-radial deviation, and flexion-extension. The experiment was repeated in two different arm configurations (preferred and undesired) to assess the effect of limb configuration. The results showed: (i) a statistically significant and substantial decrease in maximum output force with less wrist ability to generate stabilizing torque, and (ii) a significant but minimal difference in maximum pushing force between the two arm configurations. Interestingly, subjects unexpectedly improved their maximum pushing performance between pre- and post-experiment, suggesting a negligible effect of fatigue and a possible effect of learning. Our findings confirm our hypothesis that force production appears to be limited by stiffness production. Muscles do not primarily generate force, but generate mechanical impedance.

">EEG Phase Slips Reveal Detailed Brain Activity Patterns of Novice Vipassana Meditators During Decision Making Tasks</a></h4>

              
                Our study adopted a novel approach, utilizing four biomarkers, namely EEG potentials, their first-order derivatives, and phase slip rates derived from each, to discern the differences between novice Vipassana (NVP) subjects and non-meditator controls (NMC). Phase slip rates are discontinuities in instantaneous phase that represent cortical phase transitions, indicating a significant change in the overall brain state. We employed 128-channel EEG data from eight NMC and eight NVP subjects, collected during a gamified protocol, to investigate object identification within a visual oddball paradigm. EEG was continuously acquired during the first 50 trials for each subject. We retained 44 artifact-free trials per subject (the minimum common across all subjects) and computed within-subject averages. The EEGs were then averaged over NMC and NVP subjects. The EEG was filtered in the alpha band, and the phase was extracted using the Hilbert transform, unwrapped, and the phase slip rates were computed. A montage layout of electrodes was used to make the spatiotemporal plots of biomarkers. Our findings revealed that the spatiotemporal profiles of all four biomarkers differed significantly between the two groups of subjects. Furthermore, the NVP subjects demonstrated faster object recognition. These results not only provide a unique method to use phase slip rates to quantify cognitive differences between NMC and NVP subjects but also present a promising set of biomarkers for quantitative task-based EEG analyses.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Social learning, a hallmark of human behavior, entails integrating other’s actions or ideas with one’s own. While it can accelerate the learning process by circumventing slow and costly individual trial-and-error learning, its effectiveness depends on knowing when and whose information to use. In this study, we explored how individuals use social information based on their own and others’ levels of uncertainty. Participants performed a social information use task in which they could revise their initial estimate after viewing a peer’s estimate. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the amount of information provided before their decision and by manipulating the peer’s reported confidence. As expected, adjustments were larger when individuals themselves were less certain and the peer was more confident. Through a combination of Bayesian computational modeling and neuroimaging analyses, we were able to identify regions in the anterior and ventral medial prefrontal cortex where neural activity overlapped in response to lower personal certainty, higher peer confidence, and larger belief updates after viewing the peer’s estimate. We discuss how these regions in the medial prefrontal cortex likely serve as a convergence zone for the preparation and execution of integrating certainty estimates.</span>

Behaviorally, we found that manipulating prior beliefs causally affected confidence without corresponding changes in accuracy and a negligible effect on reaction times. The electroencephalogram data showed a monotonic relation between the reported level of confidence and both centro-parietal positivity and error positivity amplitudes. Importantly, this finding is compatible both with the theory that these signals track confidence as well as with the alternative theory that they track accumulated evidence. Critically, both neural signals were insensitive to the influence of prior beliefs on confidence, showing that they reflect the accumulated evidence that is used by the system to compute confidence, not directly confidence. Likewise, oscillatory activity in alpha and beta band was insensitive to the influence of prior beliefs on confidence. Decoding analyses revealed that the brain does hold shared representations for prior beliefs and confidence, and we identified a frontal signal that is sensitive to both confidence and prior beliefs.</span>

In controls, we temporarily limited the visual field to the central 10° to model peripheral loss. The central loss experienced by STGD patients led to an increase in RF size in the dorsal subdivisions of V1, V2, and V3. In contrast, peripheral loss in RP patients led to a bilateral increase in population RF sizes in V1 but a decrease in V2. Transient peripheral loss in controls led to an increase in RF size in V1 and a decrease in V2 and V3, regardless of the dorsal-ventral division of the cortical representation.

Partial Least Square Correlation revealed a main component linking cognitive, linguistic, and phonological measures to amodal/associative brain areas. A second analysis only in TRs revealed a stronger association between cognitive, linguistic, literacy and phonological skills within the same brain network as in the full sample, suggesting better speech-print convergence in TRs. In this sample, an additional component involving speed, automatization, and lexical access was associated with less involvement in unimodal, lower-level auditory, and motor brain areas. The complementarity between the two components likely reflects TRs’ reduced reliance on lower-level sensorimotor regions and greater engagement of higher-level cortices and skills. Overall, our work suggests convergence between behavioral measures of linguistic, domain-general cognitive and domain-specific non-linguistic skill, and between these behavioral measures and neural processing of language. This convergence is greater in TRs, suggesting more integrated processing in this group.

                <p>The corticospinal tract (CST) facilitates skilled, precise movements, which necessitates that subcerebral projection neurons (SCPNs) establish segmentally specific connectivity with brainstem and spinal circuits. Developmental molecular delineation enables prospective identification of corticospinal neurons (CSNs) projecting to thoraco-lumbar spinal segments; however, it remains unclear whether other SCPN subpopulations in developing sensorimotor cortex can be prospectively identified in this manner. Such molecular tools could enable investigations of SCPN circuitry with precision and specificity. During development, Kelch-like 14 (<I>Klhl14</I>) is specifically expressed by a specific SCPN subpopulation, CSN<SUB>BC-lat</SUB>, that reside in lateral sensorimotor cortex with axonal projections exclusively to bulbar-cervical targets. In this study, we generated Klhl14-T2A-Cre knock-in mice to investigate SCPN that are <I>Klhl14+</I> during development into maturity. Using conditional anterograde and retrograde labeling in mice of either sex, we find that Klhl14-Cre is specifically expressed by CSN<SUB>BC-lat</SUB> only at specific developmental time points. We establish conditional viral labeling in Klhl14-T2A-Cre mice as a new approach to reliably investigate CSN<SUB>BC-lat</SUB> axon targeting and confirm that this identifies known molecular regulators of CSN axon targeting. Therefore, Klhl14-T2A-Cre mice can be used as a novel tool for identifying molecular regulators of CST axon guidance in a relatively high-throughput manner in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that intersectional viral labeling enables precise targeting of only Klhl14-Cre+ CSN<SUB>BC-lat</SUB> in the adult central nervous system. Together, our results establish that developmental molecular delineation of SCPN subpopulations can be used to selectively and specifically investigate their development, as well as anatomical and functional organization into maturity.</p>

                <p>by Peng Tao, Yunda Si, Jie Xia, Yi Xiao</p>

The divergence in folding pathways between RNA co-transcriptional folding (CTF) and free folding (FF) is crucial for understanding dynamic functional regulation of RNAs. Here, we developed a simplified all-atom molecular dynamics framework to systematically compare the folding kinetics of an RNA hairpin (PDB:1ZIH) under CTF and FF conditions. By analyzing over 800 microseconds of simulated trajectory, we found that despite convergence to identical native conformations across CTF simulations (with varied transcription rates) and FF simulations, they exhibit distinct preferences for the folding pathways defined by the order of base-pair formation. Conformational space analysis shows that CTF biases the folding pathway by adopting more compact conformations than FF. Our findings provide atomic-scale insights into how temporal-spatial coupling of transcription and folding diversifies RNA folding dynamics.

Understanding acute infectious disease dynamics at individual and population levels is critical for informing public health preparedness and response. Serological assays, which measure a range of biomarkers relating to humoral immunity, can provide a valuable window into immune responses generated by past infections and vaccinations. However, traditional methods for interpreting serological data, such as binary seropositivity and seroconversion thresholds, often rely on heuristics that fail to account for individual variability in antibody kinetics and timing of infection, potentially leading to biased estimates of infection rates and post-exposure immune responses. To address these limitations, we developed <i>serojump</i>, a novel probabilistic framework and software package that uses individual-level serological data to infer infection status, timing, and subsequent antibody kinetics. We validated <i>serojump</i> using simulated serological data and real-world SARS-CoV-2 datasets from The Gambia. In simulation studies, the model accurately recovered individual infection status, population-level antibody kinetics, and the relationship between biomarkers and immunity against infection, demonstrating robustness under observational noise. Benchmarking against standard serological heuristics in real-world data revealed that <i>serojump</i> achieves higher sensitivity in identifying infections, outperforming static threshold-based methods and precision in inferred infection timing. Application of <i>serojump</i> to longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 serological data taken during the Delta wave provided additional insights into i) missed infections based on sub-threshold rises in antibody level and ii) antibody responses to multiple biomarkers post-vaccination and infection. Our findings highlight the utility of <i>serojump</i> as a pathogen-agnostic, flexible tool for serological inference, enabling deeper insights into infection dynamics, immune responses, and correlates of protection. The open-source framework offers researchers a platform for extracting information from serological datasets, with potential applications across various infectious diseases and study designs.

Understanding cerebral circulation is crucial for early diagnosis and patient-oriented therapies for brain conditions. However, blood flow simulations at the organ scale have been limited. This work introduces a framework for modeling extensive vascular networks in the human cerebral cortex and conducting pulsatile blood flow simulations. Using a patient-specific cerebral geometry, we applied a parallelized adaptive constrained constructive optimization algorithm to create a comprehensive pial vascular network in the left hemisphere, starting from the main cerebral arteries. The resulting network included over 75 000, 103 000, and 55 000 vessels for the anterior, middle, and posterior territories, respectively. Pial vessel diameters featured a median [interquartile range, IQR] value of 62.8[49.3,89.3]μm. We integrated the pial vascular network model with the Anatomically-Detailed Arterial Network (ADAN) model to conduct one-dimensional (1D) blood flow simulations under normotensive and hypertensive conditions. Viscoelastic dissipation proved to be a key ingredient in the characterization of the hemodynamic environments in the pial circulation. In the normotensive scenario, mean blood pressure in the pial vessels resulted in a median [IQR] value of 56.7[49.8,63.5]mmHg. The flow pulsatility index and its corresponding damping factor were effective descriptors of the hypertensive state. The median [IQR] pulsatility index in the normotensive state was 0.39[0.38,0.40], and in hypertension it increased up to 0.84[0.83,0.85], while its corresponding damping factor in the normotensive state was 2.07[1.78,2.48], and in the hypertensive state it was reduced to 1.20[1.16,1.39]. We observed large regional pressure gradients in terminal vessels, with pressure levels ranging from 50mmHg in normotension to 70mmHg in hypertension. Additionally, the pulsatility index at terminal vessels increased with distance from the Circle of Willis in the hypertensive case, contrasting with the decreasing pattern seen in normotension. This approach provides a unique characterization of hemodynamics in the pial vascular network of the human cerebral cortex, paving the way for research into microcirculatory environments, the link between hemodynamics and neural function, and their roles in conditions like stroke and dementia.

The length of actin filaments is regulated by the combined action of hundreds of actin-binding proteins. While the roles of individual proteins are well understood, how they combine to regulate actin dynamics <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear. Recent advances in microscopy have enabled precise, high-throughput measurements of filament lengths over time. However, the absence of a unified theoretical framework has hindered a mechanistic understanding of the multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics. To address this, we propose a general kinetic model that incorporates the combined effects of an arbitrary number of regulatory proteins on actin dynamics. We derive exact closed-form expressions for the moments of (1) the distribution of filament lengths over time and (2) the long-time distribution of changes in filament lengths within a fixed time window. We show that these moments allow us to distinguish between different regulatory mechanisms of multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics. Our theoretical framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting existing data and guiding future experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013427">An efficient and flexible framework for inferring global sensitivity of agent-based model parameters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel R. Bergman, Trachette Jackson, Harsh Vardhan Jain, Kerri-Ann Norton</p>

Agent-based models (ABMs) have become essential tools for simulating complex biological, ecological, and social systems where emergent behaviors arise from the interactions among individual agents. Quantifying uncertainty through global sensitivity analysis is crucial for assessing the robustness and reliability of ABM predictions. However, most global sensitivity methods demand substantial computational resources, making them impractical for highly complex models. Here, we introduce SMoRe GloS (Surrogate Modeling for Recapitulating Global Sensitivity), a novel, computationally efficient method for performing global sensitivity analysis of ABMs. By leveraging explicitly formulated surrogate models, SMoRe GloS allows for comprehensive parameter space exploration and uncertainty quantification without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate our method’s flexibility by applying it to two biological ABMs: a simple 2D <i>in vitro</i> cell proliferation model and a complex 3D vascular tumor growth model. Our results show that SMoRe GloS is compatible with simpler methods like the Morris one-at-a-time method, and more computationally intensive variance-based methods like eFAST. SMoRe GloS accurately recovered global sensitivity indices in each case while achieving substantial speedups, completing analyses in minutes. In contrast, direct implementation of eFAST amounted to several days of CPU time for the complex ABM. Remarkably, our method also estimates sensitivities for ABM parameters representing processes not explicitly included in the surrogate model, further enhancing its utility. By making global sensitivity analysis feasible for computationally expensive models, SMoRe GloS opens up new opportunities for uncertainty quantification in complex systems, allowing for more in depth exploration of model behavior, thereby increasing confidence in model predictions.

                <p>by Lucy Goodfellow, Carl A. B. Pearson, Simon R. Procter</p>

Compartmental infectious disease models are used to calculate disease transmission, estimate underlying rates, forecast future burden, and compare benefits across intervention scenarios. These models aggregate individuals into compartments, often stratified by characteristics to represent groups that might be intervention targets or otherwise of particular concern. Ideally, model calculation could occur at the most demanding resolution for the overall analysis, but this may be infeasible due to availability of computational resources or empirical data. Instead, detailed population age structure might be consolidated into broad categories such as children, working-age adults, and seniors. Researchers must then discretise key epidemic parameters, like the infection-fatality ratio, for these lower resolution groups. After estimating outcomes for those crude groups, follow-on analyses, such as calculating years of life lost (YLLs), may need to distribute or weight those low-resolution outcomes back to the high resolution. The specific calculation for these aggregation and disaggregation steps can substantially influence outcomes. To assist researchers with these tasks, we developed <i>paramix</i>, an R package which simplifies the transformations between high and low resolution. We demonstrate applying <i>paramix</i> to a common discretisation analysis: using age structured models for health economic calculations comparing YLLs. We compare how estimates vary between <i>paramix</i> and several alternatives for an archetypal model, including comparison to a high resolution benchmark. We consistently found that <i>paramix</i> yielded the most similar estimates to the high-resolution model, for the same computational burden of low-resolution models. In our illustrative analysis, the non-<i>paramix</i> methods estimated up to twice as many YLLs averted as the <i>paramix</i> approach, which would likely lead to a similarly large impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios used in economic evaluations.

                <p>by Maxime Calka, Pierre Badin, Mohammad Ali Nazari, Michel Rochette, Pascal Perrier, Yohan Payan</p>

<i>Background and objectives:</i> We present a new Finite Element (FE) tongue model that was designed to precisely account for 3D tongue shapes produced during isolated French speech sounds by a male individual (RS). Such a high degree of realism will enable scientists to precisely and quantitatively assess, in a speaker-specific manner, hypotheses about speech motor control and the impact of tongue anatomy, muscle arrangements, and tongue dynamics in this context.
<i>Methods:</i> The shape and topology of the FE model were generated from 3D high resolution orofacial MR images of RS having his tongue in “neutral” posture. Mesh density was determined with convergence and mesh quality analyses. In a first step, muscle anatomy in the tongue was determined based on existing literature, and, in a second step, it was refined and evaluated by comparing actual and simulated 3D tongue shapes for various French speech sounds.
<i>Results:</i> Results are twofold. Firstly, a functional organization of the Genioglossus muscle into 4 parts is proposed which, on the one hand, is compatible with anatomical observations of the human tongue, and, on the other hand, goes beyond this anatomical account to faithfully reproduce the 3D tongue shape observed for RS in vowel /i/. Secondly, the realism of this implementation is demonstrated by the good match obtained for other isolated French sounds between actual and simulated tongue shapes. These simulations also inform us about the recruitment of tongue muscles for the main French speech sounds. Recruitment patterns are consistent with findings from the literature including both EMG measurements and model-based simulations.
<i>Conclusion:</i> The new model is made freely available, along with the data. Combined with mathematical tools that transform the tongue model cloning RS tongue into other models that account for the morphology of various individuals, the model can be a powerful tool to investigate healthy and pathological speech from various perspectives.

A major goal of behavioural ecology is to explain how phenotypic and ecological factors shape the networks of social relationships that animals form with one another. This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood—and addressed—as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our <i>estimands</i>. Second, we develop <i>estimators</i> for these effects—namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal <i>estimates</i> from the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.

                <p>by Marco Saltini, Eva E. Deinum</p>

Many plant cell functions, including cell morphogenesis and anisotropic growth, rely on the self-organisation of cortical microtubules into aligned arrays with the correct orientation. An important ongoing debate is how cell geometry, wall mechanical stresses, and other internal and external cues are integrated to determine the orientation of the cortical array. Here, we demonstrate that microtubule-based nucleation can markedly shift the balance between these often competing directional cues. For this, we developed a novel, more realistic model for microtubule-based nucleation in the simulation platform CorticalSim, which avoids the longstanding inhomogeneity problem stemming from previous, less realistic models for microtubule-based nucleation. We show that microtubule-based nucleation increases the sensitivity of the array to cell geometry, and extends the regime of spontaneous alignment compared to isotropic nucleation. In the case of cylindrical cell shapes, we show that this translates into a strong tendency to align in the transverse direction rather than along the vertical axis, and this is robust against small directional cues favouring the longitudinal direction. Comparing various cylinders and boxes, we show that different nucleation mechanisms result in different preferred array orientations, with the largest differences on cylinders. Our model provides a powerful tool for investigating how plant cells integrate multiple biases to orient their cortical arrays, offering new insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying cell shape and growth.

                <p>by Ricardo Roopnarinesingh, Neel D. Jani, Michelle Leppert, Debanjan Mukherjee</p>

Deciphering the source of an embolism is a common challenge encountered in stroke treatment. Carotid stenosis is a key source of embolic strokes. Carotid interventions can be indicated when a patient has greater than 50% stenosis in the carotid ipsilateral to the cerebral infarction, which is designated as the symptomatic carotid. However, there are often significant number of cases where carotid emboli travel contralaterally leading to ambiguity regarding which carotid is symptomatic. We use a patient-specific computational embolus-hemodynamics interaction model developed in prior works to conduct an in silico experiment spanning 30 heart-to-brain arterial models with differing combinations of bilateral severe and mild stenosis degrees. We used these models to study source-to-destination transport of thromboemboli released from left/right carotid disease sites, and cardiogenic sources. Across all cases considered, thromboemboli from left and right carotid sources showed non-zero contralateral transport. We also found that cardiogenic thromboemboli do not have an altered hemisphere distribution or distinct transport preference dependent on stenosis degree, thus potentially making the underlying etiology more cryptic. In patients with carotid stenosis or chronic occlusion ipsilateral to the area affected by stroke, we have demonstrated that the presence of contralateral stenosis can cause emboli that travel across the Circle of Willis (CoW) which can potentially lead to ambiguity when deciding which carotid is truly symptomatic.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.

Inter-laboratory replicability is crucial yet challenging in microbiome research. Leveraging microbiomes to promote soil health and plant growth requires understanding underlying molecular mechanisms using reproducible experimental systems. In a global collaborative effort involving five laboratories, we aimed to help advance reproducibility in microbiome studies by testing our ability to replicate synthetic community assembly experiments. Our study compared fabricated ecosystems constructed using two different synthetic bacterial communities, the model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, and sterile EcoFAB 2.0 devices. All participating laboratories observed consistent inoculum-dependent changes in plant phenotype, root exudate composition, and final bacterial community structure, where <i>Paraburkholderia</i> sp. OAS925 could dramatically shift microbiome composition. Comparative genomics and exudate utilization linked the pH-dependent colonization ability of <i>Paraburkholderia</i>, which was further confirmed with motility assays. The study provides detailed protocols, benchmarking datasets, and best practices to help advance replicable science and inform future multi-laboratory reproducibility studies.

Investigating social and independent behavior structure in early life is critical for understanding development and brain maturation in social mammals. However, this investigation necessitates monitoring animals over weeks to months often with subsecond time resolution creating challenges for both lab studies focused on brief observation periods and field studies in which animal tracking can be imprecise. Here we used machine vision and two-week long continuous behavior recordings of families of gerbils, a highly social rodent, in large, undisturbed home environments to quantify the behavioral development of individual pups. We discovered that individual pups exhibited complex social behaviors from the first day they left the nest including a preference for interactions with siblings over parents. Critically, independent behaviors such as foraging for food and water emerged several days later, each with a stereotyped temporal trajectory. Analysis of individual animal development confirmed the quality of our tracking methods and the stability and distinctness of each behavioral measure. Our work supports a model in which early and sustained social interactions may be supportive of solitary exploration for physiological needs. This model suggests that understanding the development of behavioral independence as well as maturation of sensory and motor systems in social rodents such as gerbils may require integration of social behavioral knowledge earlier than typically considered.

                <p>by Sallieu Jalloh, Ivy K. Hughes, Hisashi Akiyama, Aldana D. Gojanovich, Andres A. Quiñones-Molina, Mengwei Yang, Andrew J. Henderson, Gustavo Mostoslavsky, Suryaram Gummuluru</p>

Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy in suppressing plasma viremia in people living with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), persistent viral RNA expression in tissue reservoirs is observed and can contribute to HIV-1-induced immunopathology and comorbidities. Infection of long-lived innate immune cells, such as tissue-resident macrophages and microglia may contribute to persistent viral RNA production and chronic inflammation. We recently reported that de novo cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA) in macrophages and microglia leads to MDA5 and MAVS-dependent innate immune sensing and induction of type I IFN responses, demonstrating that HIV icRNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this report, we show that cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 icRNA also induces NLRP1 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages and microglia in an RLR- and endosomal TLR-independent manner. Infection of both macrophages and microglia with either replication-competent or single-cycle HIV-1 induced IL-1β secretion, which was attenuated when cytoplasmic expression of viral icRNA was prevented. While IL-1β secretion was blocked by treatment with caspase-1 inhibitors or knockdown of NLRP1 or caspase-1 expression in HIV-infected macrophages, overexpression of NLRP1 significantly enhanced IL-1β secretion in an HIV-icRNA-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed interaction of HIV-1 icRNA, but not multiply-spliced HIV-1 RNA, with NLRP1, suggesting that HIV-1 icRNA sensing by NLRP1 is sufficient to trigger inflammasome activation. Together, these findings reveal a pathway of NLRP1 inflammasome activation induced by de novo expressed HIV icRNA in HIV-infected myeloid cells.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to compare the long-term safety profiles of ocrelizumab and rituximab in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using retrospective data from the University of California (UC) Health System, we simulated a target clinical trial. The primary cohort from UC San Francisco (UCSF) and a validation cohort from 5 other UC Medical Centers were analyzed. After applying exclusion criteria and propensity score matching based on disease characteristics, demographics, and socioeconomic factors, we compared UCSF patients receiving ocrelizumab (n = 542) and rituximab (n = 271)and validated in the UC-wide MS population (n = 486 and n = 162 patients, respectively). The primary outcome was an all-cause hospitalization rate; secondary outcomes included hypogammaglobulinemia development and infection incidence.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Rituximab showed higher all-cause hospitalization rates compared to ocrelizumab in both UCSF (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37–3.82, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and UC-wide cohorts (IRR = 4.54, 95% CI = 4.30–7.61, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Cumulative hazard ratios (HRs) were similarly elevated with rituximab at UCSF (HR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.37–3.75, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and UC-wide (HR = 4.01, 95% CI = 2.25–6.32, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The risk of developing hypogammaglobulinemia was higher with rituximab at both UCSF (HR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.18–6.29, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and UC-wide (HR = 4.79, 95% CI = 2.04–11.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A more favorable safety profile was observed for ocrelizumab, with lower rates of hospitalization and hypogammaglobulinemia across 2 independent cohorts. These findings may help guide treatment strategies in persons with MS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Our understanding of how the medial temporal lobe (MTL) contributes to human cognition has advanced enormously over the past half a century. My work in the 1990s characterizing the role of recollection and familiarity processes in episodic memory led me to study the MTL's role in these two memory processes. In the current paper, I provide a personal commentary in which I describe the motivating ideas, as well as the invaluable impact of mentors, colleagues, and students that led to a series of studies showing that conscious recollection is critically dependent on the hippocampus, whereas familiarity-based judgments are dependent on regions such as the perirhinal cortex.</p>

                Using a well-defined model of direct conversion, Lende-Dorn et al. demonstrate that an optimal “Goldilocks” level of MAPK signaling efficiently drives cell-fate programming. Chemogenetic tuning of MAPK activity balances proliferation and transcription factor levels to support high rates of conversion to motor neurons.

                Virlogeux et al. identify and validate a neural population code for touch in the gracile nucleus (GrN) that is altered by inflammation and neuropathic injury. Transmission of this altered neural population code to the thalamus by somatostatin-expressing neurons in the GrN is required for the expression of mechanical allodynia.

                Liang et al. reveal that the G protein γ subunit GGC1 was under selection during tomato domestication. GGC1 negatively regulates plant vigor by inhibiting CPK28-mediated phosphorylation of PIP1;2, offering a novel target for high-yield crop breeding with enhanced CO2 assimilation and photosynthetic efficiency.

                Zhou et al. show that BBX10 promotes greening during de-etiolation in Arabidopsis. BBX10 interacts with PIF1 to form a transcriptional module that regulates GUN5 and APX2 expression, thereby inhibiting protochlorophyllide biosynthesis in darkness and suppressing ROS accumulation upon light exposure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105895">Atomistic simulation of voltage activation of a truncated BK channel</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-dependence gating of ion channels underlies numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, and disruption of normal voltage gating is the cause of many channelopathies. Here, long timescale atomistic simulations were performed to directly probe voltage-induced gating transitions of the big potassium (BK) channels, where the voltage sensor domain (VSD) movement has been suggested to be distinct from that of canonical Kv channels but remains poorly understood. Using a Core-MT construct without the gating ring, multiple voltage activation transitions were observed at 750 mV, allowing detailed analysis of the activated state of BK VSD and key mechanistic features. Even though the S4 helix remains the principal voltage sensor in BK, its vertical displacement is only ~3 Å and accompanied by significant lateral movements. The nature of the predicted VSD movement is in strong agreement with recent Cryo-EM structural studies of mutant BK channels with constitutively activated VSD. Free energy analysis based on the predicted activation transition yielded a total gating charge of 0.44 <i>e</i> per VSD, consistent with the experimental range of 0.48–0.65 <i>e</i>. We further show that the ability of modest physical movements with a small total gating charge to drive effective voltage gating of BK can be attributed to large gradients in the local electric field as reshaped by the protein. Furthermore, the S4 movement is coupled to the pore opening through a non-canonical pathway that involves the tightly packed S4-S5-S6 interface. These distinct mechanistic features may be relevant to voltage gating of other ion channels where VSDs are not domain-swapped with respect to the pore-gate domain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101717">Sld3CBD–Cdc45 structural insights into Cdc45 recruitment for CMG complex formation during DNA replication</a></h4>

              
                DNA replication requires recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS into the MCM double hexamer by initiation factors to form an active helicase, the Cdc45–MCM–GINS (CMG) complex, at the replication origins. The initiation factor Sld3 is a central regulator of Cdc45 and GINS recruitment, working with Sld7 together. However, the mechanism through which Sld3 regulates CMG complex formation remains unclear. Here, we present the structure of the Sld3 Cdc45-binding domain in complex with Cdc45 (Sld3CBD–Cdc45), showing detailed interactions and conformational changes required for binding to each other. The mutant analysis indicated that the binding between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 could be broken easily. We also revealed that Sld3CBD, GINS, and MCM bind to different sites on Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD–CMG model, indicating that after recruitment of Cdc45, Sld7–Sld3 could remain in Cdc45–MCM until CMG formation. The consistency between the particle size of Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 and the distance between Sld3CBDs in the Cdc45–MCM dimer indicated the binding manner of the Cdc45–Sld3–[Sld7]<sub>2</sub>–Sld3–Cdc45 off/on MCM double hexamer. A DNA-binding assay of Sld3 and its complexes with single-stranded ARS1 (autonomously replicating sequence 1) fragments revealed a relationship between the dissociation of Sld7–Sld3 from CMG and the unwound single-stranded DNA. These findings help to further our understanding of the molecular basis of the regulation of CMG complex formation by Sld3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104041">Preparatory attentional templates in prefrontal and sensory cortex encode target-associated information</a></h4>

              
                Visual search relies on the ability to use information about the target in working memory to guide attention and make target-match decisions. The ‘attentional’ or ‘target’ template is thought to be encoded within an inferior frontal junction (IFJ)-visual attentional network. While this template typically contains veridical target features, behavioral studies have shown that target-associated information, such as statistically co-occurring object pairs, can also guide attention. However, preparatory activation of associated information within the IFJ-visual attentional network has never been demonstrated. We used fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to test if target-associated information is explicitly represented in advance of visual search. Participants learned four face-scene category pairings and then completed a cued visual search task for a face. Face information was decoded in the fusiform face area, superior parietal lobule, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the cue period, but was absent during the delay period. In contrast, associated scene information was decoded in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the cue period, and most importantly, in the IFJ and the parahippocampal place area during the delay period. These results are a novel demonstration of how target-associated information from memory can supplant the veridical target in the brain’s ‘target template’ in anticipation of difficult visual search.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104138">Aurora kinase A promotes trained immunity via regulation of endogenous S-adenosylmethionine metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Innate immune cells can acquire a memory phenotype, termed trained immunity, but the mechanism underlying the regulation of trained immunity remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora kinase A (AurA) dampens trained immunity induced by β-glucan. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis reveal that AurA inhibition restricts chromatin accessibility of genes associated with inflammatory pathways such as JAK-STAT, TNF, and NF-κB pathways. Specifically, AurA inhibition promotes nuclear localization of FOXO3 and the expression of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a key enzyme responsible for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption. Metabolomic analysis confirms a reduction in SAM level upon AurA inhibition. As a result of SAM deficiency, trained mouse macrophages exhibit decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on gene regions of <i>Il6 and Tnf</i>. Additionally, the tumor inhibition effect of β-glucan is notably abolished by AurA inhibition. Together, our findings identify an essential role of AurA in regulating trained immunity via a methylation-dependent manner by maintaining endogenous SAM levels through the mTOR-FOXO3-GNMT axis.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 80% of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) have autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor, and clinical characteristics may vary between early-onset (symptom onset age &lt;50 years) and late-onset MG (EOMG and LOMG), but the pathophysiological differences between EOMG and LOMG are not well established.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an exploratory in-depth proteomics analysis examining 768 inflammatory proteins utilizing the baseline serum samples from the BeatMG study (NCT02110706). We performed pathway enrichment analysis to assess the pathways involved in LOMG. A total of 15 selected proteins from the initial analysis were further examined using the UK Biobank and further quantified in a separate validation cohort.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 21 patients with EOMG (age 38.3 ± 12.1 years, 16 women [76.2%]) and 28 patients with LOMG (age 67.3 ± 8.6 years, 7 women [25%]) from the BeatMG study were included in the exploratory analysis. Several proteins involved in the regulation of leukocyte differentiation and myeloid leukocyte differentiation and migration pathways were more abundant in the LOMG group. Among them, 7 were significantly different in the UK Biobank cohort. A total of 80 participants (39 MG patients (age 54.33 ± 18.9 years, 17 women [43.6%]) and 41 healthy controls (age 49.56 ± 17.06 years, 21 women [66.1%]) were included in the validation cohort, and IL18R1, CXCL17, and CCL11 were validated to be specific for LOMG.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Growing evidence supports that LOMG has a distinct immune pathomechanism. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm the utility of these proteins as biomarkers of LOMG, and the feasibility of using them for more precise therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.

<p>Retinal projections in the Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) where studied using intraocular injections of a neural tracer and compared to those of a non-hovering species, the Zebra finch (<i>Taeniopygia castanotis</i>).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hummingbirds (family <i>Trochilidae</i>) are easily recognized due to their unique ability to hover. Critical to hovering flight is head and body stabilization. In birds, stabilization during flight is mediated, among other things, by the detection of optic flow, the motion that occurs across the entire retina during self-motion. Given this increased requirement for stabilization, it is not surprising that previous studies have shown that hummingbirds have neural specializations in the visual pathways involved in the detection of optic flow. Particularly, previous studies have found some structural and functional differences in the hummingbird brain, in the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM): compared to other avian species, LM shows a massive hypertrophy, and LM neurons have unique response properties to optic flow stimuli. Here, we used intraocular injections of a neural tracer, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated with a fluorescent molecule, to study the retinal projections in Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) and compare them to those of a similarly sized non-hovering species, the zebra finch (<i>Taeniopygia castanotis</i>). Retinal targets in both birds were similar and correspond closely to those reported in other birds from a variety of avian clades. Importantly, we found differences in the projections to LM between hummingbirds and zebra finches. Consistent with previous reports of specialization of LM, it was more intensely labelled compared to other retinal-recipient nuclei in hummingbirds. Moreover, this increase in intensity was most apparent in the lateral subnucleus. This study reinforces previous evidence that the LM of hummingbirds is adapted to sustain the unique flight abilities of this clade.</p>

                <p>by Shuze Liu, Samuel Joseph Gershman</p>

Real-world decision-making often involves navigating large action spaces with state-dependent action values, taxing the limited cognitive resources at our disposal. While previous studies have explored cognitive constraints on generating action consideration sets or refining state-action mappings (policy complexity), their interplay remains underexplored. In this work, we present a resource-rational framework for policy compression that integrates both constraints, offering a unified perspective on decision-making under cognitive limitations. Through simulations, we characterize the suboptimality arising from reduced action consideration sets and reveal the complex interaction between policy complexity and action consideration set size in mitigating this suboptimality. We then use such normative insight to explain empirically observed phenomena in option generation, including the preferential sampling of generally valuable options and increased correlation in responses across contexts under cognitive load. We further validate the framework’s predictions through a contextual multi-armed bandit experiment, showing how humans flexibly adapt their action consideration sets and policy complexity to maintain near-optimality in a task-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for fine-grained resource constraints in understanding human cognition, and highlights the presence of adaptive metacognitive strategies even in simple tasks.

                <p>by Dongju Lim, Kyeong Tae Ko, Hyukpyo Hong, Hyojung Lee, Boseung Choi, Won Chang, Sunhwa Choi, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting complex dynamical systems, ranging from gene regulatory networks to population-level dynamics. However, model predictions are highly sensitive to initial conditions, which are often unknown. In infectious disease models, for instance, the initial number of exposed individuals (E) at the time the model simulation starts is frequently unknown. This initial condition has often been estimated using an unrealistic, history-independent assumption for simplicity: the chance that an exposed individual becomes infectious is the same regardless of the timing of their exposure (i.e., exposure history). Here, we show that this history-independent method can yield serious bias in the estimation of the initial condition. To address this, we developed a <i>history-dependent</i> initial condition estimation method derived from a master equation expressing the time-varying likelihood of becoming infectious during a latent period. Our method consistently outperformed the history-independent method across various scenarios, including those with measurement errors and abrupt shifts in epidemics, for example, due to vaccination. In particular, our method reduced estimation error by 55% compared to the previous method in real-world COVID-19 data from Seoul, Republic of Korea, which includes likely infection dates, allowing us to obtain the true initial condition. This advancement of initial condition estimation enhances the precision of epidemic modeling, ultimately supporting more effective public health policies. We also provide a user-friendly package, Hist-D, to facilitate the use of this history-dependent initial condition estimation method.

This study addresses the pressing global health burden of mosquito-borne diseases by investigating the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mosquito species identification using wing images. Conventional identification methods are hampered by the need for significant expertise and resources, while CNNs offer a promising alternative. Our research aimed to develop a reliable and applicable classification system that can be used under real-world conditions, with a focus on improving model adaptability to unencountered devices, mitigating dataset biases, and ensuring usability across different users without standardized protocols. We utilized a large, diverse dataset of mosquito wing images of 21 taxa and three image-capturing devices (N = 14,888) and a preprocessing pipeline to standardize images and remove undesirable image features. The developed CNN models demonstrated high performance, with an average balanced accuracy of 98.3% and a macro F1-score of 97.6%, effectively distinguishing between the 21 mosquito taxa, including morphologically similar pairs. The preprocessing pipeline improved the model’s robustness, reducing performance drops on unfamiliar devices effectively. However, the study also highlights the persistence of inherent dataset biases, which the preprocessing steps could only partially mitigate. The classification system’s practical usability was demonstrated through a feasibility study, showing high inter-rater reliability. The results underscore the potential of the proposed workflow to enhance vector surveillance, especially in resource-constrained settings, and suggest its applicability to other winged insect species. The classification system developed in this study is available for public use, providing a valuable tool for vector surveillance and research, supporting efforts to mitigate the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.

Drug-induced liver injury is a leading cause of high attrition rates for both candidate drugs and marketed medications. Previous in silico models may not effectively utilize biological drug property information and often lack robust model validation. In this study, we developed a graph convolutional network embedded with a biological graph learning (BioGL) module—named BioGL-GCN(Biological Graph Learning-Graph Convolutional Network)—for drug-induced liver injury prediction using toxicogenomic profiles. The BioGL module learned the optimal graph representations of gene interactions by utilizing the constructed protein-protein interaction network, which represents initial gene relationships, and gene frequency information obtained from gene enrichment analysis. Finally, the graph convolutional network was used to identify drug hepatotoxicity. Our method pays more attention to gene-gene relationships compared to previous approaches, thereby achieving more accurate predictive performance. We applied BioGL-GCN to predict DILI risk for active components in the integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) database and validated these predictions through hepatotoxicity experiments using a 3D primary human hepatocyte (PHH) model. The results showed that our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 79%, thus further validating the reliability of the constructed model.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013392">Generating correlated data for omics simulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jianing Yang, Gregory R. Grant, Thomas G. Brooks</p>

Simulation of realistic omics data is a key input for benchmarking studies that help users obtain optimal computational pipelines. Omics data involves large numbers of measured features on each sample and these measures are generally correlated with each other. However, simulation too often ignores these correlations, perhaps due to computational and statistical hurdles of doing so. To alleviate this, we describe three approaches for generating omics-scale data with correlated measures which mimic real datasets. These approaches are all based on a Gaussian copula approach with a covariance matrix that decomposes into a diagonal part and a low-rank part. This decomposition allows for extremely efficient simulation, overcoming a hurdle for adoption of past methods. We use these approaches to demonstrate the importance of including correlation in two benchmarking applications. First, we show that variance of results from the popular DESeq2 method increases when dependence is included. Second, we demonstrate that CYCLOPS, a method for inferring circadian time of collection from transcriptomics, improves in performance when given gene-gene dependencies in some circumstances. We provide an R package, dependentsimr, that has efficient implementations of these methods and can generate dependent data with arbitrary marginal distributions, including discrete (binary, ordered categorical, Poisson, negative binomial), continuous (normal), or with an empirical distribution.

                <p>by Pierre Orhan, Yves Boubenec, Jean-Rémi King</p>

Humans can spontaneously detect complex algebraic structures. Historically, two opposing views explain this ability, at the root of language and music acquisition. Some argue for the existence of an innate and specific mechanism. Others argue that this ability emerges from experience: i.e. when generic learning principles continuously process sensory inputs. These two views, however, remain difficult to test experimentally. Here, we use deep learning models to evaluate the factors that lead to the spontaneous detection of algebraic structures in the auditory modality. Specifically, we use self-supervised learning to train multiple deep-learning models with a variable amount of either natural (environmental sounds) and/or cultural sounds (speech or music) to evaluate the impact of these stimuli. We then expose these models to the experimental paradigms classically used to evaluate the processing of algebraic structures. Like humans, these models spontaneously detect repeated sequences, probabilistic chunks, and complex algebraic structures. Also like humans, this ability diminishes with structure complexity. Importantly, this ability can emerge from experience alone: the more the models are exposed to natural sounds, the more they spontaneously detect increasingly complex structures. Finally, this ability does not emerge in models pretrained only on speech, and emerges more rapidly in models pretrained with music than environmental sounds. Overall, our study provides an operational framework to clarify sufficient built-in and acquired principles that model human’s advanced capacity to detect algebraic structures in sounds.

                <p>by Andrew Frando, Ajai A. Dandekar, Josephine R. Chandler</p>

Many bacteria use quorum sensing to control gene transcription based on population density. A recent study in PLOS Biology found that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two quorum sensing circuits activate each other, enhancing robustness and explaining their redundancy.

Many bacteria use quorum sensing to control gene transcription based on population density. This primer explores a recent study in PLOS Biology which found that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two quorum-sensing circuits activate each other, enhancing robustness and explaining their redundancy.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003337">Developmental auditory deprivation in one ear impairs brainstem binaural processing and reduces spatial hearing acuity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kelsey L. Anbuhl, Alexander T. Ferber, Andrew D. Brown, Victor Benichoux, Nathaniel T. Greene, Daniel J. Tollin</p>

Early sensory experience can exert lasting perceptual consequences. For example, a brief period of auditory deprivation early in life can lead to persistent spatial hearing deficits. Some forms of hearing loss (i.e., conductive; CHL) can distort acoustical cues needed for spatial hearing, which depend on inputs from both ears. We hypothesize that asymmetric acoustic input during development disrupts auditory circuits that integrate binaural information. Here, we identify prolonged maturation of the binaural auditory brainstem in the guinea pig by tracking auditory evoked potentials across development. Using this age range, we induce a reversible unilateral CHL and ask whether behavioral and neural maturation are disrupted. We find that developmental CHL is associated with alterations in a brainstem readout of binaural function, an effect that was not observed in a separate cohort with adult-onset CHL. Startle-based behavioral measures suggest that Early CHL animals exhibit reduced spatial resolution for high-frequency sound sources. Finally, single-unit recordings of auditory midbrain neurons reveal significantly poorer neural acuity to a sound location cue that largely depends on high-frequency sounds. Thus, these findings show that unilateral deprivation can disrupt developing auditory circuits that integrate binaural information and may give rise to lingering spatial hearing deficits.
