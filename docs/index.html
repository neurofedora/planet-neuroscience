<p>We investigated fiber distribution patterns of corticospinal neurons within the cortical area projecting to the lumbar cord gray matter of mice. The lumbar-cord-projecting area fundamentally innervates the gray matter in the same way as the cervical-cord-projecting area does.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although corticospinal neurons are known to be distributed in both the primary motor and somatosensory cortices (S1), details of the projection pattern of their fibers to the lumbar cord gray matter remain largely uncharacterized, especially in rodents. We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB. These findings suggest that the L4 Cx is parceled into subregions defined by the cytoarchitecture and subcortical projection.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) is a structure highly interconnected with several nuclei ranging from forebrain to hypothalamus and brainstem. Numerous rodent studies have examined afferent and efferent connections of the PVT and their contribution to behavior, revealing its important role in the integration of arousal cues. However, the majority of these studies used a region-oriented approach, without considering the neuronal subtype diversity of the nucleus. In the present study, we provide the anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of a subpopulation of PVT neurons molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck). Combining a genetically modified mouse model with viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of Gck-positive neurons of the anterior PVT (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup>). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons innervate several nuclei throughout the brain axis. The strongest connections are with forebrain areas associated with reward and stress and with hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the Gck-expressing neurons revealed that they are enriched in receptors for hypothalamic-derived neuropeptides, adhesion molecules, and obesity and diabetes susceptibility transcription factors. Using retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we identify that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations, including arginine-vasopressin-, melanin-concentrating hormone-, orexin-, and proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons. This detailed anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons provides a basis for functional studies of the integration of homeostatic and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, and for deciphering the potential role of these neurons in obesity and diabetes development.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b3c8d0f4-8384-43cc-98df-b9b1e9216744/cne25318-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Inhibition of androgenic pathway impairs encoding of cerebellar-dependent motor learning in male rats"/>
<p>Gaze stabilization reflexes such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the optokinetic reflex (OKR) share some neuronal circuitry and interact in oculomotor adaptation phenomena. The presence of androgen receptors (Ars) in the cerebellar–vestibular network that mediates the adaptive modification of the VOR makes the VOR an excellent model to study the impact of androgens on cerebellar-dependent learning. In young male rats, the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (FLUT) acutely impairs the capability of VOR to encode gain-increase and gain-decrease adaptation without influencing basal VOR and OKR. Such findings imply that the androgenic neuronal pathway activation participates in the VOR adaptation phenomenon probably via nonclassical mechanisms of regulation. We suggested that androgens, possibly testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by binding Ars may rapidly regulate cerebellar and extracerebellar plastic sites responsible for VOR adaptation.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebellar-dependent learning is essential for the adaptation of motor and no motor behaviors to changing contexts, and neuroactive steroids—mainly referred to as estrogens—may regulate this process. However, the role of androgens in this process has not been established, although they may affect cerebellar physiology. Thus, this study aims to determine whether the activation of androgenic neural pathways may take part in controlling the vestibuloocular (VOR) and optokinetic reflexes (OKR), which depend on a defined cerebellar circuitry. To answer this question, we acutely blocked the activation of androgen receptors (Ars) using systemic administration of the Ars antagonist flutamide (FLUT; 20 mg/Kg) in peripubertal male rats. Then, we evaluated the FLUT effect on general oculomotor performance in the VOR and OKR as well as VOR adaptive gain increases and decreases. We used a paradigm causing fast VOR adaptation that combined in phase/out phase visuo-vestibular stimulations. We found that FLUT impaired the gain increase and decrease in VOR adaptation. However, FLUT altered neither acute nor overtime basal ocular-motor performance in the VOR or OKR. These findings indicate that the activation of androgenic neural pathways participates in phenomena leading to fast VOR adaptation, probably through the modulation of plasticity mechanisms that underlie adaptation of this reflex. Conversely, androgens may not be essential for neural information processing demands in basal ocular-motor reflexes. Moreover, our results suggest that androgens, possibly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, could rapidly regulate motor memory encoding in the VOR adaptation, acting at both cerebellar and extracerebellar plasticity sites.</p>

     alt="Secretagogin in the brain and pituitary of the catfish, Clarias batrachus: Molecular characterization and regulation by insulin"/>
<p>Expression and significance of secretagogin (scgn) in the brain of catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Three scgn transcript variants were found in the brain of <i>C. batrachus</i>. Two of these transcript variants predicted to encode a putative 272 aa protein, comparable to that found in teleosts and fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Cells expressing scgn showed wide distribution in the brain and pituitary. None of the hypophysiotropic dopamine neurons but a great majority of the isotocin and vasotocin neurons coexpressed scgn. Distinct scgn neurons/fibers were observed in the entopeduncular nucleus (EN, arrow) in the ventral telencephalon. Intracranial insulin enhanced scgn expression in EN neurons.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), is a novel hexa EF-hand, phylogenetically conserved calcium-binding protein. It serves as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and neuroendocrine regulation in mammals. However, its relevance in the brain of non-mammalian vertebrates has largely remained unexplored. To address this issue, we studied the cDNA encoding scgn, <i>scgn</i> mRNA expression, and distribution of scgn-equipped elements in the brain and pituitary of a teleost, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (<i>cb</i>). The <i>cbscgn</i> cDNA consists of three transcripts (T) variants: T1 (2185 bp), T2 (2151 bp) and T3 (2060 bp). While 816 bp ORF in T1 and T2 encodes highly conserved six EF-hand 272 aa protein fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, 726-bp ORF in T3 encodes 242 aa protein. The T1 showed &gt;90% and &gt;70% identity with scgn of catfishes, and other teleosts and mammals, respectively. The T1-mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and pituitary, while the expression of T3 was restricted to the telencephalon. Application of the anti-scgn antiserum revealed a ∼32 kDa scgn-immunoreactive (scgn-i) band (known molecular weight of scgn) in the forebrain tissue, and immunohistochemically labeled neurons in the olfactory epithelium and bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hindbrain. In the pituitary, scgn-i cells were seen in the pars distalis and intermedia. Insulin is reported to regulate <i>scgn</i> mRNA in the mammalian hippocampus, and feeding-related neuropeptides in the telencephalon of teleost. Intracranial injection of insulin significantly increased T1-mRNA expression and scgn-immunoreactivity in the telencephalon. We suggest that scgn may be an important player in the regulation of olfactory, neuroendocrine system, and energy balance functions in <i>C. batrachus</i>.</p>

<p>The expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) in the zebra finch brain showing unique differential expressions in subdivisions of the forebrain and the song nuclei. The white color represents mRNA signal.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission and cell signaling, which contribute to learning, memory, and the execution of motor skills. Birdsong is a complex learned motor skill in songbirds. Although the existence of 15 nAChR subunits has been predicted in the avian genome, their expression patterns and potential contributions to song learning and production have not been comprehensively investigated. Here, we cloned all the 15 nAChR subunits (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) from the zebra finch brain and investigated the mRNA expression patterns in the neural pathways responsible for the learning and production of birdsong during a critical period of song learning. Although there were no detectable hybridization signals for ChrnA1, A6, A9, and A10, the other 11 nAChR subunits were uniquely expressed in one or more major subdivisions in the song nuclei of the songbird brain. Of these 11 subunits, ChrnA3–5, A7, and B2 were differentially regulated in the song nuclei compared with the surrounding anatomically related regions. ChrnA5 was upregulated during the critical period of song learning in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed ChrnA7 and B2 to be the major subunits expressed in neurons of the vocal motor nuclei HVC and robust nucleus of the arcopallium, indicating the potential existence of ChrnA7-homomeric and ChrnB2-heteromeric nAChRs in limited cell populations. These results suggest that relatively limited types of nAChR subunits provide functional contributions to song learning and production in songbirds.</p>

<p>Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad) is a regulator of dendritic spine density. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. <i>Acad</i> was substantially expressed in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus of intact brains. Cerebral ischemia dramatically upregulated <i>Acad</i> expression, mainly in the limbic and paralimbic regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structural plasticity of dendritic spines serves as the adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system to various stimuli. Among these stimuli, cerebral ischemia induces dynamic alterations in neuronal network activity. Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad), a regulator of dendritic spine density, is strongly induced by activating stimuli to the neurons. However, the detailed distribution of Acad in normal and ischemic adult brains remains unclear. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We found that intact adult brains expressed <i>Acad</i> in the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, hippocampal CA3, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. <i>Acad</i> expression was dramatically upregulated in the piriform cortex, olfactory area, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, amygdala, and septohippocampal nucleus 4 h after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induced widespread neuronal activation, which was required for <i>Acad</i> upregulation. Our data suggested the involvement of Acad in the adaptive plasticity and remodeling of the neuronal network in the limbic and paralimbic systems.</p>

     alt="Brain-wide mapping of inputs to the mouse lateral posterior (LP/Pulvinar) thalamus–anterior cingulate cortex network"/>
<p>We perform projection-specific monosynaptic mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP and ACC network in mice and show that the LP-ACC network integrates information from regions which parallel that of the primate pulvinar-prefrontal network. LP→ACC and ACC→LP neurons share common sources of inputs from regions involved in orienting and sensorimotor control. Inputs to the ACC→LP projection may serve to provide spatial context or visuomotor instructions, while the bottom-up LP→ACC circuit integrates multisensory information and could serve as a route for SC feedback to frontal cortex. Our study serves as a primer for future circuit-level examination of LP-ACC interactions and inputs integrated by this circuit.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent homolog of the primate pulvinar, the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus, is extensively interconnected with multiple cortical areas. While these cortical interactions can span the entire LP, subdivisions of the LP are characterized by differential connections with specific cortical regions. In particular, the medial LP has reciprocal connections with frontoparietal cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC plays an integral role in top-down sensory processing and attentional regulation, likely exerting some of these functions via the LP. However, little is known about how ACC and LP interact, and about the information potentially integrated in this reciprocal network. Here, we address this gap by employing a projection-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to delineate brain-wide inputs to bottom-up LP→ACC and top-down ACC→LP neurons. We find that LP→ACC neurons receive inputs from widespread cortical regions, including primary and higher order sensory and motor cortical areas. LP→ACC neurons also receive extensive subcortical inputs, particularly from the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Sensory inputs to ACC→LP neurons largely arise from visual cortical areas. In addition, ACC→LP neurons integrate cross-hemispheric prefrontal cortex inputs as well as inputs from higher order medial cortex. Our brain-wide anatomical mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP-ACC pathways provides a roadmap for understanding how LP and ACC communicate different sources of information to mediate attentional control and visuomotor functions.</p>

     alt="Estrogen receptors observed at extranuclear neuronal sites and in glia in the nucleus accumbens core and shell of the female rat: Evidence for localization to catecholaminergic and GABAergic neurons"/>
<p>This study used electron microscopy to examine the distribution ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core and shell. These receptors are localized, almost exclusively, to extranuclear sites in the NAc. They are observed in all neuronal profiles and in glia, but are most prevalent in presynaptic profiles. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic neurons, and a larger proportion are localized to GABAergic neurons. These results provide a mechanism for the rapid effects of estrogens on dopaminergic transmission in the NAc.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens affect dopamine-dependent diseases/behavior and have rapid effects on dopamine release and receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Low levels of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ are seen in the NAc, which cannot account for the rapid effects of estrogens in this region. G-protein coupled ER 1 (GPER1) is observed at low levels in the NAc shell, which also likely does not account for the array of estrogens’ effects in this region. Prior studies demonstrated membrane-associated ERs in the dorsal striatum; these experiments extend those findings to the NAc core and shell. Single- and dual-immunolabeling electron microscopy determined whether ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are at extranuclear sites in the NAc core and shell and whether ERα and GPER1 were localized to catecholaminergic or γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons. All three ERs are observed, almost exclusively, at extranuclear sites in the NAc, and similarly distributed in the core and shell. ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are primarily in axons and axon terminals suggesting that estrogens affect transmission in the NAc via presynaptic mechanisms. About 10% of these receptors are found on glia. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic terminals, suggesting that binding at these ERs alters release of catecholamines, including dopamine. A larger proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to GABAergic dendrites and terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter GABAergic transmission to indirectly affect dopamine transmission in the NAc. Thus, the localization of ERs could account for the rapid effects of estrogen in the NAc.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied changes in the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [Cb] and parvalbumin [Pv]) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of four capuchin monkeys with laser-induced retinal lesions. The lesions were generated with the aid of a neodymium-YAG dual-frequency laser with shots of different intensity and at different survival time in each animal. The expression of these proteins in the layers of the dLGN was evaluated by performing histodensitometry of coronal sections throughout the nucleus. High-power laser shots administered at the border of the optic disc (OD)-injured fibers resulted in large scotomas. These lesions produced a devastating effect on fibers in this passage, resulting in large deafferentation of the dLGN. The time course of plasticity expressed in this nucleus varied with the degree of the retinal lesion. Topographically, corresponding portions of the dLGN were inferred by the extent of the ocular dominance column revealed by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry in flattened preparations of V1. In the region representing the retinal lesion, the expression of GFAP, GAP43, Pv, and Cb increased and decreased in the corresponding dLGN layers shortly after lesion induction and returned to their original values with different time courses. Synaptogenesis (indicated by GAP43 expression) appeared to be increased in all layers, while “cleansing” of the glial-damaged region (indicated by GFAP expression) was markedly greater in the parvocellular layers, followed by the magnocellular layers.</p>

                Endophenotypes are heritable and quantifiable traits indexing genetic liability for a disorder. Here, we examined three potential endophenotypes, working memory function, response inhibition and reaction time variability, for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) measured as a dimensional latent trait in a large general population sample derived from the Adolescent Brain and Cognition Developmental study. The genetic risk for ADHD was estimated using polygenic risk scores (PRS) whereas ADHD traits were quantified as a dimensional continuum using Bartlett factor score estimates, derived from Attention Problems items from the Child Behaviour Checklist and Effortful Control items from the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised. The three candidate cognitive endophenotypes were quantified using task-based performance measures. Higher ADHD PRSs were associated with higher ADHD traits, as well as poorer working memory performance and increased reaction time variability. Lower working memory performance, poorer response inhibition, and increased reaction time variability were associated with more pronounced ADHD traits. Working memory and reaction time variability partially statistically mediated the relationship between ADHD PRS and ADHD traits, explaining 14% and 16% of the association, respectively. The mediation effect was specific to the genetic risk for ADHD and did not generalise to genetic risk for four other major psychiatric disorders. Together, these findings provide robust evidence from a large general population sample that working memory and reaction time variability can be considered endophenotypes for ADHD that mediate the relationship between ADHD PRS and ADHD traits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of neonatal brain functional centrality and alterations associated with preterm birth</a></h4>

              
                Formation of the functional connectome in early life underpins future learning and behaviour. However, our understanding of how the functional organisation of brain regions into interconnected hubs (centrality) matures in the early postnatal period is limited, especially in response to factors associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as preterm birth. We characterised voxel-wise functional centrality (weighted degree) in 366 neonates from the Developing Human Connectome Project. We tested the hypothesis that functional centrality matures with age at scan in term-born babies and is disrupted by preterm birth. Finally, we asked whether neonatal functional centrality predicts general neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. We report an age-related increase in functional centrality predominantly within visual regions and decrease within motor and auditory regions in term-born infants. Preterm-born infants scanned at term equivalent age had higher functional centrality predominantly within visual regions and lower measures in motor regions. Functional centrality was not related to outcome at 18 months old. Thus, preterm birth appears to affect functional centrality in regions undergoing substantial development during the perinatal period. Our work raises the question of whether these alterations are adaptive or disruptive, and whether they predict neurodevelopmental characteristics that are more subtle or emerge later in life.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Granule Cells Constitute One of the Major Neuronal Subtypes in the Molecular Layer of the Posterior Cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The migration of neurons from their birthplace to their correct destination is one of the most crucial steps in brain development. Incomplete or incorrect migration yields ectopic neurons, which cause neurologic deficits or are negligible at best. However, the granule cells (GCs) in the cerebellar cortex may challenge this traditional view of ectopic neurons. When animals are born, GCs proliferate near the pia mater and then migrate down to the GC layer located deep in the cerebellar cortex. However, some GC-like cells stay in the molecular layer, a layer between the pia mater and GC layer, even in normal adult animals. These cells were named ectopic GCs nearly 50 years ago, but their abundance and functional properties remain unclear. Here, we have examined GCs in the molecular layer (mGCs) with a specific marker for mature GCs and transgenic mice in which GCs are sparsely labeled with a fluorescent protein. Contrary to the previous assumption that mGCs are a minor neuronal population, we have found that mGCs are as prevalent as stellate or basket cells in the posterior cerebellum. They are produced during a similar period as regular GCs (rGCs), and <I>in vivo</I> time-lapse imaging has revealed that mGCs are stably present in the molecular layer. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings have shown that mGCs discharge action potentials similarly to rGCs. Since axonal inputs differ between the molecular layer and GC layer, mGCs might be incorporated in different micro-circuits from rGCs and have a unique functional role in the cerebellum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Learning from the Physical Consequences of Our Actions Improves Motor Memory</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Actions have consequences. Motor learning involves correcting actions that lead to movement errors and remembering these actions for future behavior. In most laboratory situations, movement errors have no physical consequences and simply indicate the progress of learning. Here, we asked how experiencing a physical consequence when making a movement error affects motor learning. Two groups of participants adapted to a new, prism-induced mapping between visual input and motor output while performing a precision walking task. Importantly, one group experienced an unexpected slip perturbation when making foot-placement errors during adaptation. Because of our innate drive for safety, and the fact that balance is fundamental to movement, we hypothesized that this experience would enhance motor memory. Learning generalized to different walking tasks to a greater extent in the group who experienced the adverse physical consequence. This group also showed faster relearning one week later despite exposure to a competing mapping during initial learning, evidence of greater memory consolidation. The group differences in generalization and consolidation occurred although they both experienced similar magnitude foot-placement errors and adapted at similar rates. Our results suggest the brain considers the potential physical consequences of movement error when learning and that balance-threatening consequences serve to enhance this process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Contributions of Mu-Opioid Receptors on Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons to Analgesia Induced by Various Stress Intensities</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The endogenous opioid system plays a crucial role in stress-induced analgesia. Mu-opioid receptors (MORs), one of the major opioid receptors, are expressed widely in subpopulations of cells throughout the CNS. However, the potential roles of MORs expressed in glutamatergic (MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB>) and -aminobutyric acidergic (MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB>) neurons in stress-induced analgesia remain unclear. By examining tail-flick latencies to noxious radiant heat of male mice, here we investigated the contributions of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> and MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> to behavioral analgesia and activities of neurons projecting from periaqueductal gray (PAG) to rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) induced by a range of time courses of forced swim exposure. The moderate but not transitory or prolonged swim exposure induced a MOR-dependent analgesia, although all of these three stresses enhanced &beta;-endorphin release. Selective deletion of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> but not MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> clearly attenuated analgesia and blocked the enhancement of activities of PAG-RVM neurons induced by moderate swim exposure. Under transitory swim exposure, in contrast, selective deletion of MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> elicited an analgesia behavior via strengthening the activities of PAG-RVM neurons. These results indicate that MOR-dependent endogenous opioid signaling participates in nociceptive modulation in a wide range, not limited to moderate, of stress intensities. Endogenous activation of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> exerts analgesia, whereas MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> produces antianalgesia. More importantly, with an increase of stress intensities, the efficiencies of MORs on nociception shifts from balance between MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> and MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> to biasing toward MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB>-mediated processes. Our results point to the cellular dynamic characteristics of MORs expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in pain modulation under various stress intensities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Functional Gradient of the Fusiform Cortex for Chinese Character Recognition</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visual word recognition has been proposed to have a  functional and spatial organization corresponding to hierarchical language-like word forms in the left fusiform gyrus (FG) during visual word recognition in alphabetic languages. However, it is still unclear whether the similar functional gradients of word-like representation exist during Chinese character recognition. In this study, we adopted univariate activation analysis and representational similarity analysis (RSA) methods to investigate the functional organization in the FG for Chinese character recognition using task fMRI data. Native Chinese readers were visually presented with four types of character-like stimuli (i.e., real characters, pseudo-characters, false characters, and stroke combinations). After analysis, we observed a posterior-to-anterior functional gradient in the left FG corresponding to the degree of likeness of stimuli to character. Additionally, distinct subregions of the left FG harbor different orthographic codes. The middle part of the left FG was involved in abstract orthographic processing, while the anterior part of the left FG was involved in lexical orthographic processing (i.e., mapping orthography onto phonology or semantics). Notably, for the right FG, we did not find similar coding pattern for selectivity to character likeness, indicating the asymmetry of the functional hierarchical organization in favor of the left hemisphere. In conclusion, our findings revealed that the left FG presents a posterior-to-anterior gradient functional processing for Chinese character recognition, which expands our understanding of the psychological, neural, and computational theories of word reading.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynein Is Required for Rab7-Dependent Endosome Maturation, Retrograde Dendritic Transport, and Degradation</a></h4>

              
                <p>In all cell types, endocytosed cargo is transported along a set of endosomal compartments, which are linked maturationally from early endosomes (EEs) via late endosomes (LEs) to lysosomes. Lysosomes are critical for degradation of proteins that enter through endocytic as well as autophagic pathways. Rab7 is the master regulator of early-to-late endosome maturation, motility, and fusion with lysosomes. We previously showed that most degradative lysosomes are localized in the soma and in the first 25 &micro;m of the dendrite and that bulk degradation of dendritic membrane proteins occurs in/near the soma. Dendritic late endosomes therefore move retrogradely in a Rab7-dependent manner for fusion with somatic lysosomes. We now used cultured E18 rat hippocampal neurons of both sexes to determine which microtubule motor is responsible for degradative flux of late endosomes. Based on multiple approaches (inhibiting dynein/dynactin itself or inhibiting dynein recruitment to endosomes by expressing the C-terminus of the Rab7 effector, RILP), we now demonstrate that net retrograde flux of late endosomes in dendrites is supported by dynein. Inhibition of dynein also delays maturation of somatic endosomes, as evidenced by excessive accumulation of Rab7. In addition, degradation of dendritic cargos is inhibited. Our results also suggest that GDP-GTP cycling of Rab7 appears necessary not only for endosomal maturation but also for fusion with lysosomes subsequent to arrival in the soma. In conclusion, Rab7-dependent dynein/dynactin recruitment to dendritic endosomes plays multifaceted roles in dendritic endosome maturation as well as retrograde transport of late endosomes to sustain normal degradative flux.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lysosomes are critical for degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins that enter through endocytosis. Lysosomes are also the endpoint of autophagy and thus responsible for protein and organelle homeostasis. Endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction is linked to neurodegeneration and aging. We identify roles in dendrites for two proteins with links to human diseases, Rab7 and dynein. Our previous work identified a process that requires directional retrograde transport in dendrites, namely, efficient degradation of short-lived membrane proteins. Based on multiple approaches, we demonstrate that Rab7-dependent recruitment of dynein motors supports net retrograde transport to lysosomes and is needed for endosome maturation. Our data also suggest that GDP-GTP cycling of Rab7 is required for fusion with lysosomes and degradation, subsequent to arrival in the soma.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a Developmental Switch in Information Transfer between Whisker S1 and S2 Cortex in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The whiskers of rodents are a key sensory organ that provides critical tactile information for animal navigation and object exploration throughout life. Previous work has explored the developmental sensory-driven activation of the primary sensory cortex processing whisker information (wS1), also called barrel cortex. This body of work has shown that the barrel cortex is already activated by sensory stimuli during the first postnatal week. However, it is currently unknown when over the course of development these stimuli begin being processed by higher-order cortical areas, such as secondary whisker somatosensory area (wS2). Here we investigate the developmental engagement of wS2 by whisker stimuli and the emergence of corticocortical communication from wS1 to wS2. Using <I>in vivo</I> wide-field imaging and multielectrode recordings in control and conditional KO mice of either sex with thalamocortical innervation defects, we find that wS1 and wS2 are able to process bottom-up information coming from the thalamus from birth. We also identify that it is only at the end of the first postnatal week that wS1 begins to provide functional excitation into wS2, switching to more inhibitory actions after the second postnatal week. Therefore, we have uncovered a developmental window when information transfer between wS1 and wS2 reaches mature function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At the end of the first postnatal week, the primary whisker somatosensory area starts providing excitatory input to the secondary whisker somatosensory area 2. This excitatory drive weakens during the second postnatal week and switches to inhibition in the adult.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Stimulation Induces Distinct Forms of Sensitization of On-Off Direction-Selective Ganglion Cell Responses in the Dorsal and Ventral Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experience-dependent modulation of neuronal responses is a key attribute in sensory processing. In the mammalian retina, the On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) is well known for its robust direction selectivity. However, how the On-Off DSGC light responsiveness dynamically adjusts to the changing visual environment is underexplored. Here, we report that On-Off DSGCs tuned to posterior motion direction [i.e. posterior DSGCs (pDSGCs)] in mice of both sexes can be transiently sensitized by prior stimuli. Notably, distinct sensitization patterns are found in dorsal and ventral pDSGCs. Although responses of both dorsal and ventral pDSGCs to dark stimuli (Off responses) are sensitized, only dorsal cells show the sensitization of responses to bright stimuli (On responses). Visual stimulation to the dorsal retina potentiates a sustained excitatory input from Off bipolar cells, leading to tonic depolarization of pDSGCs. Such tonic depolarization propagates from the Off to the On dendritic arbor of the pDSGC to sensitize its On response. We also identified a previously overlooked feature of DSGC dendritic architecture that can support dendritic integration between On and Off dendritic layers bypassing the soma. By contrast, ventral pDSGCs lack a sensitized tonic depolarization and thus do not exhibit sensitization of their On responses. Our results highlight a topographic difference in Off bipolar cell inputs underlying divergent sensitization patterns of dorsal and ventral pDSGCs. Moreover, substantial crossovers between dendritic layers of On-Off DSGCs suggest an interactive dendritic algorithm for processing On and Off signals before they reach the soma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual neuronal responses are dynamically influenced by the prior visual experience. This form of plasticity reflects the efficient coding of the naturalistic environment by the visual system. We found that a class of retinal output neurons, On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells, transiently increase their responsiveness after visual stimulation. Cells located in dorsal and ventral retinas exhibit distinct sensitization patterns because of different adaptive properties of Off bipolar cell signaling. A previously overlooked dendritic morphologic feature of the On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell is implicated in the cross talk between On and Off pathways during sensitization. Together, these findings uncover a topographic difference in the adaptive encoding of upper and lower visual fields and the underlying neural mechanism in the dorsal and ventral retinas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Biophysical and Architectural Mechanisms of Subthalamic Theta under Response Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cortico-basal ganglia circuit is needed to suppress prepotent actions and to facilitate controlled behavior. Under conditions of response conflict, the frontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN) exhibit increased spiking and theta band power, which are linked to adaptive regulation of behavioral output. The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these neural signatures of impulse control remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal (STN-globus pallidus externus) network and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence, and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN "conflict detector" units because of an NMDA-dependent supralinear response. Our results provide insights into the biophysical principles and architectural constraints that give rise to STN dynamics during response conflict, and how their disruption can lead to impulsivity and compulsivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subthalamic nucleus exhibits theta band power modulation related to cognitive control over motor actions during conditions of response conflict. However, the mechanisms of such dynamics are not understood. Here we developed a novel biophysically detailed and data-constrained large-scale model of the subthalamopallidal network, and examined the impacts of cellular and network architectural properties that give rise to theta dynamics. Our investigations implicate an important role for NMDA receptors and cortico-subthalamic nucleus topographical connectivities in theta power modulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in the Activity of Basolateral Amygdalar Neurons That Project to the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis and Their Role in Anticipatory Anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal fear and anxiety can manifest as psychiatric disorders. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in sustained responding to, or anticipation of, an aversive event which can be expressed as anticipatory anxiety. The BLA is also active during anticipatory anxiety and sends projections to the BNST. However, little is known about the role for BLA neurons that project to BNST (BLA-BNST) in anticipatory anxiety in rodents. To address this, we tested whether chemogenetic inactivation of the BLA-BNST pathway attenuates sustained conditioned responses produced by anticipation of an aversive stimulus. For comparison, we also assessed BLA-BNST inactivation during social interaction, which is sensitive to unlearned anxiety. We found that BLA-BNST inactivation reduced conditioned sustained freezing and increased social behaviors, but surprisingly, only in males. To determine whether sex differences in BLA-BNST neuronal activity contribute to the differences in behavior, we used <I>in vivo</I> and <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiological approaches. In males, BLA-BNST projection neurons were more active and excitable, which coincided with a smaller after-hyperpolarization current (<I>I</I><SUB>AHP</SUB>) compared with other BLA neurons; whereas in females, BLA-BNST neurons were less excitable and had larger <I>I</I><SUB>AHP</SUB> compared with other BLA neurons. These findings demonstrate that activity of BLA-BNST neurons mediates conditioned anticipatory anxiety-like behavior in males. The lack of a role of BLA-BNST in females in this behavior, possibly because of low excitability of these neurons, also highlights the need for caution when generalizing the role of specific neurocircuits in fear and anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anxiety disorders disproportionately affect women. This hints toward sex differences within anxiety neurocircuitry, yet most of our understanding is derived from male rodents. Furthermore, debilitating anticipation of adverse events is among the most severe anxiety symptoms, but little is known about anticipatory anxiety neurocircuitry. Here we demonstrated that BLA-BNST activity is required for anticipatory anxiety to a prolonged aversive cue, but only in males. Moreover, BLA-BNST neurons are hypoactive and less excitable in females. These results uncover BLA-BNST as a key component of anticipatory anxiety circuitry, and cellular differences may explain the sex-dependent role of this circuit. Uncovering this disparity provides evidence that the assumed basic circuitry of an anxiety behavior might not readily transpose from males to females.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Aged Rats Exhibit Altered Behavior-Induced Oscillatory Activity, Place Cell Firing Rates, and Spatial Information Content in the CA1 Region of the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal gamma and theta oscillations are associated with mnemonic and navigational processes and adapt to changes in the behavioral state of an animal to optimize spatial information processing. It has been shown that locomotor activity modulates gamma and theta frequencies in rats, although how age alters this modulation has not been well studied. Here, we examine gamma and theta local-field potential and place cell activity in the hippocampus CA1 region of young and old male rats as they performed a spatial eye-blink conditioning task across 31 d. Although mean gamma frequency was similar in both groups, gamma frequency increased with running speed at a slower rate in old animals. By contrast, theta frequencies scaled with speed similarly in both groups but were lower across speeds in old animals. Although these frequencies scaled equally well with deceleration and speed, acceleration was less correlated with gamma frequency in both age groups. Additionally, spike phase-locking to gamma, but not theta, was greater in older animals. Finally, aged rats had reduced within-field firing rates but greater spatial information per spike within the field. These data support a strong relationship between locomotor behavior and local-field potential activity and suggest that age significantly affects this relationship. Furthermore, observed changes in CA1 place cell firing rates and information content lend support to the hypothesis that age may result in more general and context-invariant hippocampal representations over more detailed information. These results may explain the observation that older adults tend to recall the gist of an experience rather than the details.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal oscillations and place cell activity are sensitive to sensorimotor input generated from active locomotion, yet studies of aged hippocampal function often do not account for this. By considering locomotion and spatial location, we identify novel age-associated differences in the scaling of oscillatory activity with speed, spike-field coherence, spatial information content, and within-field firing rates of CA1 place cells. These results indicate that age has an impact on the relationship between locomotion and hippocampal oscillatory activity, perhaps indicative of alterations to afferent input. These data also support the hypothesis that aged hippocampal place cells, compared with young, may more often represent more general spatial information. If true, these results may help explain why older humans tend to recall less specific and more gist-like information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human Spindle Variability</a></h4>

              
                <p>In humans, sleep spindles are 10- to 16-Hz oscillations lasting approximately 0.5&ndash;2 s. Spindles, along with cortical slow oscillations, may facilitate memory consolidation by enabling synaptic plasticity. Early recordings of spindles at the scalp found anterior channels had overall slower frequency than central-posterior channels. This robust, topographical finding led to dichotomizing spindles as "slow" versus "fast," modeled as two distinct spindle generators in frontal versus posterior cortex. Using a large dataset of intracranial stereoelectroencephalographic (sEEG) recordings from 20 patients (13 female, 7 male) and 365 bipolar recordings, we show that the difference in spindle frequency between frontal and parietal channels is comparable to the variability in spindle frequency within the course of individual spindles, across different spindles recorded by a given site, and across sites within a given region. Thus, fast and slow spindles only capture average differences that obscure a much larger underlying overlap in frequency. Furthermore, differences in mean frequency are only one of several ways that spindles differ. For example, compared with parietal, frontal spindles are smaller, tend to occur after parietal when both are engaged, and show a larger decrease in frequency within-spindles. However, frontal and parietal spindles are similar in being longer, less variable, and more widespread than occipital, temporal, and Rolandic spindles. These characteristics are accentuated in spindles which are highly phase-locked to posterior hippocampal spindles. We propose that rather than a strict parietal-fast/frontal-slow dichotomy, spindles differ continuously and quasi-independently in multiple dimensions, with variability due about equally to within-spindle, within-region, and between-region factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep spindles are 10- to 16-Hz neural oscillations generated by cortico-thalamic circuits that promote memory consolidation. Spindles are often dichotomized into slow-anterior and fast-posterior categories for cognitive and clinical studies. Here, we show that the anterior-posterior difference in spindle frequency is comparable to that observed between different cycles of individual spindles, between spindles from a given site, or from different sites within a region. Further, we show that spindles vary on other dimensions such as duration, amplitude, spread, primacy and consistency, and that these multiple dimensions vary continuously and largely independently across cortical regions. These findings suggest that multiple continuous variables rather than a strict frequency dichotomy may be more useful biomarkers for memory consolidation or psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">In Vivo Multi-Day Calcium Imaging of CA1 Hippocampus in Freely Moving Rats Reveals a High Preponderance of Place Cells with Consistent Place Fields</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calcium imaging using GCaMP indicators and miniature microscopes has been used to image cellular populations during long timescales and in different task phases, as well as to determine neuronal circuit topology and organization. Because the hippocampus (HPC) is essential for tasks of memory, spatial navigation, and learning, calcium imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can provide new insight on cell changes over time during these tasks. All reported HPC <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging experiments have been done in mouse. However, rats have many behavioral and physiological experimental advantages over mice. In this paper, we present the first (to our knowledge) <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging from CA1 HPC in freely moving male rats. Using the UCLA Miniscope, we demonstrate that, in rat, hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks. We show that calcium events in these cells are highly correlated with periods of movement, with few calcium events occurring during periods without movement. We additionally show that an extremely large percent of cells recorded during a navigational task are place cells (77.3 &plusmn; 5.0%, surpassing the percent seen during mouse calcium imaging), and that these cells enable accurate decoding of animal position and can be held over days with consistent place fields in a consistent spatial map. A detailed protocol is included, and implications of these advancements on <I>in vivo</I> imaging and place field literature are discussed.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>In vivo</I> calcium imaging in freely moving animals allows the visualization of cellular activity across days. In this paper, we present the first <I>in vivo</I> Ca2+ recording from CA1 hippocampus (HPC) in freely moving rats. We demonstrate that hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks, and that calcium activity corresponds to periods of movement. We show that a high percentage (77.3 &plusmn; 5.0%) of imaged cells are place cells, and that these place cells enable accurate decoding and can be held stably over days with little change in field location. Because the HPC is essential for many tasks involving memory, navigation, and learning, imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can shed new insight on cellular activity changes and organization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for the Normalization Effects of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder on Functional Connectivity in Neonates with Prenatal Opioid Exposure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altered functional connectivity has been reported in infants with prenatal exposure to opioids, which significantly interrupts and influences endogenous neurotransmitter/receptor signaling during fetal programming. Better birth outcomes and long-term developmental outcomes are associated with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during pregnancy, but the neural mechanisms underlying these benefits are largely unknown. We aimed to characterize effects of prenatal opioid/other drug exposure (PODE) and the neural basis for the reported beneficial effects of MOUD by examining neonatal brain functional organization. A cohort of 109 human newborns, 42 PODE, 39 with prenatal exposure to drugs excluding opioids (PDE), 28 drug-free controls (males and females) underwent resting-state fMRI at 2 weeks of age. To examine neural effects of MOUD, PODE infants were separated into subgroups based on whether mothers received MOUD (<I>n</I> = 31) or no treatment (<I>n</I> = 11). A novel heatmap analysis was designed to characterize PODE-associated functional connectivity alterations and MOUD-related effects, and permutation testing identified regions of interest with significant effects. PODE neonates showed alterations beyond those associated with PDE, particularly in reward-related frontal-sensory connectivity. MOUD was associated with a significant reduction of PODE-related alterations in key regions of endogenous opioid pathways including limbic and frontal connections. However, significant residual effects in limbic and subcortical circuitry were observed. These findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with PODE. Importantly, widespread normalization effects associated with MOUD reveal, for the first time, the potential brain basis of the beneficial effects of MOUD on the developing brain and underscore the importance of this treatment intervention for better developmental outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first study to reveal the potential neural mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects on the neonate brain associated with MOUD during pregnancy. We identified both normalization and residual effects of MOUD on brain functional architecture by directly comparing neonates prenatally exposed to opioids with MOUD and those exposed to opioids but without MOUD. Our findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with prenatal opioid exposure and demonstrate that although significant residual effects remain in reward circuitry, MOUD confers significant normalization effects on functional connectivity of regions associated with socioemotional development and reward processing. Together, our results highlight the importance of MOUD intervention for better neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Uncertainty Alternates Top-down and Bottom-up Fronto-Temporal Network Signaling during Response Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response inhibition is a primary executive control function that allows the withholding of inappropriate responses, and requires appropriate perception of the external environment to achieve a behavioral goal. It remains unclear, however, how response inhibition is achieved when goal-relevant information involves perceptual uncertainty. Twenty-six human participants of both sexes performed a go/no-go task where visually presented random-dot motion stimuli involved perceptual uncertainties. The right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) was involved in response inhibition, and the middle temporal (MT) region showed greater activity when dot motions involved less uncertainty. A neocortical temporal region in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) specifically showed greater activity during response inhibition in more perceptually certain trials. In this STS region, activity was greater when response inhibition was successful than when it failed. Directional effective connectivity analysis revealed that, in more coherent trials, the MT and STS regions showed enhanced connectivity to the rIFC, whereas in less coherent trials, the signal direction was reversed. These results suggest that a reversible fronto-temporal functional network guides response inhibition and perceptual decision-making under perceptual uncertainty, and in this network, perceptual information in the MT is converted to control information in the rIFC via STS, enabling achievement of response inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Response inhibition refers to withholding inappropriate behavior and is important for achieving goals. Often, however, decision must be made based on limited environmental evidence. We showed that successful response inhibition is guided by a neocortical temporal region that plays a hub role in converting perceived information coded in a posterior temporal region to control information coded in the PFC. Interestingly, when a perceived stimulus becomes more uncertain, the PFC supplements stimulus encoding in the temporal regions. Our results highlight fronto-temporal mechanisms of response inhibition in which conversion of stimulus-control information is regulated based on the uncertainty of environmental evidence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sound Localization of World and Head-Centered Space in Ferrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>The location of sounds can be described in multiple coordinate systems that are defined relative to ourselves, or the world around us. Evidence from neural recordings in animals point toward the existence of both head-centered and world-centered representations of sound location in the brain; however, it is unclear whether such neural representations have perceptual correlates in the sound localization abilities of nonhuman listeners. Here, we establish novel behavioral tests to determine the coordinate systems in which ferrets can localize sounds. We found that ferrets could learn to discriminate between sound locations that were fixed in either world-centered or head-centered space, across wide variations in sound location in the alternative coordinate system. Using probe sounds to assess broader generalization of spatial hearing, we demonstrated that in both head and world-centered tasks, animals used continuous maps of auditory space to guide behavior. Single trial responses of individual animals were sufficiently informative that we could then model sound localization using speaker position in specific coordinate systems and accurately predict ferrets' actions in held-out data. Our results demonstrate that ferrets, an animal model in which neurons are known to be tuned to sound location in egocentric and allocentric reference frames, can also localize sounds in multiple head and world-centered spaces.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans can describe the location of sounds either relative to themselves, or in the world, independent of their momentary position. These different spaces are also represented in the activity of neurons in animals, but it is not clear whether nonhuman listeners also perceive both head and world-centered sound location. Here, we designed behavioral tasks in which ferrets discriminated between sounds using their position in the world, or relative to the head. Subjects learnt to solve both problems and generalized sound location in each space when presented with infrequent probe sounds. These findings reveal a perceptual correlate of neural sensitivity previously observed in the ferret brain and establish that, like humans, ferrets can access an auditory map of their local environment.</p>

                <p>Understanding the pathogenesis of nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration is critical for developing mechanism-based treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). In the nigral dopaminergic neurons of postmortem human PD brains, we found that CREB, a well-recognized pro-survival transcription factor in neurons, was inactivated by dephosphorylation at Ser133. CREB dephosphorylation correlated with decreased expression of NURR1, one of its target genes crucial for dopaminergic neuron survival, confirming that CREB function was impaired in nigral dopaminergic neurons in PD. An MPTP mouse model was used to further elucidate the mechanism underlying CREB dephosphorylation. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates CREB, was constitutively associated with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC1 promotes CREB Ser133 dephosphorylation via a stable interaction with PP1. We found that CREB interacted with the HDAC1/PP1 complex during dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Importantly, increased CREB/HDAC1 interaction occurred in the nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patients as demonstrated using a proximity ligation assay. Disrupting CREB/HDAC1 interaction via either overexpression of GAL4 M1, a CREB mutant, or administration of trichostatin A, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, restored the expression levels of phospho-CREB (Ser133) and NURR1, and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP-treated mouse brain. Collectively, our results demonstrated that HDAC1/PP1-mediated CREB inactivation contributed to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Disruption of CREB/HDAC1 interaction has the potential to be a new approach for PD therapy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder attributed to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Understanding the pathogenesis of nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration is critical for developing mechanism-based treatments for PD. We found in nigral dopaminergic neurons of postmortem human PD brains that CREB, a well-recognized pro-survival transcription factor in neurons, was inactivated by dephosphorylation at Ser133. HDAC1, constitutively associated with PP1, interacted with CREB to mediate its dephosphorylation during dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Disrupting CREB/HDAC1 interaction restored CREB activity and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP mouse brains. This work suggests that disruption of the CREB/HDAC1 interaction to restore CREB activity may be a potential therapeutic approach in PD.</p>

                <p>by Hillary A. Raab, Careen Foord, Romain Ligneul, Catherine A. Hartley</p>

Accurate assessment of environmental controllability enables individuals to adaptively adjust their behavior—exploiting rewards when desirable outcomes are contingent upon their actions and minimizing costly deliberation when their actions are inconsequential. However, it remains unclear how estimation of environmental controllability changes from childhood to adulthood. Ninety participants (ages 8–25) completed a task that covertly alternated between controllable and uncontrollable conditions, requiring them to explore different actions to discover the current degree of environmental controllability. We found that while children were able to distinguish controllable and uncontrollable conditions, accuracy of controllability assessments improved with age. Computational modeling revealed that whereas younger participants’ controllability assessments relied on evidence gleaned through random exploration, older participants more effectively recruited their task structure knowledge to make highly informative interventions. Age-related improvements in working memory mediated this qualitative shift toward increased use of an inferential strategy. Collectively, these findings reveal an age-related shift in the cognitive processes engaged to assess environmental controllability. Improved detection of environmental controllability may foster increasingly adaptive behavior over development by revealing when actions can be leveraged for one’s benefit.

                <p>by Alaina Shumate, Brandon Wong, Geo Pertea, Mihaela Pertea</p>

Short-read RNA sequencing and long-read RNA sequencing each have their strengths and weaknesses for transcriptome assembly. While short reads are highly accurate, they are rarely able to span multiple exons. Long-read technology can capture full-length transcripts, but its relatively high error rate often leads to mis-identified splice sites. Here we present a new release of StringTie that performs hybrid-read assembly. By taking advantage of the strengths of both long and short reads, hybrid-read assembly with StringTie is more accurate than long-read only or short-read only assembly, and on some datasets it can more than double the number of correctly assembled transcripts, while obtaining substantially higher precision than the long-read data assembly alone. Here we demonstrate the improved accuracy on simulated data and real data from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Mus musculus</i>, and human. We also show that hybrid-read assembly is more accurate than correcting long reads prior to assembly while also being substantially faster. StringTie is freely available as open source software at https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatial modelling for population replacement of mosquito vectors at continental scale</a></h4>

Malaria is one of the deadliest vector-borne diseases in the world. Researchers are developing new genetic and conventional vector control strategies to attempt to limit its burden. Novel control strategies require detailed safety assessment to ensure responsible and successful deployments. <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu stricto (s.s.) and <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i>, two closely related subspecies within the species complex <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu lato (s.l.), are among the dominant malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. These two subspecies readily hybridise and compete in the wild and are also known to have distinct niches, each with spatially and temporally varying carrying capacities driven by precipitation and land use factors.
We model the spread and persistence of a population-modifying gene drive system in these subspecies across sub-Saharan Africa by simulating introductions of genetically modified mosquitoes across the African mainland and its offshore islands. We explore transmission of the gene drive between the two subspecies that arise from different hybridisation mechanisms, the effects of both local dispersal and potential wind-aided migration to the spread, and the development of resistance to the gene drive. Given the best current available knowledge on the subspecies’ life histories, we find that an introduced gene drive system with typical characteristics can plausibly spread from even distant offshore islands to the African mainland with the aid of wind-driven migration, with resistance beginning to take over within a decade. Our model accounts for regional to continental scale mechanisms, and demonstrates a range of realistic dynamics including the effect of prevailing wind on spread and spatio-temporally varying carrying capacities for subspecies. As a result, it is well-placed to answer future questions relating to mosquito gene drives as important life history parameters become better understood.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Why does viral RNA sometimes persist after recovery from acute infections?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Diane E. Griffin</p>

DNA viruses often persist in the body of their host, becoming latent and recurring many months or years later. By contrast, most RNA viruses cause acute infections that are cleared from the host as they lack the mechanisms to persist. However, it is becoming clear that viral RNA can persist after clinical recovery and elimination of detectable infectious virus. This persistence can either be asymptomatic or associated with late progressive disease or nonspecific lingering symptoms, such as may be the case following infection with Ebola or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Why does viral RNA sometimes persist after recovery from an acute infection? Where does the RNA come from? And what are the consequences?

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RSK1 promotes mammalian axon regeneration by inducing the synthesis of regeneration-related proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susu Mao, Yuanyuan Chen, Wei Feng, Songlin Zhou, Chunyi Jiang, Junjie Zhang, Xiaohong Liu, Tianmei Qian, Kai Liu, Yaxian Wang, Chun Yao, Xiaosong Gu, Bin Yu</p>

In contrast to the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the neurons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) can regenerate their axons. However, the underlying mechanism dictating the regeneration program after PNS injuries remains poorly understood. Combining chemical inhibitor screening with gain- and loss-of-function analyses, we identified p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) as a crucial regulator of axon regeneration in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after sciatic nerve injury (SNI). Mechanistically, RSK1 was found to preferentially regulate the synthesis of regeneration-related proteins using ribosomal profiling. Interestingly, RSK1 expression was up-regulated in injured DRG neurons, but not retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Additionally, RSK1 overexpression enhanced phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion-induced axon regeneration in RGCs in the adult CNS. Our findings reveal a critical mechanism in inducing protein synthesis that promotes axon regeneration and further suggest RSK1 as a possible therapeutic target for neuronal injury repair.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Central retinal artery occlusion following sildenafil intake [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To report a case of central retinal artery occlusion associated with sildenafil intake and briefly discuss its causative pathogenesis. Methods: A 50-year-old man with no premorbidities presented with symptoms of sudden severe visual field constriction in the left eye (LE). Best-corrected visual acuity in the LE was 20/25. Fundus examination and fluorescein angiography of the LE were suggestive of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) with cilioretinal artery sparing. Further investigation revealed that 100 mg of sildenafil had been taken for the first time three hours before the onset of symptoms. Results: The patient was treated promptly with intravenous acetazolamide, sublingual isosorbide dinitrate and ocular massage, but without visual recovery. No other associated systemic or local risk factors were found, and the case was classified as a potential complication of sildenafil. Conclusion: Although no direct link could be established, the aim of this report is to highlight the incidence and to consider this issue when evaluating any case of central retinal artery occlusion.

                Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a musculoskeletal disorder that causes pain and increasing loss of function, resulting in reduced proprioceptive accuracy and balance. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of balance training on pain and functional outcomes in knee OA. Methods: “PubMed”, “Scopus”, “Web of Science”, “Cochrane”, and “Physiotherapy Evidence Database” were searched for studies conducted between January 2000 and December 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effectiveness of balance training in knee OA, as well as its effects on pain and functional outcome measures, were included. Conference abstracts, case reports, observational studies, and clinical commentaries were not included. Meta-analysis was conducted for the common outcomes, i.e., Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The Timed Up and Go (TUG), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). The PEDro scale was used to determine the quality of the included studies. Results: This review includes 22 RCTs of which 17 articles were included for meta-analysis. The included articles had 1456 participants. The meta-analysis showed improvement in the VAS scores in the experimental group compared to the control group [I2 = 92%; mean difference= -0.79; 95% CI= -1.59 to 0.01; p<0.05] and for the WOMAC scores the heterogeneity (I2) was 81% with a mean difference of -0.02 [95% CI= -0.44 to 0.40; p<0.0001]. The TUG score was analyzed, the I2 was 95% with a mean difference of -1.71 [95% CI= -3.09 to -0.33; p<0.0001] for the intervention against the control group. Conclusions: Balance training significantly reduced knee pain and improved functional outcomes measured with TUG. However, there was no difference observed in WOMAC. Although due to the heterogeneity of the included articles the treatment impact may be overestimated. Registration: The current systematic review was registered in PROSPERO on 7th October 2021 (registration number CRD42021276674).

                Background: To assess the relationship between dermatoglyphic patterns and various growth patterns of the mandible. Methods: Patients with Class I Skeletal relation were selected after clinical diagnosis followed by digitally tracing the cephalogram. The patients were subdivided into three groups of mandibular divergence patterns ie Average, Horizontal and Vertical. 90 samples ie 30 in each group were selected for the study. The fingerprints of all the selected subjects were then extracted digitally and analysed for the most dominant pattern in each hand. Results: For the left hand, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) association between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern when Horizontal growers were compared to Average and Vertical Growers. For the right hand, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) association between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern when Horizontal growers were compared to Average Growers. A significant association (P<0.05) between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern was also found when average growers were compared to vertical growers. Conclusions: Horizontal growers had 80% frequency of appearance of whorls in their left hand and 67% in their right hand. Horizontal growers could easily be differentiated from the average and vertical growers because of the dominance of whorl pattern in their hands. Composite and arch pattern were more frequent in vertical growers when compared to horizontal and average growers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bone tissue engineering application on fracture healing with bone defect as assessed through osteocalcin and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) biomarker examination: experimental study on murine models [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Bone is naturally regenerable, with a high ability to repair itself. In massive segmental bone defect, bone cannot be repaired independently. Therefore, it is necessary to give a bone graft to promote the healing process. To date, autografts are the gold standard for bone grafts. However, some of the reported complications reported have led to auto-bone transplants being often disregarded. Both autografts or allografts also have some issues. Therefore, in an effort to develop alternative treatments for correcting bone defects and their consequences, bone tissue engineering (BTE) has gained popularity and is nowadays being researched as a potential alternative in bone defect management. There are three fundamental components in BTE combined: biomaterials (scaffolds), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and growth factors. The combination of these components is believed to help the healing process of bone defects.  Methods: This work was an animal study involving twenty Wistar strain Rattus norvegicus. They were divided into five groups: negative group (normal rats), positive group (rats with the bone defect without intervention), K-P1 group (rats with bone defect given SVF and porous carbonated- hydroxyapatite (HA)application), K-P2 group (rats with bone defect given SVF and nanocrystalline-HA application) and K-P3 (rats with bone defect giving SVF a bovine-HA application). After 30 days, the rats were sacrificed, the biomarkers osteocalcin and BMP-2 were evaluated. Biomarkers were quantified using ELISA. Results: Both osteocalcin and BMP-2 biomarker expressions were higher in intervention group (with SVF and scaffolds application) compared to the positive group (with no SVF and scaffolds treatment). The combination of SVF and bovine HA was reported significantly to have the highest osteocalcin and BMP levels when compared with other groups Conclusions: A combined application of SVF and scaffolds could aid the healing process in murine models with bone defect, marked by increasing levels of osteocalcin and BMP-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Presenteeism and associated factors among railway train drivers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Presenteeism is an emerging work-related health problem among train drivers. It is more serious than absenteeism, as it accounts for higher productivity losses over the long term and may increase the risk of occupational accidents. Train drivers have high rates of mental and physical health conditions that may put them at high risk of presenteeism. Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 train drivers working in Mansoura railway station and 100 administrative employees working in the Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura university as a comparison group to estimate the prevalence of presenteeism and its associated factors among train drivers working in Mansoura railway station, Egypt. A questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic, occupational and medical data. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used to measure non-specific psychological distress. The Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS-6) was used to assess productivity loss related to sickness presenteeism. Results: The prevalence of presenteeism was significantly higher among train drivers (76%) compared to the comparison group (31%). All participants (100%) with psychological distress reported presenteeism. Being a train driver (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=5.4) and having hypertension (AOR=4.03) are independent predictors for presenteeism. Conclusions: The prevalence of presenteeism and its associated risk factors were significantly higher among train drivers than the comparison group. There is an urgent need for the railway industry to understand the factors that may contribute to presenteeism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of technology capability in supporting firm performance in the high-tech manufacturing industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Technology has influenced many aspects of life, particularly in the digital era of today. Companies that are closely related to technology are also challenged to keep innovating to stay competitive in the market, especially the higher their technology intensity their products and services are related. This study focuses on examining the technology capability of high-tech manufacturing firms in Indonesia. According to the International Standard Industrial Classification, high-tech manufacturing firms are firms that manufacture computer, electronic, and optical products. The aim of this study is to identify the role of technology capability that influences a firm’s performance and identify whether the value chain mediates the relationship between technology capability to firm performance. Methods: The method used in this study is descriptive quantitative analysis, using multi-linear regression and path analysis to test the hypothesis. The data used in this study is secondary data that came from Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), Indonesia's official statistics agency. The survey data used in this study comes from Indonesia's annual survey of manufacturing firms in 2017. Result: Technology capability and value chain have significant effects on firm performance. Nonetheless, the value chain as an intervening variable has no significant effect on firm performance. In other words, with or without technology utilization of the value chain, both produce similar results. Conclusion: Firms in the high-tech manufacturing industry are expected to have sufficient knowledge and capability in utilizing their technology resources to ensure the firm's long-term viability and to enable them to continuously create innovations, which leads to improved firm performance and thus to their competitive market survival. By identifying the effect of the value chain as an intervening variable and identifying the difference between direct and indirect effects, this study also adds to previous research on the effects of technology capability and value chain on firm performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Thermal comfort optimization through bioclimatic design in Mediterranean cities [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bioclimatic design is an approach based on local climate which improves thermal qualities and indoor comfort. Buildings follow this process to minimize negative effects on the environment. However, this approach is still not suitable in developed countries. This study aims to investigate Mediterranean local bioclimatic strategies’ impact on thermal comfort efficiency in housing, by examining architectural elements and treatments. Methods: We adopted a descriptive, analytical, and comparative methodology, complemented with a software simulation, within a qualitative and quantitative approach. Investigation and methodological tools were based on technical information including plans, elevations, photos, and documentation. The approach consisted of multiple stages: a literature review interpreting the concept of bioclimatic design, as well as thermal comfort variables and common Mediterranean building features. Moreover, the paper showcases three examples of successful Mediterranean passive houses. Furthermore, the paper presents a case- studyhouse in Alex West, Alexandria, designed in the Mediterranean Revival style. Results: The results showed that the most influencing building features on thermal comfort were the low-pitched roofs and the top chimney, which achieved 12.6% and 5% improvement in the summer and 13% and 6.8% in winter, respectively. The pergola and porch elements barely had an effect when placed on the northern façade. However, on the southern façade, a positive contribution in the summer by 1.4% and 3.4% respectively were reported, but a slight negative impact in winter by 0.5% and 2% respectively. Conclusions:  We examined the impact of common Mediterranean building features , and compared thermal comfort results between case-study houses. Features focusing on passive design for cooling rather than heating, allowing wind flow for maximized natural ventilation, using ventilated pitched roof spaces, using sun shading elements in the proper facades and angles, help passive thermal regulation. The study proposes recommendations for optimizing thermal comfort in residential buildings in Alexandria, Egypt.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Whole genome sequencing data of Candida krusei, pathogen causing Candidaemia, from Department of Parasitology Culture Collection, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Candida krusei is a Candida non-albicans species with a high prevalence, which causes candidaemia. Current treatment guidelines include fluconazole as a primary therapeutic option for the treatment of these infections; however, it is only a fungistatic against Candida spp., and both inherent and acquired resistance to fluconazole have been reported. C. krusei species is also reported as the only Candida sp. which has an intrinsic resistance factor to fluconazole. Therefore, in dealing with antifungal resistance, it is necessary to develop new antifungal agents that are efficient in the treatment of fungal infections, especially those caused by C. krusei. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genome of clinical C. krusei isolates and correlate the resistant phenotypes with mutations in resistance genes. A total of 16 samples of C. krusei from clinical samples from hospitals in Jakarta were used in the experiment. All colonies were extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. The library was prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep Kit. The sequencing process was carried out on the Illumina MiSeq Platform using a 2x301 paired-end configuration. FASTQ raw files are available under the BioProject Accession Number PRJNA819536 and Sequence Read Archive Accession Numbers SRR18739949 and SRR18739964.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between the body mass index, waist circumference, and body fat percentage with erosive esophagitis in adults with obesity after sleeve gastrectomy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: High anthropometric indexes before sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are associated with an increased risk of erosive esophagitis (EE) in bariatric surgery candidates. Reasons that explain how these indexes influence the development of esophageal pathology after surgery remains unclear. Objectives: To assess the association between the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and body fat percentage (BFP) with the development of EE in adults with obesity three months after SG. Setting: Clínica Avendaño, Lima, Peru. Methods: Retrospective cohort using a database including adults with obesity who underwent SG during 2017-2020. All the patients included had an endoscopy before and after the surgery. Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared according to BMI, WC and BFP, as well as by the development of de novo esophagitis. The association was evaluated by crude and adjusted generalized linear models with the log-Poisson family. Results: From a total of 106 patients, 23 (21.7%) developed EE. We did not find significant differences in sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with de novo EE compared to those who did not develop EE. After adjustment, BMI (aRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.18-1.40), BFP (aRR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.15-1.19) and WC (aRR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.69-1.16) were not associated with the development of EE three months post SG. Conclusions: We found no association between preoperative anthropometric indexes and the development of de novo EE; therefore, morbid obesity should not be a criterion to exclude the patients to undergo SG as primary surgery because of the risk of developing EE.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD), as a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, particularly affects the elderly population, and is clinically identified by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Pathophysiologically, PD is characterized by an early loss of dopaminergic neurons in the <i>Substantia nigra pars compacta</i>, accompanied by the extensive aggregation of alpha-synuclein (<i>α-Syn</i>) in the form of Lewy bodies. The onset of PD has been reported to be influenced by multiple biological molecules. In this context, circular RNAs (circRNAs), as tissue-specific noncoding RNAs with closed structures, have been recently demonstrated to involve in a set of PD's pathogenic processes. These RNA molecules can either up- or downregulate the expression of <i>α-Syn</i>, as well as moderating its accumulation through different regulatory mechanisms, in which targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) is considered the most common pathway. Since circRNAs have prominent structural and biological characteristics, they could also be considered as promising candidates for PD diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, PD has become a global health concern, and a large number of its pathogenic processes are still unclear; thus, it is crucial to elucidate the ambiguous aspects of PD pathophysiology to improve the efficiency of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In line with this fact, the current review aims to highlight the interplay between circRNAs and PD pathogenesis, and then discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of circRNAs in PD progression. This study will thus be the first of its kind reviewing the relationship between circRNAs and PD.</p>

To better understand these processes, researchers need tools to analyse neurotransmitter signalling in the organs of living animals. We have invented NeuroString, a soft sensor for monoamine neurotransmitters, which can be fitted to the brain or gut of animals without disturbing the organ’s natural functions.

                The K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 subtypes of voltage-gated potassium channels play a role in important physiological processes such as sound amplification in the cochlea and adjusting vascular smooth muscle tone. Therefore, the mechanisms that regulate K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel function are of interest. Here, we study the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on human K<sub>V</sub>7.4 and K<sub>V</sub>7.5 channels expressed in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. We report that PUFAs facilitate activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 by shifting the V<sub>50</sub> of the conductance <i>versus</i> voltage (G(V)) curve toward more negative voltages. This response depends on the head group charge, as an uncharged PUFA analogue has no effect and a positively charged PUFA analogue induces positive V<sub>50</sub> shifts. In contrast, PUFAs inhibit activation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 by shifting V<sub>50</sub> toward more positive voltages. No effect on V<sub>50</sub> of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 is observed by an uncharged or a positively charged PUFA analogue. Thus, the hK<sub>V</sub>7.5 channel’s response to PUFAs is analogous to the one previously observed in hK<sub>V</sub>7.1–7.3 channels, whereas the hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 channel response is opposite, revealing subtype-specific responses to PUFAs. We identify a unique inner PUFA interaction site in the voltage-sensing domain of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 underlying the PUFA response, revealing an unconventional mechanism of modulation of hK<sub>V</sub>7.4 by PUFAs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinctive mechanisms of epilepsy-causing mutants discovered by measuring S4 movement in KCNQ2 channels</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal KCNQ channels mediate the M-current, a key regulator of membrane excitability in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Mutations in KCNQ2 channels cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic encephalopathies. However, the impact that different mutations have on channel function remains poorly defined, largely because of our limited understanding of the voltage sensing mechanisms that trigger channel gating. Here, we define parameters of voltage sensor movements in wt-KCNQ2 and channels bearing epilepsy-associated mutations using cysteine accessibility and voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF). Cysteine modification reveals that a stretch of 8-9 amino acids in the S4 become exposed upon VSD activation of KCNQ2 channels. VCF shows that the voltage dependence and the time course of S4 movement and channel opening/closing closely correlate. VCF reveals different mechanisms by which different epilepsy-associated mutations affect KCNQ2 channel voltage-dependent gating. This study provides insight into KCNQ2 channel function, which will aid in uncovering the mechanisms underlying channelopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A biophysical threshold for biofilm formation</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria are ubiquitous in our daily lives, either as motile planktonic cells or as immobilized surface-attached biofilms. These different phenotypic states play key roles in agriculture, environment, industry, and medicine; hence, it is critically important to be able to predict the conditions under which bacteria transition from one state to the other. Unfortunately, these transitions depend on a dizzyingly complex array of factors that are determined by the intrinsic properties of the individual cells as well as those of their surrounding environments, and are thus challenging to describe. To address this issue, here, we develop a generally-applicable biophysical model of the interplay between motility-mediated dispersal and biofilm formation under positive quorum sensing control. Using this model, we establish a universal rule predicting how the onset and extent of biofilm formation depend collectively on cell concentration and motility, nutrient diffusion and consumption, chemotactic sensing, and autoinducer production. Our work thus provides a key step toward quantitatively predicting and controlling biofilm formation in diverse and complex settings.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neural mechanism for detecting object motion during self-motion</a></h4>

              
                Detection of objects that move in a scene is a fundamental computation performed by the visual system. This computation is greatly complicated by observer motion, which causes most objects to move across the retinal image. How the visual system detects scene-relative object motion during self-motion is poorly understood. Human behavioral studies suggest that the visual system may identify local conflicts between motion parallax and binocular disparity cues to depth and may use these signals to detect moving objects. We describe a novel mechanism for performing this computation based on neurons in macaque middle temporal (MT) area with incongruent depth tuning for binocular disparity and motion parallax cues. Neurons with incongruent tuning respond selectively to scene-relative object motion, and their responses are predictive of perceptual decisions when animals are trained to detect a moving object during self-motion. This finding establishes a novel functional role for neurons with incongruent tuning for multiple depth cues.

                Cancer stem cells (CSCs) alone can initiate and maintain tumors, but the function of non-cancer stem cells (non-CSCs) that form the tumor bulk remains poorly understood. Proteomic analysis showed a higher abundance of the extracellular matrix small leucine-rich proteoglycan Fibromodulin (FMOD) in the conditioned medium of differentiated glioma cells (DGCs), the equivalent of glioma non-CSCs, compared to that of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). DGCs silenced for FMOD fail to cooperate with co-implanted GSCs to promote tumor growth. FMOD downregulation neither affects GSC growth and differentiation nor DGC growth and reprogramming <i>in vitro</i>. DGC-secreted FMOD promotes angiogenesis by activating Integrin-dependent Notch signaling in endothelial cells. Furthermore, conditional silencing of <i>FMOD</i> in newly generated DGCs <i>in vivo</i> inhibits the growth of GSC-initiated tumors due to poorly developed vasculature and increases mouse survival. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that DGC-secreted FMOD promotes glioma tumor angiogenesis and growth through paracrine signaling in endothelial cells and identifies a DGC-produced protein as a potential therapeutic target in glioma.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Minian an open-source miniscope analysis pipeline</a></h4>

              
                Miniature microscopes have gained considerable traction for <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, extracting calcium signals from raw videos is a computationally complex problem and remains a bottleneck for many researchers utilizing single-photon <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging. Despite the existence of many powerful analysis packages designed to detect and extract calcium dynamics, most have either key parameters that are hard-coded or insufficient step-by-step guidance and validations to help the users choose the best parameters. This makes it difficult to know whether the output is reliable and meets the assumptions necessary for proper analysis. Moreover, large memory demand is often a constraint for setting up these pipelines since it limits the choice of hardware to specialized computers. Given these difficulties, there is a need for a low memory demand, user-friendly tool offering interactive visualizations of how altering parameters at each step of the analysis affects data output. Our open-source analysis pipeline, Minian (Miniscope Analysis), facilitates the transparency and accessibility of single-photon calcium imaging analysis, permitting users with little computational experience to extract the location of cells and their corresponding calcium traces and deconvolved neural activities. Minian contains interactive visualization tools for every step of the analysis, as well as detailed documentation and tips on parameter exploration. Furthermore, Minian has relatively small memory demands and can be run on a laptop, making it available to labs that do not have access to specialized computational hardware. Minian has been validated to reliably and robustly extract calcium events across different brain regions and from different cell types. In practice, Minian provides an open-source calcium imaging analysis pipeline with user-friendly interactive visualizations to explore parameters and validate results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational Identification of Ligand-Receptor Pairs that Drive Human Astrocyte Development</a></h4>

              
                Extrinsic signaling between diverse cell types is crucial to nervous system development. Ligand binding is a key driver of developmental processes, but it remains a significant challenge to disentangle how collections of these signals act cooperatively to affect changes in recipient cells. In the developing human brain, cortical progenitors transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in a stereotyped progression that is influenced by extrinsic ligands. Therefore, we sought to use the wealth of published genomic data in the developing human brain to identify and then test novel ligand combinations that act synergistically to drive gliogenesis. Using computational tools, we identified ligand-receptor pairs that are expressed at appropriate developmental stages, in relevant cell types, and whose activation is predicted to cooperatively stimulate complimentary astrocyte gene signatures. We then tested a group of five neuronally-secreted ligands and validated their synergistic contributions to astrocyte development within both human cortical organoids and primary fetal tissue. We confirm cooperative capabilities of these ligands far greater than their individual capacities and discovered that their combinatorial effects converge on AKT/mTOR signaling to drive transcriptomic and morphological features of astrocyte development. This platform provides a powerful agnostic framework to identify and test how extrinsic signals work in concert to drive developmental processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular specification of cortico-brainstem versus corticospinal projection neurons in development</a></h4>

              
                Skilled motor control requires precise connections between subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) in the cerebral cortex and their appropriate subcerebral targets in the brainstem or spinal cord. The brainstem is an important motor control center and cortical projections to the brainstem serve distinct motor control functions than corticospinal projections. However, mechanisms controlling cortico-brainstem versus corticospinal projections during development remain unknown. Here, we show that the transition between the brainstem and cervical cord distinguishes cortico-brainstem from corticospinal neurons from the earliest stages of SCPN axon extension in white matter. We used high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing of FACS-purified SCPN, retrogradely labeled from either the cerebral peduncle (labeling both cortico-brainstem and corticospinal neurons) or the cervical cord (labeling corticospinal neurons only) at critical times of axon extension. We identify that cortico-brainstem and corticospinal neurons are molecularly distinct: We establish Neuropeptide Y (Npy) as specifically enriched in cortico-brainstem neurons in lateral cortex, while CART prepropeptide (Cartpt) delineates cervical-projecting corticospinal neurons. Our results highlight molecular specification of cortico-brainstem vs. corticospinal projections well before these axons reach their appropriate segmental target and suggest a broad molecular program over SCPN axon targeting to distinct subcerebral targets early in development. These findings are likely to inform future investigations of motor circuit development, as well as approaches aimed at enhancing motor recovery after central nervous system damage.

                Many species of animals exhibit an intuitive sense of number, suggesting a fundamental neural mechanism for representing numerosity in a visual scene. Recent empirical studies demonstrate that early feedforward visual responses are sensitive to numerosity of a dot array but not to continuous dimensions orthogonal to numerosity, such as size and spacing of the dots. Here we identified the core neurocomputational principles underlying these effects: (1) center-surround contrast filters; (2) at different spatial scales; with (3) divisive normalization across network units. In an untrained computational model, these principles eliminated sensitivity to size and spacing, making numerosity the main determinant of the neuronal response magnitude. In addition to identifying these core principles, we demonstrate that divisive normalization can explain illusions concerning numerosity perception across space and time. These results identify a set of neurocomputational properties that gives rise to the ubiquity of the number sense in the animal kingdom.

                Skeletal muscles support the stability and mobility of the skeleton but differ in biomechanical properties and physiological functions. The intrinsic factors that regulate muscle-specific characteristics are poorly understood. To study these, we constructed a large atlas of RNA-seq profiles from six leg muscles and two locations from one muscle, using biopsies from 22 healthy young males. We identified differential expression patterns and cellular composition across the seven tissues using three bioinformatics approaches confirmed by large-scale newly developed quantitative immune-histology procedures. With all three procedures, the muscle samples clustered into three groups congruent with their anatomical location. Concomitant with genes marking oxidative metabolism, genes marking fast- or slow-twitch myofibers differed between the three groups. The groups of muscles with higher expression of slow-twitch genes were enriched in endothelial cells and showed higher capillary content. In addition, expression profiles of Homeobox (HOX) transcription factors differed between the three groups and were confirmed by spatial RNA hybridization. We created an open-source graphical interface to explore and visualize the leg muscle atlas (https://tabbassidaloii.shinyapps.io/muscleAtlasShinyApp/). Our study reveals molecular specialization of human leg muscles and provides a novel resource to study muscle-specific molecular features, which could be linked with (patho)physiological processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Atlas for Glycoprotein Hormone Receptors at Single-Transcript Level</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing evidence that anterior pituitary hormones, traditionally thought to have unitary functions in regulating single endocrine targets, act on multiple somatic tissues, such as bone, fat, and liver. There is also emerging evidence for anterior pituitary hormone action on brain receptors in mediating central neural and peripheral somatic functions. Here, we have created the most comprehensive neuroanatomical atlas on the expression of TSHRs, LHCGRs and FSHRs. We have used RNAscope, a technology that allows the detection of mRNA at single-transcript level, together with protein level validation, to document Tshr expression in 173 and Fshr expression in 353 brain regions, nuclei and sub-nuclei identified using the Atlas for the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. We also identified Lhcgr transcripts in 401 brain regions, nuclei and sub-nuclei. Complementarily, we used ViewRNA, another single-transcript detection technology, to establish the expression of FSHRs in human brain samples, where transcripts were co-localized in MALAT1-positive neurons. In addition, we show high expression for all three receptors in the ventricular region--with yet unknown functions. Intriguingly, Tshr and Fshr expression in the ependymal layer of the third ventricle was similar to that of the thyroid follicular cells and testicular Sertoli cells, respectively. TSHRs were expressed specifically in tanycytes. In contrast, Fshrs were localized to NeuN-positive neurons in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in murine and human brain--both are Alzheimer's disease vulnerable regions. Our atlas thus provides a vital resource for scientists to explore the link between the stimulation or inactivation of brain glycoprotein hormone receptors on somatic function. New actionable pathways for human disease may be unmasked through further studies.

                Resilience, the ability to overcome stressful conditions, is found in most mammals and varies significantly among individuals. A lack of resilience can lead to the development of neuropsychiatric and sleep disorders, often within the same individual. Despite extensive research into the brain mechanisms causing maladaptive behavioral-responses to stress, it is not clear why some individuals exhibit resilience. To examine if sleep has a determinative role in maladaptive behavioral-response to social stress, we investigated individual variations in resilience using a social-defeat model for male mice. Our results reveal a direct, causal relationship between sleep amount and resilience--demonstrating that sleep increases after social-defeat stress only occur in resilient mice. Further, we found that within the prefrontal cortex, a regulator of maladaptive responses to stress, pre-existing differences in sleep regulation predict resilience. Overall, these results demonstrate that increased NREM sleep, mediated cortically, is an active response to social-defeat stress that is both necessary and sufficient for promoting resilience. They also show that differences in resilience are strongly correlated with inter-individual variability in sleep regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diffusion MR imaging in the corticospinal tract of idiopathic scoliosis</a></h4>

              
                Many studies have shown that idiopathic scoliosis is not only a deformity of the spine. It is often associated with neurological impairment without any macroscopic abnormality in the brain. In our previous diffusion MRI study, we demonstrated that children with right-thoracic idiopathic scoliosis had abnormal white matter microstructure of the crossing premotor fibres in the corpus callosum. Based on this, we hypothesized that similar microstructural changes could affect the main descending white matter tracts, the corticospinal tract. We compared the fractional anisotropy values along the corticospinal tracts in ten patients with right-thoracic and ten patients with left-thoracic idiopathic scoliosis to 49 healthy controls. We found abnormal left-right asymmetry of the fractional anisotropy values in scoliosis patients at the level of the pons. Whereas at upper levels the values were similar across all groups. Our results suggest that abnormal sensorimotor integration at the level of the pons is associated with the development of idiopathic scoliosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Incubation of palatable food craving is associated with brain-wide neuronal activation in mice</a></h4>

              
                Studies using rodent models have shown that relapse to drug or food seeking increases progressively during abstinence, a phenomenon termed "incubation of craving". Mechanistic studies of incubation of craving have focused on specific neurobiological targets within pre-selected brain areas. Recent methodological advances in whole-brain immunohistochemistry, clearing, and imaging now enable unbiased brain-wide cellular resolution mapping of regions and circuits engaged during learned behaviors. However, these whole brain imaging approaches were developed for mouse brains while incubation of drug craving has primarily been studied in rats and incubation of food craving has not been demonstrated in mice. Here, we established a mouse model of incubation of palatable food craving and examined food reward seeking after 1, 15, and 60 abstinence days. We then used the neuronal activity marker Fos with intact brain mapping procedures to identify corresponding patterns of brain-wide activation. Relapse to food seeking was significantly higher after 60 abstinence days than after 1 or 15 days. Using unbiased ClearMap analysis, we identified increased activation of multiple brain regions, particularly corticostriatal structures, following 60, but not 15 abstinence days. We used orthogonal SMART2 analysis to confirm these findings within corticostriatal and thalamocortical subvolumes and applied expert-guided registration to investigate subdivision and layer-specific activation patterns. Overall, we (1) identified novel brain-wide activity patterns during incubation of food seeking using complementary analytical approaches, and (2) provide a single-cell resolution whole-brain atlas that can be used to identify functional networks and global architecture underlying incubation of food craving.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Value of Zero-filling in In Vivo MRS</a></h4>

              
                Two opinions currently exist on the role of zero-filling in data processing for in vivo MRS: that it results in a purely cosmetic interpolation; or that it confers a benefit. Most commonly, in vivo MRS data are acquired as complex time-domain half-echoes, that are Fourier transformed to the give a real spectrum that is modeled for quantification. In this manuscript, we highlight that performing zero-filling draws the independent information from the imaginary part of the spectrum into the real spectrum, improving modeling accuracy. In order to demonstrate this, 10,000 time-domain datasets were simulated as decaying exponentials and noise was added. Data were then Fourier transformed with no-zero filling, 2x, 4x and 8x zero-filling. All spectra were then modeled using a simple single-Lorentzian frequency-domain model. It was demonstrated that 2x zero-filling results in a ~{surd}2 benefit in modeling accuracy, compared to no zero-filling. There was no additional advantage for further zero-filling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in vivo biomarker to characterize ototoxic compounds and novel protective therapeutics</a></h4>

              
                There are no approved therapeutics for the prevention of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction from drugs like aminoglycoside antibiotics. While the mechanisms underlying aminoglycoside ototoxicity remain unresolved, there is considerable evidence that aminoglycosides enter inner ear mechanosensory hair cells through the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channel. Inhibition of MET-dependent uptake with small molecules or modified aminoglycosides is a promising otoprotective strategy. To better characterize mammalian ototoxicity and aid in the translation of emerging therapeutics, a biomarker is needed. In the present study we propose that neonatal mice systemically injected with the aminoglycosides G418 conjugated to Texas Red (G418-TR) can be used as a histologic biomarker to characterize in vivo aminoglycoside toxicity. We demonstrate that postnatal day 5 mice, like older mice with functional hearing, show uptake and retention of G418-TR in cochlear hair cells following systemic injection. When we compare G418-TR uptake in other tissues, we find that kidney proximal tubule cells show similar retention. Using ORC-13661, an investigational hearing protection drug, we demonstrate in vivo inhibition of aminoglycoside uptake in mammalian hair cells. This work establishes how systemically administered fluorescently labeled ototoxins in the neonatal mouse can reveal important details about ototoxic drugs and protective therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assortative mixing in micro-architecturally annotated brain connectomes</a></h4>

              
                The wiring of the brain connects micro-architecturally diverse neuronal populations. The conventional graph model encodes macroscale brain connectivity as a network of nodes and edges, but abstracts away the rich biological detail of each regional node. Regions are different in terms of their microscale attributes, many of which are readily available through modern technological advances and data-sharing initiatives. How is macroscale connectivity related to nodal attributes? Here we investigate the systematic arrangement of white-matter connectivity with respect to multiple biological annotations. Namely, we formally study assortative mixing in annotated connectomes by quantifying the tendency for regions to be connected with each other based on the similarity of their micro-architectural attributes. We perform all experiments using four cortico-cortical connectome datasets from three different species (human, macaque and mouse), and consider a range of molecular, cellular and laminar annotations, including gene expression, neurotransmitter receptors, neuron density, laminar thickness and intracortical myelin. Importantly, we disentangle the relationship between neural wiring, regional heterogeneity and spatial embedding using spatial autocorrelation-preserving null models. We show that mixing between micro-architecturally diverse neuronal populations is supported by long-distance connections. Using meta-analytic decoding, we find that the arrangement of connectivity patterns with respect to biological annotations shape patterns of regional functional specialization. Specifically, regions that connect to biologically similar regions are associated with executive function; conversely, regions that connect with biologically dissimilar regions are associated with memory function. By bridging scales of cortical organization, from microscale attributes to macroscale connectivity, this work lays the foundation for next-generation annotated connectomics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal modeling reveals geometric dependence of AMPAR dynamics on dendritic spine morphology</a></h4>

              
                The modification of neural circuits depends on the strengthening and weakening of synaptic connections. Synaptic strength is often correlated to the density of the ionotropic, glutamateric receptors, AMPAR, (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor) at the postsynaptic density (PSD). While AMPAR density is known to change based on complex biological signaling cascades, the effect of geometric factors such as dendritic spine shape, size, and curvature remain poorly understood. In this work, we developed a deterministic, spatiotemporal model to study the dynamics of AMPAR during long term potentiation (LTP). This model includes a minimal set of biochemical events that represent the upstream signaling events, trafficking of AMPAR to and from the PSD, lateral diffusion in the plane of the spine membrane, and the presence of an extrasynaptic AMPAR pool. Using idealized and realistic spine geometries, we show that the dynamics and increase of bound AMPAR at the PSD depends on a combination of endo- and exocytosis, membrane diffusion, availability of free AMPAR, and intracellular signaling interactions. We also found non-monotonic relationships between spine volume and change in AMPAR at the PSD, suggesting that spines restrict changes in AMPAR to optimize resources and prevent runaway potentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-lapse Imaging of Microglial Activity and Astrocytic Calcium Signaling Reveals a Neuroprotective Effect of Cannabidiol in the Subacute Phase of Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Pharmacological agents that limit secondary tissue loss and/or improve functional outcomes after stroke are still limited. Cannabidiol, the major non-psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa, has been proposed as a neuroprotective agent against experimental focal cerebral ischemia. The effects of cannabidiol have generally been related to the modulation of neuroinflammation, including the control of glial activation and the toxicity exerted by pro-inflammatory mediators. However, so far, most information concerning cannabidiol neuroprotective effects was obtained from histological and biochemical post-mortem assays. To test whether the effects of cannabidiol on glial cells could be also detected in vivo, we performed time-lapse imaging of microglial activity and astrocytic calcium signaling in the subacute phase of stroke using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy. First, C57BL/6N wild-type mice underwent either sham or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery. The animals received intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or cannabidiol (10 mg/kg) 30 min, 24 h, and 48 h after surgery. One day later the neurological score test was performed. Brain tissue was processed to evaluate the neuronal loss and microglial activation. Transgenic mice with microglial expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein and astrocyte-specific expression of the calcium sensor GCaMP3 were used to access in vivo microglial activity and astrocytic calcium signaling, respectively. The animals were submitted to the same experimental design described above and to imaging sessions before, 30 min, 24 h and, 48 h after surgery. Astrocytic calcium signaling was also assessed in acutely isolated slices 5 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery in the presence of perfusion or cannabidiol solution. Cannabidiol prevented ischemia-induced neurological impairments as well as protected against neuronal loss in ischemic mice. Cannabidiol also reduced ischemia-induced microglial activation, as demonstrated in fixed tissue as well in in vivo conditions. No difference in the amplitude and duration of astrocytic calcium signals was detected before and after the middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo. Similarly, no significant difference was found in the astrocytic calcium signals between contra and ipsilateral side of acutely isolated brain slices. The present results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of cannabidiol after stroke may occur in the subacute phase of ischemia and reinforce the strong anti-inflammatory property of this compound.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aberrant cortical spine dynamics after concussive injury are reversed by integrated stress response inhibition.</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term neurological disability in the world and the strongest environmental risk factor for the development of dementia. Even mild TBI (resulting from concussive injuries) is associated with a >2-fold increase in the risk of dementia onset. Little is known about the cellular mechanisms responsible for the progression of long lasting cognitive deficits. The integrated stress response (ISR), a phylogenetically conserved pathway involved in the cellular response to stress, is activated after TBI, axsnd inhibition of the ISR - even weeks after injury - can reverse behavioral and cognitive deficits. However, the cellular mechanisms by which ISR inhibition restores cognition are unknown. Here we used longitudinal two-photon imaging in vivo after concussive injury in mice to study dendritic spine dynamics in the parietal cortex, a brain region involved in working memory. Concussive injury profoundly altered spine dynamics measured up to a month after injury. Strikingly, brief pharmacological treatment with the drug-like small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB entirely reversed the structural changes measured in the parietal cortex and the associated working memory deficits. Thus, both neural and cognitive consequences of concussive injury are mediated in part by activation of the ISR and can be corrected by its inhibition. These findings suggest that targeting ISR activation could serve as a promising approach for the clinical treatment of chronic cognitive deficits after TBI.

                Alzheimer's disease pathology leads to neurodegeneration within the memory-related structures of the medial temporal cortex and hippocampus. Neurodegeneration also occurs as a part of normative aging and it is unclear whether medial temporal lobe subregions are selectively intact in older adults with preserved cognitive function in comparison to adults who are cognitively impaired. In this study, we used T1-weighted and high-resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to assess age-related volumetric changes to medial temporal lobe regions, including the hippocampal formation and rhinal cortex, in patients with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal controls in two independent cohorts. Our results show age was significantly associated with regional atrophy in the hippocampus, but not the rhinal cortex. Additionally, variability in regional medial temporal lobe volume was associated with tau uptake in the rhinal cortex, but not the hippocampus. Together, these results suggest that the rhinal cortex may be more indicative of Alzheimer's disease pathology and can help differentiate from age-related neurodegeneration.

                The search for reliable human blood-brain barrier (BBB) models represents a challenge for the development/testing of strategies aiming to enhance brain delivery of drugs. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have raised hopes in the development of predictive BBB models. Differentiating strategies are thus required to generate endothelial cells (ECs), a major component of the BBB. Several hiPSC-based protocols have reported the generation of in vitro models with significant differences in barrier properties. We studied in depth the properties of iPSCs byproducts from two protocols that have been established to yield these in vitro barrier models. Our analysis/study reveals that iPSCs endowed with EC features yield high permeability models, while the cells that exhibit outstanding barrier properties show principally epithelial cell-like (EpC) features. Our study demonstrates that hiPSC-based BBB models need extensive characterization beforehand and that a reliable human BBB model is still needed.

                Everyday experiences are dynamic, driving fluctuations across simultaneous cognitive processes. A key challenge in the study of naturalistic cognition is to disentangle the complexity of these dynamic processes, without altering the natural experience itself. Retrospective behavioral sampling (RBS) is a novel approach to track the cognitive fluctuations throughout the time-course of naturalistic stimulation, across a variety of cognitive dimensions. We tested the effectiveness and reliability of RBS in a web-based experiment, in which 53 participants viewed short movies and listened to a story, followed by retrospective reporting. Participants recalled their experience of 55 discrete events from the stimuli, rating their quality of memory, magnitude of surprise, intensity of negative and positive emotions, perceived importance, reflectivity state, and mental time travel. In addition, a subset of the original cohort re-rated their memory of events in a follow-up questionnaire. Results show highly replicable fluctuation patterns across distinct cognitive dimensions, thereby revealing a stimulus-driven experience that is substantially shared among individuals. Remarkably, memory ratings more than a week after stimulation resulted in an almost identical time-course of memorability as measured immediately following stimulation. In addition, idiosyncratic response patterns were preserved across different stimuli, indicating that RBS characterizes individual differences that are stimulus invariant. The current findings highlight the potential of RBS as a powerful tool for measuring dynamic processes of naturalistic cognition. We discuss the promising approach of matching RBS fluctuations with dynamic processes measured via other testing modalities, such as neuroimaging, to study the neural manifestations of naturalistic cognitive processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral activity increases neuronal activity in the circadian clock of diurnal Arvicanthis ansorgei</a></h4>

              
                The central circadian clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) within the brain, regulates daily patterns of activity and physiology. Many studies indicate that exercise at certain times of the day is beneficial for maintaining circadian health; however, the underlying mechanisms in diurnal species such as humans are poorly understood. We therefore investigated the effect of behavioral activity on SCN neuronal firing rate in the diurnal rodent Arvicanthis ansorgei by performing in vivo electrophysiological recordings in freely moving animals. We found that SCN firing was acutely increased at the onset of behavioral activity; the firing rate remained elevated during episodes of behavioral activity ranging from seconds to hours, and then returned to baseline levels after behavioral activity ceased. We also found that diurnal behavioral input increases SCN rhythm amplitude, while crepuscular activity results in a bimodal rhythm in the SCN. To confirm that behavioral activity affects the SCN via activation of extra-SCN areas, we performed ex vivo recordings and found that SCN firing in both fully diurnal and crepuscular animals has a unimodal rhythm, with a single peak occurring at midday. Together, these data indicate that exercise increases the SCN's rhythm in diurnal Arvicanthis and does so via an excitatory effect on the SCN's neuronal firing rate. Thus the electrical activity rhythm that is generated at a molecular level is increased by behavioral activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Parabrachial to Hypothalamic Neurocircuit Mediates Defensive Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Defensive behaviors are critical for animals survival. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is critical in transmitting danger stimuli to trigger behavioral responses. Here, by viral tracing and electrophysiological recordings, we uncover that cholecystokinin (CCK) neurons in the lateral PB (LPBCCK neurons) are monosynaptic connected with the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons. Selective photoactivation of LPBCCK neurons, their axon terminals within the PVN and glutamatergic neurons in the PVN, trigger defensive-like flight-to-nest behavior. Conversely, photoinhibition of LPBCCK neurons suppresses defensive responses. We show that LPBCCK neurons provide excitatory transmission to the PVN neurons and blocking glutamatergic transmission inhibits LPBCCK-PVN pathway activation-induced flight behaviors. Further, we demonstrate that chemogenetic inhibition of PVN neurons prevents photoactivation of LPBCCK-PVN pathway-driven flight responses. These data suggest that LPBCCK neurons recruit downstream PVN neurons to actively engage in flight responses. Our study identifies a novel circuit from LPBCCK to PVN and dissects its role in defensive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectomic Analysis of Thalamus-driven Disinhibition in Cortical Layer 4</a></h4>

              
                In mammals, sensory signals are transmitted via the thalamus primarily to layer 4 of the primary sensory cortices. While information about average neuronal connectivity in this layer is available, the detailed and higher-order circuit structure is not known. Here, we used 3-dimensional electron microscopy for a connectomic analysis of the thalamus-driven inhibitory network in a layer 4 barrel. We find that thalamic input drives a subset of interneurons with high specificity. These interneurons in turn target spiny stellate and star pyramidal excitatory neurons with subtype specificity. In addition, they create a directed disinhibitory network directly driven by the thalamic input. Together, this circuit can create differential windows of opportunity for activation of the types of excitatory neurons in dependence of strength and timing of thalamic input. With this, we have identified a so-far unknown degree of specialization of the microcircuitry in the main thalamocortical recipient layer of the primary sensory cortex.

	<p>The analysis of resting-state fMRI signals usually focuses on the low-frequency range/band (0.01&amp;amp;ndash;0.1 Hz), which does not cover all aspects of brain activity. Studies have shown that distinct frequency bands can capture unique fluctuations in brain activity, with high-frequency signals (&amp;amp;gt;0.1 Hz) providing valuable information for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. We hypothesized that it is meaningful to study the dynamic reconfiguration of schizophrenia through different frequencies. Therefore, this study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance (RS-fMRI) data from 42 schizophrenia and 40 normal controls to investigate dynamic network reconfiguration in multiple frequency bands (0.01&amp;amp;ndash;0.25 Hz, 0.01&amp;amp;ndash;0.027 Hz, 0.027&amp;amp;ndash;0.073 Hz, 0.073&amp;amp;ndash;0.198 Hz, 0.198&amp;amp;ndash;0.25 Hz). Based on the time-varying dynamic network constructed for each frequency band, we compared the dynamic reconfiguration of schizophrenia and normal controls by calculating the recruitment and integration. The experimental results showed that the differences between schizophrenia and normal controls are observed in the full frequency, which is more significant in slow3. In addition, as visual network, attention network, and default mode network differ a lot from each other, they can show a high degree of connectivity, which indicates that the functional network of schizophrenia is affected by the abnormal brain state in these areas. These shreds of evidence provide a new perspective and promote the current understanding of the characteristics of dynamic brain networks in schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>Measurements of response inhibition components of reactive inhibition and proactive inhibition within the stop-signal paradigm have been of particular interest to researchers since the 1980s. While frequentist nonparametric and Bayesian parametric methods have been proposed to precisely estimate the entire distribution of reactive inhibition, quantified by stop signal reaction times (SSRT), there is no method yet in the stop signal task literature to precisely estimate the entire distribution of proactive inhibition. We identify the proactive inhibition as the difference of go reaction times for go trials following stop trials versus those following go trials and introduce an Asymmetric Laplace Gaussian (ALG) model to describe its distribution. The proposed method is based on two assumptions of independent trial type (go/stop) reaction times and Ex-Gaussian (ExG) models. Results indicated that the four parametric ALG model uniquely describes the proactive inhibition distribution and its key shape features, and its hazard function is monotonically increasing, as are its three parametric ExG components. In conclusion, the four parametric ALG model can be used for both response inhibition components and its parameters and descriptive and shape statistics can be used to classify both components in a spectrum of clinical conditions.</p>

	<p>Although emotional or affective working memory (WM) is quite well established in general psychology, not much research has looked into its potential implications for the language sciences and bilingualism and second language acquisition (SLA) research until recently. To fill this gap, this paper aims to propose that WM has not just cognitive implications, but its affective dimension may also make complementary and unique contributions to language and bilingualism/SLA research. Towards this end, we first briefly synthesize the cognitive views of WM conceptions and assessment procedures in the current language sciences and bilingualism/SLA research. Next, we turn to discuss the theoretical models and assumptions of affective WM and explore their theoretical implications for bilingualism/SLA research based on emerging empirical evidence. Then, we propose a conceptual framework integrating cognitive and affective WM perspectives and further provide guidelines for designing affective WM span tasks that can be used in future affective WM&amp;amp;ndash;language research, focusing on the construction procedures of several emotion-based affective WM span tasks (e.g., the emotional reading span task, the emotional operation span task, and the emotional symmetry span task) as examples. Overall, we argue that affective feelings are also an integral part of the mental representations held in WM and future research in the language sciences and bilingualism/SLA should incorporate both cognitive and affective WM dimensions.</p>

	<p>The Locus coeruleus (LC) modulates various neuronal circuits throughout the brain. Its unique architectural organization encompasses a net of axonal innervation that spans the entire brain, while its somatic core is highly compact. Recent research revealed an unexpected cellular input specificity within the nucleus that can give rise to various network states that either broadcast norepinephrine signals throughout the brain or pointedly modulate specific brain areas. Such adaptive input&amp;amp;ndash;output functions likely surpass our existing network models that build upon a given synaptic wiring configuration between neurons. As the distances between noradrenergic neurons in the core of the LC are unusually small, neighboring neurons could theoretically impact each other via volume transmission of NE. We therefore set out to investigate if such interaction could be mediated through noradrenergic alpha2-receptors in a spiking neuron model of the LC. We validated our model of LC neurons through comparison with experimental patch-clamp data and identified key variables that impact alpha2-mediated inhibition of neighboring LC neurons. Our simulation confirmed a reliable autoinhibition of LC neurons after episodes of high neuronal activity that continue even after neuronal activity subsided. Additionally, dendro-somatic synapses inhibited spontaneous spiking in the somatic compartment of connected neurons in our model. We determined the exact position of hundreds of LC neurons in the mouse brain stem via a tissue clearing approach and, based on this, further determined that 25 percent of noradrenergic neurons have a neighboring LC neuron within less than a 25-micrometer radius. By modeling NE diffusion, we estimated that more than 15 percent of the alpha2-adrenergic receptors fraction can bind NE within such a diffusion radius. Our spiking neuron model of LC neurons predicts that repeated or long-lasting episodes of high neuronal activity induce partitioning of the gross LC network and reduce the spike rate in neighboring neurons at distances smaller than 25 &amp;amp;mu;m. As these volume-mediating neighboring effects are challenging to test with the current methodology, our findings can guide future experimental approaches to test this phenomenon and its physiological consequences.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The activity of primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons is modulated not only by sensory inputs but also by other task-related variables in associative learning. However, it is unclear how A1 neural activity changes dynamically in response to these variables during the learning process of associative memory tasks. Therefore, we developed an associative memory task using auditory stimuli in rats. In this task, rats were required to associate tone frequencies (high and low) with a choice of ports (right or left) to obtain a reward. The activity of A1 neurons in the rats during the learning process of the task was recorded. A1 neurons increased their firing rates either when the rats were presented with a high or low tone (frequency-selective cells) before they chose either the left or right port (choice-direction cells), or when they received a reward after choosing either the left or right port (reward-direction cells). Furthermore, the proportion of frequency-selective cells and reward-direction cells increased with task acquisition and reached the maximum level in the last stage of learning. These results suggest that A1 neurons have task- and learning-dependent selectivity toward sensory input and reward when auditory tones and behavioral responses are gradually associated during task training. This selective activity of A1 neurons may facilitate the formation of associations, leading to the consolidation of associative memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hypothalamic TRH Mediates Anorectic Effects of Serotonin in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Among the modulatory functions of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), an anorectic behavior in rodents is observed when centrally injected. Hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons receive serotonergic inputs from dorsal raphe nucleus and express serotonin (5HT) receptors such as 5HT<SUB>1A</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>2A/2C</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>6</SUB>, which are involved in 5HT-induced feeding regulation. Rats subjected to dehydration-induced anorexia (DIA) model show increased PVN TRH mRNA expression, associated with their decreased food intake. We analyzed whether 5HT input is implicated in the enhanced PVN TRH transcription that anorectic rats exhibit, given that 5HT increases TRH expression and release when studied <I>in vitro</I>. By using mHypoA-2/30 hypothalamic cell cultures, we found that 5HT stimulated TRH mRNA, pCREB, and pERK1/2 levels. By inhibiting basal PKA or PKC activities or those induced by 5HT, pCREB or pERK1/2 content did not increase suggesting involvement of both kinases in their phosphorylation. 5HT effect on TRH mRNA was not affected by PKA inhibition, but it diminished in the presence of PKCi suggesting involvement of PKC in 5HT-induced TRH increased transcription. This likely involves 5HT<SUB>2A/2C</SUB> and the activation of alternative transduction pathways than those studied here. In agreement with the <I>in vitro</I> data, we found that injecting 5HT<SUB>2A/2C</SUB> antagonists into the PVN of DIA rats reversed the increased TRH expression of anorectic animals, as well as their decreased food intake; also, the agonist reduced food intake of hungry restricted animals along with elevated PVN TRH mRNA levels. Our results support that the anorectic effects of serotonin are mediated by PVN TRH in this model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Histochemical Characterization of the Dorsal Raphe-Periaqueductal Grey Dopamine Transporter Neurons Projecting to the Extended Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus contains many tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons which are regarded as dopaminergic (DA) neurons. These DA neurons in the DR and periaqueductal gray (PAG) region (DA<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons) are a subgroup of the A10 cluster, which is known to be heterogeneous. This DA population projects to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and has been reported to modulate various affective behaviors. To characterize, the histochemical features of DA<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons projecting to the CeA and BNST in mice, the current study combined retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Gold (FG) and histological techniques, focusing on TH, dopamine transporter (DAT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2). To identify putative DA neurons, DAT-Cre::Ai14 mice were used. It was observed that DAT<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons consisted of the following two subpopulations: TH+/VIP&ndash; and TH&ndash;/VIP+ neurons. The DAT+/TH&ndash;/VIP+ subpopulation would be non-DA noncanonical DAT neurons. Anterograde labeling of DAT<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons with AAV in DAT-Cre mice revealed that the fibers exclusively innervated the lateral part of the CeA and the oval nucleus of the BNST. Retrograde labeling with FG injections into the CeA or BNST revealed that the two subpopulations similarly innervated these regions. Furthermore, using VGlut2-Cre::Ai14 mice, it was turned out that the TH&ndash;/VIP+ subpopulations innervating both CeA and BNST were VGlut2-positive neurons. These two subpopulations of DAT<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons, TH+/VIP&ndash; and TH&ndash;/VIP+, might differentially interfere with the extended amygdala, thereby modulating affective behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elastic network modeling of cellular networks unveils sensor and effector genes that control information flow</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Omer Acar, She Zhang, Ivet Bahar, Anne-Ruxandra Carvunis</p>

The high-level organization of the cell is embedded in indirect relationships that connect distinct cellular processes. Existing computational approaches for detecting indirect relationships between genes typically consist of propagating abstract information through network representations of the cell. However, the selection of genes to serve as the source of propagation is inherently biased by prior knowledge. Here, we sought to derive an unbiased view of the high-level organization of the cell by identifying the genes that propagate and receive information most effectively in the cell, and the indirect relationships between these genes. To this aim, we adapted a perturbation-response scanning strategy initially developed for identifying allosteric interactions within proteins. We deployed this strategy onto an elastic network model of the yeast genetic interaction profile similarity network. This network revealed a superior propensity for information propagation relative to simulated networks with similar topology. Perturbation-response scanning identified the major distributors and receivers of information in the network, named effector and sensor genes, respectively. Effectors formed dense clusters centrally integrated into the network, whereas sensors formed loosely connected antenna-shaped clusters and contained genes with previously characterized involvement in signal transduction. We propose that indirect relationships between effector and sensor clusters represent major paths of information flow between distinct cellular processes. Genetic similarity networks for fission yeast and human displayed similarly strong propensities for information propagation and clusters of effector and sensor genes, suggesting that the global architecture enabling indirect relationships is evolutionarily conserved across species. Our results demonstrate that elastic network modeling of cellular networks constitutes a promising strategy to probe the high-level organization and cooperativity in the cell.

With the frenetic growth of high-dimensional datasets in different biomedical domains, there is an urgent need to develop predictive methods able to deal with this complexity. Feature selection is a relevant strategy in machine learning to address this challenge. We introduce a novel feature selection algorithm for linear regression called BOSO (Bilevel Optimization Selector Operator). We conducted a benchmark of BOSO with key algorithms in the literature, finding a superior accuracy for feature selection in high-dimensional datasets. Proof-of-concept of BOSO for predicting drug sensitivity in cancer is presented. A detailed analysis is carried out for methotrexate, a well-studied drug targeting cancer metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern reveals key tradeoffs between receptor affinity and antibody escape</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Emily K. Makowski, John S. Schardt, Matthew D. Smith, Peter M. Tessier</p>

SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility represent a serious threat to global health. Here we report machine learning models that can predict the impact of receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations on receptor (ACE2) affinity, which is linked to infectivity, and escape from human serum antibodies, which is linked to viral neutralization. Importantly, the models predict many of the known impacts of RBD mutations in current and former Variants of Concern on receptor affinity and antibody escape as well as novel sets of mutations that strongly modulate both properties. Moreover, these models reveal key opposing impacts of RBD mutations on transmissibility, as many sets of RBD mutations predicted to increase antibody escape are also predicted to reduce receptor affinity and vice versa. These models, when used in concert, capture the complex impacts of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on properties linked to transmissibility and are expected to improve the development of next-generation vaccines and biotherapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Genome-wide cross-cancer analysis illustrates the critical role of bimodal miRNA in patient survival and drug responses to PI3K inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura Moody, Guanying Bianca Xu, Yuan-Xiang Pan, Hong Chen</p>

Heterogeneity of cancer means many tumorigenic genes are only aberrantly expressed in a subset of patients and thus follow a bimodal distribution, having two modes of expression within a single population. Traditional statistical techniques that compare sample means between cancer patients and healthy controls fail to detect bimodally expressed genes. We utilize a mixture modeling approach to identify bimodal microRNA (miRNA) across cancers, find consistent sources of heterogeneity, and identify potential oncogenic miRNA that may be used to guide personalized therapies. Pathway analysis was conducted using target genes of the bimodal miRNA to identify potential functional implications in cancer. <i>In vivo</i> overexpression experiments were conducted to elucidate the clinical importance of bimodal miRNA in chemotherapy treatments. In nine types of cancer, tumors consistently displayed greater bimodality than normal tissue. Specifically, in liver and lung cancers, high expression of miR-105 and miR-767 was indicative of poor prognosis. Functional pathway analysis identified target genes of miR-105 and miR-767 enriched in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and analysis of over 200 cancer drugs <i>in vitro</i> showed that drugs targeting the same pathway had greater efficacy in cell lines with high miR-105 and miR-767 levels. Overexpression of the two miRNA facilitated response to PI3K inhibitor treatment. We demonstrate that while cancer is marked by considerable genetic heterogeneity, there is between-cancer concordance regarding the particular miRNA that are more variable. Bimodal miRNA are ideal biomarkers that can be used to stratify patients for prognosis and drug response in certain types of cancer.

                <p>by Erik Garrison, Zev N. Kronenberg, Eric T. Dawson, Brent S. Pedersen, Pjotr Prins</p>

Since its introduction in 2011 the variant call format (VCF) has been widely adopted for processing DNA and RNA variants in practically all population studies—as well as in somatic and germline mutation studies. The VCF format can represent single nucleotide variants, multi-nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, and simple structural variants called and anchored against a reference genome.
Here we present a spectrum of over 125 useful, complimentary free and open source software tools and libraries, we wrote and made available through the multiple vcflib, bio-vcf, cyvcf2, hts-nim and slivar projects. These tools are applied for comparison, filtering, normalisation, smoothing and annotation of VCF, as well as output of statistics, visualisation, and transformations of files variants. These tools run everyday in critical biomedical pipelines and countless shell scripts. Our tools are part of the wider bioinformatics ecosystem and we highlight best practices.
We shortly discuss the design of VCF, lessons learnt, and how we can address more complex variation through pangenome graph formats, variation that can not easily be represented by the VCF format.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Recommendations for improving statistical inference in population genomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Parul Johri, Charles F. Aquadro, Mark Beaumont, Brian Charlesworth, Laurent Excoffier, Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter D. Keightley, Michael Lynch, Gil McVean, Bret A. Payseur, Susanne P. Pfeifer, Wolfgang Stephan, Jeffrey D. Jensen</p>

The field of population genomics has grown rapidly in response to the recent advent of affordable, large-scale sequencing technologies. As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population genetic insights outpaced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous nonadaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our consensus views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Learning-related congruent and incongruent changes of excitation and inhibition in distinct cortical areas</a></h4>

Excitatory and inhibitory neurons in diverse cortical regions are likely to contribute differentially to the transformation of sensory information into goal-directed motor plans. Here, we investigate the relative changes across mouse sensorimotor cortex in the activity of putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons—categorized as regular or fast spiking (FS) according to their action potential (AP) waveform—comparing before and after learning of a whisker detection task with delayed licking as perceptual report. Surprisingly, we found that the whisker-evoked activity of regular versus FS neurons changed in opposite directions after learning in primary and secondary whisker motor cortices, while it changed similarly in primary and secondary orofacial motor cortices. Our results suggest that changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition in local circuits concurrent with changes in the long-range synaptic inputs in distinct cortical regions might contribute to performance of delayed sensory-to-motor transformation.

The continued spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis is one of the most pressing and complex challenges facing tuberculosis management worldwide. Therefore, developing a new class of drugs is necessary and urgently needed to cope with the increasing threat of drug-resistant tuberculosis. This study aims to discover a potential new class of tuberculosis drug candidates different from existing tuberculosis drugs. By screening a library of compounds, methyl (S)-1-((3-alkoxy-6,7-dimethoxyphenanthren-9-yl)methyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (PP) derivatives with antitubercular activity were discovered. MIC ranges for PP1S, PP2S, and PP3S against clinically isolated drug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> strains were 0.78 to 3.13, 0.19 to 1.56, and 0.78 to 6.25 μg/ml, respectively. PPs demonstrated antitubercular activities in macrophage and tuberculosis mouse models, showing no detectable toxicity in all assays tested. PPs specifically inhibited <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> without significantly changing the intestinal microbiome in mice. Mutants selected in vitro suggest that the drug targets the PE-PGRS57, which has been found only in the genomes of the <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> complex, highlighting the specificity and safety potency of this compound. As PPs show an excellent safety profile and highly selective toxicity specific to <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>, PPs are considered a promising new candidate for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis while maintaining microbiome homeostasis.

Ensuring high vaccination and even booster vaccination coverage is critical in preventing severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among the various COVID-19 vaccines currently in use, the mRNA vaccines have shown remarkable effectiveness. However, systemic adverse events (AEs), such as postvaccination fatigue, are prevalent following mRNA vaccination, and the underpinnings of which are not understood. Herein, we found that higher baseline expression of genes related to T and NK cell exhaustion and suppression were positively correlated with the development of moderately severe fatigue after Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination; increased expression of genes associated with T and NK cell exhaustion and suppression reacted to vaccination were associated with greater levels of innate immune activation at 1 day postvaccination. We further found, in a mouse model, that altering the route of vaccination from intramuscular (i.m.) to subcutaneous (s.c.) could lessen the pro-inflammatory response and correspondingly the extent of systemic AEs; the humoral immune response to BNT162b2 vaccination was not compromised. Instead, it is possible that the s.c. route could improve cytotoxic CD8 T-cell responses to BNT162b2 vaccination. Our findings thus provide a glimpse of the molecular basis of postvaccination fatigue from mRNA vaccination and suggest a readily translatable solution to minimize systemic AEs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">P2P Lending platforms in Malaysia: the awareness among Malaysian adults [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Since 2016, the Securities Commission (SC) in Malaysia has given licenses to only eleven P2P lending platforms. Such lending platforms are expected to disrupt the lending services of traditional lenders in the coming years. However, being still in their infant stages, it is essential to know the extent to which such platforms are made known to potential investors out there. This study aims to examine the awareness level of the eleven P2P lending platforms among Malaysian adults. The study also explores if past investment experience and financial knowledge would influence such awareness from Malaysian adults.  Methods - A sample of 335 Malaysian individuals was used for this study. An online questionnaire was designed with three main parts: demographic, financial literacy, and P2P lending awareness. Using IBM SPSS Statistics 26, frequency, descriptive, normality, Pearson coefficients and multiple regression analyses were carried out.  Results - Although seven out of ten respondents have good knowledge in three areas of finance: compounding rate, inflation and diversification, only 14.33% had a good and excellent awareness level of P2P lending. Thus, one would expect lesser awareness about P2P lending among Malaysian adults whose financial literacy is poor or zero. Test results from multiple regression analysis suggest that past lending experiences positively affect the awareness of P2P lending in Malaysia, but not the financial literacy. Conclusions - the awareness about P2P lending among Malaysian adults is too low, despite their high level of education and financial literacy. No investing experience and not knowing any existing P2P lending in the country may be the reason for this low awareness. Therefore, for P2P lending to thrive in Malaysia, the eleven P2P lending platforms need to be promoted aggressively in various social media outlets.

Here the authors show that, by suppressing PARPi-triggered DNA damage and reducing dsDNA production in BRCA1-deficient breast tumor cells, tumor associated macrophages contribute to PARPi resistance, that can be overcome by STING agonism.
