Abstract: Premature birth and various pre- and peri-natal stresses can lead to a variety of brain lesions and have clearly been identified as major risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, with variable but multiple consequences that can significantly alter the functional outcome of children in the short, medium and long term. The main aim of the various diagnostic and prognostic markers available, based in particular on clinical and neuroimaging data, is to facilitate early detection of the various disorders and to optimise the follow-up and management of these babies at risk of deficiencies.

                arXiv:2504.21406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human brain development is a complex and dynamic process that begins during the first weeks of pregnancy and lasts until early adulthood. This chapter focuses on the developmental window from prenatal period to infancy, probably the most dynamic period across the entire lifespan. The availability of non-invasive three-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) methodologies has changed the paradigm and allows investigations of the living human brain structure - e.g. micro- and macrostructural features of cortical and subcortical regions and their connections, including cortical sulcation/gyrification, area, and thickness, as well as white matter microstructure and connectivity - beginning in utero. Because of its relative safety, MRI is well-adapted to study individuals at multiple time points and to longitudinally follow the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the early stages of cognitive development.

                arXiv:2411.10872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas that jointly represent visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of areas across visual cortex. Through RNC we generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This revealed a typical network-level configuration of representational relationships in which shared or unique representational content varied based on cortical distance, categorical selectivity, and position within the visual hierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.

                arXiv:2504.21338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box discrete optimization (BB-DO) problems arise in many real-world applications, such as neural architecture search and mathematical model estimation. A key challenge in BB-DO is epistasis among parameters where multiple variables must be modified simultaneously to effectively improve the objective function. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) provide a powerful framework for tackling BB-DO problems. In particular, an EDA leveraging a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has demonstrated strong performance on relatively low-dimensional problems with epistasis while reducing computational cost. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms such as DSMGA-II and P3, which integrate bit-flip-based local search with linkage learning, have shown excellent performance on high-dimensional problems. In this study, we propose a new memetic algorithm that combines VAE-based sampling with local search. The proposed method inherits the strengths of both VAE-based EDAs and local search-based approaches: it effectively handles high-dimensional problems with epistasis among parameters without incurring excessive computational overhead. Experiments on NK landscapes -- a challenging benchmark for BB-DO involving epistasis among parameters -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art VAE-based EDA methods, as well as leading approaches such as P3 and DSMGA-II.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21545">Meta knowledge assisted Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.21545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary computation (EC)-based neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved remarkable performance in the automatic design of neural architectures. However, the high computational cost associated with evaluating searched architectures poses a challenge for these methods, and a fixed form of learning rate (LR) schedule means greater information loss on diverse searched architectures. This paper introduces an efficient EC-based NAS method to solve these problems via an innovative meta-learning framework. Specifically, a meta-learning-rate (Meta-LR) scheme is used through pretraining to obtain a suitable LR schedule, which guides the training process with lower information loss when evaluating each individual. An adaptive surrogate model is designed through an adaptive threshold to select the potential architectures in a few epochs and then evaluate the potential architectures with complete epochs. Additionally, a periodic mutation operator is proposed to increase the diversity of the population, which enhances the generalizability and robustness. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet1K datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high performance comparable to that of many state-of-the-art peer methods, with lower computational cost and greater robustness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21552">The First Theoretical Approximation Guarantees for the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III)</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.21552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work conducts a first theoretical analysis studying how well the NSGA-III approximates the Pareto front when the population size $N$ is less than the Pareto front size. We show that when $N$ is at least the number $N_r$ of reference points, then the approximation quality, measured by the maximum empty interval (MEI) indicator, on the OneMinMax benchmark is such that there is no empty interval longer than $\lceil\frac{(5-2\sqrt2)n}{N_r-1}\rceil$. This bound is independent of $N$, which suggests that further increasing the population size does not increase the quality of approximation when $N_r$ is fixed. This is a notable difference to the NSGA-II with sequential survival selection, where increasing the population size improves the quality of the approximations. We also prove two results indicating approximation difficulties when $N<N_r$. These theoretical results suggest that the best setting to approximate the Pareto front is $N_r=N$. In our experiments, we observe that with this setting the NSGA-III computes optimal approximations, very different from the NSGA-II, for which optimal approximations have not been observed so far.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21155">Evaluation and Verification of Physics-Informed Neural Models of the Grad-Shafranov Equation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.21155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our contributions are motivated by fusion reactors that rely on maintaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium, where the balance between plasma pressure and confining magnetic fields is required for stable operation. In axisymmetric tokamak reactors in particular, and under the assumption of toroidal symmetry, this equilibrium can be mathematically modelled using the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the GSE. Existing studies did not examine realistic scenarios in which a single network generalizes to a variety of boundary conditions. Addressing that limitation, we evaluate a PINN architecture that incorporates boundary points as network inputs. Additionally, we compare PINN model accuracy and inference speeds with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model. Finding the PINN model to be the most performant, and accurate in our setting, we use the network verification tool Marabou to perform a range of verification tasks. Although we find some discrepancies between evaluations of the networks natively in PyTorch, compared to via Marabou, we are able to demonstrate useful and practical verification workflows. Our study is the first investigation of verification of such networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254">ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.21254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to provide robust and generalizable representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sserranw/ABG-NAS.

Abstract: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) enables the knowledge transfer from the given pre-trained teacher network to the target student model without access to the real training data. Existing DFKD methods focus primarily on improving image recognition performance on associated datasets, often neglecting the crucial aspect of the transferability of learned representations. In this paper, we propose Category-Aware Embedding Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (CAE-DFKD), which addresses at the embedding level the limitations of previous rely on image-level methods to improve model generalization but fail when directly applied to DFKD. The superiority and flexibility of CAE-DFKD are extensively evaluated, including: \textit{\textbf{i.)}} Significant efficiency advantages resulting from altering the generator training paradigm; \textit{\textbf{ii.)}} Competitive performance with existing DFKD state-of-the-art methods on image recognition tasks; \textit{\textbf{iii.)}} Remarkable transferability of data-free learned representations demonstrated in downstream tasks.

Abstract: In this survey, we introduce Meta-Black-Box-Optimization~(MetaBBO) as an emerging avenue within the Evolutionary Computation~(EC) community, which incorporates Meta-learning approaches to assist automated algorithm design. Despite the success of MetaBBO, the current literature provides insufficient summaries of its key aspects and lacks practical guidance for implementation. To bridge this gap, we offer a comprehensive review of recent advances in MetaBBO, providing an in-depth examination of its key developments. We begin with a unified definition of the MetaBBO paradigm, followed by a systematic taxonomy of various algorithm design tasks, including algorithm selection, algorithm configuration, solution manipulation, and algorithm generation. Further, we conceptually summarize different learning methodologies behind current MetaBBO works, including reinforcement learning, supervised learning, neuroevolution, and in-context learning with Large Language Models. A comprehensive evaluation of the latest representative MetaBBO methods is then carried out, alongside an experimental analysis of their optimization performance, computational efficiency, and generalization ability. Based on the evaluation results, we meticulously identify a set of core designs that enhance the generalization and learning effectiveness of MetaBBO. Finally, we outline the vision for the field by providing insight into the latest trends and potential future directions. Relevant literature will be continuously collected and updated at https://github.com/MetaEvo/Awesome-MetaBBO.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17751">Revisiting Reset Mechanisms in Spiking Neural Networks for Sequential Modeling: Specialized Discretization for Binary Activated RNN</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks. From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps. To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17827">Evolution Meets Diffusion: Efficient Neural Architecture Generation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

">In-phase and anti-phase dual-site beta tACS differentially influence functional connectivity and motor inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory control relies on coordinated beta-band activity within a fronto-basal ganglia network, which implements inhibition via downstream effects on (pre)motor areas. In this study, we employed dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and primary motor cortex (M1) to directly manipulate phase relationships in the beta band and assess their effects on both functional connectivity and motor inhibition. Fifty-two healthy participants received in-phase, anti-phase and sham stimulation while performing a stop-signal task. The results revealed that connectivity between rIFG and lM1 increased following in-phase but decreased after anti-phase stimulation. Although no direct modulation of task performance was observed, the greater connectivity increase between the targets during in-phase stimulation was predictive of faster inhibitory performance. In contrast, greater connectivity decreases during anti-phase stimulation were related to faster go responses, suggesting a shift towards less inhibition on the motor system. These findings provide evidence that dual-site beta-tACS can both enhance and impair inhibitory control depending on phase alignment, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive intervention for disorders marked by impaired inhibition.

">HPDL is critical in human cortical development via regulation of mitochondrial functional properties</a></h4>

              
                Human brain development is highly regulated by several spatiotemporal processes, which disruption can result in severe neurological disorders. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of mitochondrial function as one of these fundamental pathways involved in neurodevelopment. Our study investigates the role of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like (HPDL) protein in cortical neurogenesis and mitochondrial activity, since mutations in the HPDL gene are associated with SPG83, a childhood-onset form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by corticospinal tract degeneration and cortical abnormalities. Starting from mutant neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrated that HPDL is essential to mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplex assembly and cellular redox balance. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed dysregulated pathways related to neurogenesis, implicating HPDL role in early cortical development. To further elucidate the role of HPDL, we generated cortical neurons and organoids from SPG83 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Mutant cells exhibited premature neurogenesis at early differentiation stages, likely leading to depletion of cortical progenitors, as evidenced by decreased proliferation, slight increase of apoptosis, and unbalanced cortical type composition at later stages. Furthermore, cortical organoids derived from SPG83 patients showed impaired growth, reminding microcephaly observed in severe cases. In addition, mitochondrial morpho-functional characterization in mutant neurons confirmed disruption of OxPhos chain functionality and increased ROS generation rate. Treatment of cortical cells with two antioxidant compounds, could partially revert premature neurogenesis. In conclusion, our findings reveal a critical role for HPDL in coordinating cortical progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, and mitochondrial function. These insights shed light on a mechanistical understanding of SPG83 pathology and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting oxidative stress in this and related neurological disorders.

">Astrocyte-derived PTPRZ1 regulates astrocyte morphology and excitatory synaptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTPRZ1) is one of the most abundantly expressed and enriched proteins in astrocytes during development, yet its function in astrocytes is unknown. Using an astrocyte-neuron co-culture system, we found that knockdown of Ptprz1 in astrocytes significantly impaired astrocyte branching morphogenesis. To investigate the function of PTPRZ1 in astrocytes during brain development, we generated a Ptprz1 conditional knockout mouse and deleted Ptprz1 from astrocytes postnatally, after the bulk of astrogenesis is complete. At postnatal day 21, we found defects in astrocyte morphology and a reduction in excitatory synapse number across multiple layers of the visual cortex, suggesting important functions for astrocytic PTPRZ1 in both astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenesis. PTPRZ1 is expressed in several neural cell types, including radial glial stem cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and regulates critical aspects of neurodevelopment, including neurite outgrowth, neuronal differentiation, myelination, and extracellular matrix (ECM) development. Moreover, altered PTPRZ1 expression is associated with schizophrenia and glioblastoma. Therefore, this mouse model is a valuable resource for investigating cell-type-specific PTPRZ1 function in numerous neurodevelopmental and neuropathological mechanisms.

                Despite their importance for brain function, cortico-subcortical white matter tracts are under-represented in diffusion MRI tractography studies. Their non-invasive mapping is more challenging and less explored compared to other major cortico-cortical bundles. We introduce a set of standardised tractography protocols for delineating tracts between the cortex and various deep subcortical structures, including the caudate, putamen, amygdala, thalamus and hippocampus.<br />To enable comparative studies, our protocols are designed for both human and macaque brains. We demonstrate how tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles obtained from tracers in the macaque and how these translate to humans. We show that the proposed protocols are robust against data quality and preserve aspects of individual variability stemming from family structure in humans. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of these species-matched protocols in mapping homologous grey matter regions in humans and macaques, both in cortex and subcortex.

                Long-term potentiation (LTP) induces presynaptic bouton enlargement and a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles. To understand the relationship between these events, we performed 3D analysis of serial section electron micrographs in rat hippocampal area CA1, 2 hours after LTP induction. We observed a high vesicle packing density in control boutons, contrasting with a lower density in most LTP boutons. Notably, the summed membrane area of the vesicles lost in low-density LTP boutons is comparable to the surface membrane required for the observed bouton enlargement when compared to high-density control boutons. These novel findings suggest that presynaptic vesicle density provides a new structural indicator of LTP that supports a local mechanism of bouton enlargement.

However, histological atlases of the mouse brain, crucial in biomedical research, have not kept pace. Autofluorescence-based volumetric brain atlases are increasingly used but lack microscopic histological contrast, cytoarchitectonic information, corresponding MRI datasets, and often have truncated brainstems. Here, we present a multimodal, multiscale atlas of the laboratory mouse brain and head. The new reference brains include the whole head with consecutive Nissl and myelin serial section histology in three planes of section with 0.46 m in-plane resolution, including intact brainstem, cranial nerves, and associated sensors and musculature. We provide reassembled histological volumes with 20 m isotropic resolution in stereotactic coordinates, determined using co-registered in vivo MRI and CT. In addition to conventional MRI contrasts, we provide diffusion MRI-based in vivo and ex vivo microstructural information, adding a valuable co-registered contrast modality that bridges MRI with cell-resolution histological data. We shift emphasis from compartmental annotations to stereotactic coordinates in the reference brains, offering a basis for evolving annotations over time and resolving conflicting neuroanatomical judgments by different experts. This new reference atlas facilitates integration of molecular cell type data and regional connectivity, serves as a model for similar atlases in other species, and sets a precedent for preserving extra-cranial nervous system structures.

                <p>Layer 5 (L5) of the cortex provides strong driving input to higher-order thalamic nuclei, such as the pulvinar in the visual system, forming the basis of cortico-thalamo-cortical (transthalamic) circuits. These circuits provide a communication route between cortical areas in parallel to direct corticocortical connections, but their specific role in perception and behavior remains unclear. Using targeted optogenetic inhibition in mice of both sexes performing a visual discrimination task, we selectively suppressed the corticothalamic input from L5 cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) at their terminals in the pulvinar. This suppresses transthalamic circuits from V1; furthermore, any effect on direct corticocortical projections and local V1 circuitry would thus result from transthalamic inputs (e.g., V1 to pulvinar back to V1; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Miller-Hansen and Sherman, 2022</cross-ref>). Such suppression of transthalamic processing during visual stimulus presentation of drifting gratings significantly impaired discrimination performance across different orientations. The impact on behavior was specific to the portion of visual space that retinotopically coincided with the V1 L5 corticothalamic inhibition. These results highlight the importance of incorporating L5-initiated transthalamic circuits into cortical processing frameworks, particularly those addressing how the hierarchical propagation of sensory signals supports perceptual decision-making.</p>

                <p>The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is the large white matter association tract connecting the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Past studies in nonhuman primates have parcellated the SLF into three subdivisions and have outlined the specific corticocortical organization and terminations for each subdivision. However, it is difficult to characterize these structural connections in humans to the specificity of tract-tracing studies in animals. This has led to disagreement on how the SLF subdivisions are organized in the human brain, including if the dorsomedial SLF (SLF-I) is part of the cingulum subsystem. Here, we present a novel large-scale, probabilistic map of the SLF subdivisions, using high-resolution diffusion imaging data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We used image data from 302 adult males and 405 adult females to model the three SLF subdivisions in each hemisphere and attempted to characterize the frontal and parietal termination points for each subdivision. SLF subdivisions were successfully modeled in each subject, showing the dorsomedial-to-ventrolateral organization similar to that in nonhuman primate histological studies. We also found minimal differences between SLF-I models with and without the cingulate gyrus excluded, suggesting that the SLF-I may be a separable tract from the cingulum. Lastly, the SLF subdivisions showed differentiable associations with major cognitive domains such as memory and executive functions. While histological confirmation is needed beyond tractography, these probabilistic masks offer a first step in guiding future exploration of frontoparietal organization by providing detailed characterization of the SLF subdivisions and their potential cortical terminations.</p>

                <p>Auditory learning is supported by long-term changes in the neural processing of sound. We examined these task-depend changes in the auditory cortex by mapping neural sensitivity to timbre, pitch, and location cues in cues in trained (<I>n</I> = 5) and untrained control female ferrets (<I>n</I> = 5). Trained animals either identified vowels in a two-alternative forced choice task (<I>n</I> = 3) or discriminated when a repeating vowel changed in identity or pitch (<I>n</I> = 2). Neural responses were recorded under anesthesia in two primary auditory cortical fields and two tonotopically organized nonprimary fields. In trained animals, the overall sensitivity to sound timbre was reduced across three cortical fields compared with control animals, but maintained in a nonprimary field (the posterior pseudosylvian field). While training did not increase sensitivity to timbre across the auditory cortex, it did change the way in which neurons integrated spectral information, with neural responses in trained animals increasing their sensitivity to first and second formant frequencies, whereas in control animals cortical sensitivity to spectral timbre depended mostly on the second formant. Animals trained on timbre identification were required to generalize across pitch when discriminating timbre, and their neurons became less modulated by fundamental frequency relative to control animals. Finally, both trained groups showed increased spatial sensitivity and an enhanced response to sound source locations close to the midline, where the loudspeaker was located in the training chamber. These results demonstrate that training elicited widespread alterations in the cortical representation of complex sounds.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/18/e1187242025?rss=1">Spike Rate Inference from Mouse Spinal Cord Calcium Imaging Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calcium imaging is a key method to record the spiking activity of identified and genetically targeted neurons. However, the observed calcium signals are only an indirect readout of the underlying electrophysiological events (single spikes or bursts of spikes) and require dedicated algorithms to recover the spike rate. These algorithms for spike inference can be optimized using ground truth data from combined electrical and optical recordings, but it is not clear how such optimized algorithms perform on cell types and brain regions for which ground truth does not exist. Here, we use a state-of-the-art algorithm based on supervised deep learning (CASCADE) and a nonsupervised algorithm based on non-negative deconvolution (OASIS) to test spike rate inference in spinal cord neurons. To enable these tests, we recorded specific ground truth from glutamatergic and GABAergic somatosensory neurons in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord in mice of both sexes. We find that CASCADE and OASIS algorithms designed for cortical excitatory neurons generalize well to both spinal cord cell types. However, CASCADE models retrained on our ground truth further improved the performance, resulting in a more accurate inference of spiking activity from spinal cord neurons. We openly provide retrained models that can be applied to spinal cord data with variable noise levels and frame rates. Together, our ground truth recordings and analyses provide a solid foundation for the interpretation of calcium imaging data from spinal cord dorsal horn and showcase how spike rate inference can generalize between different regions of the nervous system.</p>

                <p>Despite the importance of odor detection to the survival of most animals, mechanisms governing olfactory sensitivity remain unclear, especially beyond the olfactory sensory neurons. Here, we leverage opto- and chemo-genetics to selectively modulate activities of CCKergic tufted cells (TCs) in the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) of either sex, which form the intrabulbar associational system (IAS) to link isofunctional glomeruli, to determine the functional impact on OB output via mitral cells (MCs) and odor detection in behaving animals. NMDA receptors in CCKergic TCs remarkably amplify the OSN-evoked monosynaptic responses in these excitatory neurons, which provide a long-lasting feedforward excitation to MCs via both chemical transmission and electrical synapses between their apical dendrites. NMDA receptors in MCs mediate late components of the dendrodendritic TC-&gt;MC transmission to significantly boost MC output. Congruently, optogenetic inhibition of the CCKerigic TCs dramatically reduces the OSN-evoked MC responses. Unexpectedly, optogenetic activation of the axons projecting from CCKergic TCs on the opposite side of the same bulb produces mainly AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory responses in MCs, leading us to speculate that CCKergic TCs functionally synchronize MC output from mirror glomeruli. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of CCKergic TCs reduces animal&rsquo;s sensitivity to odors by elevating the detection threshold, consistent with the key role of these TCs in functionally controlling MC output. Collectively, our results delineate the cellular and circuit mechanisms allowing the CCKergic TCs to regulate MC output from glomeruli on both the medial and lateral sides of each OB and the system&rsquo;s sensitivity to odors possibly via the IAS.</p>

                <p>The amygdala is a cluster of subcortical nuclei that receives diverse sensory inputs and projects to the cortex, midbrain, and other subcortical structures. Numerous accounts of amygdalar contributions to social and emotional behavior have been offered, yet an overarching description of amygdala function remains elusive. Here, we adopt a computationally explicit framework that aims to develop a model of amygdala function based on the types of sensory inputs it receives, rather than individual constructs such as threat, arousal, or valence. Characterizing human fMRI signal acquired as male and female participants viewed a full-length film, we develop encoding models that predict both patterns of amygdala activity and self-reported valence evoked by naturalistic images. We use deep image synthesis to generate artificial stimuli that distinctly engage encoding models of amygdala subregions that systematically differ from one another in terms of their low-level visual properties. These findings characterize how the amygdala compresses high-dimensional sensory inputs into low-dimensional representations relevant to behavior.</p>

                <p>Our consummatory decisions depend on the taste of food and the reward experienced while eating, which are processed through neural computations in interconnected brain areas. Although many gustatory regions of rodents have been explored, the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) remains understudied. The MD, a multimodal brain area connected with gustatory centers, is often studied for its role in processing associative and cognitive information and has been shown to represent intraorally delivered chemosensory stimuli after strong retronasal odor&ndash;taste associations. Key questions remain about whether MD neurons can process taste quality independently of odor&ndash;taste associations and how they represent extraoral signals predicting rewarding and aversive gustatory outcomes. Here, using C57 male and female mice, we present electrophysiological evidence demonstrating how MD neurons represent and encode (1) the identity and concentrations of basic taste qualities during active licking and (2) auditory signals anticipating rewarding and aversive taste outcomes. Our data reveal that MD neurons can reliably and dynamically encode taste identity in a broadly tuned manner and taste concentrations with spiking activity positively and negatively correlated with stimulus intensity. Our data also show that MD can represent information related to predictive cues and their associated outcomes, regardless of whether the cue predicts a rewarding or aversive outcome. In summary, our findings suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus is integral to the taste pathway, as it can encode sensory-discriminative dimensions of tastants and participate in processing associative information essential for ingestive behaviors.</p>

                <p>What is the secret of human intelligence? A key discovery in psychology is that performance correlations across diverse cognitive tasks are explained by a few broad abilities and one overarching general factor, which is also predictive of real-life achievements. Whether these factors correspond to biological processes is a century-old debate. While previous research focused on localizing their correlates in brain structure, connectivity, and activation levels, the mechanisms of neural information processing related to intelligence are still unexplored. I outline a new approach integrating psychometrics with neuroscientific advances in identifying the computations underlying single tasks from their representational geometry to provide a novel perspective on this topic. In particular, I propose a neural process account of the general factor that builds on the central role of structure mapping&mdash;the process of abstracting and reasoning based on relational knowledge&mdash;in human cognition. Neural coding properties in the hippocampal and prefrontal&ndash;parietal systems that enable inferential leaps through structural abstraction might contribute to the general factor. In general, integrating neuro-representational and psychometric research has the potential to uncover core principles of natural intelligence.</p>

                <p>Every movement requires the nervous system to solve a complex biomechanical control problem, but this process is mostly veiled from one&rsquo;s conscious awareness. Simultaneously, we also have conscious experience of controlling our movements&mdash;our sense of agency (SoA). Whether SoA corresponds to those neural representations that implement actual neuromuscular control is an open question with ethical, medical, and legal implications. If SoA is the conscious experience of control, this predicts that SoA can be decoded from the same brain structures that implement the so-called "inverse dynamics" computations for planning movement. We correlated human (male and female) fMRI measurements during hand movements with the internal representations of a deep neural network performing the same hand control task in a biomechanical simulation&mdash;revealing detailed cortical encodings of sensorimotor states, idiosyncratic to each subject. We then manipulated SoA by usurping control of participants&rsquo; muscles via electrical stimulation and found that the same voxels which were best explained by modeled inverse dynamics representations&mdash;which, strikingly, were located in canonically visual areas&mdash;also predicted SoA. Importantly, model-brain correspondences and robust SoA decoding could both be achieved within single subjects, enabling relationships between motor representations and awareness to be studied at the level of the individual.</p>

                <p>Some decisions, such as selecting a food item in a novel menu, are not based on rational norms, or on trained habits, but on subjective preferences. How the human brain makes these preference-based decisions is still debated in cognitive neuroscience. Classical models focus on the comparison mechanism that achieves the selection of the option with best expected value. Recent models suggest that estimates of option values are refined until reaching sufficient confidence in the considered choice. Neuroimaging studies in humans and electrophysiology studies in animals have gathered evidence that value and confidence estimates are both represented in the medial and lateral regions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Here, we took advantage of electrodes implanted within the OFC of human patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (14 women, 12 men) to investigate whether value and confidence estimates can be dissociated in electrophysiology activity recorded during preference-based binary decisions. The overall value (likeability ratings summed over options) and choice confidence (selection probability of the chosen option) were identified in low-frequency (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) OFC activity. These value and confidence signals were time-locked to the decision, showed opposite signs of correlation, and were recorded in separate sites. This pattern of results is not consistent with the simulations of an attractor neural network model implementing a comparison of option values. However, it is compatible with the notion of a neural network generating sparse representations of option values and choice confidence estimates, based on which decisions can be made.</p>

                <p>Peripheral and brain-produced sex hormones exert sex-specific regulation of hippocampal cognitive function. Estrogens produced by neuronal aromatase regulate inhibitory neurons (INs) and hippocampal-dependent memory in adult female mice, but not in males. How and when this sex effect is established and how peripheral and brain sources of estrogens interact in the control of hippocampal INs is currently unknown. Using ex vivo electrophysiology, fiber photometry, molecular analysis, estrous cycle monitoring, and neonatal hormonal manipulations, we unveil estrous cycle-dependent and estrous cycle-independent features of CA1 parvalbumin (PV) INs and hippocampal inhibition in adult female mice. Before puberty, aromatase is expressed in PV INs and regulates synaptic inhibition in female but not in male mice. Neonatal testosterone administration altered prepubertal female mouse hippocampus-dependent memory, PV IN function and estrogenic regulation of adult female synaptic inhibition and PV IN perineuronal nets. Our results suggest that sex differences in brain-derived estrogen regulation of CA1 inhibition are established by organizational effects of neonatal gonadal hormones and highlight the role of INs as mediators of the sexual differentiation of the hippocampus.</p>

                <p>Sensory systems must perform the dual and opposing tasks of being sensitive to weak stimuli while also maintaining information content in dense and variable sensory landscapes. This occurs in the olfactory system, where olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are highly sensitive to low concentrations of odors and maintain discriminability in complex odor environments. How OSNs maintain both sensitivity and sparsity is poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether the calcium-activated chloride channel, TMEM16B, may support these dual roles in OSNs in both male and female mice. We used multiphoton microscopy to image the stimulus&ndash;response density of OSNs in the olfactory epithelium. In TMEM16B knock-out mice, we found that sensory representations were denser, and the magnitude of OSN responses was increased. Behaviorally, these changes in sensory representations were associated with an increased aversion to the odorant trimethylamine, which switches perceptual valence as its concentration increases, and a decreased efficiency of olfactory-guided navigation. Our results indicate that the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16B sparsens sensory representations in the peripheral olfactory system and contributes to efficient integrative olfactory-guided behaviors.</p>

                <p>Subplate neurons (SpNs) are among the earliest generated cortical neurons that form functional cortical synapses and aid in cortical circuit development. A fraction of SpNs survive and form Layer (L)6b in the adult cortex. While SpNs exhibit a large variety of molecular identities, it is unclear if molecular identity correlates with their functional circuits and if different SpNs have similar developmental trajectories. To resolve these questions, we here characterize the functional intracortical circuits to molecularly identified subpopulations of SpNs with SpN-specific Cre-lines [connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)-dgCre and dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1)-Cre] in in vitro brain slices of the primary auditory cortex using whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings and laser-scanning photostimulation. We targeted three age groups: before [Postnatal Day (P)7&ndash;P9] and after (P14&ndash;P20) the ear canal opening and when circuits are mature (P60&ndash;P80). While the excitatory intracortical circuits impinging on both subtypes were similar, inhibitory circuits differed, particularly those from subplate/L6b. At P7&ndash;P9, Drd1 neurons received stronger inhibition from the subplate compared with CTGF neurons. The functional circuits on SpNs prune with age. By P60&ndash;P80, the inhibitory connections from L6b on CTGF neurons increased and became significantly abundant than those on Drd1 neurons. However, the inhibition strength between the two subtypes remained unchanged. Thus, SpNs exhibit diverse neuronal morphologies and intracortical input patterns, independent of molecular expression. Thus, although the subplate comprises distinct molecular neural classes, molecular expression is not clearly correlated with neural morphologies and functional circuits throughout development.</p>

                <p>How the brain learns new motor commands through reinforcement involves distributed neural circuits beyond known frontal-striatal pathways, yet a comprehensive understanding of this broader neural architecture remains elusive. Here, using human functional MRI (<I>N</I>&nbsp;= 46, 27 females) and manifold learning techniques, we identified a low-dimensional neural space that captured the dynamic changes in whole-brain functional organization during a reward-based trajectory learning task. By quantifying participants&rsquo; learning rates through an Actor&ndash;Critic model, we discovered that periods of accelerated learning were characterized by significant manifold contractions across multiple brain regions, including areas of limbic and hippocampal cortex, as well as the cerebellum. This contraction reflected enhanced network integration, with notably stronger connectivity between several of these regions and the sensorimotor cerebellum correlating with higher learning rates. These findings challenge the traditional view of the cerebellum as solely involved in error-based learning, supporting the emerging view that it coordinates with other brain regions during reinforcement learning.</p>

                <p>Early life stress (ELS) has been shown to disrupt cognitive and limbic functions, yet its impact on sensory systems, particularly the auditory system, remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigated the enduring effects of ELS induced by neonatal maternal separation (MS) on behavioral and cortical processing of sound azimuth in adult male rats. We found that MS significantly impairs sound-azimuth discrimination, paralleled by broader azimuth tuning and reduced dendritic branching and spine density in neurons within the primary auditory cortex. Notably, exposure to an enriched acoustic environment during the stress period effectively protects against these MS-induced alterations, restoring behavioral performance, cortical tuning, and dendritic spine density of neurons to levels comparable with controls. Further analyses reveal that epigenetic regulation of cortical brain-derived neurotrophic factor by histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation may underlie the observed changes in cortical structure and function. These results underscore the profound and lasting impact of MS-induced ELS on auditory processing, particularly within cortical circuits involved in spatial processing. They suggest that sensory enrichment is a potential therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the adverse effects of ELS on sensory processing, with broader implications for understanding and treating sensory deficits in stress-related disorders.</p>

                <p>In everyday tasks, we must often shift our focus away from internal representations held in working memory to engage with perceptual events in the external world. Here, we investigated how our internal focus is reestablished following an interrupting task by tracking the reselection of visual representations and their associated action plans in working memory. Specifically, we asked whether reselection occurs for both visual and motor memory attributes and when this reselection occurs. We developed a visual-motor working-memory task in which participants were retrospectively cued to select one of two memory items before being interrupted by a perceptual discrimination task. To determine what information was reselected, the memory items had distinct visual and motor attributes. To determine when internal representations were reselected, the interrupting task was presented at one of three distinct time points following the retro-cue. We employed electroencephalography time&ndash;frequency analyses to track the initial selection and later reselection of visual and motor representations, as operationalized through modulations of posterior alpha (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) activity relative to the memorized item location (visual) and of central beta (13&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) activity relative to the required response hand (motor). Our results show that internal visual and motor contents were concurrently reselected immediately after completing the interrupting task, rather than only when internal information was required for memory-guided behavior. Thus, following interruption, we swiftly resume our internal focus in working memory through the simultaneous reselection of memorized visual representations and their associated action plans, thereby restoring internal contents to a ready-to-use state.</p>

                <p>by James Webb, Paul Steffan, Benjamin Y. Hayden, Daeyeol Lee, Caleb Kemere, Matthew McGinley</p>

Foraging theory predicts animal behavior in many contexts. In patch-based foraging behaviors, the marginal value theorem (MVT) gives the optimal strategy for deterministic environments whose parameters are fully known to the forager. In natural settings, environmental parameters exhibit variability and are only partially known to the animal based on its experience, creating uncertainty. Models of uncertainty in foraging are well established. However, natural environments also exhibit unpredicted changes in their statistics. As a result, animals must ascertain whether the currently observed quality of the environment is consistent with their internal models, or whether something has changed, creating meta-uncertainty. Behavioral strategies for optimizing foraging behavior under meta-uncertainty, and their neural underpinnings, are largely unknown. Here, we developed a novel behavioral task and computational framework for studying patch-leaving decisions in head-fixed and freely moving mice in conditions of meta-uncertainty. We stochastically varied between-patch travel time, as well as within-patch reward depletion rate. We find that, when uncertainty is minimal, mice adopt patch residence times in a manner consistent with the MVT and not explainable by simple ethologically motivated heuristic strategies. However, behavior in highly variable environments was best explained by modeling both first- and second-order uncertainty in environmental parameters, wherein local variability and global statistics are captured by a Bayesian estimator and dynamic prior, respectively. Thus, mice forage under meta-uncertainty by employing a hierarchical Bayesian strategy, which is essential for efficiently foraging in volatile environments. The results provide a foundation for understanding the neural basis of decision-making that exhibits naturalistic meta-uncertainty.

                <p>by Tessa M. Vergroesen, Vincent Vermeulen, Roeland M. H. Merks</p>

During angiogenesis, endothelial cells expand the vasculature by migrating from existing blood vessels, proliferating and collectively organizing into new capillaries. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experimentation is instrumental for identifying the molecular players and cell behaviour that regulate angiogenesis. Alongside experimental work, computational and mathematical models of endothelial cell network formation have helped to analyse if the current molecular and cellular understanding of endothelial cell behaviour is sufficient to explain the formation of endothelial cell networks. As input, the models take (a subset of) the current knowledge or hypotheses of single cell behaviour and capture it into a dynamical, mathematical description. As output, they predict the multicellular behaviour following from the actions of many individual cells, <i>i.e.</i>, formation of a vascular-like network. Paradoxically, computational modelling based on different assumptions, <i>i.e.</i>, completely different, sometimes non-intersecting sets of observed single cell behaviour, can reproduce the same angiogenesis-like multicellular behaviour, making it practically impossible to decide which, if any, of these models is correct. Here we present dynamical analyses of time-lapses of <i>in vitro</i> endothelial cell network formation experiments and compare these with dynamic analyses of three mathematical models: (1) the cell elongation model; (2) the contact-inhibited chemotaxis model; and (3) the mechanical cell-cell communication model. We extract a variety of dynamical characteristics of endothelial cell network formation using a custom time-lapse video analysis pipeline in ImageJ. We compare the dynamical network characteristics of the <i>in vitro</i> experiments to those of the cellular networks produced by the computational models. We test the response of the <i>in silico</i> dynamical cell network characteristics to changes in cell density and make related changes in the <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Of the three computational models that we have considered, the cell elongation model best captures the remodelling phase of <i>in vitro</i> endothelial cell network formation. Furthermore, in the <i>in vitro</i> model, the final size and number of lacunae in the network are independent of the initial cell density. This observation is also reproduced in the cell elongation model, but not in the other two models that we have considered. Altogether, we present an approach to model validation based on comparisons of time-resolved data and variations of model conditions.

                <p>by Qiyao Zhu, Vikram Khipple Mulligan, Dennis Shasha</p>

Rational computational design is crucial to the pursuit of novel drugs and therapeutic agents. Meso-scale cyclic peptides, which consist of 7-40 amino acid residues, are of particular interest due to their conformational rigidity, binding specificity, degradation resistance, and potential cell permeability. Because there are few natural cyclic peptides, <i>de novo</i> design involving non-canonical amino acids is a potentially useful goal. Here, we develop an efficient pipeline (CyclicChamp) for cyclic peptide design. After converting the cyclic constraint into an error function, we employ a variant of simulated annealing to search for low-energy peptide backbones while maintaining peptide closure. Compared to the previous random sampling approach, which was capable of sampling conformations of cyclic peptides of up to 14 residues, our method both greatly accelerates the computation speed for sampling conformations of small macrocycles (<i>ca</i>. 7 residues), and addresses the high-dimensionality challenge that large macrocycle designs often encounter. As a result, CyclicChamp makes conformational sampling tractable for 15- to 24-residue cyclic peptides, thus permitting the design of macrocycles in this size range. Microsecond-length molecular dynamics simulations on the resulting 15, 20, and 24 amino acid cyclic designs identify designs with kinetic stability. To test their thermodynamic stability, we perform additional replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and generate free energy surfaces. Three 15-residue designs, one 20-residue and one 24-residue design emerge as promising candidates.

A critical step before data-sharing of human neuroimaging is removing facial features to protect individuals’ privacy. However, not only does this process redact identifiable information about individuals, but it also removes non-identifiable information. This introduces undesired variability into downstream analysis and interpretation. This registered report investigated the degree to which the so-called <i>defacing</i> altered the quality assessment of T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images of the human brain from the openly available “IXI dataset”. The effect of defacing on manual quality assessment was investigated on a single-site subset of the dataset (<i>N</i> = 185). By comparing two linear mixed-effects models, we determined that four trained human raters’ perception of quality was significantly influenced by defacing by modeling their ratings on the same set of images in two conditions: “nondefaced” (i.e., preserving facial features) and “defaced”. In addition, we investigated these biases on automated quality assessments by applying repeated-measures, multivariate ANOVA (rm-MANOVA) on the image quality metrics extracted with <i>MRIQC</i> on the full IXI dataset (<i>N</i> = 581; three acquisition sites). This study found that defacing altered the quality assessments by humans and showed that <i>MRIQC</i>’s quality metrics were mostly insensitive to defacing.

How animal brains evolve to support ecological specialization is poorly understood. A recent PLOS Biology study reveals that glial cells show the most dramatic molecular and cellular changes in the brains of fruit flies adapted to a toxic niche, highlighting their underappreciated role in brain evolution.

                Neuronal synapses function within a multifaceted neuropil ecosystem, incorporating astroglia, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Hodebourg et al. review how perisynaptic ecosystems shape synaptic signaling and plasticity, emphasizing the need to consider all cell types to understand adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.

                Lish et al. reveal that AD-protective CLU alleles enhance CLU upregulation in response to accumulated neuropathology, thereby dampening inflammatory signaling between microglia and astrocytes. Using several complementary approaches, they show that CLU upregulation in astrocytes protects neurons from microglia-mediated induction of phospho-tau and synapse loss.

                Sharma et al. show that the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1ɑ is activated in infected lungs, where myeloid IRE1ɑ exacerbates inflammation, cell death, and lung injury. Ablation of myeloid IRE1ɑ or global IRE1ɑ inhibition augments type II interferon response and protects mice against MRSA primary and secondary to influenza pneumonia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96513">Hidden GPCR structural transitions addressed by multiple walker supervised molecular dynamics (mwSuMD)</a></h4>

              
                The structural basis for the pharmacology of human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the most abundant membrane proteins and the target of about 35% of approved drugs, is still a matter of intense study. What makes GPCRs challenging to study is the inherent flexibility and the metastable nature of interaction with extra- and intracellular partners that drive their effects. Here, we present a molecular dynamics (MD) adaptive sampling algorithm, namely multiple walker supervised molecular dynamics (mwSuMD), to address complex structural transitions involving GPCRs without energy input. We first report the binding and unbinding of the vasopressin peptide from its receptor V<sub>2</sub>. Successively, we present the complete transition of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) from inactive to active, agonist and G<sub>s</sub>-bound state, and the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) release from G<sub>s</sub>. To our knowledge, this is the first time the whole sequence of events leading from an inactive GPCR to the GDP release is simulated without any energy bias. We demonstrate that mwSuMD can address complex binding processes intrinsically linked to protein dynamics out of reach of classic MD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102915">DNA replication in primary hepatocytes without the six-subunit ORC</a></h4>

              
                The six-subunit ORC is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. Cancer cell lines in culture can survive and replicate DNA replication after genetic inactivation of individual ORC subunits, ORC1, ORC2, or ORC5. In primary cells, ORC1 was dispensable in the mouse liver for endo-reduplication, but this could be explained by the ORC1 homolog, CDC6, substituting for ORC1 to restore functional ORC. Here, we have created mice with a conditional deletion of ORC2, which does not have a homolog. Although mouse embryo fibroblasts require ORC2 for proliferation, mouse hepatocytes synthesize DNA in cell culture and endo-reduplicate in vivo without ORC2. Mouse livers endo-reduplicate after simultaneous deletion of ORC1 and ORC2 both during normal development and after partial hepatectomy. Since endo-reduplication initiates DNA synthesis like normal S phase replication these results unequivocally indicate that primary cells, like cancer cell lines, can load MCM2-7 and initiate replication without ORC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90668">Interpreting roles of mutations associated with the emergence of S. aureus USA300 strains using transcriptional regulatory network reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> clonal complex 8 (CC8) is made up of several subtypes with varying levels of clinical burden; from community-associated methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> USA300 strains to hospital-associated (HA-MRSA) USA500 strains and ancestral methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains. This phenotypic distribution within a single clonal complex makes CC8 an ideal clade to study the emergence of mutations important for antibiotic resistance and community spread. Gene-level analysis comparing USA300 against MSSA and HA-MRSA strains have revealed key horizontally acquired genes important for its rapid spread in the community. However, efforts to define the contributions of point mutations and indels have been confounded by strong linkage disequilibrium resulting from clonal propagation. To break down this confounding effect, we combined genetic association testing with a model of the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) to find candidate mutations that may have led to changes in gene regulation. First, we used a De Bruijn graph genome-wide association study to enrich mutations unique to the USA300 lineages within CC8. Next, we reconstructed the TRN by using independent component analysis on 670 RNA-sequencing samples from USA300 and non-USA300 CC8 strains which predicted several genes with strain-specific altered expression patterns. Examination of the regulatory region of one of the genes enriched by both approaches, <i>isdH</i>, revealed a 38-bp deletion containing a Fur-binding site and a conserved single-nucleotide polymorphism which likely led to the altered expression levels in USA300 strains. Taken together, our results demonstrate the utility of reconstructed TRNs to address the limits of genetic approaches when studying emerging pathogenic strains.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104237">Engineering cardiolipin binding to an artificial membrane protein reveals determinants for lipid-mediated stabilization</a></h4>

              
                Integral membrane proteins carry out essential functions in the cell, and their activities are often modulated by specific protein-lipid interactions in the membrane. Here, we elucidate the intricate role of cardiolipin (CDL), a regulatory lipid, as a stabilizer of membrane proteins and their complexes. Using the in silico-designed model protein TMHC4_R (ROCKET) as a scaffold, we employ a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and native mass spectrometry to explore the protein features that facilitate preferential lipid interactions and mediate stabilization. We find that the spatial arrangement of positively charged residues as well as local conformational flexibility are factors that distinguish stabilizing from non-stabilizing CDL interactions. However, we also find that even in this controlled, artificial system, a clear-cut distinction between binding and stabilization is difficult to attain, revealing that overlapping lipid contacts can partially compensate for the effects of binding site mutations. Extending our insights to naturally occurring proteins, we identify a stabilizing CDL site within the <i>E. coli</i> rhomboid intramembrane protease GlpG and uncover its regulatory influence on enzyme substrate preference. In this work, we establish a framework for engineering functional lipid interactions, paving the way for the design of proteins with membrane-specific properties or functions.

                Synaptic inhibition is the mechanistic backbone of a suite of cortical functions, not the least of which are maintaining network stability and modulating neuronal gain. In cortical models with a single inhibitory neuron class, network stabilization and gain control work in opposition to one another – meaning high gain coincides with low stability and vice versa. It is now clear that cortical inhibition is diverse, with molecularly distinguished cell classes having distinct positions within the cortical circuit. We analyze circuit models with pyramidal neurons (E) as well as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) expressing interneurons. We show how, in E – PV – SOM recurrently connected networks, SOM-mediated modulation can lead to simultaneous increases in neuronal gain and network stability. Our work exposes how the impact of a modulation mediated by SOM neurons depends critically on circuit connectivity and the network state.

                Thermal nociception in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is regulated by the Ca²<sup>+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CMK-1, but its downstream effectors have remained unclear. Here, we combined in vitro kinase assays with mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to identify hundreds of CMK-1 substrates, including the calcineurin A subunit TAX-6, phosphorylated within its conserved regulatory domain. Genetic and pharmacological analyses reveal multiple antagonistic interactions between CMK-1 and calcineurin signaling in modulating both naive thermal responsiveness and adaptation to repeated noxious stimuli. Cell-specific manipulations indicate that CMK-1 acts in AFD and ASER thermo-sensory neurons, while TAX-6 functions in FLP thermo-sensory neurons and downstream interneurons. Since CMK-1 and TAX-6 act in distinct cell types, the phosphorylation observed in vitro might not directly underlie the behavioral phenotype. Instead, the opposing effects seem to arise from their distributed roles within the sensory circuit. Overall, our study provides (1) a resource of candidate CMK-1 targets for further dissecting CaM kinase signaling and (2) evidence of a previously unrecognized, circuit-level antagonism between CMK-1 and calcineurin pathways. These findings highlight a complex interplay of signaling modules that modulate thermal nociception and adaptation, offering new insights into potentially conserved mechanisms that shape nociceptive plasticity and pain (de)sensitization in more complex nervous systems.

">High-resolution phenotypic screen in zebrafish identifies novel regulators of CNS axon diameter growth</a></h4>

              
                Axon diameter varies up to 100-fold between distinct neurons in the central nervous system with larger axons exhibiting proportionally faster conduction velocity. Axon diameter influences myelination, can be dynamically regulated, which might help fine-tune neural circuit function, and is altered in several diseases. Despite its importance, mechanisms regulating axon diameter remain poorly understood. This gap in understanding is due in part to the limitations of fixed tissue analyses, such as electron microscopy, which cannot be scaled up to execute discovery screens. To address this, we developed a high-resolution, high-content imaging-based in vivo platform to identify pharmacological modulators of axon diameter in zebrafish. We focused on the Mauthner neuron, whose axon diameter growth can be monitored during development. To facilitate our high-content chemical screen, we developed an automated high-resolution imaging and image analysis pipeline to assess changes in Mauthner axon diameter in transgenic reporter animals. We screened 880 compounds and identified 33 that altered Mauthner axon diameter. Validating this discovery pipeline, we confirmed that compounds that affect beta-2 adrenoceptor and dopamine signaling increase axon diameter in separate follow-up studies.

">Passive muscle forces in Drosophila are large but insufficient to support a flys weight</a></h4>

              
                Movement of a limb is shaped by active forces generated by muscle contraction but also by passive forces within individual muscles and joints. In small animals such as insects, the contribution of passive forces to limb movement can match the active forces. However, most measurements of passive forces are limited to the femur-tibia joint in large insects. Here we take advantage of genetic tools in Drosophila to measure passive torques at multiple joints in the flys leg. We genetically inactivate all the motor neurons to assess passive forces. We find that the passive torques are well approximated by a linear spring, i.e., the passive torques linearly increase with angular deviation from the rest angle. The torques are much larger than the gravitational torque due to the leg itself. We estimate that the passive torques are seventy times smaller than necessary to support the weight of the animal. We also inactivated all the motor neurons in a freely standing fly and found that, as predicted from the model, the fly falls when the motor neurons are inactivated. We found that the height at which a fly stands, and, therefore the active forces vary. The flys height affects the time to initiate a fall. The time it takes for the fall is consistent with the active forces decaying with a time constant of ~100 ms. Thus, although passive forces are strong and will have a large effect on limb kinematics, they are not strong enough to support the weight of the fly.

">Cryptic intronic transcriptional initiation generates efficient endogenous mRNA templates for C9orf72-associated RAN translation</a></h4>

              
                Intronic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Despite its intronic location, this repeat avidly supports synthesis of pathogenic dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins via repeat-associated non AUG (RAN) translation. However, the template RNA species that undergoes RAN translation endogenously remains unclear. Using long-read based 5 prime RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Repeat RLM RACE), we identified novel C9orf72 transcripts initiating within intron 1 in a C9BAC mouse model, patient derived iNeurons, and iNeuron derived polysomes. These cryptic m7G capped mRNAs are at least partially polyadenylated and are more abundant than transcripts derived from intron retention or circular intron lariats. In RAN translation reporter assays, novel intronic template transcripts, even those with short (32 nucleotide) leaders, exhibited robust expression compared to exon-intron and repeat-containing lariat reporters. To assess endogenous lariat repeat RNA contributions to RAN translation, we enhanced endogenous lariat stability by knocking down the lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1. However, this modulation did not impact DPR production in patient-derived iNeurons. These findings identify cryptic, linear, m7G capped intronic-initiating C9orf72 mRNAs as an endogenous template for RAN translation and DPR production, with implications for disease pathogenesis and therapeutic development.

">Whey Protein Phospholipid Concentrate Supplementation Prevents High-Fat Diet Induced Cognitive Impairment in Wistar Rats by Promoting Brain Neuronal Connectivity and Sphingolipid Clearance</a></h4>

              
                Whey protein phospholipid concentrate (WPPC), a byproduct of whey protein processing, is high in phospholipids and glycoconjugates which serve as substrates for fatty acids and sugar monomers (e.g. sialic acid) critical to neuronal myelin synthesis in the brain. This led us to hypothesize that WPPC will improve cognitive impairment induced by a high fat (HF) diet by promoting myelin turnover and improving myelin-dependent processes associated with encoding and storing memory. Male Wistar rats were randomized to one of four diets starting at weaning to ~6.5 months on age: a low-fat (LF) diet containing 10% fat by weight, a HF diet containing 45% fat by weight to induce cognitive impairment, and a HF diet containing either 1.6% or 10% WPPC by weight (n=12 per diet). Rats were subjected to cognitive testing after 2 and 4 months of dietary intervention and then implanted with chronic bipolar electrodes to measure axonal evoked responses within the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal circuitry. Phospholipid and sphingolipid components of myelin were quantified in the hippocampus. There were no significant differences in cognition measured by novel object recognition after 2 months of supplementation. At 4 months, rats on the HF diet performed significantly worse than rats on the LF, HF1.6 and HF10 diets. The beneficial effects of WPPC on cognition were due to a partial reversal in evoked response impairments in hippocampal memory storage. Additionally, hippocampus sphingolipids were higher in rats on the HF diet compared to the LF, HF1.6 and HF10 groups. These findings demonstrate that WPPC prevented cognitive impairment induced by a HF diet by regulating entorhinal cortex-hippocampal circuitries associated with memory storage, though modulating myelin turnover.

">Environmental enrichment selectively restores brain metabolic activity during cocaine abstinence</a></h4>

              
                Background: Environmental enrichment (EE) is a promising strategy to promote recovery from addiction, but its neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates how exposure to EE during abstinence dynamically affects brain neuroadaptations induced by voluntary intake of cocaine. Methods: Using longitudinal 18FDG microPET imaging, we examined brain metabolic activity in rats following extended access cocaine self-administration. After establishing escalation of cocaine intake, rats were housed in either enriched or standard environments during a four-week abstinence period. Brain metabolic activity was assessed after one and four weeks of abstinence. Results: Cocaine self-administration produced widespread decreases in cortical metabolic activity, particularly in regions involved in executive function (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate) and interoception (insula), while increasing activity in emotional and motivational circuits (nucleus accumbens, amygdala, mesencephalon). EE selectively normalized these alterations through temporally distinct mechanisms: rapidly restoring nucleus accumbens and amygdala function while gradually affecting prefrontal cortical activity. After four weeks, rats housed in enriched environments showed significantly normalized metabolic activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum compared to those in standard housing, with persistent changes in anterior cingulate cortex and ventral posterior hippocampus. Conclusions: Our findings reveal circuit-specific and temporally distinct effects of environmental enrichment on cocaine-induced brain alterations. These insights could inform the development of more targeted therapeutic approaches for addiction recovery.

">Single-dose DMT reverses anhedonia and cognitive deficits via restoration of neurogenesis in a stress-induced depression model.</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a leading cause of disability worldwide, with current treatments limited by delayed onset and low efficacy. The serotonergic psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early clinical studies, yet its mechanisms and efficacy remain poorly characterized in established models of depression. Here, we evaluated the effects of a single dose of DMT in the Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (UCMS) paradigm, a robust mouse model recapitulating key features of MDD, including anhedonia and cognitive impairment. DMT administered after UCMS reversed depressive-like behavior and restored cognitive performance, outperforming chronic fluoxetine across most domains. When administered during the stress period, DMT prevented the development of anhedonia but did not rescue cognitive deficits, suggesting partial protection. Notably, DMT remained effective under isoflurane anesthesia, indicating that its therapeutic action can occur independently of the psychedelic experience. Histological analyses revealed that all DMT regimes significantly increased adult-born granule cell (abGC) integration and reduced the number of ectopically abnormally integrated abGCs. Together, our findings highlight the robust and multifaceted effects of DMT on behavior and neurogenesis, positioning it as a promising candidate for rapid-acting antidepressant strategies that target structural circuit repair.

">Neural dynamics encoding risky choices during deliberation reveal separate choice subspaces</a></h4>

              
                Human decision-making involves the coordinated activity of multiple brain areas, acting in concert, to enable humans to make choices. Most decisions are carried out under conditions of uncertainty, where the desired outcome may not be achieved if the wrong decision is made. In these cases, humans deliberate before making a choice. The neural dynamics underlying deliberation are unknown and intracranial recordings in clinical settings present a unique opportunity to record high temporal resolution electrophysiological data from many (hundreds) brain locations during behavior. Combined with dynamic systems modeling, these allow identification of latent brain states that describe the neural dynamics during decision-making, providing insight into these neural dynamics and computations. Results show that the neural dynamics underlying risky decision, but not decisions without risk, converge to separate subspaces depending on the subject's preferred choice and that the degree of overlap between these subspaces declines as choice approaches, suggesting a network level representation of evidence accumulation. These results bridge the gap between regression analyses and data driven models of latent states and suggest that during risky decisions, deliberation and evidence accumulation toward a final decision are represented by the same neural dynamics, providing novel insights into the neural computations underlying human choice.

">Proprioceptive and visual motion detection acuity contribute to children dynamic postural control</a></h4>

              
                Acquiring efficient postural control strategies is key to children proper motor development. For that, the brain needs to continuously integrate sensory information and convert it into corrective motor commands. Although this entire process naturally hinges on the reliability of early senses, very few studies have investigated early sensory acuity and its role in postural stability during development. Clarifying this could lead to a better understanding of conditions, such as developmental coordination disorder (DCD), where the impairment of balance control is substantial. Here, we tested 25 typically developed school-aged children with a Visual Motion Detection test (VMDT), an ankle Joint Position Sense test (aJPST), force-plate assessed posturography, and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second edition (MABC-2). We found a significant correlation between the balance score of the MABC-2 and both VMDT score (r = 0.60, p = 0.003) and aJPST score (r = -0.47, p = 0.02). However, no such relationship was found between the force-plate assessed sway amplitude during upright standing and the two sensory acuity scores. Importantly, the MABC-2 balance scores were associated with upright stability, but only to a limited extent. Given that the MABC-2 balance component factors in static and dynamic balance while posturography focuses only on static balance, our results point at a key role of early sensory acuity for dynamic balance. Together, these findings bring attention to possible clinical tools for motor impairment detection and subsequent rehabilitation strategies during development.

">Calcium-permeable AMPAR in hippocampal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons protect against memory interference</a></h4>

              
                Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons exert exquisite control over spike output, and plasticity in these inhibitory circuits may be important for maintaining network stability in learning and memory. PV+ interneuron recruitment is primarily mediated by GluA2-lacking Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPAR), which support anti-Hebbian plasticity. However, the functional significance of CP-AMPAR-mediated plasticity remains unknown. Using a viral approach to artificially express the GluA2 subunit in hippocampal PV+ interneurons, we replaced CP-AMPAR with GluA2-containing receptors, and in doing so reduced synaptically-evoked Ca2+ transients and anti-Hebbian plasticity. Transfection of hippocampal PV+ interneurons with GluA2 resulted in delay-dependent spatial working memory deficits which increased across trials per session, and impaired reversal learning in the Morris water maze but not initial acquisition. Our data suggest that loss of CP-AMPAR-mediated plasticity in these cells leads to proactive interference, revealing a significant role for dynamic recruitment of PV+ interneurons in the segregation of memories and accurate memory retrieval.

                The lateral habenula (LHb), which plays a critical role in value-based decision-making and in stress responses, is linked to drug addiction and mood disorders. Prior research from our lab demonstrated the LHb's responsiveness to corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), yet the origin of CRF inputs to this region remained elusive. Here, we mapped CRF projections to the LHb, revealing several contributing brain regions and a subpopulation of CRF-expressing LHb neurons (LHbCRF) along with their downstream targets. Chemogenetic activation of LHbCRF neurons did not affect conditioned place preference or anxiety-related behaviors in mice of either sex. However, it enhanced passive action-locking responses to a simulated aerial threat in both male and female mice as well as induced subtle sex-specific differences in escape latency which aligned with our observation of higher basal spontaneous activity in male LHbCRF neurons. These findings indicate that LHbCRF neurons can promote passive defensive responses to immediate danger, with baseline activity potentially influencing the timing of escape.

">Spatial Dynamics and Functional Connectivity in EEG: Insights from Lexical Processing</a></h4>

              
                Lexical processing is a core cognitive function involving the integration of semantic and symbolic information across distributed brain networks. In this study, we investigate the spatial dynamics and functional connectivity underlying lexical categorization using electroencephalography (EEG) data from a silent reading task. Participants were presented with words from two categories, social and numeric, while EEG signals were recorded and analyzed. Frequency band power and inter-electrode coherence were extracted as features to train Random Forest classifiers for word category prediction. The spatial dynamics model, based on band power from selected electrodes, achieved 100% classification accuracy and identified region- and frequency-specific contributions, notably in the theta and alpha bands across parietal and occipital regions. A complementary functional connectivity model achieved 85% accuracy, highlighting the role of inter-regional coherence in lexical differentiation. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional EEG analysis with machine learning for decoding semantic categories, providing foundational insights for future brain-computer interface applications.

">Safety learning induces postsynaptic potentiation of direct pathway spiny projection neurons in the tail of the striatum</a></h4>

              
                The association of a sensory cue with an outcome is a crucial step in learning to identify safe versus threatening situations. Here we assessed how learned sound-safety association alters neuronal activity in tail of the striatum (TS), where auditory cortical and thalamic inputs converge. Prior to training, foot shock elicited responses by TS direct and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs), while sound tones produced no response. However, once the sound association was learned, sound tones strongly activated TS SPNs, even when the animal was under anesthesia. This conditioned auditory response occurred concurrently with alterations of direct pathway SPNs in the TS, including increased responses to cortical and auditory thalamic inputs, increased excitatory response with an enhanced ratio of NMDA to AMPA receptors, decreased responses to inhibitory input, and increased dendritic spines. This convergence of postsynaptic changes provides responses to relevant auditory cues during associative learning.

">Platelet concentrate-derived extracellular vesicles promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that platelet concentrate (PC) derivatives harbor neuroregenerative potential. Here, we evaluated the neurogenic effects of PC-derived human platelet lysate (HPPL) and extracellular vesicles (pEVs) on neural precursor cells using both an ex vivo neurosphere assay and an in vivo intranasal delivery model in adult mice. pEVs selectively enhanced the proliferation of dentate gyrus (DG)-derived neurospheres, and this region-specific effect persisted even without exogenous growth factors. In line with these findings, short-term intranasal administration of pEVs significantly increased cell proliferation in the DG. Long-term (28-day) pEVs treatment further elevated the proportion of newborn mature neurons in the DG, whereas HPPL primarily increased both proliferation and the number of immature neurons. Proteomic profiling of DG tissue after pEV treatment revealed 111 differentially expressed proteins, enriched in pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, myelination, Notch4 signaling, and MHC class I processing. These findings identify allogeneic PC-derived EVs as potent, cell-free agents capable of promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis and brain repair through metabolic and immunoregulatory mechanisms.

">Periventricular Diffusivity Reflects APOE4-modulated Amyloid Accumulation and Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimers Continuum</a></h4>

              
                Background: Altered glymphatic-related fluid dynamics are increasingly recognized as a key feature of Alzheimers disease (AD). We generalized an established diffusion imaging technique to estimate periventricular diffusivity (PVeD), hypothesizing that fast diffusion signals in the periventricular region can reflect amyloid-beta deposition across the AD continuum. Methods: Participants from two multi-site cohorts (n = 440 and 414), comprising cognitively unimpaired individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with AD, were included. We tested and validated the association of PVeD with amyloid-beta burden and core AD characteristics. Results: Lower PVeD was extensively associated with greater amyloid-beta burden, neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and clinical severity. Importantly, the relationship between PVeD and amyloid-beta burden was significantly modulated by APOE4 status, with APOE4 carriers showing a stronger negative association. Baseline PVeD also predicted longitudinal cognitive decline. Discussion: These findings suggest that periventricular fast diffusion signals can reflect APOE4-modulated amyloid-beta burden and cognitive decline in AD.

">Digital Twin Brain Predicts rTMS Effects on Brain State Dynamics in Chronic Tinnitus</a></h4>

              
                Predicting repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) effects on whole-brain dynamics in clinical populations is crucial for developing personalized therapies and advancing precision medicine in brain disorders. This study provides the first proof-of-concept demonstrating that the Digital Twin Brain (DTB) can forecast rTMS effects on brain state dynamics in individuals with brain disorders (chronic tinnitus). First, we identified two aberrant brain states that predominantly overlapped with the somatomotor and default mode networks, respectively. Subsequently, we developed DTB for patients and derived regional responses for each brain region, revealing distinct roles of the parieto-occipital and frontal regions. Mechanistically, we examined the biological plausibility using tinnitus-specific risk genes and investigated the multi-scale neurobiological relevance. Clinically, we found that DTB can predict rTMS effects in an independent, longitudinal dataset (all r > 0.78). Particularly, the predictive capacity exhibits a state-specific nature. Overall, this work proposes a novel DTB-based framework for predicting rTMS effects in clinical populations and provides the first empirical evidence supporting its clinical utility. This approach may be generalizable to other brain disorders and neuromodulation techniques, promoting broader advancements in brain health.

">Functional connectivity patterns as an early indicator of later very early preterm outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal functional brain development associated with preterm birth has been widely reported; however, the neural brain architectures of later neurodevelopmental difficulties are not yet fully understood. Here, we applied connectome-based predictive modeling approaches to identify the brain networks associated with later neurocognitive scores at 2-3 years of age in very preterm infants (<31 weeks gestation, N=79) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The whole-brain functional connectome soon after birth successfully predicted verbal ability at 3 years of corrected age (r=0.53, p=4.04x10^(-7)) and motor ability at age 2 (r=0.39, p=0.0004) in very preterm infants. In particular, we found that functional edges between the frontoparietal network and limbic, motor, and medial frontal networks at birth contributed significantly to the prediction of future verbal language ability, while the edges connecting the medial frontal network and motor and basal ganglia networks contributed the most to the prediction of future motor ability. In a separate validation analysis, we demonstrated that the mean connectivity strength among these top brain networks significantly differentiated (average accuracy 76%, p<0.001) poor from normal performers at 2 and 3 years corrected ages. These findings highlight regional functional connectivity soon after birth as a promising biomarker for identifying risks for later brain disorders, which could inform the targeted development of effective early treatments and interventions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Extensive studies have demonstrated significant gray matter atrophy in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD); however, the underlying gene expression mechanisms remain largely unknown. To comprehensively characterize the gray matter volume alterations in PD patients, we conducted a neuroimaging meta-analysis and validated the observed atrophic phenotypes in an independent dataset. Leveraging the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), we linked brain transcriptomic data to neuroimaging phenotypes to identify genes associated with PD-related gray matter atrophy. Further enrichment analyses and functional characterization explored the potential roles of these correlated genes in disease pathology. Both the neuroimaging meta-analysis and independent dataset analysis consistently revealed significant gray matter atrophy in PD, particularly in the superior temporal gyrus, highly associated with sensory and motor functions. Spatial transcriptome-neuroimaging correlation analysis identified 1,952 overlapping genes whose expression levels were significantly correlated with the spatial distribution of gray matter atrophy in PD patients. These genes were enriched in several key biological processes and molecular pathways, exhibiting region- and cell type-specific expression, particularly in dopaminergic receptor neurons of brain tissue. This study delineates the spatial distribution of gray matter atrophy in PD and suggests that this neurodegenerative phenotype may result from complex interactions among multiple functionally relevant genes.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>White matter, comprising approximately 50% of the human brain, is crucial for efficient neuronal signaling and a wide range of brain functions, including social cognition, sensation, memory, motor control, and information integration across cortical brain regions in the service of perception and cognition. White matter, composed of myelinated axons, results from complex interactions between different cell types, with oligodendrocytes (OLs) and microglia playing integral roles. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, regulate oligodendrogenesis through phagocytosis and molecular signaling, for example through cytokines, which promote and inhibit maturation stages of OL lineage cells. Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a recognized risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The physiological presentation of ASD includes white matter abnormalities and immune dysregulation. Emerging evidence indicates that MIA may reduce microglial reactivity and alter cytokine release in offspring, potentially disrupting the delicate balance required for proper white matter development. Understanding the intricate interplay between oligodendrocytes, microglia, inflammation, and white matter development in the context of MIA provides valuable insights into the etiology of and core symptoms of ASD and possible therapeutic targets.</span>

This study investigates the refined theoretical framework. Neuroimaging datasets from 60 MDD and 60 healthy controls were obtained from the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression database, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). The cerebral cortex was parcellated using the modular analysis and similarity measurements (MOSI) technique. For each node, the average amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (avgALFF) and nodal strength were calculated. Correlation analyses were conducted to establish an adjacency matrix and assess the relationship between nodal power and strength. The results indicated that the LM system in MDD displayed higher partition numbers and avgALFF (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.005). A significant negative correlation between nodal strength and power was replicated (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 1E-10), suggesting that greater functional input enhances regional neural suppression. Notably, MDD participants exhibited a higher negative correlation between FP nodal power and LM-FP connectivity (stronger suppression) but a lower negative correlation between LM nodal power and FP-LM connectivity (weaker suppression). These findings support the theory of abnormal cortical signal organization and reciprocal suppression in MDD.</span>

Tregs reduce microglial reactivity, assist in regenerative and reparative processes, and promote differentiation of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain, thus modulating white matter development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2784/v2?src=rss">In vitro comparison of three earwax removal formulations for the disintegration of earwax [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Impacted cerumen is a widespread reason that patients visit their health care providers. It effects approximately 2–6% of the general population and disproportionately impacts up to 65% of patients over 65. This study compared a new cerumen (earwax) removal product (Solution 1; EOS-002; a glycolic acid/bicarbonate formulation) versus two commercially available products (Solution 2 and Solution 3; both containing carbamide peroxide 6.5%) for their cerumenolytic activity in vitro. Methods Samples of human cerumen were placed in 10 x 75 mm polypropylene test tubes. Approximately 1 mL of each test solution was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The vials were shaken at the 15- and 30-minute time points to simulate rinsing in a clinical setting. Breakdown of the cerumen was graded at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 30-minute time points in a masked manner on a 5-point scale (Grade 0 = no change; Grade 4 = complete disintegration). Results Significantly greater disintegration of the cerumen was observed in the samples exposed to EOS-002 at every time point (P < 0.0001). At 5 minutes, disintegration was observed in 39 out of 43 samples exposed to EOS-002, 0 out of 24 samples exposed to Solution 2, and 1 out of 19 samples exposed to Solution 3. Mean disintegration scores at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes were 1.65, 2.38, 2.95, and 3.24 for EOS-002; 0, 0, 0, and 0.2 for Solution 2; and 0.05, 0.13, 0.16, and 0.21 for Solution 3, respectively. Discussion EOS-002 exhibited a significantly greater ability to breakdown cerumen than the two other products. Disintegration of cerumen occurred with EOS-002 within 5 minutes in 91% (39/43) of the samples. Therefore, EOS-002 provides rapid disintegration of human cerumen in vitro.

                Background Incessant incidences have led to losses of several lives and huge investments in many developing countries, particularly Nigeria. This study evaluated fire safety management strategies of selected shopping malls in the city of Abuja, Nigeria in order to identify specific areas that require improvement. Methods The research adopted a case study approach and analysis of data through qualitative means. An observation guide designed for the study was used to collect data. The data were content analysed and the findings reported in themes with the aid of tables and photographs to enhance clarity and understanding. Results The result revealed that the efficacy of active fire safety strategies of the shopping malls exhibited various levels of inadequacies. Fire prevention devices such as sprinklers, smoke detectors and drenchers were either not provided or sparsely provided. The prevalent fire-mitigation devices found in the malls were fire extinguishers and fire buckets, which are grossly inadequate to prevent the rapid spread of large-scale fire. The passive fire safety measures of the malls also exhibited some levels of inadequacies. The study underscored the need for fire safety strategies in public buildings, particularly large-scale commercial structures with high capacity of users, to be adequately provided and managed in adherence to standard practice and building code requirements. Conclusion The study recommends that building professionals should adapt innovative means to mitigate fire risk in the planning and development of commercial buildings. Also, making provisions to accommodate impulsive human behaviour during times of chaos should be a primary design consideration for building designers. The study emphasizes the need for further attention and improvement in fire safety management strategies implementation in commercial buildings, especially large-scale public facilities such as shopping malls, in order to appreciably guide against the devastating effect of fire in case of an occurrence.

                <p>Scientific progress often hinges on the courage to question conventional models and embrace exploratory research. This commentary examines the importance of curiosity-driven science by drawing on historical and contemporary examples, from Darwin's unconventional research methodologies to modern neuroscience investigations that challenge the constraints of traditional laboratory environments. An over-reliance on predictable, controlled conditions&mdash;particularly in select rodent models&mdash;has potentially limited the translational impact of neuroscience. By exploring novel research paradigms, including raccoon neural investigations and rodent-driven vehicles (ROVs), the value of expanding research models to incorporate diverse species and environments is examined. As neuroscience advances, the field must move beyond the metaphorical lamp post, venturing into uncharted territory to fully capture the complexity of neurobiological variables. By fostering a culture of discovery over predictability&mdash;supported by innovative and exploratory mentoring approaches&mdash;we can illuminate new frontiers in neuroscience and develop transformative insights for mental health and beyond.</p>

                <p>Individuals with normal hearing exhibit considerable variability in their capacity to understand speech in noisy environments. Previous research suggests the cause of this variance may be due to individual differences in cognition and auditory perception. To investigate the impact of cognitive and perceptual differences on speech comprehension, 25 adult human participants with normal hearing completed numerous cognitive and psychoacoustic tasks including the Flanker, Stroop, Trail Making, reading span, and temporal fine structure tests. They also completed a continuous multitalker spatial attention task while neural activity was recorded using electroencephalography. The auditory cortical N1 response was extracted as a measure of neural speech encoding during continuous speech listening using an engineered "chirped-speech" (Cheech) stimulus. We compared N1 component morphologies of target and masker speech stimuli to assess neural correlates of attentional gains while listening to concurrently played short story narratives. Performance on cognitive and psychoacoustic tasks was used to predict N1 component amplitude differences between attended and unattended speech using multiple regression. Results show inhibitory control and working memory abilities can predict N1 amplitude differences between the target and masker stories. Interestingly, none of the cognitive and psychoacoustic predictors correlated with behavioral speech-in-noise listening performance in the attention task, suggesting that neural measures may capture different aspects of cognitive and auditory processing compared with behavioral measures alone.</p>

                <p>Chronic pain affects millions globally, yet no universally effective treatment exists. The primary motor cortex (M1) has been a key target for chronic pain therapies, with electrical stimulation of the M1 (eMCS) showing promise. However, the mechanisms underlying M1-mediated analgesic effects are not fully understood. We investigated the role of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in M1-mediated analgesia using a neuropathic pain mouse model. In this model, neuropathic pain is associated with increased spontaneous activity of layer V pyramidal neurons (LV-PNs) in the S1, partly attributed to the reduced activity of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SST<sup>+</sup> INs), which normally suppress LV-PNs. While manipulation of either LV-PNs or SST<sup>+</sup> INs has been shown to alleviate pain, the role of S1 in M1-mediated analgesia has not been identified. Using multichannel silicon probes, we applied eMCS to neuropathic mice and observed significant analgesia. Histological analyses revealed that eMCS activated SST<sup>+</sup> INs and suppressed hyperactivity of LV-PNs in the S1, suggesting that eMCS suppresses pain by modulating S1 neuronal circuits, alongside other pain-related regions. Notably, eMCS induced long-lasting analgesia, persisting for at least 2&nbsp;d poststimulation. These findings implicate S1 as a critical mediator of eMCS-induced analgesia and suggest eMCS as a potential durable therapeutic strategy for chronic pain.</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC) was characterized by marked disparities in disease burdens across neighborhoods. Accurate neighborhood-level forecasts are critical for planning more equitable resource allocation to reduce health inequalities; however, such spatially high-resolution forecasts remain scarce in operational use. In this study, we analyze aggregated foot traffic data derived from mobile devices to measure the connectivity among 42 NYC neighborhoods driven by various human activities such as dining, shopping, and entertainment. Using real-world time-varying contact patterns in different place categories, we develop a parsimonious behavior-driven epidemic model that incorporates population mixing, indoor crowdedness, dwell time, and seasonality of virus transmissibility. We fit this model to neighborhood-level COVID-19 case data in NYC and further couple this model with a data assimilation algorithm to generate short-term forecasts of neighborhood-level COVID-19 cases in 2020. We find differential contact patterns and connectivity between neighborhoods driven by different human activities. The behavior-driven model supports accurate modeling of neighborhood-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission throughout 2020. In the best-fitting model, we estimate that the force of infection (FOI) in indoor settings increases sublinearly with crowdedness and dwell time. Retrospective forecasting demonstrates that this behavior-driven model generates improved short-term forecasts in NYC neighborhoods compared to several baseline models. Our findings indicate that aggregated foot-traffic data for routine human activities can support neighborhood-level COVID-19 forecasts in NYC. This behavior-driven model may be adapted for use with other respiratory pathogens sharing similar transmission routes.

                <p>by Alexandra Zahradníková, Jana Pavelková, Miroslav Sabo, Sefer Baday, Ivan Zahradník</p>

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) serve for excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells in a noticeably different way, not fully understood at the molecular level. We addressed the structure of skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac (RyR2) isoforms relevant to gating by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (M<sup>2+</sup>). Bioinformatics analysis of RyR structures ascertained the EF-hand loops as the M<sup>2+</sup> binding inhibition site and revealed its allosteric coupling to the channel gate. The intra-monomeric inactivation pathway interacts with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation pathway in both RyR isoforms, and the inter-monomeric pathway, stronger in RyR1, couples to the gate through the S23*-loop of the neighbor monomer. These structural findings were implemented in the model of RyR operation based on statistical mechanics and the Monod-Wyman-Changeux theorem. The model, which defines closed, open, and inactivated macrostates allosterically coupled to M<sup>2+</sup>-binding activation and inhibition sites, approximated the open probability data for both RyR1 and RyR2 channels at a broad range of M<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. The proposed mechanism of RyR operation provides a new interpretation of the structural and functional data of mammalian RyR channels on common grounds. This may provide a new platform for designing pharmacological interventions in the relevant diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscles. The synthetic approach developed in this work may find general use in deciphering mechanisms of ion channel functions.

While the excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major driver of the global antibiotic resistance crisis, more selective therapies remain unavailable for the majority of bacterial pathogens. This includes the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of the genus <i>Chlamydia</i>, which cause millions of urogenital, ocular, and respiratory infections each year. Conducting a comprehensive search of the chemical space for novel antichlamydial activities, we identified over 60 compounds that are chemically diverse, structurally distinct from known antibiotics, non-toxic to human cells, and highly potent in preventing the growth of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> in cell cultures. Some blocked <i>C. trachomatis</i> development reversibly, while others eradicated both established and persistent infections in a bactericidal manner. The top molecules displayed compelling selectivity, yet broad activity against diverse <i>Chlamydia</i> strains and species, including both urogenital and ocular serovars of <i>C</i><i>.</i> <i>trachomatis</i>, as well as <i>Chlamydia muridarum</i> and <i>Chlamydia caviae</i>. Some compounds also displayed synergies with clinically used antibiotics. Critically, we found the most potent antichlamydial compound to inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis via covalent binding to the active site of <i>Chlamydia</i> FabH, identifying a new mechanism of FabH inhibition and highlighting a possible way to selectively treat <i>Chlamydia</i> infections.

                <p>by Daehan Lee, Michael P. Shahandeh, Liliane Abuin, Richard Benton</p>

To explore how brains change upon species evolution, we generated single-cell transcriptomic atlases of the central brains of three closely related but ecologically distinct drosophilids: the generalists <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>Drosophila simulans</i>, and the noni fruit specialist <i>Drosophila sechellia</i>. The global cellular composition of these species’ brains is well-conserved, but we predicted a few cell types with different frequencies, notably perineurial glia of the blood–brain barrier, which we validate <i>in vivo</i>. Gene expression analysis revealed that distinct cell types evolve at different rates and patterns, with glial populations exhibiting the greatest divergence between species. Compared to the <i>D. melanogaster</i> brain, cellular composition and gene expression patterns are more divergent in <i>D. sechellia</i> than in <i>D. simulans</i>—despite their similar phylogenetic distance from <i>D. melanogaster</i>—indicating that the specialization of <i>D. sechellia</i> is reflected in the structure and function of its brain. Expression changes in <i>D. sechellia</i> include several metabolic signaling genes, suggestive of adaptations to its novel source of nutrition. Additional single-cell transcriptomic analysis on <i>D. sechellia</i> revealed genes and cell types responsive to dietary supplement with noni, pointing to glia as sites for both physiological and genetic adaptation to this fruit. Our atlases represent the first comparative datasets for “whole” central brains and provide a comprehensive foundation for studying the evolvability of nervous systems in a well-defined phylogenetic and ecological framework.

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their respective phenotypes represents an important set of tools to understand basic coronavirus biology as well as the public health implications of individual mutations in variants of concern. While mutations outside of spike are not well studied, the entire viral genome is undergoing evolutionary selection, with several variants containing mutations in the central disordered linker region of the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Here, we identify a mutation (G215C), characteristic of the Delta variant, that introduces a novel cysteine into this linker domain, which results in the formation of a more stable N-N dimer. Using reverse genetics, we determined that this cysteine residue is necessary and sufficient for stable dimer formation in a WA1 SARS-CoV-2 background, where it results in significantly increased viral growth both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that the N:G215C mutant has more encapsidation as measured by increased RNA binding to N, N incorporation into virions, and electron microscopy showing that individual virions are larger, with elongated morphologies.

Recent advancements in genetically encoded calcium indicators, particularly those based on green fluorescent proteins, have optimized their performance for monitoring neuronal activities in a variety of model organisms. However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak Δ<i>F</i>/<i>F</i><sub>0</sub> per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons both in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to 4-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortices in mice with high labeling density (80–90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2–3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a. Our findings highlight the potential of SomaFRCaMPi, comparable to the most sensitive soma-targeted GCaMP, for precise spatial recording of neuronal populations using popular imaging modalities in model organisms such as zebrafish and mice.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A theory and network model are presented of how scene representations are built by forming spatial view cells in the ventromedial visual cortical scene pathway to the hippocampus in primates including humans. Layer 1, corresponding to V1–V4, connects to Layer 2 in the retrosplenial scene area and uses competitive learning to form visual feature combination neurons for the part of the scene being fixated, a visual fixation scene patch. In Layer 3, corresponding to the parahippocampal scene area and hippocampus, the visual fixation scene patches are stitched together to form whole scene representations. This is performed with a continuous attractor network for a whole scene made from the overlapping Gaussian receptive fields of the neurons as the head rotates to view the whole scene. In addition, in Layer 3, gain modulation by gaze direction maps visual fixation scene patches to the correct part of the whole scene representation when saccades are made. Each neuron in Layer 3 is thus a spatial view cell that responds to a location in a viewed scene based on visual features in a part of the scene. The novel conceptual advances are that this theory shows how scene representations may be built in primates, including humans, based on features in spatial scenes that anchor the scene representation to the world being viewed (to allocentric, world-based, space); and how gaze direction contributes to this. This offers a revolutionary approach to understanding the spatial representations for navigation and episodic memory in primates, including humans.</p>

                During development of the gyrencephalic brain, both the formation of cortical folds and the establishment of axonal tracts require large, coordinated mechanical deformations. Cortical folding enables a high ratio of cortical surface area to brain volume, which is thought to enhance overall processing power. Meanwhile, a complex network of axonal connections facilitates communication between distant brain regions. The mechanisms underlying the formation of brain folds and axon tract organization remain widely debated. However, evidence emerging from measurements of mechanical stress, combined with physical and mathematical models, suggests that constrained cortical expansion generates folds via mechanical instability. In this opinion article, we highlight recent models and experimental data suggesting that mechanical stress induced by cortical folding also mediates axonal growth. We propose a key role for mechanics in establishing brain morphology and the organization of white matter fascicles of the mature brain.
