                Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.

                Background A novel low-loss 4 × 4 Butler Matrix structure for 26 GHz operation is designed in this study. The proposed 4 × 4 antenna Butler matrix comprises an inscribed structure, which makes it fundamentally different from traditional beam-forming networks in 5G 26-GHz applications. Method This novel Butler matrix comprises four hybrid couplers without crossovers or phase shifters. To reduce the size, magnitude, and phase difference, and to increase the bandwidth, interdigital and non-metallic vias are used in the coupler design. The performance of the proposed matrix was simulated using the CST software and implemented on a Rogers 8085 substrate. It was also interfaced with four substrate-integrated waveguide slot antennas to demonstrate its distinct beam scanning capability. Results The matrix yielded an error magnitude loss of 1 dB and a phase error of 1.7° with a broad operational bandwidth of 3 GHz. The measured coupling factor of the 4 × 4 Butler matrix at 26 GHz is -6 ±1 dB at the output. The measured results validate that four phase-scanning states at -14.3°, 14.88°, -32.21°, and 31.33° can be realized with return losses of less than -10 dB. Conclusions The proposed design achieves a compact, efficient, and low-loss beamforming solution suitable for 5G applications at 26 GHz, demonstrating distinct scanning features without the need for crossovers or phase shifters.

                Background Rat tickling (heterospecific play between rats and the human hand), can promote positive affect and improve laboratory rat welfare. However, individual variation, particularly in response to the standard tickling protocol involving frequent pinning, may limit its effectiveness. Following hypothesis registration (https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1053/v2), we aimed to refine the protocol by testing responses to different amounts of pinning during playful handling (PH), a flexible form of tactile interaction resembling juvenile rough and tumble rat play. Methods Juvenile male and female Wistar rats received six daily 30-second sessions of PH with 0, 1, or 4 pins per session. A non-PH control involved a motionless hand. The primary response variables were the count and variability of 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs), which are measures of positive affect in rats. Additional exploratory outcomes included behavioural and physiological responses in the elevated plus maze and open field tests. Results All PH treatments increased 50 kHz USVs compared to controls, confirming their positive effect. Males showed no difference in USVs across pinning conditions, while females vocalised more in treatments with minimal or no pinning. Except for the highest pinning treatment (P4), females produced more USVs than males across all conditions, including controls. However, reducing pinning did not reliably decrease USV variability or alter behavioural and physiological outcomes. Conclusions Applying 50 kHz USVs as a measure of positive affect, these results confirm that tickling induces positive affect in juvenile laboratory rats. We report the novel finding of sex differences in response to tickling. Females preferred tickling where the amount of pinning is minimised relative to males that showed no preference across tickling treatments. Levels of USVs suggest that females possibly found the applied treatments, including control conditions, more rewarding than males did

                Background There are currently no sex-specific recommendations for antipsychotic prescribing in schizophrenia, although women may be more susceptible to certain side-effects and may require lower doses to achieve comparable efficacy to men. However, sex differences remain insufficiently studied to inform treatment decisions. Methods We plan a systematic review and individual-participant-data meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing different antipsychotic drugs, doses, formulations with each other or with placebo in adults with acute schizophrenia. Eligible studies will be identified through the Vivli platform, and their individual-participant-data will be harmonized into a common dataset. Two independent reviewers will screen search results and assess risk of bias using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. The primary outcome will be overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and secondary outcomes will include a broad range of efficacy, tolerability, acceptability, and dosing measures. A stepwise approach to data synthesis will be adopted, depending on individual-participant-data availability, aiming to examine sex differences in the effects of antipsychotic drugs compared to placebo. If sufficient data are available, we will conduct random-effects meta-analyses using regression models to evaluate biological sex, typically categorised as male or female, as both a prognostic factor and an effect modifier, network meta-analyses to synthesize direct and indirect evidence, and dose-response meta-analyses using restricted cubic splines to explore dose-effect relationships. The robustness of the findings will be assessed through sensitivity analyses adjusting for additional covariates. The certainty of evidence on sex differences will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for subgroup analysis. If the certainty is judged to be moderate or high, sex-specific treatment effects will be further assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) framework. Discussion This study will examine sex differences in the efficacy, tolerability, and dosing of antipsychotics in acute schizophrenia, potentially contributing to evidence-based, sex-specific treatment recommendations for antipsychotic prescribing.

Abstract: The article introduces an accessible pathway into neuroscience using the MicroBCI device, which leverages the STM32 Nucleo-55RG development board as the core platform. MicroBCI enables the STM32 board to function as a brain-computer interface, capable of recording EEG, EMG, and ECG signals across 8 channels. Over the past decade, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence has transformed many fields, including neurobiology. The application of machine learning methods has created opportunities for the practical use of EEG signals in diverse technological domains. This growing interest has fueled the popularity of affordable brain-computer interface systems that utilize non-invasive electrodes for EEG acquisition. The MicroBCI device demonstrates reliable noise performance and accuracy for applied research and prototyping. Furthermore, it effectively detects alpha brain waves, confirming its ability to capture key neurological signals.

                arXiv:2509.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotions play a crucial role in human life. The research community has proposed many theories on emotions without reaching much consensus. The situation is similar for emotions in cognitive architectures and autonomous agents. I propose in this paper that emotions are recognized patterns of cognitive activities. These activities are responses of an agent to the deviations between the targets of its goals and the performances of its actions. Emotions still arise even if these activities are purely logical. I map the patterns of cognitive activities to emotions. I show the link between emotions and attention and the impacts of the parameterized functions in the cognitive architecture on the computing of emotions. My proposition bridges different theories on emotions and advances the building of consensus.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16238">Evolvable Graph Diffusion Optimal Transport with Pattern-Specific Alignment for Brain Connectome Modeling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.16238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network analysis of human brain connectivity indicates that individual differences in cognitive abilities arise from neurobiological mechanisms inherent in structural and functional brain networks. Existing studies routinely treat structural connectivity (SC) as optimal or fixed topological scaffolds for functional connectivity (FC), often overlooking higher-order dependencies between brain regions and limiting the modeling of complex cognitive processes. Besides, the distinct spatial organizations of SC and FC complicate direct integration, as naive alignment may distort intrinsic nonlinear patterns of brain connectivity. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Evolvable Graph Diffusion Optimal Transport with Pattern-Specific Alignment (EDT-PA), designed to identify disease-specific connectome patterns and classify brain disorders. To accurately model high-order structural dependencies, EDT-PA incorporates a spectrum of evolvable modeling blocks to dynamically capture high-order dependencies across brain regions. Additionally, a Pattern-Specific Alignment mechanism employs optimal transport to align structural and functional representations in a geometry-aware manner. By incorporating a Kolmogorov-Arnold network for flexible node aggregation, EDT-PA is capable of modeling complex nonlinear interactions among brain regions for downstream classification. Extensive evaluations on the REST-meta-MDD and ADNI datasets demonstrate that EDT-PA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a more effective framework for revealing structure-function misalignments and disorder-specific subnetworks in brain disorders. The project of this work is released via this link.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16253">Quantum-like representation of neuronal networks' activity: modeling "mental entanglement"</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-like modeling (QLM) - quantum theory applications outside of physics - are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) - a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision.making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., mental entanglement. We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing local observables and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on mental entanglement detection using the EEG/MEG technique.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16973">Deep Learning Inductive Biases for fMRI Time Series Classification during Resting-state and Movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has advanced fMRI analysis, yet it remains unclear which architectural inductive biases are most effective at capturing functional patterns in human brain activity. This issue is particularly important in small-sample settings, as most datasets fall into this category. We compare models with three major inductive biases in deep learning including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers for the task of biological sex classification. These models are evaluated within a unified pipeline using parcellated multivariate fMRI time series from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7-Tesla cohort, which includes four resting-state runs and four movie-watching task runs. We assess performance on Whole-brain, subcortex, and 12 functional networks. CNNs consistently achieved the highest discrimination for sex classification in both resting-state and movie-watching, while LSTM and Transformer models underperformed. Network-resolved analyses indicated that the Whole-brain, Default Mode, Cingulo-Opercular, Dorsal Attention, and Frontoparietal networks were the most discriminative. These results were largely similar between resting-state and movie-watching. Our findings indicate that, at this dataset size, discriminative information is carried by local spatial patterns and inter-regional dependencies, favoring convolutional inductive bias. Our study provides insights for selecting deep learning architectures for fMRI time series classification.

Abstract: Memory, a fundamental component of human cognition, exhibits adaptive yet fallible characteristics as illustrated by Schacter's memory "sins".These cognitive phenomena have been studied extensively in psychology and neuroscience, but the extent to which artificial systems, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), emulate these cognitive phenomena remains underexplored. This study uses human memory research as a lens for understanding LLMs and systematically investigates human memory effects in state-of-the-art LLMs using paradigms drawn from psychological research. We evaluate seven key memory phenomena, comparing human behavior to LLM performance. Both people and models remember less when overloaded with information (list length effect) and remember better with repeated exposure (list strength effect). They also show similar difficulties when retrieving overlapping information, where storing too many similar facts leads to confusion (fan effect). Like humans, LLMs are susceptible to falsely "remembering" words that were never shown but are related to others (false memories), and they can apply prior learning to new, related situations (cross-domain generalization). However, LLMs differ in two key ways: they are less influenced by the order in which information is presented (positional bias) and more robust when processing random or meaningless material (nonsense effect). These results reveal both alignments and divergences in how LLMs and humans reconstruct memory. The findings help clarify how memory-like behavior in LLMs echoes core features of human cognition, while also highlighting the architectural differences that lead to distinct patterns of error and success.

                arXiv:2509.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring synaptic connectivity from neural population activity is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience, complicated by partial observability and mismatches between inference models and true circuit dynamics. In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data from ring attractor networks and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model consistently outperforms standard baselines, resolving spurious correlations more effectively and recovering accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.

Abstract: Electrogastrography is the recording of changes in electric potential caused by the stomach's pacemaker region, typically through several cutaneous sensors placed on the abdomen. It is a worthwhile technique in medical and psychological research, but also relatively niche. Here we present a tutorial on the acquisition and analysis of the human electrogastrogram. Because dedicated equipment and software can be prohibitively expensive, we demonstrate how data can be acquired using a low-cost OpenBCI Ganglion amplifier. We also present a processing pipeline that minimises attrition, which is particularly helpful for low-cost equipment but also applicable to top-of-the-line hardware. Our approach comprises outlier rejection, frequency filtering, movement filtering, and noise reduction using independent component analysis. Where traditional approaches include a subjective step in which only one channel is manually selected for further analysis, our pipeline recomposes the electrogastrogram from all recorded channels after automatic rejection of nuisance components. The main benefits of this approach are reduced attrition, retention of data from all recorded channels, and reduced influence of researcher bias. In addition to our tutorial on the method, we offer a proof-of-principle in which our approach leads to reduced data rejection compared to established methods. We aimed to describe each step in sufficient detail to be implemented in any programming language. In addition, we made an open-source Python package freely available for ease of use.

Abstract: Generative pretraining (the "GPT" in ChatGPT) enables language models to learn from vast amounts of internet text without human supervision. This approach has driven breakthroughs across AI by allowing deep neural networks to learn from massive, unstructured datasets. We use the term foundation models to refer to large pretrained systems that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks within and across domains, and these models are increasingly applied beyond language to the brain sciences. These models achieve strong predictive accuracy, raising hopes that they might illuminate computational principles. But predictive success alone does not guarantee scientific understanding. Here, we outline how foundation models can be productively integrated into the brain sciences, highlighting both their promise and their limitations. The central challenge is to move from prediction to explanation: linking model computations to mechanisms underlying neural activity and cognition.

                arXiv:2509.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is widely used to separate mixed signals and recover statistically independent components. However, in non-human primate neuroimaging studies, most ICA-recovered spatial maps are often dense. To extract the most relevant brain activation patterns, post-hoc thresholding is typically applied-though this approach is often imprecise and arbitrary. To address this limitation, we employed the Sparse ICA method, which enforces both sparsity and statistical independence, allowing it to extract the most relevant activation maps without requiring additional post-processing. Simulation experiments demonstrate that Sparse ICA performs competitively against 11 classical linear ICA methods. We further applied Sparse ICA to real non-human primate neuroimaging data, identifying several independent component networks spanning different brain networks. These spatial maps revealed clearly defined activation areas, providing further evidence that Sparse ICA is effective and reliable in practical applications.

                arXiv:2509.16859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether another system, biological or artificial, possesses phenomenal consciousness has long been a central challenge in consciousness studies. This attribution problem has become especially pressing with the rise of large language models and other advanced AI systems, where debates about "AI consciousness" implicitly rely on some criterion for deciding whether a given system is conscious. In this paper, we propose a substrate-independent, logically rigorous, and counterfeit-resistant sufficiency criterion for phenomenal consciousness. We argue that any machine satisfying this criterion should be regarded as conscious with at least the same level of confidence with which we attribute consciousness to other humans. Building on this criterion, we develop a formal framework and specify a set of operational principles that guide the design of systems capable of meeting the sufficiency condition. We further argue that machines engineered according to this framework can, in principle, realize phenomenal consciousness. As an initial validation, we show that humans themselves can be viewed as machines that satisfy this framework and its principles. If correct, this proposal carries significant implications for philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. It offers an explanation for why certain qualia, such as the experience of red, are in principle irreducible to physical description, while simultaneously providing a general reinterpretation of human information processing. Moreover, it suggests a path toward a new paradigm of AI beyond current statistics-based approaches, potentially guiding the construction of genuinely human-like AI.

                arXiv:2509.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks constitute fundamental organizational structures across biological systems, although conventional graph-theoretic analyses capture exclusively pairwise interactions, thereby omitting the intricate higher-order relationships that characterize network complexity. This work proposes a unified framework for heat kernel smoothing on simplicial complexes, extending classical signal processing methodologies from vertices and edges to cycles and higher-dimensional structures. Through Hodge Laplacian, a discrete heat kernel on a finite simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is constructed to smooth signals on $k$-simplices via the boundary operator $\partial_k$. Computationally efficient sparse algorithms for constructing boundary operators are developed to implement linear diffusion processes on $k$-simplices. The methodology generalizes heat kernel smoothing to $k$-simplices, utilizing boundary structure to localize topological features while maintaining homological invariance. Simulation studies demonstrate qualitative signal enhancement across vertex and edge domains following diffusion processes. Application to parcellated human brain functional connectivity networks reveals that simplex-space smoothing attenuates spurious connections while amplifying coherent anatomical architectures, establishing practical significance for computational neuroscience applications.

                arXiv:2501.03247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a neurogeometric model for the arm area of motor cortex, which encodes complex motor primitives, ranging from simple movement features like movement direction, to short hand trajectories, termed fragments, and ultimately to more complex patterns known as neural states (Georgopoulos, Hatsopoulos, Kadmon-Harpaz et al). Based on the sub-riemannian framework introduced in 2023, we model the space of fragments as a set of short curves defined by kinematic parameters. We then introduce a geometric kernel that serves as a model for cortical connectivity and use it in a differential equation to describe cortical activity. By applying a grouping algorithm to this cortical activity model, we successfully recover the neural states observed in Kadmon-Harpaz et al, which were based on measured cortical activity. This confirms that the choice of kinematic variables and the distance metric used here are sufficient to explain the phenomena of neural state formation. The modularity of our model reflects the brain's hierarchical structure, where initial groupings in the kinematic space $\mathcal{M}$ lead to more abstract representations. This approach mimics how the brain processes stimuli at different scales, extracting both local and global properties.

                arXiv:2506.08599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-person neuroscience holds social cognition as embodied meaning co-regulation through reciprocal interaction, modeled here as coupled active inference with affect emerging as inference over identity-relevant surprise. Each agent maintains a self-model that tracks violations in its predictive coherence while recursively modeling the other. Valence is computed from self-model prediction error, weighted by self-relevance, and modulated by prior affective states and by what we term temporal aiming, which captures affective appraisal over time. This accommodates shifts in the self-other boundary, allowing affect to emerge at individual and dyadic levels. We propose a novel method termed geometric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to empirically operationalize these processes: it tracks topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entro-py serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.

Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8% and silhouette coefficient by 29%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. We also observe that a fine-tuned pretrained model achieves superior results on the corresponding task. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/ncclab-sustech/DCA .

                arXiv:2401.08064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trust is central to human social interactions, manifesting in actions that make one vulnerable to another. We argue that trust will thus depend on the decision-making processes that arise in neural systems. Building on advances in the cognitive neuroscience of decision making, we propose a mechanistic model of trust arising from multiple parallel systems that perform distinct, complementary information processing. Because each system learns via different mechanisms, trust can be created (or destroyed) in multiple ways. This systems-level taxonomy of information representations provides a principled basis for differentiating forms of trust, linking them to specific learning processes, and generating testable predictions about their expression in behavior. By situating trust within a broader theory of neural decision systems, our account unifies diverse findings across psychology, neuroscience, and the social sciences, and offers a foundation for explaining how humans develop, maintain, and repair trust in a complex social world.

Abstract: This study presents Neural Focused Ant Colony Optimization (NeuFACO), a non-autoregressive framework for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that combines advanced reinforcement learning with enhanced Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). NeuFACO employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with entropy regularization to train a graph neural network for instance-specific heuristic guidance, which is integrated into an optimized ACO framework featuring candidate lists, restricted tour refinement, and scalable local search. By leveraging amortized inference alongside ACO stochastic exploration, NeuFACO efficiently produces high-quality solutions across diverse TSP instances.

                arXiv:2509.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and energy demands of large-scale neural networks, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge their practical deployment in edge applications due to high power consumption, area requirements, and privacy concerns. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), particularly in analog implementations, offer a promising low-power alternative but suffer from noise sensitivity and connectivity limitations. This work presents a novel CMOS-implemented field-programmable neural network architecture for hardware reservoir computing. We propose a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron circuit with integrated voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) and programmable weighted interconnections via an on-chip FPGA framework, enabling arbitrary reservoir configurations. The system demonstrates effective implementation of the FORCE algorithm learning, linear and non-linear memory capacity benchmarks, and NARMA10 tasks, both in simulation and actual chip measurements. The neuron design achieves compact area utilization (around 540 NAND2-equivalent units) and low energy consumption (21.7 pJ/pulse) without requiring ADCs for information readout, making it ideal for system-on-chip integration of reservoir computing. This architecture paves the way for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic systems capable of performing real-time learning and inference with high configurability and digital interfacing.

                arXiv:2509.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for discovering loops in programming code according to their potential for parallelization. Two genetic algorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of code: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous loops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the loop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and preprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were implemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a robust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of both models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance, but the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset sizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the identification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool for software optimization and performance improvement.

                arXiv:2509.16856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) enable programmatic control of the functions and services in a computer network. By leveraging Software Defined Networking to control the links between virtualised network functions, SFCs provide a scalable approach to dealing with the increased pressures on network operation and management. Unfortunately, the challenge of embedding SFCs onto the underlying physical network and compute infrastructure is an NP-hard problem. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been used to address this issue, but they require significant time to evaluate solution quality (fitness) \textit{online}, with most solutions instead adopting \textit{offline} simulations or analytical evaluations.
  To enable online use of GAs in solving the SFC embedding problem, we introduce a hybrid online-offline approach to evaluate generated solutions. At the core of this is BeNNS--a topology, traffic, and SFC-embedding agnostic surrogate model that approximates fitness. We evaluate our approach across six experiments, varying available resources and traffic loads. Our results demonstrate that our approach is capable of exploring thousands of potential configurations and generating deployable solutions in 36.8 minutes on average, compared to online-only approaches, which take 17.9 hours on average to explore tens of solutions, which do not converge on an optimal solution.

                arXiv:2509.16959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated. The grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, model performance will be improved rather than impeded. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers.

                arXiv:2509.17731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for designing biologically plausible bursting neuron circuits using a minimal number of components. We hypothesize that to design circuits capable of bursting, the neuron circuit design must mimic a neuron model that inherently exhibits bursting dynamics. Consequently, classical models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley, $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}$, and FitzHugh-Nagumo models are not suitable choices. Instead, we propose a methodology for designing neuron circuits that emulate the qualitative characteristics of the $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}+I_{K(M)}$ model, a well-established minimal bursting neuron model. Based on this methodology, we present two novel MOSFET-based circuits that exhibit bursting. Using the method of dissection of neural bursting, we demonstrate that the nullcline and bifurcation diagrams of the fast subsystem in our circuits are qualitatively equivalent to those of the $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}+I_{K(M)}$ model. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the type of bifurcation at burst initiation and termination on the bursting characteristics, showing that our circuits can exhibit diverse bursting behaviours. Importantly, the main contribution of this work lies not in the specific circuit implementation, but in the methodology proposed for constructing bursting neuron circuits.

                arXiv:2412.01454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks employ fixed weights during inference, limiting their ability to adapt to changing input conditions, unlike biological neurons that adjust signal strength dynamically based on stimuli. This discrepancy between artificial and biological neurons constrains neural network flexibility and adaptability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for adaptive neural networks, where neuron weights are modeled as functions of the input signal, allowing the network to adjust dynamically in real-time. Importantly, we achieve this within the same traditional architecture of an Artificial Neural Network, maintaining structural familiarity while introducing dynamic adaptability. In our research, we apply Chebyshev polynomials as one of the many possible decomposition methods to achieve this adaptive weighting mechanism, with polynomial coefficients learned during training. Out of the 145 datasets tested, our adaptive Chebyshev neural network demonstrated a marked improvement over an equivalent MLP in approximately 8\% of cases, performing strictly better on 121 datasets. In the remaining 24 datasets, the performance of our algorithm matched that of the MLP, highlighting its ability to generalize standard neural network behavior while offering enhanced adaptability. As a generalized form of the MLP, this model seamlessly retains MLP performance where needed while extending its capabilities to achieve superior accuracy across a wide range of complex tasks. These results underscore the potential of adaptive neurons to enhance generalization, flexibility, and robustness in neural networks, particularly in applications with dynamic or non-linear data dependencies.

                arXiv:2504.06126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization. Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. In many applications, one has to repeatedly solve VRP instances drawn from the same distribution, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce an optimization framework where a reinforcement learning agent is trained on prior instances and quickly generates initial solutions, which are then further optimized by a genetic algorithm. This framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time budgets. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within one second, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling real-time and interactive routing at scale. EARLI can generalize to new data, as we demonstrate on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. By combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, our hybrid framework takes a step forward to closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.

                arXiv:2507.22832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since any ReLU network is piecewise affine, its hidden units can be characterized by their pullbacks through the active subnetwork, i.e., by their gradients (up to bias terms). However, gradients of deeper neurons are notoriously misaligned, which obscures the network's internal representations. We posit that models do align gradients with data, yet this is concealed by the intrinsic noise of the ReLU hard gating. We validate this intuition by applying soft gating in the backward pass only, reducing the local impact of weakly excited neurons. The resulting modified gradients, which we call "excitation pullbacks", exhibit striking perceptual alignment on a number of ImageNet-pretrained architectures, while the rudimentary pixel-space gradient ascent quickly produces easily interpretable input- and target-specific features. Inspired by these findings, we formulate the "path stability" hypothesis, claiming that the binary activation patterns largely stabilize during training and get encoded in the pre-activation distribution of the final model. When true, excitation pullbacks become aligned with the gradients of a kernel machine that mainly determines the network's decision. This provides a theoretical justification for the apparent faithfulness of the feature attributions based on excitation pullbacks, potentially even leading to mechanistic interpretability of deep models. Incidentally, we give a possible explanation for the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and Deep Features, together with a novel perspective on the network's internal memory and generalization properties. We release the code and an interactive app for easier exploration of the excitation pullbacks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108292">Sulfation affects apical extracellular matrix organization during development of the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland tube</a></h4>

              
                The apical extracellular matrix (aECM) plays a critical role in epithelial tube morphogenesis during organ formation, but its composition and organization remain poorly understood. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we identify Papss, an enzyme that synthesizes the universal sulfate donor PAPS, as a critical regulator of tube lumen expansion. <i>Papss</i> mutants show a disorganized apical membrane, condensed aECM, and disruptions in Golgi structures and intracellular trafficking. SG-specific expression of wild-type Papss, but not the catalytically inactive form, rescues the defects in <i>Papss</i> mutants, suggesting that defects in sulfation are the underlying cause of the phenotypes. Additionally, we identify two zona pellucida (ZP) domain proteins, Piopio (Pio), and Dumpy (Dpy), as key components of the SG aECM. In the absence of <i>Papss</i>, Pio is gradually lost in the aECM, while the Dpy-positive aECM structure is condensed and dissociates from the apical membrane, leading to a thin lumen. Mutations in <i>dpy</i> or <i>pio</i>, or in <i>Notopleural</i>, which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal Pio pool, result in a SG lumen with alternating bulges and constrictions, with the loss of <i>pio</i> leading to the loss of Dpy in the lumen. Our findings underscore the essential role of sulfation in organizing the aECM during tubular organ formation and highlight the mechanical support provided by ZP domain proteins in maintaining luminal diameter.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106602">Multiphase separation in postsynaptic density regulated by membrane geometry via interaction valency and volume</a></h4>

              
                Biomolecular condensates are found at various cellular locations, nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane. These condensates often contain multiple components and can separate into multiple phases with various morphologies such as core-shell droplets, implicating functional roles. Demixing and arrangements of condensates are determined by competitive interactions and their locations. Recent studies reported a puzzling multiphase morphology in postsynaptic density components: AMPA receptor, NMDA receptor, PSD-95, and CaMKII. The multiphase morphology appears reversed when transitioning from the solution to the membrane. Using this system as a model, we study the multiphase behavior of condensates in solution (3D) and domain formation on and beneath the membrane (2D) and elucidate molecular mechanisms behind the puzzle. Our simulations reproduce the core-shell structure in 3D in vitro solution, where AMPA-receptor/PSD-95 form the core and NMDA-receptor/CaMKII form the shell, triggered by CaMKII activation. Then, we obtain a reversed morphology on the membrane. This reversal is primarily driven by CaMKII’s high valency and large volume. We find that, in solution, CaMKII’s non-specific volume interaction dominates, while on the membrane, specific multivalent interactions overcome the excluded volume interaction of CaMKII. The layered structures of receptors and CaMKIIs reduce the excluded volume effects of CaMKII on receptors, making the multivalent interaction dominant. These findings highlight the differences between condensate formation in solution and membrane domain formation, modulated by their layered arrangement.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106628">Hierarchical encoding of natural sound mixtures in ferret auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Extracting relevant auditory signals from complex natural scenes is a fundamental challenge for the auditory system. Sounds from multiple sources overlap in time and frequency. In particular, dynamic ‘foreground’ sounds are often masked by more stationary ‘background’ sounds. Human auditory cortex exhibits a hierarchical organization where background-invariant representations are progressively enhanced along the processing stream, from primary to non-primary regions. However, we do not know whether this organizational principle is conserved across species and which neural mechanisms drive this invariance. To address these questions, we investigated background invariance in ferret auditory cortex using functional ultrasound imaging, which enables large-scale, high-resolution recordings of hemodynamic responses. We measured responses across primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortical regions as ferrets passively listened to mixtures of natural sounds and their components in isolation. We found a hierarchical gradient of background invariance, mirroring findings in humans: responses in primary auditory cortex reflected contributions from both foreground and background sounds, while background invariance increased in higher-order auditory regions. Using a spectrotemporal filter-bank model, we found that in ferrets this hierarchical structure could be largely explained by tuning to low-order acoustic features. However, this model failed to fully account for background invariance in human non-primary auditory cortex, suggesting that additional, higher-order mechanisms are crucial for background segregation in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107043">The increase in cell volume and nuclear number of the koji-fungus Aspergillus oryzae contributes to its high enzyme productivity</a></h4>

              
                While the ratio of nuclei to cell volume is well regulated, it remains largely unexplored in multinucleate organisms. The koji-fungus <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>, traditionally used in Japanese brewing and fermentation for over a thousand years, is now widely utilized in modern biotechnology as a host for enzyme production. We discovered that, over time in culture, hyphae become thicker, resulting in a tenfold increase in cell volume, and the number of nuclei in hyphal cells also increases tenfold, exceeding 200. The increase in cell volume and nuclear number is unique among the investigated <i>Aspergillus</i> species and correlates with its high enzyme production capabilities. Since nuclear number and cell volume are correlated, both must increase simultaneously for either to expand. Our analyses identified genetic factors and nutritional environmental signals involved in each of these increases. Increases in nuclear number and cell volume were also observed in other fungi bred for industrial use. This study not only deepens our understanding of the evolutionary processes that promote high enzyme productivity through fungal breeding, but also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating cell volume and nuclear number in multinucleate organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102756">Oxytocin restores context-specific hyperaltruistic preference</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in moral decision-making research show people are hyperaltruistic by being more willing to sacrifice monetary gains to spare others from suffering than to spare themselves. Yet other studies indicate an opposite egoistic bias: subjects are less willing to harm themselves for others’ benefits than for their own. These results underscore the complexities of moral decisions and demand a mechanistic explanation for hyperaltruistic preferences. We investigated hyperaltruism using trade-off choices combining monetary gains and painful electric shocks and choices combining monetary losses and shocks. Study 1 revealed that switching the decision context from gains to losses effectively eliminated the hyperaltruistic preference, accompanied by the altered relationship between subjects’ instrumental harm (IH) trait attitudes and relative pain sensitivities. In the pre-registered study 2, we found that oxytocin, a neuropeptide linked to parochial altruism, restored the context-dependent hyperaltruistic preference. Furthermore, oxytocin increased the degree to which subjects framed the task as harming others, which mediated the correlation between IH and relative pain sensitivities. Thus, the loss decision context and oxytocin diminished and restored the mediation effect of subjective harm framing, respectively. Our results help elucidate the psychological processes underpinning the contextual specificity of hyperaltruism and carry implications in promoting prosocial interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100248">SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 interacts with TEAD to suppress Hippo-YAP signaling</a></h4>

              
                The Hippo pathway controls organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration primarily by modulating YAP/TEAD-mediated gene expression. Although emerging studies report Hippo-YAP dysfunction after viral infection, it is largely unknown in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung samples, and observed a decrease in YAP target gene expression. In screening SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins, we found that nonstructural protein 13 (NSP13), a conserved coronavirus helicase, inhibits YAP transcriptional activity independent of the upstream Hippo kinases LATS1/2. Consistently, introducing NSP13 into mouse cardiomyocytes suppresses an active form of YAP (YAP5SA) <i>in vivo</i>. Subsequent investigations on NSP13 mutants revealed that NSP13 helicase activity, including DNA binding and unwinding, is crucial for suppressing YAP transactivation in HEK293T cells. Mechanistically, TEAD4 serves as a platform to recruit NSP13 and YAP. NSP13 likely inactivates the YAP/TEAD4 transcription complex by remodeling chromatin to recruit proteins, such as transcription termination factor 2 (TTF2), to bind the YAP/TEAD/NSP13 complex. These findings reveal a novel YAP/TEAD regulatory mechanism and uncover molecular insights into Hippo-YAP regulation after SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

">Neuroanatomical Correlates of Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schizophrenia is characterized by widespread structural brain abnormalities, but associations between structural abnormalities and negative symptom severity are not well understood. Negative symptoms have been conceptualized in a hierarchical structure of two second-order dimensions -motivation and pleasure (MAP) and expression (EXP)- and five first-order domains: anhedonia, avolition, and asociality (MAP), and blunted affect and alogia (EXP). A better understanding of the neural circuitry underlying negative symptom dimensions and domains is important given their reported association with poor functional outcome and lack of available treatments. Study Design: The meta-analysis included 1,591 individuals with schizophrenia across 16 samples with structural imaging and Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms data. The study generated correlations of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes with the negative symptom dimensions and domains. Study results: Negative symptoms showed mainly negative associations with cortical thickness and subcortical volumes. The effect sizes were small but there was a pattern of associations in predominantly frontal lobe cortical thickness and limbic subcortical volumes. The regional correlation patterns of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes with symptom domains support the conceptualized hierarchical structure of negative symptoms: correlations of MAP domains were stronger with the MAP than EXP dimension, and vice versa. Exploratory analyses with receptor densities further supported the hierarchy. Conclusion: Our findings reveal small but consistent associations between negative symptom dimensions and predominantly prefrontal region cortical thickness, and limbic region volumes. These findings advance our understanding of the network of anatomical regions that may contribute to the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

                Background Rising tuition costs and unequal access to higher education have prompted Indonesian universities to explore Zakat-based funding models to support needy students. In contrast, the use of Zakat on income (Zakatu kasbil ‘amal) and the Fisabilillah category for scholarships has been increasingly practiced; their implementation remains shaped by theological debates and institutional innovations. This study examines how universities integrate fatwa-driven legitimacy with Zakat governance to mobilize Zakat and expand student support systems. Method This study combines a systematic literature review with an exploratory qualitative approach. Academic publications, Scopus-indexed articles, national regulations, institutional reports, and relevant fatwas were analyzed to examine how theological perspectives and institutional practices interact in mobilizing Zakat for student funding. Evidence from university cases contextualized findings, such as PUSPAS UNAIR, UPZ UIN Sumatera Utara, BAZNAS, and LAZISMU. Result The findings reveal two applied contributions. First, Zakat on income has been institutionalized by universities through various mechanisms, including establishing Unit Pengumpul Zakat (UPZ), forming private Zakat Institutions or collaborating with BAZNAS and LAZISMU. Supported by Indonesian Ulema Council Fatwa No. 3/2003, these institutional models embed auto-debit payroll systems and structured governance processes, transforming Zakat on income into a sustainable funding source for student scholarships. Second, universities expand the use of the Fisabilillah category as a legitimate asnaf for distributing Zakat-based scholarships. While classical scholars traditionally limit Fisabilillah to battle-related jihad, contemporary fatwas, including Indonesian Ulema Council Fatwa No. 120/1996, Dar al-Ifta Egypt (2007), and Jordan’s Fatwa No. 2847 (2013), permit allocating Zakat to education when it serves the collective benefit. Universities operationalize this broader fiqh application through structured programs such as the BAZNAS Scholarship Institute, LAZISMU’s scholarship schemes, and university-managed funding initiatives.

                <p>Cancer patients experience circadian rhythm disruptions during and after chemotherapy that can contribute to debilitating side effects. It is unknown how chemotherapy mediates circadian disruptions and specifically the extent to which these disruptions occur at the level of the principal clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. In the present study, we assessed how the commonly used chemotherapeutic, paclitaxel, impacts the SCN molecular clock and SCN-dependent behavioral adaptations to circadian challenges in female mice. Following a repeated chemotherapy regimen, we measured rhythmic SCN expression of molecular clock and circadian-associated transcripts. Paclitaxel chemotherapy disrupted the SCN molecular clock through abolished rhythmicity (<I>Bmal1</I>, <I>Nr1d2</I>) and damped rhythmic transcription (<I>Ciart</I>, <I>Dbp</I>, <I>Nr1d1</I>, <I>Per2</I>) of key molecular clock genes. We further determined chemotherapy-induced changes to SCN function by measuring circadian wheel running adaptations to a jet lag phase-delay or phase-advance paradigm and by generating a phase response curve (PRC). Chemotherapy did not alter re-entrainment to a 6&nbsp;h phase-advance, but after a 6&nbsp;h phase-delay, chemotherapy-treated mice had a more stable and robust circadian rhythm than vehicle-treated mice, possibly indicative of a weakened or decoupled SCN. In the PRC, chemotherapy blunted light-induced phase-shift delays during subjective night compared with vehicle controls, also indicative of disrupted SCN-dependent entrainment. Together, this work demonstrates that paclitaxel chemotherapy disrupts both the molecular clock and functional re-entrainment of the SCN that could cause or contribute to observed circadian rhythm disruptions after treatment. This research could help guide application of circadian-mediated therapies to mitigate side effects of chemotherapy.</p>

                <p>Chemotherapy can cause debilitating behavioral side effects (e.g., fatigue, depression, cognitive decline); however, having an intimate partner can buffer these effects. The California mouse (<I>Peromyscus californicus</I>) is a rare monogamous mouse species that offers a novel opportunity to model human intimate partnership to identify the neurobiological mechanisms by which mate bonding reduces chemotherapy-associated behavioral side effects. As a first step toward this goal, this pilot study aimed to develop the first chemotherapy model, to our knowledge, in adult male and female California mice. Following a repeated paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen, well characterized in laboratory mice (<I>Mus musculus</I>), gross sickness physiology was first assessed after various doses. The 20&nbsp;mg/kg paclitaxel dose, injected six times every other day, was the highest tolerable, clinically relevant dose and was characterized by moderate body mass loss and increased spleen mass. Thus, further investigation of the effects of this chemotherapy paradigm on peripheral and neural inflammatory gene expression, based on previous reports in laboratory mice, was undertaken; results were mixed. Consistent across the spleen, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, some proinflammatory genes were unexpectedly decreased with chemotherapy (<I>Il1&beta;</I>, <I>Tnf</I>), whereas one gene was increased (<I>Icam1</I>). Chemotherapy also increased fatigue and sociability, but not anxiety-like behavior or cognition. Taken together, this pilot study characterized a translational model of chemotherapy in California mice with clinically relevant gross physiological changes and modest changes in neuroinflammation and behavioral side effects. This work also highlights the need for comparative studies and the growth of research tools for this socially relevant mouse species.</p>

                Background High-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) has gained interest as an adjunctive therapy in cancer care due to its potential antioxidative and cytotoxic effects. Despite growing research, a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the efficacy and safety of HDIVC in advanced solid tumors remains limited. Materials and Methods This review will follow the six steps of the Arksey and O’Malley framework, as adapted by Levac et al, namely: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection eligibility, charting the data, collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and consultation. PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases will be used for the search of articles from 2000 – 2025. Grey literature will also be conducted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will be used as a guide for this scoping review protocol. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine the eligibility of articles with two independent reviewers. Discrepancies will be handled by consensus or by consulting an expert in cancer care. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 12 weeks, from 01 October to 31 December 2025. The extracted data will be analyzed and presented in a report. Conclusion This scoping review will consolidate evidence on HDIVC for advanced solid tumors, identifying efficacy outcomes, safety profiles, and patient experiences in African populations that will inform clinical practice and guide policy making. Ethics and Dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. However, the results of this search will be disseminated through academic presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

                Background Accurate estimation of the postmortem interval (PMI) remains one of the central challenges in forensic medicine. Traditional external markers are limited by environmental and individual variability. Bone marrow, owing to its protected anatomical location and slower decomposition rate, offers a potential histological substrate for PMI estimation. Aim This study aimed to evaluate cytoplasmic changes in sternal bone marrow cells and assess their correlation with Postmortem interval (PMI). Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study of 43 medico-legal autopsies with documented time of death. Sternal bone marrow aspirates were stained with Leishman stain and examined microscopically. Cytoplasmic changes were scored from 0 to 4 (intact morphology to complete dissolution) using a system adapted from Biradar G et al. Data were analyzed using ANOVA (p < 0.05). Results Mild cytoplasmic alterations (S1) were most frequent (51.1%), followed by moderate changes (S2, 25.6%) and severe dissolution (S4, 14%). Only 9.3% of cases showed no observable changes (S0). Mean PMI increased with the severity of cytoplasmic changes (S0: 8.5 h; S1: 14.1 h; S2: 10.5 h; S4: 15.0 h), although some overlap was seen, especially at S2, likely reflecting biological and environmental variability. The overall correlation was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion Cytoplasmic autolysis in bone marrow follows a sequential pattern, from early vacuolation to complete dissolution with increasing PMI. Although not statistically significant, observed trends suggest cytoplasmic scoring may aid early PMI estimation when combined with other markers.

                Background Montelukast is a pharmaceutical agent predominantly used for the management of asthma and allergic rhinitis. It fulfils its role by antagonizing the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type 1, hence inhibiting the effects of inflammatory leukotrienes such as LTD4. Nonetheless, like to other pharmaceuticals, montelukast is associated with possible adverse effects. Prevalent symptoms include cephalalgia, abdominal discomfort, and influenza-like manifestations. In few instances, it has been linked to changes in mood, agitation, and sleep disruptions, particularly in youngsters. Objective to assess the potential psychotropic effects of montelukast by measuring changes in cortisol levels, examining genes involved in neurotransmission and neuroplasticity, and observing behavioral tests in treated animals. Methods Thirty-five albino male rats weighing 150-200 milligrams the rats were categorized into five groups, with seven individuals in each group. Group II received reserpine as the positive control, while montelukast was administered at doses of 5 mg/kg for group III, 10 mg/kg for group IV, and 20 mg/kg for group V. The negative control group I was treated with a solvent combination of DMSO and acetic acid. Results reduction in cortisol levels, downregulation of BDNF and chrna7 genes, and significant alterations in behavioral assessments in the reserpine and montelukast groups in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion Animals treated with montelukast exhibit significant alterations in behavior and biomarker levels, suggesting potential psychological changes induced by the medication.

                Background The regulation of receptor expression is crucial for fine-tuned signal transduction. Notch signaling is a key signaling pathway involved in retinal development. Compared to the knowledge on this signaling pathway in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells, less is known about its involvement in earlier stages of retinal progenitor cell differentiation and its regulation, although NOTCH1, and probably NOTCH3, are involved in earlier stage differentiation. We aimed to clarify the timing of Notch receptor expression in undifferentiated retinal progenitor cells and elucidate the possible involvement of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of Notch receptor expressions. Methods We re-analyzed publicly available human fetal retina single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (GSE183684) using Seurat/Signac pipelines. Results On days 59, 74 and 78, we observed NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 mRNA expressions in early retinal progenitor cells, which diminished at later stages of differentiation. Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin remodeling in part of the NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 loci were accompanied by transitions in their mRNA expressions. Importantly, the NOTCH1 locus, which showed chromatin remodeling, contained multiple binding motifs for transcription factors important in early retinal progenitor cell differentiation. Conclusions These results suggest that chromatin remodeling may be involved in the differential expression of NOTCH1, although another type of Notch mRNA expression regulations may also exist.

                Background This study investigates the relationship between customers’ perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR), hotel reputation, and customer loyalty within the hospitality sector. This study explored how customers’ evaluations of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives influence their loyalty behaviors and whether this relationship is mediated by the hotel’s perceived reputation. This study contributes to the literature by integrating corporate social responsibility and hotel reputation into a unified model to predict customer loyalty in the hospitality sector. Methods Data were collected through a structured questionnaire administered via convenience sampling, resulting in 391 valid responses from customers who stayed in star-rated hotels in New Delhi, India. The proposed hypotheses were assessed using PLS-SEM, and the conceptual model was further evaluated for its explanatory and predictive power. Results The study revealed that corporate social responsibility and hotel reputation significantly and positively impact customer loyalty. Furthermore, hotel reputation partially mediates the relationship between corporate social responsibility and customer loyalty. The model demonstrated good explanatory power (R2 = 0.435 for customer loyalty) and medium predictive relevance (Q2 > 0.15), supporting the robustness of the proposed structural framework. Conclusions The findings of this study reveal that corporate social responsibility significantly enhances customer loyalty. The partial mediating effect of hotel reputation suggests that while corporate social responsibility independently influences customer loyalty, its impact is further strengthened when accompanied by a strong hotel reputation. This study highlights the strategic importance of aligning corporate social responsibility initiatives with reputation-building efforts to foster deeper emotional and behavioral loyalty among customers.

                This paper presents a synthetic dataset to study the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSC) simulations using the simulation tool SCAPS-1D. The dataset consists of 18.570 simulated devices generated from four baseline device architectures and their respective photovoltaic performance values. The data set was generated through numerical simulations, and the evaluation of the electrical performance of the device was carried out by studying current density-voltage (J-V) curves under standard illumination conditions, temperature, and maximum applied voltage as working conditions, which were not modified. The dataset can be used to train different machine learning (ML) models using supervised methods or unsupervised techniques such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, which facilitate the identification of patterns or relationships between parameters. Thus, it can be useful in reverse design strategies to determine optimal configurations based on defined objectives. This work contributes to the development of PSC by providing a broad dataset for further analysis and optimization.

Background <p>Measles outbreaks continue to cause a large burden of disease in Africa including Kenya. We used information from regular serological surveys in Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) in combination with mathematical modelling to estimate the relative contribution of the vaccination programme to current measles immunity.</p> Methods <p>We developed a static birth cohort model to track the proportion of children who are either measles naïve or seroconverted due to natural infection or vaccination through first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1), the second dose (MCV2), or supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs). We fitted the model to biennial paediatric serological survey and case notification data and used vaccination coverage estimates from the KHDSS to estimate the relative contributions of vaccination and infection to measles immunity in Kilifi.</p> Results <p>We estimated that between 2009 and 2021, 60% (95%CI 55–64%) of measles seroconversion in Kilifi was attributable to MCV1, with MCV2 contributing 1.0% (95%CI 0.9-1.1%) since its introduction. Natural infection and SIAs accounted for 24% (95%CI 17–31%) and 16% (95%CI 14–19%), respectively. A hypothetical 10% increase in MCV1 coverage increased the seroconversion attributed to MCV1–67% (95%CI 63–71%), with concurrent reductions in seroconversion from natural infection and SIAs to 13% (95%CI 9–18%) and 10% (95%CI 9–12%), respectively. Importantly, this same 10% increase in MCV1, if administered promptly at 9 months, could potentially reduce seroconversion from natural infection further from 24% to 11% (95%CI 07–15%) and reliance on SIAs from 16% to 8% (95% CI 7–10%).</p> Conclusion <p>Optimizing routine coverage timing and uptake is crucial for reducing SIAs dependence and measles susceptibility. A 10% MCV1 coverage increase could have halved susceptibility and lessened SIA demand, highlighting the potential of minor improvements in coverage to alleviate measles and reduce costly SIAs.</p>

                <p>by Rui Yin, Alba Gutiérrez-Sacristán, Undiagnosed Diseases Network , Shilpa Nadimpalli Kobren, Paul Avillach</p>

Rare and ultra-rare genetic conditions are estimated to impact nearly 1 in 17 people worldwide, yet accurately pinpointing the diagnostic variants underlying each of these conditions remains a formidable challenge. Because comprehensive, <i>in vivo</i> functional assessment of all possible genetic variants is infeasible, clinicians instead consider <i>in silico</i> variant pathogenicity predictions to distinguish plausibly disease-causing from benign variants across the genome. However, in the most difficult undiagnosed cases, such as those accepted to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), existing pathogenicity predictions cannot reliably discern true etiological variant(s) from other deleterious candidate variants that were prioritized through case- or family-level analyses. Pinpointing the disease-causing variant from a small pool of plausible candidates remains a largely manual effort requiring extensive clinical workups, functional and experimental assays, and eventual identification of genotype- and phenotype-matched individuals. Here, we introduce VarPPUD, a tool trained on prioritized variants from UDN cases, that leverages gene-, amino acid-, and nucleotide-level features to discern pathogenic (disease causative) variants from other damaging or deleterious variants that are unlikely to be confirmed as relevant to the disease. VarPPUD achieves a cross-validated accuracy of 79.3% and precision of 77.5% on a held-out subset of uniquely challenging UDN cases, respectively representing an average 18.6% and 23.4% improvement over nine existing state-of-the-art pathogenicity prediction tools on this task. We validate VarPPUD’s ability to discriminate likely from unlikely pathogenic variants using both synthetic data generated via a GAN-based framework and a temporally held-out set of UDN patients evaluated between 2022 and 2024. The model was trained exclusively on data available through 2021 and applied without retraining to the post-2021 cohort, demonstrating strong generalizability to newly accrued cases. Finally, we show how VarPPUD can be probed to evaluate each input feature’s importance and contribution toward prediction—an essential step toward understanding the distinct characteristics of newly-uncovered disease-causing variants.

                <p>by Adel Heydarabadipour, Lucian Smith, Joseph L. Hellerstein, Herbert M. Sauro</p>

SBMLNetwork is an open-source software library that makes the SBML Layout and Render packages practical for standards-based visualization of biochemical models. Current tools often manage model visualization data in custom-designed, tool-specific formats and store it separately from the model itself, hindering interoperability, reproducibility, and the seamless integration of visualization with model data. SBMLNetwork addresses these limitations by building directly on the SBML Layout and Render specifications, automating the generation of standards-compliant visualization data, offering a modular implementation with broad integration support, and providing a robust API tailored to the needs of systems biology researchers. We illustrate the capabilities of SBMLNetwork across key visualization tasks, including SBGN-compliant visualization, application of predefined style templates, layout arrangement to reflect pathway logic, and integration of model data into network diagrams. These examples demonstrate how SBMLNetwork enables high-level visualization features and seamlessly translate user intent into reproducible outputs that support both structural representation and dynamic data visualization within the SBML model.

                <p>by Emily P. Van Syoc, Andres Gomez, Emily R. Davenport, Seth R. Bordenstein</p>

Fungi in the gut microbiome, collectively known as the mycobiome, are a prevalent yet neglected component of the human holobiont. A major question in the study of gut microbial communities is whether fungi exhibit eco-evolutionary patterns that are consistent with partner fidelity and long-term associations. We compared gut fungal profiles across natural populations of humans and nonhuman primates and identified significant degrees of primate-mycobiome phylosymbiosis as well as human-enriched fungal taxa. Notably, subsets of fungi are cophylogenetic and exhibit cospeciation patterns in hominids. These findings cautiously originate a new view on the eco-evolutionary potential that can shape the composition of human and primate gut mycobiomes.

                <p>by Bhagaban Mallik, Sajad A. Bhat, Xinnan Wang, C. Andrew Frank</p>

Neurons require high amounts of energy, and mitochondria help to fulfill this requirement. Dysfunctional mitochondria trigger problems in various neuronal tasks. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse, we previously reported that Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunits were required for maintaining NMJ function and growth. Here, we report tissue-specific adaptations at the NMJ when MCI is depleted. In <i>Drosophila</i> motor neurons, MCI depletion causes profound cytological defects and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). But instead of diminishing synapse function, neuronal ROS triggers a homeostatic signaling process that maintains normal NMJ excitation. We identify molecules mediating this compensatory response. MCI depletion in muscles also enhances local ROS. But high levels of muscle ROS cause destructive responses: synapse degeneration, mitochondrial fragmentation, and impaired neurotransmission. In humans, mutations affecting MCI subunits cause severe neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The tissue-level effects that we describe in the <i>Drosophila</i> system are potentially relevant to forms of mitochondrial pathogenesis.

<p>Even 20 years before expected onset of clinical symptoms, FDG uptake was lower for DS compared to neurotypical familial controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). ADAD baseline FDG was similar to neurotypical familial controls until 7 years before expected symptom onset. Both symptomatic individuals with DS and ADAD had lower FDG compared to neurotypical familial controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). A higher amyloid burden was associated with lower FDG for both genetic forms, with similar rates of decline in FDG uptake for DS and ADAD who were amyloid positive.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Brain glucose metabolism is substantially lower for people with DS, even in individuals who are cognitively stable. The patterns of FDG decline are distinct in these 2 genetically determined forms of AD. The diagnostic utility of FDG-PET is specific to the genetic form of AD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78045?af=R">Microneurography Reveals Unmyelinated Small Nerve Fiber Dysfunction in Long COVID</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To review the microneurography findings of long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) patients who presented to the clinic with multisystem involvement affecting neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, pulmonary, and immunological domains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 36 consecutive long COVID patients using microneurography. We evaluated abnormalities in C nociceptors, including spontaneous activity, peripheral sensitization, multiple spikes, conduction failure, and alterations in activity-dependent slowing of conduction velocity. Sympathetic nerve fiber function was assessed using the recovery cycle of excitability. Results were compared with a large normative database.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The mean age was 40.9 ± 9.2 years (range 17–60 years), with a female predominance (30/36, 83.3%). Patients were seen from 15 to 61 months after onset of symptoms (35.7 ± 11.3 months). All patients presented with neuropathic symptoms, mainly pain and orthostatic intolerance. A total of 32 patients (88.9%) had objective electrophysiological abnormalities in peripheral C fibers, including spontaneous nociceptor activity (61.1%), peripheral sensitization (27.8%), and multiple spikes (11.1%). Long COVID patients also showed a significant shift in C nociceptor populations, with a higher prevalence of type 1B mechano-insensitive C nociceptors compared with healthy controls. Changes in activity-dependent slowing of conduction velocity differed in opposite directions between mechano-sensitive and mechano-insensitive C nociceptors. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers also showed abnormal recovery cycles with a lack of supernormality, suggesting impaired neuronal homeostasis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides novel electrophysiological evidence linking small nerve fiber dysfunction to long COVID. These findings align with previous histological evidence of small nerve fiber loss, reinforcing the hypothesis that peripheral nerve dysfunction contributes to the multisystem symptoms of long COVID.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To establish a framework for validating candidate biomarkers of cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD) associated with cognitive impairment and characterize individuals enrolled by the MarkVCID2 consortium under this framework.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants age 60 to 90 years were enrolled across 17 MarkVCID2 sites. Recruitment was targeted to enrich in cognitive symptoms (mild dementia, mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive decline), defined risk factors (diabetes mellitus, advanced hypertension), and Black/African American, White, and Hispanic/Latino subgroups. Enrolled participants underwent baseline visits that included cognitive testing, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biofluid collection. Provisional risk for SVD-related cognitive decline was estimated primarily by baseline cognitive symptoms plus SVD risk factors. Adjudicated risk status was estimated by cognitive symptoms plus presence of moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, or lacunes on baseline MRI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MarkVCID2 enrolled 1883 individuals age 73.4 ± 7.5 years, 65.0% female, 24.2% Hispanic, and 27.1% non-Hispanic Black. Among enrollees, 44.8% were provisionally designated high-risk. After baseline MRI, 48.5% were categorized as adjudicated high-risk status, with substantial recategorization both from low- to high-risk (primarily because of MRI lesions without SVD risk factors) and high- to low-risk (primarily suspected cognitive impairment at screening not confirmed by baseline testing).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MarkVCID2 baseline data indicate successful enrollment of diverse individuals enriched in factors associated with SVD-related cognitive decline. Changes over 3 years of longitudinal follow-up will be analyzed to validate the candidate biomarkers for 2 projected contexts of use: subject selection (identifying likelihood of future SVD progression) and study outcome (efficiently measuring SVD progression).

[vers</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aimed to co-design culturally adapted pain neuroscience education (PNE) materials for a Lebanese population. The developed material aimed to enhance patients’ understanding of pain and its influences, offer strategies for self-management, and promote healthier lifestyles. Methods Employing a community-based participatory action research (PAR) approach, insights were gathered from PTs and male and female patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP), who were the end users of the co-designed product. PAR, rooted in bridging universities and communities, emphasizes the active involvement and actions of individuals within impacted communities, fostering collaboration and engagement throughout the research process. Data from the PAR groups were subjected to reflexive thematic analysis. Results Twelve individuals with CLBP, and eight PTs, participated in the interviews. They represent diverse educational backgrounds, religious affiliations, and regions across Lebanon. Three key themes were identified by exploring the cultural adaptation of PNE material: the ecological validity model (EVM) dimensions, implementation challenges, and lived experiences of CLBP patients, shedding light on their personal and religious perspectives on pain. Conclusion This study emphasizes the need for ongoing refinement and collaboration to effectively implement PNE in diverse populations. Utilizing frameworks such as EVM and the Barrera model ensures alignment with cultural norms while addressing specific cultural contexts such as appearance, pain beliefs, and religious influences. alignment with cultural norms while addressing specific cultural contexts such as appearance, pain beliefs, and religious influences.

                Introduction Managing esophageal foreign bodies in cognitively impaired adults with multiple congenital anomalies presents different complex challenges, particularly when anatomical abnormalities, airway anomalies, and behavioral disturbances are present at the same time. These underlying factors can complicate both diagnosis and treatment, necessitating a highly individualized and multidisciplinary approach. This case shows the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving videolaryngoscopic intubation, flexible endoscopy, and rigid oesophagoscopy. Case Presentation A 32-year-old male with multiple congenital anomalies—including microcephaly, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, severe kyphoscoliosis, and lower limb muscle atrophy—presented with acute dysphagia. CT imaging revealed a calcified foreign body lodged within a multidiverticular oesophagus in its cervical portion, along with a sliding hiatal hernia. Due to behavioural unpredictability and risk of aspiration, awake fibreoptic intubation was considered unsafe. A modified rapid sequence induction using propofol and C-MAC® videolaryngoscopy enabled successful first-pass intubation. Flexible endoscopy was initially misdirected into a large proximal diverticulum, leading the team to proceed with rigid oesophagoscopy. The ENT team successfully retrieved multiple bone fragments. Postoperative respiratory distress was managed conservatively, without reintubation. Clinical Discussion This case underlines the significance of interdisciplinary coordination and the limitations of flexible endoscopy in altered oesophageal anatomy. Videolaryngoscopy proved essential in managing a complex airway scenario. Conclusion Tailored, proactive strategies involving anaesthetists, ENT, and gastroenterology teams are essential in similar high-risk settings to ensure procedural success.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-956/v1?src=rss">Toward Effective Educational Supervision in Yemen: A Hybrid Fuzzy Delphi and Clustering Analysis of Technical Barriers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives Comprehensive educational supervision is essential for ensuring quality teaching, fostering professional development, and supporting institutional capacity building. However, its implementation encounters numerous structural, technical, and human resource challenges. This study aimed to identify, validate, rank, and cluster the technical barriers affecting comprehensive educational supervision in Amanat Al Asimah, Yemen. This aligns with national reform goals by offering strategic insights to improve supervisory systems, thereby enhancing teaching quality, institutional performance, and educational resilience in fragile contexts Methods This study employed a three-phase mixed-methods approach. Initially, a literature review identified 11 key barriers to effective supervision. These were validated using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM), involving 16 experienced educational supervisors to assess the consensus and suitability of the items. Subsequently, a quantitative survey targeting 370 teachers was conducted to evaluate their perceived severity. Fuzzy set theory was used to aggregate and defuzzify the responses, generating crisp scores for prioritization. Finally, K-means clustering was applied to segment the barriers based on their impacts. Results FDM analysis confirmed the validity of all 11 identified barriers, with a domain-level threshold of 0.093 and an average expert consensus of 90%, indicating strong agreement. The fuzzy set-based evaluation highlighted three top-priority challenges: weak supervisory competencies, limited ability to develop effective supervisory plans, and poor supervisor-teacher relationships. K-means clustering grouped the barriers into three segments: one high-priority barrier, seven moderate-priority concerns, and three low-priority issues. Notably, weak supervisory competencies emerged as the most critical barrier, isolated in a high-priority cluster. Conclusion These findings provide evidence-based guidance for policy and strategic interventions aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of supervision systems in fragile educational settings. The study concludes with recommendations for strengthening supervisory competencies, improving resource allocation, and fostering trust-based supervisor-teacher relationships, thereby contributing to the quality of education and institutional resilience in Yemen.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-954/v1?src=rss">Factors associated with the prevalence of refractive errors among medical students in the United Arab Emirates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Refractive errors (REs) remain a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Medical students frequently report a high burden of REs, possibly attributable to genetic influences and lifestyle factors like extended near-work activities and limited outdoor exposure. Limited data exist on the prevalence and determinants of REs among medical students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of REs in this population and to identify the key potential risk factors associated with them. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among medical students at the United Arab Emirates University. A validated 14-item questionnaire assessed the presence and type of REs, demographic and physical characteristics, educational level, family history, electronic device usage, and sunlight exposure. The survey was disseminated electronically between November 2023 and February 2024. Proper statistical analysis was employed to determine key predictors of REs. Results Among 328 participants, the overall prevalence of refractive errors was 61.3%, with myopia (with or without astigmatism) accounting for 84.1% of these cases. Female students exhibited more than three-fold higher risk of having REs than males (p = 0.01), and students with a first-degree relative affected had a 7.6-fold greater likelihood of having REs (p < 0.001). Most students with REs (77.1%) used spectacles for correction, and only 11 had laser refractive surgery. Finally, body weight significantly modulated RE type, favoring hyperopia among heavier participants (p < 0.05). Conclusion This study reveals a high prevalence of REs among medical students in UAE, with myopia being the predominant type. The key risk factors associated with this high prevalence were female sex and positive family history. These findings underscore the need for targeted preventative and corrective strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-194/v2?src=rss">Effect of ACTH4-10Pro8-Gly9-Pro10 on anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13) expression in acute spinal cord injury models (male Sprague Dawley rats) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a damage to the spinal cord caused mainly by trauma resulting in major motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunctions. Its final neurological outcome is determined by both primary and secondary injury processes. A key component of secondary injury mechanisms after initial trauma is neuroinflammation. A neuroprotective compound, ACTH4-10Pro8-Gly9-Pro10 (ACTH4-10) also known as semax, has shown neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. ACTH4-10 has also been actively used in the treatment of brain ischemia without serious complication reported. Here, we analyzed the effects of ACTH4-10 at regulating the inflammatory cascade in SCI by looking at anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13) levels after acute SCI. Method We carried out laminectomies in male Sprague Dawley rats at the second thoracic vertebrae. After laminectomy, we exposed the myelum and created mild SCI models with 20-g, and severe SCI with 35-g aneurysm clips. ACTH4-10 was administered intranasally to the treatment group and 0.9% NaCl to the control group (placebo). Both groups were kept alive and terminated at 3 and 6 hours. The tissue sample preparations were fixed in formalin and examined for immunohistochemistry. Quantitative measurement of the cytokines was done in the posterior horn area with specific associated anti-monoclonal antibodies. Results Rats with mild SCI that were given ACTH4-10 showed greater anti-inflammatory levels at 3 hours post-compression but only IL-10 and IL-13 were elevated significantly at 6 hours. Rats with severe compression in ACTH4-10 group showed greater levels of IL-10, IL-13 at 3 hours and IL-4, IL-10 at 6 hours compared with the placebo group. Conclusions Administration of ACTH4-10Pro8-Gly9-Pro10 intranasal can increase anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in Sprague Dawley rat models with mild and severe SCI. Expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines was greater in mild compression and 3-hour termination. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and clinical outcome in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00183-3?rss=yes">How do ramping dynamics influence computations in the entorhinal cortex?</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex is crucial for declarative memory and spatial cognition. Recent experiments reveal that many entorhinal neurons represent information through ramping activity in which their firing rate changes monotonically between behaviourally relevant boundaries. This Opinion considers the implications of entorhinal ramping dynamics for computations within the hippocampal formation. Localised firing of extensively investigated grid, border, and object cells is suited to categorisation and rapid learning, whereas ramping activity may reflect compressed codes for communication between areas, or entorhinal computations suited to generalisation. Thus, ramping dynamics may be a manifestation of fundamental but largely overlooked mechanisms contributing to memory and spatial cognition, suggesting a need to re-evaluate models of hippocampal–entorhinal function centred exclusively on sparse, localised codes.

                van der Net et al. show that mechanical interactions with the stromal component collagen I trigger reprogramming of colorectal cancer cells into a fetal-like state, through mechanosensitive integrins and calcium channels. These findings implicate mechanical forces in the regulation of stem cell plasticity during the metastatic cascade of colorectal cancer.

                Carpentier et al. suggest that seipin regulates palmitate flux between sphingolipids and glycerolipids. Seipin loss causes ceramide buildup, trans-Golgi disorganization, and misrouting of caveolin-1 to lipid droplets instead of the plasma membrane. These findings identify seipin as a key regulator of overall lipid metabolism, protein trafficking, and organelle membrane homeostasis.

                Immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade (ICB) is effective in only a minority of cancer patients, suggesting that additional treatment strategies are needed. Peng et al. reveal a novel immune-suppressing mechanism mediated by the RSK-UBE2L6-RNF19A signaling axis and suggest a potential combination therapy strategy by combining ICB with RSK inhibition.

                Alvarez et al. demonstrate that SINV and CHIKV both require BBB infection for neuroinvasion. Neuroinvasive SINV uses a specialist entry strategy, relying solely on PCDH10, while non-neuroinvasive SINV is a generalist engaging multiple receptors yet infecting poorly. CHIKV instead depends on post-entry processes, revealing distinct mechanisms for neuroinvasion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106823">A SHERLOCK toolbox for eco-epidemiological surveillance of African trypanosomes in domestic pigs from Western Africa</a></h4>

              
                Animal African trypanosomosis (AAT), caused by protist parasites of the genus <i>Trypanosoma</i>, puts upward of a million head of livestock at risk across 37 countries in Africa. The economic impact of AAT and the presence of human-infectious trypanosomes in animals place a clear importance on improving diagnostics for animal trypanosomes to map the distribution of the veterinary parasites and identify reservoirs of human-infectious trypanosomes. We have adapted the CRISPR-based detection toolkit SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) for trypanosomatid parasites responsible for AAT (SHERLOCK4AAT) including Pan-trypanosomatid, <i>Trypanozoon</i>, <i>T. vivax</i>, <i>T. congolense</i>, <i>T. theileri</i>, <i>T. simiae,</i> and <i>T. suis</i> assays. To test the applicability of this technique in the field, we analysed dried blood spots collected from 200 farm and 224 free-ranging pigs in endemic and historical human African trypanosomiasis foci in Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire, respectively. The results revealed that SHERLOCK4AAT can detect and discriminate between trypanosome species involved in multiple infections with a high sensitivity. 62.7% [58.1, 67.3] of pigs were found infected with at least one trypanosome species. <i>T. brucei gambiense</i>, a human-infectious trypanosome, was found in one animal at both sites, highlighting the risk that these animals may act as persistent reservoirs. These data suggest that, due to their proximity to humans and their attractiveness to tsetse flies, pigs could act as sentinels to monitor <i>T. b. gambiense</i> circulation using the SHERLOCK4AAT toolbox.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96713">Identification of type 2 diabetes- and obesity-associated human β-cells using deep transfer learning</a></h4>

              
                Diabetes affects &gt;10% of adults worldwide and is caused by impaired production or response to insulin, resulting in chronic hyperglycemia. Pancreatic islet β-cells are the sole source of endogenous insulin, and our understanding of β-cell dysfunction and death in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is incomplete. Single-cell RNA-seq data supports heterogeneity as an important factor in β-cell function and survival. However, it is difficult to identify which β-cell phenotypes are critical for T2D etiology and progression. Our goal was to prioritize specific disease-related β-cell subpopulations to better understand T2D pathogenesis and identify relevant genes for targeted therapeutics. To address this, we applied a deep transfer learning tool, DEGAS, which maps disease associations onto single-cell RNA-seq data from bulk expression data. Independent runs of DEGAS using T2D or obesity status identified distinct β-cell subpopulations. A singular cluster of T2D-associated β-cells was identified; however, β-cells with high obese-DEGAS scores contained two subpopulations derived largely from either non-diabetic (ND) or T2D donors. The obesity-associated ND cells were enriched for translation and unfolded protein response genes compared to T2D cells. We selected CDKN1C and DLK1 for validation by immunostaining in human pancreas sections from healthy and T2D donors. Both CDKN1C and DLK1 were heterogeneously expressed among β-cells. CDKN1C was increased in β-cells from T2D donors, in agreement with the DEGAS predictions, while DLK1 appeared depleted from T2D islets of some donors. In conclusion, DEGAS has the potential to advance our holistic understanding of the β-cell transcriptomic phenotypes, including features that distinguish β-cells in obese ND or lean T2D states. Future work will expand this approach to additional human islet omics datasets to reveal the complex multicellular interactions driving T2D.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Human sensorimotor control is remarkably fast and accurate at the system level despite severe speed-accuracy trade-offs at the component level. The discrepancy between the contrasting speed-accuracy trade-offs at these two levels is a paradox. Meanwhile, speed accuracy trade-offs, heterogeneity, and layered architectures are ubiquitous in nerves, skeletons, and muscles, but they have only been studied in isolation using domain-specific models. In this article, we develop a mechanistic model for how component speed-accuracy trade-offs constrain sensorimotor control that is consistent with Fitts’ law for reaching. The model suggests that diversity among components deconstrains the limitations of individual components in sensorimotor control. Such diversity-enabled sweet spots (DESSs) are ubiquitous in nature, explaining why large heterogeneities exist in the components of biological systems and how natural selection routinely evolves systems with fast and accurate responses using imperfect components.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Firing rate models are dynamical systems widely used in applied and theoretical neuroscience to describe local cortical dynamics in neuronal populations. By providing a macroscopic perspective of neuronal activity, these models are essential for investigating oscillatory phenomena, chaotic behavior, and associative memory processes. Despite their widespread use, the application of firing rate models to associative memory networks has received limited mathematical exploration, and most existing studies are focused on specific models. Conversely, well-established associative memory designs, such as Hopfield networks, lack key biologically relevant features intrinsic to firing rate models, including positivity and interpretable synaptic matrices reflecting the action of long-term potentiation and long-term depression. To address this gap, we propose a general framework that ensures the emergence of rescaled memory patterns as stable equilibria in the firing rate dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which the memories are locally and globally asymptotically stable, providing insights into constructing biologically plausible and robust systems for associative memory retrieval.</span>

A unique component of transformer models is the scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) layer, which does not appear to have an analog in prior signal processing algorithms. Here, we show that SDPA operates using a novel principle that projects the current state estimate onto the space spanned by prior estimates. We show that SDPA, when used for causal recursive state estimation, implements constrained state estimation in circumstances where the constraint is unknown and may be time varying. Since constraints in high-dimensional space may represent the complex relationships that define nonlinear signals and models, this suggests that the SDPA layer and transformer models leverage constrained estimation to achieve their success. This also suggests that transformers and the SPDA layer could be a computational model for previously unexplained capabilities of human behavior.</span>

Low-rank factorizations have been extremely successful in reconstructing and generalizing high-dimensional data in a wide variety of machine learning problems from drug-target discovery to music recommendations.

We propose a reformulation of the widely used logistic matrix factorization in which we use the distance, rather than the dot product, to measure similarity between latent factors. We show that this measure of similarity, which can draw nonlinear decision boundaries and respect triangle inequalities between points, has more expressive power and modeling capacity. The distance-based model implemented in Euclidean and hyperbolic space outperforms previous formulations of logistic matrix factorization on three different biological test problems with disparate structure and statistics. In particular, we show that a distance-based factorization (1) generalizes better to test data, (2) achieves optimal performance at lower factor space dimension, and (3) clusters data better in the latent factor space.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sequential learning involves learning tasks in a sequence and proves challenging for most neural networks. Biological neural networks regularly succeed at the sequential learning challenge and are even capable of transferring knowledge both forward and backward between tasks. Artificial neural networks often totally fail to transfer performance between tasks and regularly suffer from degraded performance or catastrophic forgetting on previous tasks. Models of associative memory have been used to investigate the discrepancy between biological and artificial neural networks due to their biological ties and inspirations, of which the Hopfield network is the most studied model. The dense associative memory (DAM), or modern Hopfield network, generalizes the Hopfield network, allowing for greater capacities and prototype learning behaviors while still retaining the associative memory structure. We give a substantial review of the sequential learning space with particular respect to the Hopfield network and associative memories. We present the first published benchmarks of sequential learning in the DAM using various sequential learning techniques and analyze the results of the sequential learning to demonstrate previously unseen transitions in the behavior of the DAM. This letter also discusses the departure from biological plausibility that may affect the utility of the DAM as a tool for studying biological neural networks.

">Hippocampal functional connectivity changes associated with active and lecture-based physics learning</a></h4>

              
                Introductory university physics courses often face the dual challenge of introducing students to new physics concepts while also addressing their preconceived notions that conflict with scientific principles. Active learning pedagogical approaches, which employ constructivist principles and emphasize active participation in the learning process, have been shown to be effective in teaching complex physics concepts. However, while the behavioral effects of constructivist methodologies are largely understood, the neurobiological underpinnings that facilitate this process remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed students enrolled in either an active learning or lecture-based physics course before and after a 15-week semester of learning and examined changes in hippocampal whole-brain connectivity. We focused on the hippocampus given its critical role in learning and memory. Our findings revealed that hippocampal connectivity with brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes decreased over time, regardless of instructional approach. Results also indicated that active learning students exhibited increased hippocampal connectivity with parietal, cerebellar, and frontal regions, reflecting experiential learning based on constructivist principles, whereas lecture-based students exhibited increased hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform gyrus, suggesting learning through passive observation. Our findings demonstrate that while some aspects of hippocampal functional connectivity may decrease over time, active vs. passive learning may preferentially enhance hippocampal connectivity during physics learning.

">Transcriptomic Signatures of Hippocampal Subregions and Neuronal Nuclei in Active Place Avoidance Memory Maintenance</a></h4>

              
                The gene expression changes associated with memory acquisition, consolidation and reconsolidation, all active epochs in memory formation, have been well characterized in the rodent hippocampus. Less is known, however, of the changes in gene expression supporting the maintenance of memory, particularly when it remains undisturbed or offline days after the memory experience. In this study, we used a combination of spatial transcriptomic and single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to measure the gene expression changes in the dorsal hippocampus during an early phase of offline memory maintenance, 3 days after the post-training retention test of an active place avoidance memory. Through spatial transcriptomics we identified spatially regionalized differential gene expression and biological process enrichment, with CA1, CA3, and DG exhibiting differential expression of genes involved in post-synaptic function, synaptic vesicle transport, and neuronal differentiation, respectively. Notably, through snRNA-seq, differentially expressed genes detected in clusters of hippocampal neurons from the trained animal were largely defined by their down regulation of genes involved in ATP synthesis and cytoplasmic translation. With both techniques we also examined the gene expression changes in a putative subset of memory-associated neurons through the detection of eYFP mRNA in the Arc-Cre/flox-eYFP double transgenic mouse line. Amongst this population of cells, we detected a limited number of differentially expressed genes unique to each subregional population and associated with synaptic plasticity and post-synaptic signaling. Our results suggest that two overarching transcriptomic patters contribute to the functional changes in hippocampal cells during offline memory maintenance: a regional distribution of pathways linked to synaptic functions, and a reduction of metabolic activity across hippocampal sub-regions and memory-associated neuronal ensembles.

">Beyond Alzheimer's story: how an engineered molecule gained an endogenous essence</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is extra-neuronal protein aggregates formed mainly by the amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}), that are deposited inside the brain as amyloid plaques. The engineered peptide Ac-His-Ala-Glu-Glu-NH2 (HAEE) suppresses the formation of amyloid plaques in vivo and is being tested as an anti-amyloid drug candidate. Here, by using a quantitative mass-spectrometry method we discover that HAEE peptide represents a normal endogenous component of human blood plasma. Moreover, the HAEE level has been significantly reduced in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD (n=200) as compared with the control participants with no clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment (n=150). Thus, endogenous HAEE may be considered as a potential blood-based biomarker in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, while exogenous HAEE may serve as a drug in AD-modifying therapy.

">Dynamic changes in chromosome and nuclear architecture during maturation of normal and ALS C9orf72 motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                We have investigated changes in chromosome conformation, nuclear organization, and transcription during differentiation and maturation of control and mutant motor neurons harboring hexanucleotide expansions in the C9orf72 gene that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using an in vitro reprogramming, differentiation and neural maturation protocol, we obtained highly purified populations of post-mitotic motor neurons for both normal and diseased cells. As expected, as fibroblasts are reprogrammed into iPSCs, and as iPSCs differentiate into motor neurons, chromatin accessibility, chromosome conformation, and nuclear organization change along with large-scale alterations in transcriptional profiles. We find that the transcriptome changes extensively during the first three weeks of post-mitotic neuronal maturation, with thousands of genes changing expression, but then is relatively stable for the next three weeks. In contrast, chromosome conformation and nuclear organization continue to change over the entire 6-week maturation period: chromosome territoriality increases, long-range interactions along chromosomes decrease, compartmentalization strength increases, and centromeres and telomeres increasingly cluster. In motor neurons derived from ALS patients such changes in chromosome conformation were much reduced. Chromatin accessibility changes also showed delayed maturation. The transcriptome in these cells matured relatively normally but with notable changes in expression of genes involved in lipid, sterol and mitochondrial function. We conclude that neural maturation is associated with large scale post-mitotic changes in gene expression, chromosome conformation and nuclear organization, and that these processes are defective in motor neurons derived from ALS patients carrying C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions.

">Establishing a continuum of cell types in the visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian cerebral cortex is composed of neurons whose properties vary in a continuous fashion rather than falling into discrete cell types. In the mouse visual cortex, excitatory neurons in layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) form such a continuum along cortical depth, patterned by the graded expression of hundreds of genes. Here we sought to understand how this continuum develops and contributes to cortical wiring. Using single-nucleus multiomics (RNA- and ATAC-Seq) and spatial transcriptomics, we show that the L2/3 continuum is established in two phases. During the first postnatal week, a genetically hardwired program establishes a primitive continuum of cell identities spanning the depth of L2/3. The second program, promoted by visual experience, is later superimposed upon the preexisting continuum. This second phase is driven by activity-regulated transcription factors that drive the L2/3 depth-dependent expression of genes linked to synaptic function and plasticity. We show that neurons at different positions along the L2/3 continuum project preferentially to distinct higher visual areas and that visual deprivation disrupts targeting to some higher visual areas while sparing others. Thus, cortical continua emerge through a stepwise process in which genetic programs and sensory experience specify neuronal identity and sculpt intracortical wiring specificity.

">Differential functional connectivity between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is associated with heterogeneity in open field exploration</a></h4>

              
                A common paradigm in behavioral neuroscience involves recording neural activity from freely moving rodents as they forage in an open field. This procedure is often used in studies investigating spatial navigation, where recording is conducted in regions such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. It is usually assumed that there is no systematic variation in behavior in this paradigm, thereby allowing spatial representations to be examined without the confounding effects of behavior change. Here we show that the behavior of rats in this paradigm can be algorithmically divided into at least two distinct modes, and that the transitions between these modes is marked by distinct differences in theta and gamma band power in the hippocampus, as well as transition-associated communication between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, with information strongly flowing from hippocampus to prefrontal cortex during the transition period. Moreover, we show that following a maternal immune activation intervention, intra-regional changes in power are preserved, but communication between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is impaired. These findings demonstrate that animals in the open field perform distinct behaviors that are accompanied by marked changes in brain activity and regional communication.

">Familial Risk for Dementia, Cognitive Performance, and the Human Cerebello-Hippocampal Circuit: A Study in the European Prevention of Alzheimers Disease cohort</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellohippocampal (CBHP) circuit is increasingly implicated in episodic and spatial memory, yet its role in normal aging, dementia risk, and sex differences remains unclear. Structure and function in both the hippocampus and cerebellum have been linked to mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimers Disease, and cognitive decline in healthy older adults. Literature on the CBHP circuit is largely limited to animal studies and small samples of young adults in the context of visuospatial abilities, underscoring the need for large, diverse aging cohorts to establish CB-HP connectivity as an early, translatable marker of neurodegeneration. Here, we investigate the CBHP circuit in the context of aging, dementia risk, behavior, and sex differences in healthy older adults to advance understanding of cognitive decline in the aging population. We explored this relationship in 857 healthy adults with and without a family history of dementia (aged 50-88, 59% female, 71% family history positive) using resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsMRI) and behavioral assessments. We hypothesized that CB-HP functional connectivity (FC) would be lower with increased age, relate positively to cognitive performance, be lower in females positive for family history of dementia, and be lower in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-risk than cognitively normal (CN) participants with sex differences therein. We observed selective links between CBHP FC, cognition, and sex. MCI risk participants performed worse on spatial memory performances than CN, whereas CBHP FC showed opposite performance slopes by risk status, suggesting the CBHP circuit may function as a compensatory network for short-term recall. Sex differences were seen on cognitive tasks (delayed episodic memory and spatial tasks) and in CBHP a better visuospatial index was linked to greater FC in females, while males displayed an inverse relationship. Behavioral differences by familial dementia history were shown, although CBHP FC did not show effects here. Overall, CB-HP networks appear behaviorally silent in the aggregate but reveal risk and sex dependent relationships when memory demands and circuit nodes are considered.

">Impact of Task Similarity and Training Regimes on Cognitive Transfer and Interference</a></h4>

              
                Learning depends not only on the content of what we learn, but also on how we learn and on how experiences are structured over time. To investigate how task similarity and training regime interact during learning, we trained participants on spatial and conceptual learning tasks that shared either similar or distinct underlying structures, using either interleaved or blocked regimes. Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different. In contrast, blocked training produced the opposite effect: it improved performance and facilitated transfer across similar tasks. This effect, however, emerged only when participants first learned the conceptual task, followed by the spatial task, suggesting an asymmetric interaction between task order and structural similarity. We also replicated our results using a neural network model, providing converging evidence for the computational principles governing the interplay between training regime and structural similarity in multi-task learning.

">Modular inhibitory coding in binary networks</a></h4>

              
                We developed and characterized properties of new class of binary models where, as observed in biological networks, excitatory neurons are functionally separated from inhibitory units. New patterns, represented as activation and inactivation of binary units in excitatory layer, are stored in the network through recruitment and training of inhibitory units that are group into individual modules and interact with excitatory layer. We investigate the roles the two populations play in memory storage and show that inhibitory layer plays a critical role in memory storage and management and that capacity of this new type of network scales with number of inhibitory neurons. Further, we show that performance of the network is only gradually diminished when excitatory to excitatory connections are removed, but critically depends on inhibitory to excitatory connections. These results are in line with new experimental work showing that inhibitory interneurons are playing critical role in memory storage and recall in the brain networks and may also address why generally excitatory networks exhibit sparser reciprocal connectivity as compared to connections to/from inhibitory units. We further show advantages of so designed coding shame in terms of memory capacity, its expansion with progressive storage of new memories as well as network behavior for large memory loading.

">Distinct cellular processes drive motor skill learning in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of research, the biological mechanisms by which motor skills consolidate in the human brain remain poorly understood. Diffusion MRI provides a unique opportunity to probe biological processes non-invasively, as water displacements occur on the micrometer scale. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), our team showed that motor sequence learning (MSL) induces microstructural changes in the hippocampus and key motor regions, suggesting that declarative and procedural systems may operate as part of the same network. Yet DTI cannot identify the cellular source of these changes, leaving open whether they reflect structural plasticity, remodeling of dendritic and astrocytic processes described in rodents, or transient homeostatic responses that accompany learning, neuronal and astrocytic swelling. Here, we combined ultra-high-gradient diffusion MRI with the compartment-based Soma and Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI) model to disentangle the cellular basis of motor skill memory consolidation. DTI showed that MSL induced rapid microstructural changes in the hippocampus, precuneus, and motor regions, but only those in the precuneus and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) persisted overnight. SANDI revealed that DTI changes were driven by two distinct cellular processes: a transient enlargement of the cell soma across all regions consistent with a short-lived homeostatic response, and a sustained rise in cell-process density restricted to the precuneus and PPC, compatible with structural plasticity. By decomposing diffusion signals into their cellular sources, our work disambiguates transient and enduring processes, providing the first non-invasive evidence for the cellular basis of human motor memory consolidation and a framework for studying neuroplasticity in vivo.

">Morphine regulates astrocyte transcriptional dynamics in the ventral tegmental area by stimulation of glucocorticoid signaling</a></h4>

              
                Opioids are potent analgesics often prescribed for the treatment of chronic pain, a condition affecting millions worldwide. Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.

                How the human auditory cortex prioritizes relevant information amid concurrent sounds has been a long-standing question in auditory cognitive neuroscience. The present study used auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) to tag the electrocortical response to a tone embedded in concurrent naturalistic sounds, addressing methodological challenges with overlapping auditory streams. Participants endorsing low (LMS) or high in misophonia symptoms (HMS) - a condition with decreased tolerance to specific, typically orofacial, sounds - were recruited. Sounds varied in their emotional valence (pleasant, neutral, unpleasant, and orofacial) to investigate how emotional content modulates attentional competition and how competition is resolved in listeners with misophonia traits. Affective ratings, alpha-band changes, and pupil dilation in response to the sounds were also assessed. Hypothetical models of competition were tested, revealing a facilitation trend in the ASSR amplitude when accompanied by pleasant and unpleasant, compared to neutral sounds, regardless of misophonia symptoms. However, ASSR was selectively reduced in the HMS but not the LMS group when accompanied by orofacial sounds. Analyses of alpha-band, pupil, and rating data showed that the groups differed primarily in their response to pleasant sounds and orofacial sounds, with the HMS group exhibiting a stronger response to orofacial sounds than the LMS group.

Using resting-state fMRI from 584 neonates in the Developing Human Connectome Project, we provide the first comprehensive systems-level characterization of human visual cortex within hours of birth and across the third trimester of gestation. We discover that newborns possess a sophisticated visual architecture already functionally organized into three distinct pathways (ventral, lateral, and dorsal), each exhibiting posterior-to-anterior hierarchical structure and adult-like topographic organization. This tripartite visual organization differs from the bipartite organization observed in macaques, suggesting this architecture emerges through intrinsic developmental mechanisms rather than being a product of extensive postnatal experience and environmental adaptation. Moreover, pathway segregation, hierarchical ordering, and connectivity maturity all strengthen progressively with gestational age, revealing that visual cortical organization emerges through an active developmental program that unfolds across late gestation. Yet, despite this large-scale structure, individual pathways follow strikingly different maturation trajectories: dorsal areas exhibit a near-adult-like functional organization, even at the earliest gestational timepoints tested, whereas ventral areas remain immature and poised for experience-dependent refinement. These findings reframe our understanding of early visual development by revealing that complex functional networks emerge before substantial visual experience, yet are differentially prepared for plasticity, providing crucial insights into how evolution has optimized the brain for rapid learning while maintaining the flexibility needed for adaptation to diverse environments.

">Comparative Connectomics Highlights Conserved Architectural Synaptic Motifs in the Drosophila Mushroom Body</a></h4>

              
                While the influence of synaptic plasticity on learning and memory has been extensively studied, the detailed patterns of synaptic connectivity remain incompletely mapped. Convergent synaptic motifs -- a tight grouping of at least two axons whose active zones are within 300nm and which are presynaptic to the same target -- are a common feature of neural circuits in the insect brain and are believed to serve as an important computational primitive in many brain areas. The Mushroom Body (MB) of Drosophila, for instance, is the center of associative learning and memory, where sensory information is conducted by Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB, and integrated by MB output neurons (MBONs). Indeed, the majority of KC-to-MBON synapses occur in a convergent motif. Nonetheless, the functional role of this convergent motif is not well studied. To gain insight into their potential role in the MB, we combine big-data network neuroscience tools with existing electron microscopy connectome datasets to detect and map the distribution of convergent synaptic motifs. We find that convergent motifs consistently occur across the MB in different individuals, including the  lobe where they were first quantified, and we report on both the variance and consistency in the formation of these motifs across different MB regions and individuals. Our discovery of multiply-convergent motifs -- where two KCs target multiple postsynaptic targets simultaneously -- reveals a previously unrecognized synaptic economy that may optimize information transfer while conserving neural resources. These stereotyped arrangements likely represent fundamental organizational principles underlying associative learning across species. Lastly, to our knowledge, this study offers the first and most extensive comparative analysis of synaptic motifs across Drosophila connectomes, establishing a framework for enabling systematic motif analysis of synapses across species.

">Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell responses to inflammatory demyelination with aging</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) have the capacity to self-renew, differentiate into mature myelinating cells, and remyelinate the central nervous system in response to demyelination. Normal aging is associated with a reduction in the functional capacity of OPCs and induces distinct transcriptional signatures even in the absence of an autoimmune inflammatory demyelination insult. To determine how aging impacts the OPC response to an acute inflammatory insult comparable to a demyelinating event in multiple sclerosis (MS), we performed adoptive transfer of young myelin-reactive Th17 T cells into young and aged mice. Spinal cord OPC responses were quantified using lineage tracing and myelin sheath thickness was quantified using transmission electron microscopy. In the subacute phase 9-10 days after adoptive transfer, the density of both young and aged OPCs is enriched in spinal cord lesions compared to non-lesion white matter. After adoptive transfer, the density of aged OPCs is significantly higher than naive/non-adoptive transfer aged spinal cord. Differentiated oligodendrocytes (OLs) are relatively preserved within lesions of aged and young animals despite an overall reduction in OL density after adoptive transfer. While lineage tracing identified newly formed oligodendrocytes after adoptive transfer in both young and aged lesions, less oligodendrocyte differentiation was observed in aged animals. Despite the reduction of OPC differentiation in aged animals, there was no significant difference in the extent of remyelination observed for young and aged lesions. Aged OPCs rise to the challenge in response to a strong auto-immune attack, suggesting that compensatory strategies allow both young and aged OPCs to survive and remyelinate in the inflammatory environment. Identifying pathways that promote resilience of young and aged OPCs in the face of an inflammatory challenge will facilitate the development of remyelinating therapies for the treatment of people with MS across the full spectrum of human aging.

">Molecular deconstruction of the pre-B&oumltzinger Complex/Nucleus Ambiguus (preB&oumltC/NA) region: cellular constituencies and transcriptional responses to repeated seizures in the rat hindbrain</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy affects millions worldwide, but a significant portion suffers from uncontrollable epilepsy. Repeated seizures have many consequences, including a high risk of post-ictal cardiorespiratory failure and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Major risk factors for SUDEP include biological sex in addition to the occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs). How repeated seizures lead to cardiorespiratory dysfunction remains unknown. A key factor in many neurological diseases is neuroinflammation, predominantly mediated by microglia and astrocytes that become dysfunctional. Mechanistically, questions remain how they affect neuronal function in epilepsy and contribute to cardiorespiratory dysfunction and increased SUDEP risk. Previously, we have shown that repeated seizures in our novel rat model with genetic mutations in kcnj16, an inwardly rectifying K+ channel, in the Dahl salt sensitive rat (SSkcnj16-/-) led to increased neuroinflammation in key ventilatory regions at 3 and 5 days of seizures. Specifically, there was increased recruitment of various inflammatory mediators, increased recruitment of activated microglia, with improvement in post-ictal respiratory dysfunction and mortality with usage of anti-inflammatory agents. Here we tested the hypothesis that repeated seizures lead to differential neuroinflammatory activation after repeated seizures in CNS regions of ventilatory control. Male SSkcnj16-/- rats were subjected to 0 (Naive), 3, 7 or 10 days of seizure, and subsequently, the pre-B&oumltzinger Complex/Nucleus Ambiguus (preB&oumltC/NA) was isolated and sent for nuclei isolation and sequencing. Seurat was utilized to filter and process the data, integrate across conditions and allow for differential gene expression (DEG) analysis. Afterwards, pathways enrichment analysis was performed allowing for determination of unique pathways recruited across cell types for each seizure condition. Overall, we were able to identify 18 unique cell types based on transcriptomic signatures, with 8 different neuronal populations, grouped based on Type 1, Type 2 or a mixed Type 1 & Type 2 genetic expression, indicating rhythm generation or pattern generation, respectively. We found that majority of the neuronal clusters were Type 1 or mixed type, indicating predominantly rhythmogenic neuronal populations. Importantly, these critical neuronal populations showed significant upregulation in various metabolic and neurological disease pathways at the 3 and 7 Day timepoints. Furthermore, we identified various glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes and saw increased recruitment in various Inflammatory pathways, Metabolic pathways and Chemokine related pathways after 3 and 7Days of seizures, confirming our previous results. Consequently, our results show for the first time, transcriptomic characterization of crucial rhythmogenic neuronal populations after repeated seizures and the changes that may underlie their dysfunction in SUDEP, mediated in part through the network change in upregulated inflammatory pathways in surrounding glial cells.

">BET protein inhibitor JQ1 reduces inflammation and hippocampal amyloid-β level without altering Tau phosphorylation in LPS-challenged adult wild-type mice</a></h4>

              
                Introduction A growing body of evidence highlights the role of infection and inflammation in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we aimed to analyze the impact of JQ1, an inhibitor of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, which are key readers of the epigenetic acetylation code, on AD-related gene expression changes and biochemical alterations in the hippocampus during a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammatory response in mice. Methods JQ1 and LPS were administered intraperitoneally to adult male wild-type C57BL/6J mice. Changes in selected general and brain-specific parameters were measured for up to 12 h. Results Our results demonstrated that inhibition of BET proteins reduced LPS-induced sickness behavior and time-dependent elevation of proinflammatory signaling. LPS did not significantly alter amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) levels; however, a significant reduction in A{beta} load was observed in JQ1-treated animals overall, suggesting that BET proteins play a crucial role in regulating A{beta} levels in the brain. At the same time, JQ1 treatment did not affect LPS-induced increases in phospho-Tau levels. Discussion Our results suggest that inhibiting BET proteins, in addition to their anti-inflammatory action, may be an effective strategy for reducing A{beta} levels in the brain. However, a mechanistic explanation of this phenomenon requires further investigation.

">Neuronal signatures of successful one-shot memory in mid-level visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                High-capacity, one-shot visual recognition memory challenges theories of learning and neural coding because it requires rapid, robust, and durable representations. Most studies have focused on the hippocampus and other higher areas. However, behavioral evidence demonstrating links between image properties and memorability and revealing image specificity of visual memory suggests an important role for mid-level visual cortex. We tested the hypothesis that area V4 contains signals that could support recognition memory. Our task increased difficulty, allowing comparisons of neuronal population responses on correct and error trials. We observed signatures of several proposed memory mechanisms including magnitude coding, repetition suppression, sparse coding, and population response consistency, but only sparse coding and population response consistency predicted behavior. Familiar images also evoked faster dynamics, consistent with pattern completion. These findings demonstrate that the building blocks of fast, high-capacity memory are present in mid-level sensory cortex, highlighting its role in distributed memory networks.

">Effects of the Neutral CB1 Receptor Antagonist AM6527 on Spontaneous, Consummatory, and Motivated Behavior in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Rationale. The cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) signaling pathway plays a central role in regulating motivational and feeding behaviors. Neutral CB1R antagonists represent a promising therapeutic class with potentially fewer adverse effects than inverse agonists, yet their behavioral effects remain incompletely characterized. Objectives. We investigated the behavioral profile of AM6527, orally bioavailable neutral CB1R antagonist, across naturalistic and operant paradigms in male mice. To evaluate dopaminergic involvement in AM6527s effects, we employed several pharmacological interventions. Results. Using machine learning-based Motion-Sequencing (MoSeq), which parses spontaneous behavior into sub-second syllables, we found that AM6527 did not affect overall speed in an open field, however, it increased the self-directed behaviors and reduced specific locomotor syllables at the highest dose tested. In a naturalistic reward consumption paradigm, AM6527 produced a dose-dependent reduction in milk intake. Operant conditioning paradigms revealed robust suppression of motivated responding on fixed ratio-3 and progressive ratio (PR) schedules for palatable milk reward, with the greatest impact on high-baseline performers under PR conditions. To understand the dopaminergic involvement, we co-administered dopaminergic drugs (targeting D1R, D2R, or dopamine transporter) which resulted in partial rescue of operant responding, indicating dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic contributions to AM6527s observed behavioral effects. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that neutral CB1R antagonism suppresses consummatory and motivated behaviors via dopamine-dependent and -independent mechanisms. By leveraging sub-second behavioral analysis with MoSeq, we further reveal distinct changes in spontaneous behavior, underscoring the relevance of CB-based treatments for maladaptive appetitive and motivational states in both psychiatric and metabolic disorder.

">Internal mechanosensory feedback modulates central pattern generation to coordinate ovulation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Successful reproduction requires precise coordination of muscle contractions during ovulation and has been well investigated in insects. However, the neural mechanisms of the central pattern generator (CPG) orchestrating this process remain poorly understood. Using Drosophila, we identify a novel pair of multidendritic mechanosensory neurons (mdn-LO) in the lateral oviducts that express the mechanosensitive channels TMC (transmembrane channel-like protein), PPK (pickpocket), and Piezo. We demonstrate that TMC is essential for ovulation coordination: tmc mutation or neuron-specific knockdown significantly increases egg-jamming at the junction between the lateral and the common oviduct, while ppk or Piezo single mutants reduce egg-laying without causing jamming. Calcium imaging reveals that mdn-LO neurons are rhythmically activated by oviduct contractions, and chemogenetic stimulation of these neurons triggers muscle contraction. Trans-Tango and GRASP (GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners) analyses show that mdn-LO neurons form synapses with efferent insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7)-expressing motor neurons in the abdominal ganglion. Activating either mdn-LO or ILP7 neurons induces egg-jamming, indicating their roles within a CPG network. This circuit, including the TMC-expressing mdn-LO neurons and a set of ILP7 neurons, organizes an innate behavior by coupling strategic sensory information and a CPG to ensure bilateral coordination of oviduct contractions to prevent egg jamming during oviposition.

">PhaseICA: Complex-Valued Decomposition of Spatially Independent Brain Waves</a></h4>

              
                Understanding complex dynamics from spatiotemporal signals requires robust tools capable of decoding reoccurring patterns. Traditional ICA methods often overlook the spatially non-stationarity nature of brain activity across both the frequency and spatial domains. We propose a novel data-driven approach, named PhaseICA, designed to extract reoccurring spatiotemporal patterns, referred to as brain waves. Unlike conventional ICA methods that focus solely on amplitude, PhaseICA incorporates phase information directly into the component estimation, preserving the nonstationary property that real-valued ICA methods typically discard. The method performs spatial independence optimization in the complex domain by minimizing a complex entropy bound over the eigenvectors of Hilbert-transformed signals. The proposed method captures spatial propagation across brain regions with interpretable and compact representations, offering a promising foundation for decoding brain dynamic systems and revealing the temporal relationship of regions.

">Transmitted alpha-synuclein extracellular vesicles downregulate axonal flux of retrograde carriers in recipient neurons</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a cytosolic protein located in nerve terminals and is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that alpha-syn can be transmitted from neuron to neuron via exosomal release, thereby contributing to the propagation of alpha-syn pathology. However, the mechanism by which alpha-syn-containing exosomes perturb the function of recipient neurons is currently unknown. Retrograde axonal transport of carriers emanating from the presynapse is essential for neuronal survival. To determine the effect of transmitted alpha-syn on neuronal retrograde trafficking, we used conditioned medium from alpha-syn transfected donor hippocampal neurons, applied to naive (non-transfected) recipient neurons cultured in microfluidic chambers. Time-lapse imaging of retrograde carriers containing cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) was then performed in these recipient neurons. Here, we show that conditioned medium from alpha-synWT-GFP transfected donor neurons significantly downregulated the frequency of retrograde CTB carriers when applied to recipient neurons. This effect was abolished by (i) inhibiting endocytosis in recipient neurons, (ii) blocking exosomal release from donor cells via an Hsp90-dependent mechanism, or (iii) by using conditioned medium from neurons transfected with a Parkinson's mutant (alpha-synA30P-GFP). Whilst transmitted, alpha-synWT-mEos2, alpha-synA30P-mEos2, and mEos2 alone were detected in recipient neurons using single-molecule imaging. Interestingly, alpha-synWT-mEos2 exhibited lower mobility and periodic (190 nm) immobilizations along the axon. Our data suggest that the downregulation of vesicular trafficking by transmitted alpha-syn does not rely on the specific release nor uptake of exosomal alpha-syn but probably depends on its interaction with endogenous alpha-syn following endocytosis in recipient neurons. The transmitted alpha-syn-containing extracellular vesicles therefore control essential axonal trafficking in recipient neurons, an effect lost with the Parkinson's disease mutant alpha-synA30P.

">Single nucleus multiomic atlas of human dorsal root ganglia reveals the contribution of non-neuronal cell types to pain</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons residing in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) transmit sensory information such as pain, itch, touch, pressure and bodily position to the central nervous system. The activity of sensory neurons is regulated by non-neuronal cell types in the DRG, including satellite glial cells (SGCs) and fibroblasts. Dysregulated gene expression in DRG cells contributes to sensory nervous system disorders such as chronic pain and itch. Understanding the genetic underpinnings of these conditions requires dissecting transcriptional regulation in human DRG (hDRG). In this study, we profiled transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility landscapes from postmortem hDRG samples at single-cell level. We demonstrate that sequencing depth significantly impacts downstream analysis, with deeper sequencing yielding more detected cells and features, improved data integration, refined clustering and annotation, and more accurate scientific interpretations. We identified nine major cell types, defined their molecular signatures, and mapped cis-regulatory landscapes. Integration of gene expression with chromatin accessibility enabled peak-gene association and transcriptional network analyses, revealing transcription factors, their target genes, and their regulatory elements. This approach uncovered cell types, genes, and cis-regulatory regions potentially driving pain conditions. Our unbiased genome-wide analysis confirmed known pain-related genes and highlighted novel candidates. These findings provide new insight into molecular mechanisms and candidate cell types involved in pain. Importantly, our results demonstrate that non-neuronal cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and SGCs, play critical roles in pain pathogenesis and should be investigated as therapeutic targets.

">Dynamic and context-dependent modulation of proprioceptive input in primate primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                During voluntary movement, somatosensory input is attenuated -sensory gating - which may prevent the CNS from being overwhelmed by predictable afferent feedback not essential for motor control. In the cerebral cortex, sensory gating has been demonstrated in primary (S1) and higher-order sensory areas. The primary motor cortex (M1) is the major cortical output relay to the spinal cord and muscles, and proprioceptive feedback is crucial for shaping motor output, much as in S1. However, whether proprioceptive signals to M1 are attenuated during movement, and if so, why, remains unclear. We recorded somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) in M1 of two monkeys performing a wrist task while electrically stimulating muscle and cutaneous afferents innervating forearm extensors and adjacent skin. Both local field potentials and single-neuron recordings revealed significant suppression of muscle-evoked SEPs during Active movement and Static hold phases, providing direct evidence that proprioceptive input to M1 is generally gated during motor execution, as previously reported for cutaneous input. Yet, amidst this suppression, SEPs in a subset of M1 neurons were preserved during Static hold, especially those evoked by antagonist muscle afferents. Because monkeys had to maintain precise joint angles for stable posture, these results suggest that proprioceptive signals from antagonist muscles - likely reflecting spindle activity in lengthening muscles - escape attenuation to provide information essential for joint angle control. Overall, our findings demonstrate that while proprioceptive input to M1 is broadly suppressed during motor output, specific afferent signals from antagonist muscles are selectively maintained in a context-dependent manner to support posture control.

">Temporal Interference Stimulation Can Enhance or Disrupt Human Memory Encoding as a Function of Brain Location and Frequency</a></h4>

              
                Visual memory relies on synchronized interactions and rhythms between the medial temporal lobes and neocortical brain regions. Non-invasive manipulation of memory-related brain regions, specifically deeper temporal lobe regions, has been limited by the lack of precision of non-invasive neuromodulation; when targeting deeper structures, the cortex is always stimulated, never deeper structures in isolation. Temporal Interference (TI) stimulation, a novel non-invasive technique, uses high-frequency carrier fields to deliver targeted, physiologically relevant neuromodulation via amplitude-modulated envelopes at specific brain regions. Here, we investigate TI s impact on figure memory encoding in 70 healthy participants using the Rey-Osterrieth and Taylor Complex Figure tasks, with TI applied in several brain regions independently and simultaneously; allowing investigation of combinations of medial temporal lobe and neocortical brain regions. Interestingly, higher frequency TI envelopes (130 Hz offset) targeting bilateral hippocampi and temporal cortices significantly impair recall (p = 6.54e-04), while lower frequency TI envelopes (5 Hz offset) targeting only the bilateral hippocampi significantly enhance recall (p = 0.0447). Stimulation using other combinations of medial temporal lobe and neocortical regions showed no effect, underscoring the critical role of frequency and focality of non-invasive brain stimulation and correct target selection. Finally, functional MRI reveals strong differences between the effects of 130 Hz and 5 Hz envelopes, specifically in hippocampal BOLD signals, brain connectivity, default mode, and attentional networks. These findings demonstrate TI s ability to bidirectionally modulate memory encoding through precise frequency and target tuning, offering a powerful tool for cognitive neuroscience and potential therapeutic applications for memory disorders.

">Molecular Deconstruction of the Medullary Raphe Magnus in the rat: Transcriptional Responses to Repeated Seizures</a></h4>

              
                Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is a leading cause of death in patients with epilepsy and is thought to result from dysfunctional and/or failure of cardiorespiratory control systems. Post-mortem brainstem tissue analyses in human SUDEP cases point to reductions in markers of the brainstem serotonin (5-HT) system, which is known as a brainstem center that provides excitatory neuromodulation. We have previously shown in a knockout rat model (SSkcnj16-/- rats) that repeated seizures led to progressively greater ventilatory inhibition in the post-seizure period, seizure-associated mortality, and reduced brainstem 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph) particularly within the Raphe Magnus (RMg). Here, we account for the cellular constituency and local transcriptional responses to repeated seizures in male SSkcnj16-/- rats that experienced daily seizures for 3, 5, 7, or 10 consecutive days using single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA seq) from brainstem tissue biopsies including the RMg (-12.12 mm to -10.30 mm caudal to Bregma) two hours post-seizure. Unbiased cluster analysis identified 18 cell major clusters that were by identified by the expression of known gene markers, with most cells being oligodendrocytes. However, local RMg neurons showed the greatest numbers of differentially expressed genes with seizures compared to all other cell types. Further re-clustering of neuronal cell types yielded 14 distinct RMg neuron subpopulations, including 5 types of GABAergic neurons, 2 glutamatergic clusters, and 2 groups of 5-HT neurons which all had unique expression profiles. Nearly all DEGs across neuronal subtypes were increased following seizures, and a large fraction of which were common across seizure days and across neuron type suggesting uniformity in cellular response to seizures in this region. These studies provide foundational information regarding the cellular constituency of the RMg region in the rat, and altered neuronal function following repeated seizures in the absence of changes in other cell types in this key region of cardiorespiratory control.

">Growth inhibitory effect of cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients on HFF2 cells</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS). Occurrence of immunogenic cell death (ICD) in this disease and expression of ICD markers in the CSF of MS patients are documented. However, cytotoxic effect of MS patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the cells is not reported. To evaluate the cytotoxic impact of CSF from MS patients on cell viability, human foreskin fibroblast (HFF2) cells were treated with CSF samples from individuals with MS and healthy controls. The results inferred that patient-derived CSF significantly declined the survival of HFF2 cells in comparison to the CSF of healthy individuals. This observation implies a cytotoxic environment and characteristic of patients CSF, which could be due to the presence of cellular-damaging factors such as calreticulin (CRT) in the patients CSF. The cytotoxic environment of CSF might reflect ICD occurrence in CNS of the patients and also could explain the progressive essence of the disease.

">VMAT2 dysfunction impairs vesicular dopamine uptake, driving its oxidation and α-synuclein pathology in DJ-1-linked Parkinson's disease neurons</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by -synuclein accumulation and dopaminergic neuron degeneration, with dopamine (DA) oxidation emerging as a key pathological driver. However, the mechanisms underlying this neurotoxic process remain unclear. Using PD patient-derived and CRISPR-engineered iPSC midbrain dopaminergic neurons lacking DJ-1, we identified defective sequestration of cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles, which culminated in DA oxidation and -synuclein accumulation. In-depth proteomics, state-of-the-art imaging, and ultrasensitive DA probes uncovered that decreased VMAT2 protein and function impaired vesicular DA uptake, resulting in reduced vesicle availability and abnormal vesicle morphology. Furthermore, VMAT2 activity and vesicle endocytosis are processes dependent on ATP, which is notably reduced in DJ-1-deficient dopaminergic neurons. ATP supplementation restored vesicular function and alleviated DA-related pathologies in mutant dopaminergic neurons. This study reveals an ATP-sensitive mechanism that regulates DA homeostasis through VMAT2 and vesicle dynamics in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, highlighting enhanced DA sequestration as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD.

">Evaluating the quality of brainstem ROI registration using structural and diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Accurate registration of regions of interest (ROIs) from standard atlases to participants' native spaces is a critical step in fMRI studies, as it directly affects the reliability of sampled BOLD signals. While T1-weighted (T1w) image-based ROI registration is well validated and widely adopted in cortical fMRI, its performance degrades in brainstem studies due to the small size, dense packing, and poor visibility of brainstem nuclei on T1w contrast. We hypothesized that incorporating diffusion MR images, containing more information about internal brainstem architecture, should improve ROI registration accuracy. To test this, we developed four registration pipelines that either included or excluded diffusion-based alignment components and evaluated their performance using data from n=10 healthy participants. Registration accuracy was assessed using Dice coefficients for the red nucleus (RN) and mis-registration fractions for the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The results showed that diffusion-based pipelines, using fractional anisotropy (FA) images, non-diffusion-weighted (b0) images, and multivariate combination, outperformed the T1w-only baseline. Probabilistic maps derived from inverse-transformed native ROIs further supported improved sensitivity to inter-individual anatomical variability in the diffusion-augmented pipelines. In addition, analysis of gradient magnitude maps from the Jacobian determinants revealed associations between localized deformation and image modality-specific landmarks. These findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion-augmented pipelines for improving brainstem ROI registration, which could enhance the robustness of fMRI studies on brainstem disorders characterized by functional dysregulation.

Consistent with the literature, the group with CP had weaker somatosensory cortical responses compared to the neurotypical controls. While the participants with CP demonstrated clinically relevant mobility improvements, there were no changes in the somatosensory cortical activity. However, there was a prominent increase in neural activity within the anterior cingulate.

Remarkably, we found that the more critical role of orientation-untuned neuronal populations in orientation encoding is to enhance coding robustness, specifically by reducing sensitivity to noise. Moreover, when using artificial neural networks to model the primate ventral visual pathway, we found that the V1-like layer also contains a proportion of orientation-untuned units. Removing these units leads to significant impairments in natural object recognition. Overall, these results indicate that orientation-untuned neurons encode orientation information and play a crucial role in primate visual perception. The study provides compelling evidence for a continuous distribution of visual features across neurons and challenges the notion of highly specialized units.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Many of the environments that we navigate through every day are hierarchically organized—they consist of spaces nested within other spaces. How do our mind/brains represent such environments? To address this question, we familiarized participants with a virtual environment consisting of a building within a courtyard, with objects distributed throughout the courtyard and building interior. We then scanned them with functional MRI (fMRI) while they performed a memory task that required them to think about spatial relationships within and across the subspaces. Behavioral responses were less accurate and response times were longer on trials requiring integration across the subspaces compared to trials not requiring integration. FMRI response differences between integration and non-integration trials were observed in scene-responsive and medial temporal lobe brain regions, which were correlated the behavioral integration effects in retrosplenial complex, occipital place area, and hippocampus. Multivoxel pattern analyses provided additional evidence for representations in these brain regions that reflected the hierarchical organization of the environment. These results indicate that people form cognitive maps of nested spaces by dividing them into subspaces and using an active cognitive process to integrate the subspaces. Similar mechanisms might be used to support hierarchical coding in memory more broadly.</span>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-952/v1?src=rss">Multimodal Machine Learning Approach for Diagnosing Atopic Dermatitis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent, chronic inflammatory skin disease with diverse clinical presentations, often overlapping with other dermatoses. Its diagnosis remains largely dependent on clinical expertise, leading to variability and limited diagnostic accuracy, particularly among general practitioners. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model that integrates lesion image analysis and structured anamnesis to improve AD diagnosis. Methods This diagnostic study was conducted in two phases: Phase 1 used retrospective data from 2021–2024, and Phase 2 involved prospective external validation from multiple hospitals in 2025. Patients with AD or related skin conditions were included, with diagnoses based on AAD 2014 criteria. Multimodal fusion combined ResNet50-extracted image features and MPNet-based anamnesis text features using a late fusion model. This approach mimics clinical reasoning by integrating visual and contextual clinical information to classify cases as AD or non-AD. Results and Discussion The multimodal AI model integrating ResNet50 (image) and MPNet (anamnesis) achieved 98.28% accuracy in classifying AD vs non-AD, outperforming image-or text-only models. It offers clinical advantages by mimicking physician reasoning, improving diagnostic consistency, reducing subjectivity, and enabling mass triage. However, real-world generalizability remains a challenge due to limited training diversity, potential language constraints (Bahasa Indonesia), and narrow differential diagnoses. External validation and explainable AI (XAI) are critical for broader application. Despite limitations, the model aligns with emerging literature, showing multimodal AI can approach or surpass expert-level performance in dermatological diagnosis when rigorously validated. Conclusions The multimodal ResNet50-MPNet model shows near-perfect accuracy in diagnosing AD by mimicking clinician reasoning. It offers consistent, holistic assessment but requires external validation and improved interpretability for clinical adoption. Continued AI-clinician collaboration is vital to translating this promising technology into real-world dermatological care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-133/v3?src=rss">Mortality involving and not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated in England between Apr 21 and May 23 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy may be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, may have increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

                Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health concern, with the greatest burden observed in lower-middle-income countries. Monitoring AMR through a One Health approach is essential to understand the link between clinical, animal, and environmental sources and to develop targeted interventions. Objectives This systematic review aimed to assess the impact of antibiotics on gene expression in Pseudomonas spp. within the East African Community (EAC). Methodology A thorough literature search across Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed yielded 284 articles, of which 11 met the inclusion criteria after screening. The selected studies came from five EAC countries. Findings showed a high prevalence of AMR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with over 90% resistance to most antibiotics, except Amikacin, which remained effective likely due to limited usage. Results and discussion Common resistance genes identified included carbapenemases such as blaNDM-1 and blaVIM. The disc diffusion method was the most commonly used technique (50%).Multidrug-resistant clones like ST244 and ST357 were frequently reported. Environmental isolates had lower resistance rates (54%) compared to clinical strains (73%), suggesting differing selection pressures. Most studies originated from Kenya and Uganda (each 30%), reflecting differences in research capacity and healthcare infrastructure across the region. Conclusion These results underscore the urgent need for expanded AMR surveillance, stronger antimicrobial stewardship, and further research to inform public health responses in East Africa.

                <p>by Han-Jia Jiang, Jugoslava Aćimović, Tiina Manninen, Iiro Ahokainen, Jonas Stapmanns, Mikko Lehtimäki, Markus Diesmann, Sacha J. van Albada, Hans Ekkehard Plesser, Marja-Leena Linne</p>

Astrocytes engage in local interactions with neurons, synapses, other glial cell types, and the vasculature through intricate cellular and molecular processes, playing an important role in brain information processing, plasticity, cognition, and behavior. This study advances understanding of local interactions and self-organization of neuron-astrocyte networks and contributes to the broader investigation of their potential relationship with global activity regimes and overall brain function. We present six new contributions: (1) the development of a new model-building framework for neuron-astrocyte networks, (2) the introduction of connectivity concepts for tripartite neuron-astrocyte interactions in biological neural networks, (3) the design of a scalable architecture capable of simulating networks with up to a million cells, (4) a formalized description of neuron-astrocyte modeling that facilitates reproducibility, (5) the integration of experimental data to a greater extent than existing studies, and (6) simulation results demonstrating how neuron-astrocyte interactions drive the emergence of synchronization in local neuronal groups. Specifically, we develop a new technology for representing astrocytes and their interactions with neurons in distributed simulation code for large-scale spiking neuronal networks. This includes an astrocyte model with calcium dynamics, an extended neuron model receiving calcium-dependent signals from astrocytes, and a parallelized connectivity generation scheme for tripartite interactions between pre- and postsynaptic neurons and astrocytes. We verify the efficiency of our reference implementation through benchmarks varying in computing resources and network sizes. Our <i>in silico</i> experiments reproduce experimental data on astrocytic effects on neuronal synchronization, demonstrating that astrocytes consistently induce local synchronization in groups of neurons across various connectivity schemes and global activity regimes. By adjusting the strength of neuron-astrocyte interactions, we can switch the global activity regime from asynchronous to network-wide synchronization. This work represents an advancement in neuron-astrocyte modeling, introducing a novel framework that enables large-scale simulations of astrocytic influence on neuronal networks.

                <p>by Leandro P. L. Jacob, Sydney M. Bailes, Stephanie D. Williams, Carsen Stringer, Laura D. Lewis</p>

The brain exhibits rich oscillatory dynamics that play critical roles in vigilance and cognition, such as the neural rhythms that define sleep. These rhythms continuously fluctuate, signaling major changes in vigilance, but the widespread brain dynamics underlying these oscillations are difficult to investigate. Using simultaneous EEG and fast fMRI in humans who fell asleep inside the scanner, we developed a machine learning approach to investigate which fMRI regions and networks predict fluctuations in neural rhythms. We demonstrated that the rise and fall of alpha (8–12 Hz) and delta (1–4 Hz) power—two canonical EEG bands critically involved with cognition and vigilance—can be predicted from fMRI data in subjects that were not present in the training set. This approach also identified predictive information in individual brain regions across the cortex and subcortex. Finally, we developed an approach to identify shared and unique predictive information, and found that information about alpha rhythms was highly separable in two networks linked to arousal and visual systems. Conversely, delta rhythms were diffusely represented on a large spatial scale primarily across the cortex. These results demonstrate that EEG rhythms can be predicted from fMRI data, identify large-scale network patterns that underlie alpha and delta rhythms, and establish a novel framework for investigating multimodal brain dynamics.

                <p>by Azka Javaid, H. Robert Frost</p>

The accurate cell-level characterization of cytokine activity is important for understanding the signaling processes underpinning a wide range of immune-mediated conditions such as auto-immune disease, cancer and response to infection. We previously proposed the SCAPE (Single cell transcriptomics-level Cytokine Activity Prediction and Estimation) method to address the challenges associated with cytokine activity estimation in human single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. Here, we propose a new method MouSSE (Mouse-Specific Single cell transcriptomics level cytokine activity prediction and Estimation) for performing cytokine activity estimation in murine scRNA-seq and ST data. MouSSE estimates the cell-level activity of 86 distinct cytokines using a gene set scoring approach. The cytokine-specific gene sets used by MouSSE are constructed using experimental cytokine stimulation data from the Immune Dictionary and cell-level scores are computed using a modification of the Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM) technique that supports both positive and negative gene weights. MouSSE is validated using data from both the Immune Dictionary via stratified cross-validation and external scRNA-seq and ST datasets against 10 cytokine activity estimation methods. These results demonstrate that MouSSE outperforms comparable methods for cell-level cytokine activity estimation in mouse scRNA-seq and ST data. An example vignette and installation instructions for the MouSSE R package are provided at https://github.com/azkajavaid/MousseR-package.

Drug tolerant persisters (DTPs) drive cancer therapy resistance by temporarily evading drug action, allowing multiple routes to eventual permanent resistance. Despite clear evidence for DTPs, the timing of their emergence, proliferative nature, and how their population dynamics arise from measured single-cell kinetics remain poorly understood. Here we use time-lapse microscopy data from two cancer cell lines, integrating single-cell and population measurements, to develop a quantitative description of drug persistence. Contrary to the expectation that increasing levels of genotoxic stress should lead to slower times to division and faster times to death, we observe minor changes in the single-cell intermitotic and death time distributions upon increasing cisplatin concentration. Yet, population decay rates increase 3-fold, suggesting a surprising independence of the overall dynamics from the measured birth and death rates. To explain this phenomenon, we argue that the observed lineage correlations and concentration-dependent decay rates imply cell-state dependent fate choices made <i>both</i> pre and post-cisplatin as opposed to just post-drug birth/death rate-based competitive fate choices. We demonstrate that these cell-states, present in the pre-drug ancestors of DTP and sensitive cells, exhibit no difference in cycling speed and are inherited across at least 2-3 cellular generations. Post-drug survival versus death fates are decided with high probability by these pre-existing cell-states, but get modulated to some extent by the drug, leading to a drug concentration dependent state-fate map. A stochastic model implementing these rules simultaneously recapitulates the observed decay rates and cell-fate lineage correlations. The model also demonstrates how the use of barcode diversity change before and after drug might lead to misleading interpretations of the timing of persister fate decisions. Our results provide a conceptual framework for quantifying pre versus post-drug contributions to cell fate, without requiring knowledge of the underlying molecular architecture of the heterogeneous cell states.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78029?af=R">Clinical–Radiological Spectrum of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy‐Related Inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify clinical and radiological features of cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri), and compare these features with those of sporadic CAA, to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and clinical care of CAA-ri.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed routine clinical data from 37 patients with CAA-ri and 158 patients with sporadic CAA, including conventional vascular risk factors and comorbidities. We assessed brain magnetic resonance imaging for: radiological markers of CAA; features of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema/effusion (ARIA-E) including parenchymal white matter hyperintensities, sulcal hyperintensities, and gyral swelling; and evidence of neurodegeneration (medial temporal atrophy and global cortical atrophy).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with patients with sporadic CAA, patients with CAA-ri had more numerous lobar cerebral microbleeds (median 207[IQR 33-811] vs 19[IQR 7-58], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and higher rates of medial temporal and global cortical atrophy. In comparison with sporadic CAA, all ARIA-E features were much more common in patients with CAA-ri (parenchymal hyperintensities 89% vs 3%, sulcal hyperintensities 78% vs 9%, and gyral swelling 86% vs 0.6%), as were conventional vascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia) and long-term comorbidities (inflammatory and infectious disorders, autoimmune or connective tissue disorders, or malignancies).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Features of ARIA-E (parenchymal white matter hyperintensities, sulcal hyperintensities, and gyral swelling) are more common in CAA-ri in comparison with “non-inflammatory” sporadic CAA, suggesting shared mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy and a potential role in improving diagnostic accuracy for CAA-ri. The high prevalence of atrophy and lobar cerebral microbleeds suggests a potential mechanistic role for capillary CAA, Alzheimer's disease, or both, in CAA-ri. Cardiovascular risk factors and other long-term comorbidities may also be relevant to the underlying mechanisms of CAA-ri. ANN NEUROL 2025 ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Reversing the aging process may yield significant benefits in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), as accelerated biological aging is observed in this population. Secondary analyses of 2 previously conducted dietary interventions including a 6-month modified ketogenic diet in 39 participants and an 8-week randomized comparison of intermittent and daily calorie restriction versus a weight-stable regimen in 36 participants demonstrated significant decreases in metabolomic age (mAge) following the ketogenic diet (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and intermittent calorie restriction (<i>p</i> = 0.04), whereas daily calorie reduction had no effect. These findings indicate that fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) can reverse accelerated metabolomic aging in PwMS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-949/v1?src=rss">Behavioral Finance in the sphere of investment: Systematic Review of Literature between 2020 and 2025 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Behavioral finance is a growing field that explores how cognitive biases and psychological factors—such as emotions, heuristics, and social influence—affect financial decision-making. This paper investigates how behavioral biases have evolved and influenced investment behavior in light of recent technological and market developments. Methods A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, focusing on peer-reviewed publications from 2020 to 2025. A total of 30 studies were analyzed, selected from databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Emerald using criteria including relevance, recency, and empirical focus. The selected literature was categorized based on psychological biases, methodological approaches, and emerging themes in investor behavior. Results The findings highlight that traditional biases such as overconfidence, herding, anchoring, and loss aversion continue to dominate investment behavior. Moreover, the review identifies automation bias—a newer bias arising from investor over-reliance on AI and fintech platforms. Studies show that technological innovation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising retail investor activity have intensified behavioral distortions. Conclusion Behavioral finance remains essential for understanding real-world investment behavior. Enhancing financial literacy, incorporating behavioral nudges, and updating regulatory frameworks are critical for mitigating the negative effects of these biases. The study offers a forward-looking perspective on integrating behavioral insights into investment strategies and calls for future research into AI-driven finance, cross-cultural effects, and the role of fintech in shaping investor psychology. This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research published between 2020 and 2025. This review identifies key behavioral biases, such as overconfidence, herding, anchoring, and loss aversion, that continue to dominate investor behavior. It also highlights emerging biases, including automation bias, resulting from increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) and fintech platforms. This study analyzed 30 peer-reviewed articles using various methodologies, including surveys, experiments, and econometric models.

                Background Bariatric surgery, particularly sleeve gastrectomy (SG), has emerged as an effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity. Despite its benefits, howver, it may result in severe complications. One rare but serious postoperative issue is the development of a gastrobronchial fistula (GBF), a condition with a challenging diagnosis and management pathway due to its insidious nature. Case Presentation We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in 2015. The early postoperative course was complicated by a gastric fistula that was managed with double pigtail stents. Subsequently, the patient developed recurrent bronchopulmonary infections, and imaging in 2017 revealed a GBF connecting the gastric remnant to the bronchial tree. Initial endoscopic management with stenting failed because of migration. Definitive surgical management involved complex adhesiolysis and creation of tension-free fistula-jejunal anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient remains asymptomatic. Discussion Gastrothoracic fistula post-bariatric surgery is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Their development is often linked to the insufficient treatment of early gastric leaks or collections. Diagnosis is frequently delayed owing to nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Endoscopic approaches have show limited success, and surgical management, often complex, is frequently necessary. Multidisciplinary strategies, including endoscopic and surgical options, are vital for achieving favorable outcomes. Conclusion Gastrobronchial fistulas represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge following sleeve gastrectomy. A high index of suspicion, long-term follow-up, and tailored multidisciplinary approach are essential for effective management and resolution. Awareness of this rare complication should prompt early detection and intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality.

                Introduction Textiloma refers to a retained surgical textile material within the body after surgery. It is a rare but serious iatrogenic complication that may remain asymptomatic for years. Case Presentation We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of open ovarian cystectomy 15 years earlier, presenting with persistent abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a complex pelvic mass with abscess formation and enteric fistula. Despite interventional drainage and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a retained surgical textile in the rectum, which was extracted. The patient subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency laparotomy revealing two retained textilomas and multiple intestinal perforations. Despite aggressive surgical intervention, the patient succumbed to septic shock on postoperative day one. Conclusion Textiloma should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal masses and previous surgical history. Preventive strategies and early recognition are critical to avoid fatal outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-699/v2?src=rss">The antimicrobial activity of EDTA in combination with Meropenem, Amikacin, and Piperacillin-Tazobactam against hospital-multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance presents a critical challenge to public health. In Iraq, the increasing rise of resistance strains further confirms the need for innovative treatment strategies. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has shown promise in enhancing antibiotic efficacy via destabilizing bacterial membranes and disrupting biofilms. Objectives This study examines the effects of combining EDTA with commonly used antibiotics on multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a major hospital in Baghdad, Iraq. Additionally, it assesses the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in these bacterial strains. The main goal is to improve treatment outcomes and address the growing challenges of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings. Methods This experimental in vitro study evaluates the effects of combining EDTA with meropenem, amikacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam on multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from clinical samples. Results The results show that EDTA enhanced the antibiotics’ effectiveness, increasing inhibition zone diameters and improving bacterial susceptibility. The inhibition zone expanded by approximately 2 to 5 millimeters. Resistance patterns shifted, with some previously resistant or intermediate strains becoming susceptible when treated with the combined therapy. In conclusion, EDTA increases the efficacy of meropenem, amikacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Conclusion This presents a promising approach to improve treatment options for infections caused by resistant pathogens. Further research is needed to understand EDTA’s mechanisms and clinical applications.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rapidly digitising educational system due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made a change in leadership imperative. A key framework for improving organisational effectiveness in handling these changes is digital leadership. It combines technological competencies with traditional leadership. Even with increased scholarly interest, there remains a gap in the thorough analysis of the field’s intellectual framework, thematic evolution, and collaborative dynamics. This study addresses this gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of digital leadership research in education from 1993 to 2024, employing RStudio to map publication trends, influential sources, author productivity, conceptual themes, and social structures. Data from 338 Scopus-indexed documents reveal a significant rise in publications post-2010, peaking in 2023, with core journals such as Education and Information Technologies and Cogent Education dominating the field. However, the notable decline observed in 2024 indicates that the decline in publications may be due to research saturation, a change in research priorities, or funding. Prolific authors like Karakose T., Altinay F., and Z. underscore the centrality of collaborative research, while thematic mapping identifies key clusters: digital competence, virtual leadership, and institutional innovation. Thematic evolution highlights a post-pandemic pivot toward digital transformation and AI integration, though niche areas like K-12 digital leadership remain underdeveloped. Social network analysis reveals dispersed yet growing global collaborations, with the United States, Turkey, and the United Kingdom as dominant hubs, while disparities persist in Global South participation. The study’s implications emphasize the need for interdisciplinary research, equitable global partnerships, and policy frameworks that prioritize digital leadership training for educators. Practitioners are encouraged to implement adaptive strategies to leverage emerging technologies, ensuring sustainable learning outcomes. This analysis provides a foundation for future research and practice in digital leadership by delineating the field’s conceptual and social networks, thereby bridging the divides between theory, policy, and institutional practice.

                Background Although Spigelian hernia is rare, it should not be underestimated because of its significant risk of strangulation. The scarcity of studies and the absence of large, comprehensive case series on this pathology often makes clinical decision-making, despite appearing straightforward, both challenging and ambiguous. Methods This is a retrospective, monocentric study, conducted between January 2013 and December 2022, involving 14 patients who underwent surgery for a Spigelian hernia in the General Surgery Department of Charles Nicole Hospital in Tunis. Various epidemiological, clinical, radiological, and therapeutic factors were analysed using univariate analysis and logistic regression analyses. Results Fourteen patients with Spigelian hernia were recruited. The mean patient age was 62 years. All patients had predisposing factors for increased intra-abdominal pressure, and 50% had a history of abdominal surgery. The most common symptom was lateralized abdominal pain. Diagnosis was supported by imaging in 85.7% of cases, with CT scans being particularly helpful in emergency settings. Surgical repair was performed in all patients, predominantly via an open approach (92.8%). Primary suture repair was used in 64.2% of cases, while mesh repair was performed in 35.7%. The postoperative course was uneventful in 85.7% of patients. Morbidity was 14.2%, with no mortality. One recurrence was observed during follow-up. Conclusions Despite its rarity, Spigelian hernia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of localized abdominal pain. Imaging, particularly CT, plays a key role in diagnosis. Surgical repair, whether by suture or mesh, offers favorable outcomes with low morbidity and recurrence rates.

                Background Syphilis is a cosmopolitan infection, with recent infections (primary or secondary syphilis <1 year) posing the highest risk of mother-to-child transmission. In such cases, early treatment is crucial in determining obstetric prognosis. Objective This study aims to present current data of syphilis in pregnant women and improve the management of syphilis in pregnant women in the city of Kisangani. Methods This is an analytical case-control study covering the period from July 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023. The study was conducted at Makiso Kisangani General Referral Hospital, with a study population of 290 pregnant women. A non-exhaustive sampling method was used, selecting, in the obstetrical department, a sample of 145 pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis and 145 others diagnosed with out syphilis. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.3. Results The most represented age group was 20 to 34 years (61.4%). The majority of pregnant women with syphilis were married (61.4%), in monogamous relationships (72.4%), and had unemployed partners (26.9%). The most common risk factors were having a partner who was a driver (OR: 3.31; p = 0.028), a trader (OR: 8.08; p <0.001), and having a history of STIs (p <0.001) or multiple sexual partners (p = 0.011). In 75% of cases, pregnancy resulted in the birth of a live fetus and 25% cases result in the birth of a died fetus. Conclusion Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with syphilis could be reduced through early detection and standard treatment of syphilis for pregnant women and their husbands/sexual partners.

                Background Based on signs prohibiting certain actions, people warn others using imperative forms of verbs or give a soft warning using politeness strategies. This study clarified how native Japanese speakers and Uzbek Japanese learners perform warnings based on prohibited signs. Methods After clarifying the difference between prohibition and warning, we proposed a classification scheme for the latter speech act in terms of politeness. Data were elicited using a discourse completion task. We prepared tasks for how participants verbally warn people who are about to perform prohibited acts in museums and hospitals, based on the prohibited signs. Results Native Japanese speakers tended to mitigate warnings by using two politeness strategies. The first politeness strategy was the use of rule-based expressions such as “It is forbidden.” However, such expressions may make the hearer feel that the speaker is an overbearing person who wields authority. To avoid this risk, Japanese speakers used the second politeness strategy of hedging inference, as in “Looks like it is forbidden.” They made it clear that the power to forbid does not rest with them, but with the public authorities, and furthermore, that it is only a possibility of their own speculation. The Uzbek learners of Japanese, on the other hand, were more direct in their warnings than the Japanese, and implemented a politeness strategy of apology as compensation. In some cases, the Japanese group and the Uzbek Japanese learners’ group did not warn. They did not warn strangers. Conclusions The characteristics of Uzbek learners of Japanese were found to follow the general characteristics of the learners’ language. This study presented a framework for classifying warnings about prohibited acts. This framework is applicable to languages other than Japanese, Uzbek, and Japanese spoken by Uzbek learners of Japanese.

                Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) constitute a major public health challenge globally. The increase in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases in South Africa continues to impact mortality and morbidity, including disability, necessitating the need to explore the growing burden of NCDs and their implications for public health. NCDs like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory diseases are associated with various factors, ranging from lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and socioeconomic differences. Therefore, this review will explore and describe the prevalence of NCDs, associated risk factors, and the impact on the South African public healthcare system. Methods The five-step review described by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology: (1) determining the research question, (2) comprehensive database search, (3) inclusion criteria, (4) data extraction, and (5) analysis and presentation of the results, will be used for this study. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-P) will guide this scoping review protocol. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 10 weeks, from 15 October to 31 December 2025. Literature search will be conducted across multiple electronic databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and grey literature. The literature search timeline is between 2000 and 2025. The eligibility of articles will be determined using a two-stage screening process. All articles will be individually assessed for eligibility by two reviewers, while any disagreements will be resolved by consensus. The extracted data from eligible articles will be synthesized and presented using charts and narrative summaries. Conclusion This scoping review will provide an evidence map of research available on the prevalence of NCDs in South Africa, with a description of the risk factors and interventions to prevent and control NCDs in South Africa, while also informing the development of targeted public health policies and interventions for NCDs in South Africa.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-944/v1?src=rss">Hydrotherapy as a complementary intervention for academic stress in higher education: A public health perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The global rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has heightened the urgency to tackle modifiable risk factors, including chronic psychological stress. Faculty members in higher education institutions are increasingly experiencing academic stress due to heavy workloads, administrative demands, and insufficient institutional support. Despite this, the well-being of faculty is often neglected as a crucial element in fostering knowledge and innovation, leading to burnout, reduced productivity, and a greater susceptibility to NCDs. This paper contends that hydrotherapy, long appreciated for its physiological and psychophysiological advantages, should be acknowledged as a non-pharmacological, evidence-based, and scalable solution for managing chronic academic stress. Hydrotherapy provides a comprehensive, proactive approach to faculty wellness by influencing stress-related biological pathways, especially the hypothalamic (pituitary) axis. Based on emerging clinical evidence and public health models, we propose the strategic incorporation of hydrotherapy into institutional wellness programs, viewing it not just as a relaxation method, but as a transformative intervention with the potential to improve long-term institutional vitality and public health outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-943/v1?src=rss">Antibiotic treatment of severe bacterial pneumonia: a scoping review to characterise the evidence for current treatment options [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The FAIR project is evaluating flagellin aerosol therapy (FLAMOD) as an adjunct to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pneumonia. Our scoping review characterises the existing evidence for the antibiotic treatment of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia (SBP) to inform future health economic modelling of FLAMOD versus standard-of-care. Methods A systematic search identified relevant publications (January 2001 to July 2021) in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and other sources. Clinical trials and cohort studies of antibiotic treatments in hospitalised patients with SBP reporting clinical efficacy, mortality, or length of hospital stay were eligible. Two reviewers independently applied the review methods. The study data were extracted into a bespoke Microsoft Access database. Results Over half of the 327 included studies were retrospective cohort studies and the remainder were RCTs (20%) or prospective cohort studies (23%). Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was the most common type of pneumonia (39%). Among 144 studies that treated specific bacteria, gram-negative pathogens (22.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (20.1%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.4%) were the most common. In 236 studies reporting treatment with specific antibiotics, 44% used an antibiotic from the WHO reserve list of antibiotics and a third mapped to a single drug class (commonly polymyxins, 20 studies). Mortality was the most frequently reported outcome (27.9% of studies on severe CAP). Conclusion We characterised evidence for antibiotic treatment in patients with SBP. Our database provides us with the flexibility to identify evidence for a future economic model to assess whether FLAMOD can be a cost-effective adjunct to conventional antibiotic treatment of AMR. Evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics in SBP is plentiful, but heterogeneous. We highlight challenges for evidence synthesis, including difficulties in identifying studies specifically on severe pneumonia, lack of clear reporting about whether treatment is empirical or definitive, and inconsistent reporting of the line of therapy and levels of antibiotic resistance.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved wit</a></h4>

              
                Background Good care and conscious, mindful parenting are the essential requirements of the early childhood period. Good care in early childhood consists of mindful handling of children’s needs like hunger, care in sickness, socio-emotional needs, safety, love and affection. Good care promotes children’s development and provides a favourable environment for learning. It’s a well-known fact that hospitalization is a stressful situation for child of any age. Play is an integral part of early childhood period which is virtually restricted in hospital settings. This study will try to explore the effectiveness of play therapy delivered in hospital settings, on early child development (ECD). Methods This will be a randomized control trial conducted in the Paediatrics department of a tertiary care hospital in Wardha, India. The sample size will be 360 children, 180 each in intervention and control arm. The hospitalized children from intervention arm will receive customized Play Therapy sessions from trained research assistants and will be followed up at scheduled monthly home visits for one year from the date of enrolment. All children will be assessed for changes in cognitive, motor and socio-emotional development scores. The differences in development scores between intervention and control groups will be compared and effect sizes of changes will be calculated. Discussion Implementation of play stimulation activities have been reported as useful strategies for promoting child development and good recovery during hospitalization. This trial will attempt to explore the effectiveness of play therapy on changes in child development scores of children from intervention group compared to the control group. The customized play therapy program will be adapted to paediatric inpatient settings, and attempts will be made to improve the Play Therapy kit for hospitalized children.
