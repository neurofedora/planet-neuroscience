	<p>Previous experimental studies have reported clear differences between native speakers and second language (L2) learners as concerns their capacity to extract and exploit morphosyntactic information during online processing. We examined the online processing of nominal case morphology in Korean by native speakers and L2 learners by contrasting canonical (SOV) and scrambled (OSV) structures, across auditory (Experiment 1) and written (Experiment 2) formats. Moreover, we compared different instances of nominal case marking: accusative (NOM-ACC) and dative (NOM-DAT). During auditory processing, Koreans showed incremental processing based on case information, with no effect of scrambling or specific case marking. In contrast, the L2 group showed no evidence of predictive processing and was negatively impacted by scrambling, especially for the accusative. During reading, both Koreans and the L2 group showed a cost of scrambling on first pass reading times, specifically for the dative. Lastly, L2 learners showed better comprehension for scrambled dative than accusative structures across formats. The current set of results show that format, the specific case marking, and word order all affect the online processing of nominal case morphology.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How short decoding times, stimulus dimensionality and spontaneous activity constrain the shape of tuning curves: A speed-accuracy trade-off</a></h4>

              
                According to the efficient coding hypothesis, sensory neurons are adapted to provide maximal information about the environment given some biophysical constraints. Early sensory neurons modulate their average firing rates in response to some features of the external stimulus, creating tuned responses. In early visual areas, these modulations (or tunings) are predominantly single-peaked. However, periodic tuning, as exhibited by grid cells, has been linked to a significant increase in decoding performance. Does this imply that the tuning curves in early visual areas are sub-optimal? We argue that the time scale at which neurons encode information is imperative to understanding the relative advantages of single-peaked and periodic tuning curves. Because, if decoding ability scales differently with time for the different shapes of tuning curves, the time scale at which the neurons operate becomes critical. Here, we show that the possibility of catastrophic (large) errors due to overlapping neural responses for distinct stimulus conditions creates a trade-off between decoding time and decoding ability. Unfortunately, standard theoretical measures such as Fisher information do not capture these errors. We investigate how (very) short decoding times and stimulus dimensionality affect the optimal shape of tuning curves for stimuli with finite domains. In particular, we focus on the spatial periods of the tuning curves (or the number of "peaks") for a class of circular tuning curves. We show a general trend for minimal decoding time, i.e., the shortest decoding time required to produce a statistically reliable signal, to increase with increasing Fisher information implying a trade-off between accuracy and speed. This trade-off is reinforced whenever the stimulus dimensionality is high or there is ongoing activity. Thus, given constraints on processing speed, we present normative arguments for the existence of single-peaked, rather than a periodic, tuning organization observed in early visual areas.

                We advance a model of the Mushroom Body of the Drosophila brain based on the recently published fruit fly brain connectome. We quantify the effect of the connectivity from antennal lobe projection neurons to Kenyon Cells (KCs) and the effect of feedback between KCs and the anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron on the representation of odorants at the KC level. We then characterize odorant representation in the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) as a function of semantics represented by the dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Finally, we evaluate the performance of associative learning in the MB that endows pure odorants with DAN semantics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison of visual quantities in untrained deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The ability to compare quantities of visual objects with two distinct measures, proportion and difference, is observed in newborn animals. Nevertheless, how this function originates in the brain, even before training, remains unknown. Here, we show that neuronal tuning for quantity comparison can arise spontaneously in completely untrained deep neural networks. Using a biologically inspired model neural network, we found that units selective to proportions and differences between visual quantities emerge in randomly initialized networks and that they enable the network to perform quantity comparison tasks. Further analysis shows that two distinct tunings to proportion and difference both originate from a random summation of monotonic, nonlinear responses to changes in relative quantities. Notably, we found that a slight difference in the nonlinearity profile determines the type of measure. Our results suggest that visual quantity comparisons are primitive types of functions that can emerge spontaneously in random feedforward networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of acute Methylene Blue administration on cerebral blood flow and metabolism in humans and rats</a></h4>

              
                Methylene Blue (MB) is a brain-penetrating drug with putative neuroprotective, antioxidant and metabolic enhancing effects. In vitro studies suggest that MB enhances mitochondrial complexes activity. However, no study has directly assessed the haemodynamic and metabolic effects of MB in the human brain. We used in vivo neuroimaging to measure the effect of MB on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain metabolism in humans and in rats. Two doses of MB (0.5 and 1 mg/kg in humans; 2 and 4 mg/kg in rats; iv) induced reductions in global cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans (F(1.74, 12.17)5.82, p=0.02) and rats (F(1,5)26.04, p=0.0038). Human cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was also significantly reduced (F(1.26, 8.84)8.01, p=0.016), as was the rat cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu) (t=2.6(16) p=0.018). This was contrary to our hypothesis that MB will increase CBF and energy metrics. Nevertheless, our results were reproducible across species and dose dependent. One possible explanation is that the concentrations used, although clinically relevant, reflect MB's hormetic effects, i.e., higher concentrations produce inhibitory rather than augmentation effects on metabolism. Additionally, here we used healthy volunteers and healthy rats with normal cerebral metabolism where MB's ability to enhance cerebral metabolism might be limited.

                In socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), parental behaviors not only occur in mothers and fathers, but also can exist in virgin males (parental). However, some virgin males display aggressive behaviors towards conspecific pups (attacker). Although this behavioral dichotomy in response to pup exposure has been well documented, little is known about the gene expression changes underlie the parental behavioral differences and their regulatory mechanisms. To address this, we profiled the transcriptome and DNA methylome of hippocampal dentate gyrus of four prairie vole groups, attacker virgin males, parental virgin males, fathers, and mothers. We found a concordant pattern of gene transcription in parental virgin males and fathers, when comparing to the attacker group. The methylome analysis also revealed signaling pathways enriched for epigenetic changes involving both receptor-mediated and secondary messenger signaling across both behavioral phenotypes and sexual experiences. Furthermore, we found correlations between gene expression changes and DNA methylation differences between attacker and parental virgin males, which suggests a canonical gene expression regulatory role of DNA methylation in paternal care. Therefore, our study presents an integrated view of transcriptome and epigenome that provides a DNA epigenetic based molecular insight of paternal behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Localizing the Sources of Modulations of the P3m Component by Task Difficulty</a></h4>

              
                The P3m is a late component of the event-related field (ERF) and is assumed to reflect the allocation of resources in various cognitive domains. The amplitude of the P3m can be affected by several task parameters, like stimulus probability, inter-stimulus interval and task difficulty. The task difficulty can alter the P3m amplitude, depending on which mechanisms are involved. The sources of the P3m are located in several brain areas, suggesting a widespread network generating the P3m. Which of these sources of the P3m give rise to the task-difficulty induced amplitude modulation are not well investigated. However, localizing these sources could pave the way for intervention studies with non-invasive brain stimulation methods, which might be suitable to modulate the pathologically altered P3m emerging in various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. We designed a MEG-study with a visual oddball-like task with two different task difficulties to 1) show decreased P3m amplitudes induced by increased task difficulty and 2) estimate the sources of this P3m modulation. Additionally, the influence of the increased task difficulty on behavioral outcomes were analyzed. The P3m amplitude decreased significantly in the hard condition compared to easy condition. Furthermore, the hit rate for standard trials decreased significantly, while the reaction times increased for both, targets and standards. For this specific visual oddball-like task, the sources of the task difficulty dependent P3m amplitude modulation are located in the centro-parietal regions.

                ABSTRACT Objective: The role of astrocytes largely remains to be explored in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). Due to limited study models and inaccessibility to patient-tissue samples, we differentiated astrocytes from patient fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) which provided a unique system to investigate molecular and etiopathogenetic mechanisms, identify targets, and develop therapeutic agents for X-ALD. Methods: We reprogrammed fibroblasts from adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) and cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD) patients carrying ABCD1 with pathogenic variants and a control patient to generate iPSCs. We differentiated iPSCs into astrocytes and performed transmission electron microscopy, gene expression, immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, miRNA-Seq, and lipidomics to characterize phenotypic and molecular features of patient-derived astrocytes. Results: These differentiated astrocytes exhibit diseased phenotypes and replicate biochemical and molecular changes found in patients. We confirmed the deletion of ABCD1 gene-encoded ALD protein and identified ABCD1 variant-driven very long chain fatty acid deposition in AMN and cALD astrocytes. Especially, cALD astrocytes showed increased glycolysis, increased signal transducer and transcription activator (STAT)3 activation, higher miR-9 expression in miRNA-Seq analysis, and reduced expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as arginase-1 and mannose receptor C-type-1. Consequently, Toll-like receptor-signaling via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B; p52 and p65) induced STAT3 and an altered miR-9 expression is a potential contributor to inflammatory milieu in cALD while interleukin-6 -induced anti-inflammatory cytokine production and increased chemotactic CCL-2 (MCP-1) production in AMN potentially favors microglial recruitment protecting its further progression. Interpretation: We demonstrate for the first time that patient iPSC-derived astrocytes mimic and recapitulate neuroinflammatory and biochemical defects of X-ALD and provide an in vitro cellular system to study X-ALD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probing visual sensitivity and attention in mice using reverse correlation</a></h4>

              
                Visual attention is a fundamental cognitive operation that allows the brain to evoke behaviors based on the most important stimulus features. Although mouse models offer immense potential to gain a circuit-level understanding of this phenomenon, links between visual attention and behavioral decisions in mice are not well understood. Here, we describe a new behavioral task for mice that addresses this limitation. We trained mice to detect weak vertical bars in a background of checkerboard noise while audiovisual cues manipulated their spatial attention. We then modified a reverse correlation method from human studies to link behavioral decisions to stimulus locations and features. We show that mice attended to stimulus locations just rostral of their optical axis, which was highly sensitive for vertically oriented stimulus energy whose spatial frequency matched those of the weak vertical bars. We found that the tuning of sensitivity to orientation and spatial frequency grew stronger during training, was multiplicatively scaled with attention, and approached that of an ideal observer. These results provide a new task to measure spatial- and feature-based attention in mice which can be leveraged with new recording methods to uncover attentional circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative comparison of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutation efficiency between mice and MEFs using digital PCR assays</a></h4>

              
                The creation of mutant mice has been invaluable for advancing biomedical science, but is too time- and resource-intensive for investigating the full range of mutations and polymorphisms. Cell culture models are therefore an invaluable complement to mouse models, especially for cell-autonomous pathways like the circadian clock. In this study, we quantitatively assessed the use of CRISPR to create cell models in MEFs as compared to mouse models. We generated two point mutations in the clock genes Per1 and Per2 in mice and in MEFs using the same sgRNAs and repair templates for HDR and quantified the frequency of the mutations by digital PCR. The frequency was about an order of magnitude higher in mouse zygotes compared to that in MEFs. However, the mutation frequency in MEFs was still high enough for clonal isolation by simple screening of a few dozen individual cells. The Per mutant cells that we generated provide important new insights into the role of the PAS domain in regulating PER phosphorylation, a key aspect of the circadian clock mechanism. Accurate quantification of the mutation frequency in bulk MEF populations provides a critical basis for optimizing CRISPR protocols and time/resource planning for generating cell models for further studies.

                Depression alleviation following treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) tends to be more effective when TMS is targeted to cortical areas with high resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). However, it has not yet been confirmed that rsFC-guided TMS coil placement leads to TMS modulation of the sgACC. For each participant (N=115, 34 depressed patients), a peak rsFC cortical hotspot for the sgACC and control targets were prospectively identified. Single pulses of TMS interleaved with fMRI readouts were then administered to these targets and established significant downstream fMRI BOLD responses in the sgACC. We then marked an association between TMS-evoked BOLD responses in the sgACC and rsFC between the stimulation site and sgACC. This effect was qualified by a difference between healthy and patient participants: only in depressed patients, positively connected sites of stimulation led to the strongest evoked responses in the sgACC. Our results highlight rsFC-based targeting as a viable strategy to causally modulate sgACC subcortical targets and further suggest that cortical sites with high positive rsFC to the sgACC might represent an alternative target for the treatment of depression.

                The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central pacemaker for mammalian circadian rhythms. As such, this ensemble of cell-autonomous neuronal oscillators with divergent periods must maintain coordinated oscillations. To investigate ultrastructural features enabling such synchronization, 805 coronal ultrathin sections of mouse SCN tissue were imaged with electron microscopy and aligned into a volumetric stack, from which selected neurons within the SCN core were reconstructed in silica. We found that clustered SCN core neurons were physically connected to each other via multiple large soma-to-soma plate-like contacts. In some cases, a sliver of a glial process was interleaved. These contacts were large, covering on average ~21% of apposing neuronal somata. It is possible that contacts may be the electrophysiological substrate for synchronization between SCN neurons. Such plate-like contacts may explain why synchronization of SCN neurons is maintained even when chemical synaptic transmission or electrical synaptic transmission via gap junctions is blocked. Such ephaptic contact-mediated synchronization among nearby neurons may therefore underlie the wave-like oscillations of circadian core clock genes and calcium signals observed in the SCN.

                Interaural Time Difference (ITD) is the main cue for azimuthal auditory perception in humans. ITDs at each frequency contribute differently to azimuth discrimination, which can be quantified by their azimuthal Fisher Information. Consistently, human ITD discrimination thresholds are predicted by the azimuthal information. However, this prediction is poor for frequencies below 500 Hz. Such poor prediction could be ascribed to the strategy of quantifying azimuthal information using HRTFs obtained in unnaturalistic anechoic chambers or by using a direct method which does not incorporate the delay lines proposed by the Jeffress-Colburn model. In the present study, we obtained ITD discrimination thresholds from extensive sampling across frequency and ITD, and applied multiple strategies for quantifying azimuthal information. These strategies employed HRTFs obtained in realistic and anechoic chambers, with and without considering delay lines. We found that ITD discriminability thresholds across the complete range of frequencies are better predicted by azimuthal information conveyed by ITD cues when (1) we use naturalistic high-noise HRTFs, and (2) ITD delay compensation is not applied. Our results support that auditory perception is shaped by natural environments, which include high reverberation in low frequencies. Moreover, we also suggest that delay lines are not a crucial feature for determining ITD discrimination thresholds in the human auditory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The BigMac dataset: an open resource combining multi-contrast MRI and microscopy in the macaque brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding brain structure and function often requires combining data across different modalities and scales to link microscale cellular structures to macroscale features of whole brain organisation. Here we introduce the BigMac dataset, a resource combining in vivo MRI, extensive postmortem MRI and multi-contrast microscopy for multimodal characterisation of a single whole macaque brain. The data spans modalities (MRI and microscopy), tissue states (in vivo and postmortem), and four orders of spatial magnitude, from microscopy images with micrometre or sub-micrometre resolution, to MRI signals on the order of millimetres. Crucially, the MRI and microscopy images are carefully co-registered together to facilitate quantitative multimodal analyses. Here we detail the acquisition, curation, and first release of the data, that together make BigMac a unique, openly-disseminated resource available to researchers worldwide. Further, we demonstrate example analyses and opportunities afforded by the data, including improvement of connectivity estimates from ultra-high angular resolution diffusion MRI, neuroanatomical insight provided by polarised light imaging and myelin-stained histology, and the joint analysis of MRI and microscopy data for reconstruction of the microscopy-inspired connectome. All data and code are made openly available.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Death induced by survival gene elimination (DISE) contributes to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, but the specific events that cause cell death remain poorly understood. Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE) is a recently discovered powerful cell death mechanism mediated by short (s) RNAs including micro (mi) RNAs acting through the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). G-rich 6mer seed sequences in the sRNAs (position 2-7) target hundreds of C-rich seed matches in genes essential for cell survival resulting in the simultaneous activation of multiple cell death pathways. The RISC of most cells is occupied by miRNAs with nontoxic 6mer seeds, which may protect them from DISE by blocking loading of toxic sRNAs. However, during aging when miRNA expression decreases, toxic sRNAs may enter the RISC more readily leaving cells primed for DISE. Whether DISE contributes to neuronal loss in a neurodegenerative disease such as AD has not been evaluated. Methods: Using Ago precipitation and RNAseq (Ago-RP-Seq) combined with SPOROS, a recently developed bioinformatics pipeline to analyze small RNAseq data with respect to 6mer seed toxicity, we analyzed RISC bound sRNAs (R-sRNAs) in in vitro models and in the brains of multiple in vivo AD mouse models, aged mice, and AD patients. Results: We find that in in vitro cell line studies, in mouse models that show neurodegeneration, and in the aging brain R-sRNAs shift to more toxic seeds. In contrast, in cells that survived in post-mortem brains of AD patients and the brains of "SuperAgers", individuals over age 80 who have superior memory performance, R-sRNAs shift to more nontoxic seeds, supporting a protective function of miRNAs. Conclusion: Our data provide first evidence of a contribution of DISE to the neurotoxicity seen in AD suggesting that increasing the levels of protective miRNAs in the brain or blocking the activity of toxic R-sRNAs could lead to a novel way of treating the disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proactive interhemispheric disinhibition supports response preparation during selective stopping</a></h4>

              
                Response inhibition is essential for terminating inappropriate actions. A substantial delay may occur in the response of the non-stopped effector when only part of a multi-effector action is terminated. This stopping-interference effect has been attributed to nonselective response inhibition processes and can be reduced with proactive cueing. This study aimed to elucidate the role of interhemispheric primary motor cortex (M1-M1) influences during selective stopping with proactive cueing. We hypothesized that stopping-interference would be reduced as stopping certainty increased, owing to proactive recruitment of interhemispheric facilitation or interhemispheric inhibition when cued to respond or stop, respectively. Twenty-three healthy human participants performed a bimanual anticipatory response inhibition paradigm with cues signaling the likelihood of a stop-signal occurring. Dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to determine corticomotor excitability (CME), interhemispheric inhibition (IHI), and interhemispheric facilitation (IHF) in the left hand at rest and during response preparation. Response times slowed and stopping-interference decreased with cues signaling increased stopping certainty. Proactive response inhibition was marked by a reduced rate of rise and faster cancel time in electromyographical bursts during stopping. There was a nonselective release of IHI but not CME from rest to in-task response preparation, while IHF was not observed in either context. An effector-specific CME but not IHF or IHI reduction was observed when the left hand was cued to stop. These findings indicate that the stopping-interference effect can be reduced through proactive suppression. Interhemispheric M1-M1 channels modulate inhibitory tone that supports responding, but not selective stopping, in a proactive response inhibition context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing the differential distribution and targets of Sumo paralogs in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                SUMOylation is an evolutionarily conserved and essential mechanism whereby Small Ubiquitin Like Modifiers, or SUMO proteins (Sumo in mice), are covalently bound to protein substrates in a highly dynamic and reversible manner. SUMOylation is involved in a variety of basic neurological processes including learning and memory, and central nervous system development, but is also linked with neurological disorders. However, studying SUMOylation in vivo remains challenging due to limited tools to study Sumo proteins and their targets in their native context. More complexity arises from the fact that Sumo1 and Sumo2 are ~50% homologous, whereas Sumo2 and Sumo3 are nearly identical and indistinguishable with antibodies. While Sumo paralogues can compensate for one another's loss, Sumo2 is highest expressed and only paralog essential for embryonic development making it critical to uncover roles specific to Sumo2 in vivo. To further examine the roles of Sumo2, and to begin to tease apart the redundancy and similarity between key Sumo paralogs, we generated (His6-)HA epitope-tagged Sumo2 knock-in mouse alleles, expanding the current Sumo knock-in mouse tool-kit comprising of the previously generated His6-HA-Sumo1 knock-in model. Using these HA-Sumo mouse lines, we performed whole brain imaging and mapping to the Allen Brain Atlas to analyze the relative distribution of the Sumo1 and Sumo2 paralogues in the adult mouse brain. We observed differential staining patterns between Sumo1 and Sumo2, including a partial localization of Sumo2 in nerve cell synapses of the hippocampus. Combining immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry, we identified native substrates targeted by Sumo1 or Sumo2 in the mouse brain. We validated select hits using proximity ligation assays, further providing insight into the subcellular distribution of neuronal Sumo2-conjugates. These mouse models thus serve as valuable tools to study the cellular and biochemical roles of SUMOylation in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Examining Litter Specific Variability in Mice and its Impact on Neurodevelopmental Studies</a></h4>

              
                Our current understanding of litter variability in neurodevelopmental studies using mouse may limit translation of neuroscientific findings. Higher variance of measures across litters than within, often termed intra-litter likeness, may be attributable to pre- and postnatal environment. This study aimed to assess the litter-effect within behavioral assessments (2 timepoints), and anatomy using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (4 timepoints) across 72 brain region volumes (36 C57bl/6J inbred mice; 7 litters: 19F/17M). Between-litter comparisons of brain and behavioral measures and their associations were evaluated using univariate and multivariate techniques. A power analysis using simulation methods was then performed modeling neurodevelopment and evaluating trade-offs between number-of-litters, mice-per-litter, and sample size. Our results show litter-specific developmental effects, from the adolescent period to adulthood for brain structure volumes and behaviors, and their associations in adulthood. Our power simulation analysis results suggest increasing the number-of-litters in experimental design to achieve the smallest total sample size for detecting different rates of change in specific brain regions. Our results also demonstrate how litter-specific effects may influence development and that increasing the litters to the total sample size ratio should be strongly considered when designing neurodevelopmental studies.

                Bushy neurons of the cochlear nucleus encode temporal fine structure and modulation of sound with high fidelity. However, the synaptic maps and electrotonic structures that underlie these properties are not specified in meaningful explanatory detail. We employed modern volume electron microscopy techniques to provide exact data on the numbers of synaptic inputs and their weights determined by the number of contained active zones, and the surface areas of all postsynaptic cellular compartments. Leveraging these high-resolution images, we discovered cabling of dendrite branches and new structures within dendrites, and identified non-innervated dendrites. We extend current nanoscale connectomic studies with methods to export cellular reconstructions into morphologically-constrained, biophysically-based predictive computational models. We reveal both coincidence detection and mixed supra/subthreshold modes of input convergence across the bushy cell population and show subthreshold inputs contribute to enhanced temporal encoding even in the presence of suprathreshold inputs. We demonstrate the variation of dendritic load and axon parameters and their importance in controlling excitability as potential homeostatic mechanisms, thereby defining heterogeneity in stimulus-evoked responses across the BC population.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal mitochondrial morphology is significantly affected by both fixative and oxygen level during perfusion</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the brain have a uniquely polarized structure consisting of multiple dendrites and a single axon generated from a cell body. Interestingly, intracellular mitochondria also show strikingly polarized morphologies along the dendrites and axons: in cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) dendritic mitochondria have a long and tubular shape, while axonal mitochondria are small and circular. Mitochondria play important roles in each compartment of the neuron by generating ATP and buffering calcium, thereby affecting synaptic transmission and neuronal development. In addition, mitochondrial shape, and thereby function, is dynamically altered by environmental stresses such as oxidative stress, or in various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. Although the importance of altered mitochondrial shape has been claimed by multiple studies, methods for studying this stress-sensitive organelle have not been standardized. Here we address the pertinent steps that influence mitochondrial morphology during experimental processes. We demonstrate that fixative solutions containing only paraformaldehyde (PFA), or that introduce hypoxic conditions during the procedure induce dramatic fragmentation of mitochondria both in vitro and in vivo. This disruption was not observed following the use of glutaraldehyde addition or oxygen supplementation, respectively. Finally, using pre-formed fibril alpha-synuclein treated neurons, we show a difference between mitochondrial morphology when samples were fixed with PFA/glutaraldehyde or PFA/sucrose containing solutions, but not PFA alone. Our study provides optimized methods for examining mitochondrial morphology in neurons, and demonstrates that fixation conditions are critical when investigating the underlying cellular mechanisms involving mitochondria in physiological and neurodegenerative disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual variability in neural event segmentation reflects stimulus content and interpretation</a></h4>

              
                Event segmentation is a spontaneous part of perception, important for processing continuous information and organizing it into memory. While neural and behavioral event segmentation show a degree of inter-subject consistency, meaningful individual variability exists atop these shared patterns. Here we characterized individual differences in the location of neural and behavioral event boundaries across four short movies that varied in both high- and low-level features and evoked variable interpretations. We studied the same individuals across movies to investigate the extent to which individual segmentation styles are stable irrespective of the stimulus (i.e., "trait-like") versus content-dependent. Results showed that across-subject event boundary alignment follows a posterior-to-anterior gradient that is tightly correlated with the rate of segmentation; slower segmenting regions that integrate information over longer time periods show more individual variability. We found that certain aspects of movie content-namely, continuity editing and social content-drive more shared boundaries and are better suited to pull out individual differences. We identified a subset of regions, specific to each movie, in which neural boundary locations are both aligned with behavioral boundaries during encoding and predictive of stimulus interpretation, suggesting that event segmentation may be a mechanism by which narratives generate variable memories and appraisals of stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Young adults use whole-body feedback to perceive small locomotor disturbances.</a></h4>

              
                To prevent a fall when a disturbance to walking is encountered requires sensory information about the disturbance to be perceived, integrated, and then used to generate an appropriate corrective response. Prior research has shown that feedback of whole-body motion drives this corrective response. Here, we hypothesized that young adults also use whole-body motion to perceive locomotor disturbances. 15 subjects performed a locomotor discrimination task in which the supporting leg was slowed during stance every 8-12 steps to emulate subtle slips. The perception threshold of these disturbances was determined using a psychometrics approach and found to be 0.08 {+/-} 0.03 m/s. Whole-body feedback was examined through center-of-mass (CoM) kinematics and whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). Perturbation-induced deviations of CoM and WBAM were calculated in response to the two perturbation levels nearest each subject's perception threshold. Consistent with our hypothesis, we identified significantly higher perturbation-induced deviations for perceived perturbations in sagittal-plane WBAM, anteroposterior CoM velocity, and mediolateral CoM position, velocity, and acceleration. Because whole-body motion is not sensed directly but instead arises from the integration of various sensory feedback signals, we also explored local sensory feedback contributions to the perception of locomotor disturbances. Local sensory feedback was estimated through kinematic analogues of vision (head angle), vestibular (head angular velocity), proprioception (i.e., sagittal hip, knee, and ankle angles), and somatosensation (i.e., anterior-posterior & mediolateral center-of-pressure, COP). We identified significantly higher perturbation-induced deviations for perceived perturbations in sagittal-plane ankle angle only. These results provide evidence for both whole-body feedback and ankle proprioception as important for the perception of subtle slip-like locomotor disturbances in young adults. Our interpretation is ankle proprioception is a dominant contributor to estimates of whole-body motion to perceive locomotor disturbances.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Does Functional Recovery Imply Stable Circuitry in the Spinal Animal?</a></h4>

              
                Spinal animals can regain locomotor function through gait training. However, the neural processes involved in this recovery are poorly understood. Here we use computer simulation to address if the reorganization of spinal circuits associated with the functional recovery leads to meaningful, stable circuitry function. Specifically, we develop a neuromuscular model of a spinalized rat whose circuitry can adapt based on two alternative Hebbian learning strategies, one designed to guide the circuitry back to its normal pre-injury state and the other designed to destabilize it and drive it into saturation. Exposing the model to simulated gait training, we find that both strategies lead to recovery of locomotor function as defined by the outcome measures reported in studies with spinal rats. If anything, the results obtained with the destabilizing learning strategy seem to agree more with animal observations, since it produces similarly excessive amplitudes in muscle activity. Our results suggest that gait training of spinalized animals does not necessarily effect a meaningful recovery of their spinal circuitry function. More experimental work should be directed to clarify this point, as it may have grave implications for the potential of gait rehabilitation in patients with motor complete injuries of the spinal cord.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta spectral power during sleep is associated with impaired recall of extinguished fear</a></h4>

              
                Background: The failure to retain memory for extinguished fear plays a major role in the maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with successful extinction recall necessary for symptom reduction. Disturbed sleep, a hallmark symptom of PTSD, impairs fear extinction recall. However, our understanding of the electrophysiological mechanisms underpinning sleep's role in extinction retention remain underdetermined. Methods: We reanalyzed data from two existing datasets examining the relationship between the microarchitecture of sleep and extinction recall in healthy controls (Study 1, n = 46) and a pilot study in individuals with PTSD (Study 2, n = 12). In both studies, participants underwent a fear conditioning and extinction protocol over the course of two days, with polysomnography sleep recording occurring between conditioning and extinction. Twenty-four hours after extinction learning, participants underwent extinction recall. Power spectral density (PSD) was computed for NREM and REM sleep during both pre- and post-extinction learning. Results: Increased PSD in frequencies spanning the canonical beta band during pre-extinction learning sleep were associated with worse extinction recall in healthy participants (r = .41, p = .004). Beta PSD was shown to be highly stable across three nights of sleep (NREM intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.93; REM ICC = 0.94). Individuals with PTSD were found to have increased beta PSD compared to healthy controls (NREM: p = .038; REM: p = .007), and beta PSD correlated with extinction recall in the PTSD group at a similar magnitude to controls (r = .39). Conclusions: The present findings suggest that beta band PSD may be a trait-like feature of the sleep EEG that is heightened in PTSD and associated with impaired fear extinction recall. Thus, beta PSD during sleep may reflect a trait marker for vulnerability to PTSD, specifically implicated in difficulties recalling extinguished fear.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing Cone Spectral Classification by Optoretinography</a></h4>

              
                Light propagation in photoreceptor outer segments is affected by photopigment absorption and the phototransduction amplification cascade. Photopigment absorption has been studied using retinal densitometry, while recently, optoretinography (ORG) has provided an avenue to probe changes in outer segment optical path length due to phototransduction. With adaptive optics (AO), both densitometry and ORG have been used for cone spectral classification, based on the differential bleaching signatures of the three cone types. Here, we characterize cone classification by ORG, implemented in an AO line-scan OCT and compare it against densitometry. The cone mosaics of five color normal subjects were classified using ORG showing high probability (~0.99), low error (<0.22%), high test-retest reliability (~97%) and short imaging durations (< 1 hour). Of these, the cone spectral assignments in two subjects were compared against AOSLO densitometry. High agreement (mean: 91%) was observed between the two modalities in these 2 subjects, with measurements conducted 6-7 years apart. Overall, ORG benefits from higher sensitivity and dynamic range to probe cone photopigments compared to densitometry, and thus provides greater fidelity for cone spectral classification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission alters the emergent bursting dynamics of in vitro neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in vitro connect to each other and form neural networks that display emergent electrophysiological activity. This activity begins as spontaneous uncorrelated firing in the early phase of development, and as functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses mature, this activity typically emerges as spontaneous network bursts. Network bursts are events of coordinated global activation among many neurons interspersed with periods of silencing and are important for synaptic plasticity, neural information processing, and network computation. While bursting is the consequence of balanced excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) interactions, the functional mechanisms underlying their evolution from physiological to potentially pathophysiological states are still poorly understood. This is partly because we have limited knowledge of and access to the synaptic connections themselves. In this study, we used selective chemogenetic inhibition to target and disrupt excitatory synaptic transmission in in vitro neural networks to study functional response and recovery of spontaneous network bursts over time. We found that inhibition resulted in neural networks subsequently exhibiting high frequency network bursts with high number of spikes per bursts, and with up to 98% of all spikes being in network bursts. Our results imply that the disruption in excitatory synaptic transmission during early network development likely affected inhibitory synaptic maturity which resulted in an overall decrease in network inhibition at later stages. These findings give evidence to the importance of E/I balance in maintaining physiological bursting patterns in neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Invariance of object detection in untrained deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The ability to perceive visual objects with various types of transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, is crucial for consistent object recognition. In machine learning, invariant object detection for a network is often implemented by augmentation with a massive number of training images, but the mechanism of invariant object detection in biological brains - how invariance arises initially and whether it requires visual experience - remains elusive. Here, using a model neural network of the hierarchical visual pathway of the brain, we show that invariance of object detection can emerge spontaneously in the complete absence of learning. First, we found that units selective to a particular object class arise in randomly initialized networks even before visual training. Intriguingly, these units show robust tuning to images of each object class under a wide range of image transformation types, such as viewpoint rotation. We confirmed that this "innate" invariance of object selectivity enables untrained networks to perform an object-detection task robustly, even with images that have been significantly modulated. Our computational model predicts that invariant object tuning originates from combinations of non-invariant units via random feedforward projections, and we confirmed that the predicted profile of feedforward projections is observed in untrained networks. Our results suggest that invariance of object detection is an innate characteristic that can emerge spontaneously in random feedforward networks.

                Mapping neuronal networks from 3-dimensional electron microscopy data still poses substantial reconstruction challenges, in particular for thin axons. Currently available automated image segmentation methods, while substantially progressed, still require human proof reading for many types of connectomic analyses. RoboEM, an AI-based self-steering 3D flight system trained to navigate along neurites using only EM data as input, substantially improves automated state-of-the-art segmentations and replaces human proof reading for more complex connectomic analysis problems, yielding computational annotation cost for cortical connectomes about 400-fold lower than the cost of manual error correction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity in primate visual cortex is minimally driven by spontaneous movements</a></h4>

              
                Organisms process sensory information in the context of their own moving bodies, an idea referred to as embodiment. This idea is important for developmental neuroscience, and increasingly plays a role in robotics and systems neuroscience. The mechanisms that support such embodiment are unknown, but a manifestation could be the observation in mice of brain-wide neuromodulation, including in the primary visual cortex, driven by task-irrelevant spontaneous body movements. Here we tested this hypothesis in macaque monkeys, a primate model for human vision, by simultaneously recording visual cortex activity and facial and body movements. Activity in the visual cortex (V1, V2, V3,V3A) was associated with the animals' own movements, but this modulation was largely explained by the impact of the movements on the retinal image. These results suggest that embodiment in primate vision may be realized by input provided by the eyes themselves.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling of the Zebrafish Inner Ear Reveals Molecularly Distinct Hair Cell and Supporting Cell Subtypes</a></h4>

              
                A major cause of human deafness and vestibular dysfunction is permanent loss of the mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear. In non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish, regeneration of missing hair cells can occur throughout life. While a comparative approach has the potential to reveal the basis of such differential regenerative ability, the degree to which the inner ears of fish and mammals share common hair cells and supporting cell types remains unresolved. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the zebrafish inner ear at embryonic through adult stages to catalog the diversity of hair cell and non-sensory supporting cells. We identify a putative progenitor population for hair cells and supporting cells, as well as distinct hair cells and supporting cell types in the maculae versus cristae. The hair cell and supporting cell types differ from those described for the lateral line system, a distributed mechanosensory organ in zebrafish in which most studies of hair cell regeneration have been conducted. In the maculae, we identify two subtypes of hair cells that share gene expression with mammalian striolar or extrastriolar hair cells. In situ hybridization reveals that these hair cell subtypes occupy distinct spatial domains within the two major macular organs, the utricle and saccule, consistent with the reported distinct electrophysiological properties of hair cells within these domains. These findings suggest that primitive specialization of spatially distinct striolar and extrastriolar hair cells likely arose in the last common ancestor of fish and mammals. The similarities of inner ear cell type composition between fish and mammals also support using zebrafish as a relevant model for understanding inner ear-specific hair cell function and regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Successful working memory linked to theta connectivity patterns in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is the ability to actively maintain information for a short time and is central to human behavior. Rodent studies have proposed that hippocampal-entorhinal communication supports WM maintenance. However, the exact neural mechanisms of this interaction in WM remains unclear in humans. To address these questions, we combined machine learning analyses with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC) in human participants, who maintained a set of letters in their WM. We found that WM maintenance was accompanied by elevated bidirectional hippocampal-EC information exchange via the theta band (2-8 Hz) and bidirectional cross-region theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Further decoding analyses showed that the unidirectional inter-regional communication, with both theta oscillations in the hippocampus modulating EC gamma activity and theta band-coordinated information flow from the hippocampus, could decode correct performance at the level of participants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that theta functional coupling in the hippocampal-EC supports the maintenance of WM information via a specific pattern of frequency and direction. This connectivity-based coding could shed light on the neural mechanisms of WM processing.

	<p>It has been reported that attending to stimuli in visual modality can spread to task-irrelevant but synchronously presented stimuli in auditory modality, a phenomenon termed the cross-modal spread of attention, which could be either stimulus-driven or representation-driven depending on whether the visual constituent of an audiovisual object is further selected based on the object representation. The stimulus-driven spread of attention occurs whenever a task-irrelevant sound synchronizes with an attended visual stimulus, regardless of the cross-modal semantic congruency. The present study recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate whether the stimulus-driven cross-modal spread of attention could be modulated by audio-visual emotional congruency in a visual oddball task where emotion (positive/negative) was task-irrelevant. The results first demonstrated a prominent stimulus-driven spread of attention regardless of audio-visual emotional congruency by showing that for all audiovisual pairs, the extracted ERPs to the auditory constituents of audiovisual stimuli within the time window of 200&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms were significantly larger than ERPs to the same auditory stimuli delivered alone. However, the amplitude of this stimulus-driven auditory Nd component during 200&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms was significantly larger for emotionally incongruent than congruent audiovisual stimuli when their visual constituents&amp;amp;rsquo; emotional valences were negative. Moreover, the Nd was sustained during 300&amp;amp;ndash;400 ms only for the incongruent audiovisual stimuli with emotionally negative visual constituents. These findings suggest that although the occurrence of the stimulus-driven cross-modal spread of attention is independent of audio-visual emotional congruency, its magnitude is nevertheless modulated even when emotion is task-irrelevant.</p>

	<p>Previous studies indicated that the onsets of different social threats, such as threats to &amp;amp;rdquo;belonging&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;control&amp;amp;rdquo;, are inconsistent with the subjective beliefs of social participation and require readjustment of expectations. Because a common cognitive system is assumed to be involved, the adjustment triggered by the experience of a single social threat should affect the processing of subsequent social interactions. We examined how preexposure to a loss of control affected social exclusion processing by using the Cyberball paradigm. An event-related brain component (P3) served as a probe for the state of the expectancy system, and self-reports reflected the subjective evaluations of the social threats. In the control group (n = 23), the transition to exclusion elicited a significant P3 effect and a high threat to belonging in the self-reports. Both effects were significantly reduced when the exclusion was preceded by preexposure to a loss of control (EG1disc, n = 23). These effects, however, depend on the offset of the preexposure. In case of a continuation (EG2cont, n = 24), the P3 effect was further reduced, but the threat to belonging was restored. We conclude that the P3 data are consistent with predictions of a common expectancy violation account, whereas self-reports are supposed to be affected by additional processes.</p>

	<p>Sociomoral reasoning (SMR) is an essential component of social functioning allowing children to establish judgments based on moral criteria. The progressive emergence and complexification of SMR during childhood is thought to be underpinned by a range of characteristics and abilities present in the preschool years. Past studies have mostly examined concurrent associations between individual factors and SMR. Using a more comprehensive and predictive approach to identify early predictors of school-age SMR would contribute to a more complete picture of SMR development. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of four domains of preschool predictors to SMR at school-age: demographic (age, sex, parental education), cognitive (executive and sociocognitive functions), behavioral (internalizing and externalizing behaviors), and familial (parent&amp;amp;ndash;child interactions, parental stress) factors. Parents of 122 children 3 to 5 years (M = 3.70, SD = 0.66 years, 51% girls) completed questionnaires and children were administered executive and sociocognitive tasks. Parent&amp;amp;ndash;child interactions were assessed using an observational approach. SMR was measured four years later using the SoMoral task. A four-step hierarchical regression analysis revealed that executive functions and internalizing problems were significant independent predictors of SMR. These findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the early precursors of SMR during childhood.</p>

	<p>Blinking analysis contributes to the understanding of physiological mechanisms in healthy subjects as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological diseases. To date, blinking is assessed by various neurophysiological techniques, including electromyographic (EMG) recordings and optoelectronic motion analysis. We recorded eye-blink kinematics with a new portable device, the EyeStat (Generation 3, blinktbi, Inc., Charleston, SC, USA), and compared the measurements with data obtained using traditional laboratory-based techniques. Sixteen healthy adults underwent voluntary, spontaneous, and reflex blinking recordings using the EyeStat device and the SMART motion analysis system (BTS, Milan, Italy). During the blinking recordings, the EMG activity was recorded from the orbicularis oculi muscles using surface electrodes. The blinking data were analyzed through dedicated software and evaluated with repeated-measure analyses of variance. The Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s product-moment correlation coefficient served to assess possible associations between the EyeStat device, the SMART motion system, and the EMG data. We found that the EMG data collected during the EyeStat and SMART system recordings did not differ. The blinking data recorded with the EyeStat showed a linear relationship with the results obtained with the SMART system (r ranging from 0.85 to 0.57; p ranging from &amp;amp;lt;0.001 to 0.02). These results demonstrate a high accuracy and reliability of a blinking analysis through this portable device, compared with standard techniques. EyeStat may make it easier to record blinking in research activities and in daily clinical practice, thus allowing large-scale studies in healthy subjects and patients with neurological diseases in an outpatient clinic setting.</p>

	<p>Ependymomas are commonly classified as low-grade tumors, although they may harbor a malignant behavior characterized by distant neural dissemination and spinal drop metastasis. Extra-CNS ependymoma metastases are extremely rare and only few cases have been reported in the lung, lymph nodes, pleura, mediastinum, liver, bone, and diaphragmatic, abdominal, and pelvic muscles. A review of the literature yielded 14 other case reports metastasizing outside the central nervous system, but to our knowledge, no studies describe metastasis in the paravertebral muscles. Herein, we report the case of a 39-year-old patient with a paraspinal muscles metastasis from a myxopapillary ependymoma. The neoplasm was surgically excised and histologically and molecularly analyzed. Both the analyses were consistent with the diagnosis of muscle metastases of myxopapillary ependymoma. The here-presented case report is first case in the literature of a paraspinal muscles metastasis of myxopapillary ependymoma.</p>

	<p>The social salience hypothesis proposes that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) can impact human social behavior by modulating the salience of social cues. Here, frequency-tagging EEG was used to quantify the neural responses to social versus non-social stimuli while administering a single dose of OT (24 IU) versus placebo treatment. Specifically, two streams of faces and houses were superimposed on one another, with each stream of stimuli tagged with a particular presentation rate (i.e., 6 and 7.5 Hz or vice versa). These distinctive frequency tags allowed unambiguously disentangling and objectively quantifying the respective neural responses elicited by the different streams of stimuli. This study involved a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial with 31 healthy adult men. Based on four trials of 60 s, we detected robust frequency-tagged neural responses in each individual, with entrainment to faces being more pronounced in lateral occipito-temporal regions and entrainment to houses being focused in medial occipital regions. However, contrary to our expectation, a single dose of OT did not modulate these stimulus-driven neural responses, not in terms of enhanced social processing nor in terms of generally enhanced information salience. Bayesian analyses formally confirmed these null findings. Possibly, the baseline ceiling level performance of these neurotypical adult participants as well as the personal irrelevance of the applied stimulation streams might have hindered the observation of any OT effect.</p>

	<p>The impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the mental health of the population requires the implementation of new primary screening strategies of mental health disorders to intervene in a timelier manner, and technology may provide solutions. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the mobile app Mentali (version 1.1.2; creators: Jorge Alfonso Sol&amp;amp;iacute;s Galv&amp;amp;aacute;n Sodel V&amp;amp;aacute;zquez Reyes, Margarita de la Luz Mart&amp;amp;iacute;nez Fierro, Perla Velasco Elizondo, Idalia Garza Veloz, Alejandro Mauricio Gonz&amp;amp;aacute;lez and Claudia Caldera Villalobos, Zacatecas, M&amp;amp;eacute;xico) as a primary screening tool for anxiety and depression disorders in medical students and to assess the triggering risk factors. This was a descriptive and longitudinal study and included 155 Mexican medical students. Participants interacted with Mentali for 6 months. The mobile app integrated the Beck anxiety and depression inventories together with a mood module. At the end of the interaction, the students received psychological and psychiatric interventions to confirm their primary diagnoses. Symptoms of moderate/severe anxiety and depression were present in 62.6% and 54.6% of the studied population. When corroborating the diagnoses, Mentali obtained a sensitivity of 100%, 95%, and 43% to classify a mental health disorder, anxiety, and depression, respectively. The most important triggers found were as follows: belonging to a dysfunctional family, being introverted, and having suffered from bullying. The proportion of users with excellent/good mood decreased from 78.7% to 34.4% at the end of the semester, and the proportion of users who claimed to have bad/very bad mood increased from 7.4% to 34.4% at the end of the semester (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Mentali was useful for identifying users with anxiety and/or depression, and as an auxiliary tool to coordinate the provision of specialized interventions, allowing us to increase the proportion of patients who needed psychological care and received it by 30%. The efficacy of Mentali in identifying activities through time with an impact on the mood and mental health of the users was confirmed. Our results support the use of Mentali for the primary screening of mental health disorders in young adults, including medical students.</p>

	<p>High cervical spinal cord stimulation (HCSCS) was found to have therapeutic effects on Parkinsonian gait disturbance. However, the results were inconsistent and confounded with symptoms of pain. This study aimed to reveal the gait and dysarthric effects of HCSCS in PD (Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease) and MSA-P (Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy) patients without pain. Three PD and five MSA-P patients without painful comorbidities were assessed for gait performance and speech before SCS surgery and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Stride length and the time spent in the Timed Up-and-Go task showed little change after HCSCS surgery. Overall voice quality (measured by dysphonia severity index) and perceptual speech intelligence improved significantly at 3 months, but improvements slightly diminished at 6 months postoperatively. Change in quality of life (measured by 8-item Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease questionnaire) was also notable at 3 months but narrowed over time following HCSCS. In conclusion, HCSCS showed therapeutic effects in improving the dysarthria but not gait disturbance in pain-free PD and MSA-P patients.</p>

                Strategic smart factory design is essential to utilize Industry 4.0 technologies in production environments effectively. Although a series of earlier reviews in the context of smart manufacturing have been published, so far none addresses smart factory design, i. e. the planning and operation of smart factories.  This review provides an overview of recent research in the field by systematizing opportunities, risks and success factors of smart factory design as available from recent empirical studies (2018-2022). Businesses are informed how smart factory design should be approached and implemented to realize cost advantages and increase competitiveness. Academic research benefits of a classification of relevant issues and open research fields are outlined.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ageism in medication use: a policy brief [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Ageism in medication use decreases older persons' well-being and quality of life and increases health care utilization and costs. This policy brief outlines several strategies that may be considered to combat ageism in medication use and its widespread negative consequences. The strategies are the following: 1) Establish a global action plan (designate an international organization to take a leading and coordinating role; involve all stakeholders; take a multidisciplinary, intersectoral, and systems approach; ensure affordability, accessibility, and availability of care and medications; address the needs of older adults facing multiple forms of discrimination; tailor strategies to the local contexts; designate coordinators at the national and organizational levels); 2) Enhance integration and coordination between health and social care and across different levels of health care (deliver team-based, multidisciplinary, integrated, and coordinated care; ensure interoperability of electronic health records); 3) Implement a quality and safety perspective (integrate and implement patient safety in all policies and programmes; establish a safety culture; establish open reporting culture; take an active and proactive approach; use international indicators); 4) Empower and engage older patients (involve patients in shared decision-making; provide health and medication-related information; provide decision aids and question prompt lists; launch campaigns to raise awareness about ageism in medication use and medication safety, and to promote a life-course perspective, a healthy lifestyle, and the benefits of non-pharmacological strategies); and 5) Improve education and training of care professionals (develop comprehensive curricula; implement interprofessional and intergenerational education and training; develop and revise clinical guidelines to meet older persons' needs and preferences; translate clinical guidelines into computerized clinical decision support systems, prescribing algorithms and alerts). By tackling ageism in medication use, policies, strategies, and actions can enhance the lives of older people and, in turn, their contribution to society.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The hierarchical organization of autocatalytic reaction networks and its relevance to the origin of life</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhen Peng, Jeff Linderoth, David A. Baum</p>

Prior work on abiogenesis, the emergence of life from non-life, suggests that it requires chemical reaction networks that contain self-amplifying motifs, namely, autocatalytic cores. However, little is known about how the presence of multiple autocatalytic cores might allow for the gradual accretion of complexity on the path to life. To explore this problem, we develop the concept of a seed-dependent autocatalytic system (SDAS), which is a subnetwork that can autocatalytically self-maintain given a flux of food, but cannot be initiated by food alone. Rather, initiation of SDASs requires the transient introduction of chemical “seeds”. We show that, depending on the topological relationship of SDASs in a chemical reaction network, a food-driven system can accrete complexity in a historically contingent manner, governed by rare seeding events. We develop new algorithms for detecting and analyzing SDASs in chemical reaction databases and describe parallels between multi-SDAS networks and biological ecosystems. Applying our algorithms to both an abiotic reaction network and a biochemical one, each driven by a set of simple food chemicals, we detect SDASs that are organized as trophic tiers, of which the higher tier can be seeded by relatively simple chemicals if the lower tier is already activated. This indicates that sequential activation of trophically organized SDASs by seed chemicals that are not much more complex than what already exist could be a mechanism of gradual complexification from relatively simple abiotic reactions to more complex life-like systems. Interestingly, in both reaction networks, higher-tier SDASs include chemicals that might alter emergent features of chemical systems and could serve as early targets of selection. Our analysis provides computational tools for analyzing very large chemical/biochemical reaction networks and suggests new approaches to studying abiogenesis in the lab.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ceRNAR: An R package for identification and analysis of ceRNA-miRNA triplets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi-Wen Hsiao, Lin Wang, Tzu-Pin Lu</p>

Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) represents a novel mechanism of gene regulation that controls several biological and pathological processes. Recently, an increasing number of <i>in silico</i> methods have been developed to accelerate the identification of such regulatory events. However, there is still a need for a tool supporting the hypothesis that ceRNA regulatory events only occur at specific miRNA expression levels. To this end, we present an R package, ceRNAR, which allows identification and analysis of ceRNA-miRNA triplets via integration of miRNA and RNA expression data. The ceRNAR package integrates three main steps: (i) identification of ceRNA pairs based on a rank-based correlation between pairs that considers the impact of miRNA and a running sum correlation statistic, (ii) sample clustering based on gene-gene correlation by circular binary segmentation, and (iii) peak merging to identify the most relevant sample patterns. In addition, ceRNAR also provides downstream analyses of identified ceRNA-miRNA triplets, including network analysis, functional annotation, survival analysis, external validation, and integration of different tools. The performance of our proposed approach was validated through simulation studies of different scenarios. Compared with several published tools, ceRNAR was able to identify true ceRNA triplets with high sensitivity, low false-positive rates, and acceptable running time. In real data applications, the ceRNAs common to two lung cancer datasets were identified in both datasets. The bridging miRNA for one of these, the ceRNA for <i>MAP4K3</i>, was identified by ceRNAR as hsa-let-7c-5p. Since similar cancer subtypes do share some biological patterns, these results demonstrated that our proposed algorithm was able to identify potential ceRNA targets in real patients. In summary, ceRNAR offers a novel algorithm and a comprehensive pipeline to identify and analyze ceRNA regulation. The package is implemented in R and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ywhsiao/ceRNAR).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Species abundance correlations carry limited information about microbial network interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susanne Pinto, Elisa Benincà, Egbert H. van Nes, Marten Scheffer, Johannes A. Bogaards</p>

Unraveling the network of interactions in ecological communities is a daunting task. Common methods to infer interspecific interactions from cross-sectional data are based on co-occurrence measures. For instance, interactions in the human microbiome are often inferred from correlations between the abundance of bacterial phylogenetic groups across subjects. We tested whether such correlation-based methods are indeed reliable for inferring interaction networks. For this purpose, we simulated bacterial communities by means of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model, with variation in model parameters representing variability among hosts. Our results show that correlations can be indicative for presence of bacterial interactions, but only when measurement noise is low relative to the variation in interaction strengths between hosts. Indication of interaction was affected by type of interaction network, process noise and sampling under non-equilibrium conditions. The sign of a correlation mostly coincided with the nature of the strongest pairwise interaction, but this is not necessarily the case. For instance, under rare conditions of identical interaction strength, we found that competitive and exploitative interactions can result in positive as well as negative correlations. Thus, cross-sectional abundance data carry limited information on specific interaction types. Correlations in abundance may hint at interactions but require independent validation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Patterns of asymmetry and energy cost generated from predictive simulations of hemiparetic gait</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Russell T. Johnson, Nicholas A. Bianco, James M. Finley</p>

Hemiparesis, defined as unilateral muscle weakness, often occurs in people post-stroke or people with cerebral palsy, however it is difficult to understand how this hemiparesis affects movement patterns as it often presents alongside a variety of other neuromuscular impairments. Predictive musculoskeletal modeling presents an opportunity to investigate how impairments affect gait performance assuming a particular cost function. Here, we use predictive simulation to quantify the spatiotemporal asymmetries and changes to metabolic cost that emerge when muscle strength is unilaterally reduced and how reducing spatiotemporal symmetry affects metabolic cost. We modified a 2-D musculoskeletal model by uniformly reducing the peak isometric muscle force unilaterally. We then solved optimal control simulations of walking across a range of speeds by minimizing the sum of the cubed muscle excitations. Lastly, we ran additional optimizations to test if reducing spatiotemporal asymmetry would result in an increase in metabolic cost. Our results showed that the magnitude and direction of effort-optimal spatiotemporal asymmetries depends on both the gait speed and level of weakness. Also, the optimal speed was 1.25 m/s for the symmetrical and 20% weakness models but slower (1.00 m/s) for the 40% and 60% weakness models, suggesting that hemiparesis can account for a portion of the slower gait speed seen in people with hemiparesis. Modifying the cost function to minimize spatiotemporal asymmetry resulted in small increases (~4%) in metabolic cost. Overall, our results indicate that spatiotemporal asymmetry may be optimal for people with hemiparesis. Additionally, the effect of speed and the level of weakness on spatiotemporal asymmetry may help explain the well-known heterogenous distribution of spatiotemporal asymmetries observed in the clinic. Future work could extend our results by testing the effects of other neuromuscular impairments on optimal gait strategies, and therefore build a more comprehensive understanding of the gait patterns observed in clinical populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Utility of constraints reflecting system stability on analyses for biological models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yoshiaki Kariya, Masashi Honma, Keita Tokuda, Akihiko Konagaya, Hiroshi Suzuki</p>

Simulating complex biological models consisting of multiple ordinary differential equations can aid in the prediction of the pharmacological/biological responses; however, they are often hampered by the availability of reliable kinetic parameters. In the present study, we aimed to discover the properties of behaviors without determining an optimal combination of kinetic parameter values (parameter set). The key idea was to collect as many parameter sets as possible. Given that many systems are biologically stable and resilient (BSR), we focused on the dynamics around the steady state and formulated objective functions for BSR by partial linear approximation of the focused region. Using the objective functions and modified global cluster Newton method, we developed an algorithm for a thorough exploration of the allowable parameter space for biological systems (TEAPS). We first applied TEAPS to the NF-κB signaling model. This system shows a damped oscillation after stimulation and seems to fit the BSR constraint. By applying TEAPS, we found several directions in parameter space which stringently determines the BSR property. In such directions, the experimentally fitted parameter values were included in the range of the obtained parameter sets. The arachidonic acid metabolic pathway model was used as a model related to pharmacological responses. The pharmacological effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were simulated using the parameter sets obtained by TEAPS. The structural properties of the system were partly extracted by analyzing the distribution of the obtained parameter sets. In addition, the simulations showed inter-drug differences in prostacyclin to thromboxane A2 ratio such that aspirin treatment tends to increase the ratio, while rofecoxib treatment tends to decrease it. These trends are comparable to the clinical observations. These results on real biological models suggest that the parameter sets satisfying the BSR condition can help in finding biologically plausible parameter sets and understanding the properties of biological systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ambiguity drives higher-order Pavlovian learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomislav D. Zbozinek, Omar D. Perez, Toby Wise, Michael Fanselow, Dean Mobbs</p>

In the natural world, stimulus-outcome associations are often ambiguous, and most associations are highly complex and situation-dependent. Learning to disambiguate these complex associations to identify which specific outcomes will occur in which situations is critical for survival. Pavlovian occasion setters are stimuli that determine whether other stimuli will result in a specific outcome. Occasion setting is a well-established phenomenon, but very little investigation has been conducted on how occasion setters are disambiguated when they themselves are ambiguous (i.e., when they do not consistently signal whether another stimulus will be reinforced). In two preregistered studies, we investigated the role of higher-order Pavlovian occasion setting in humans. We developed and tested the first computational model predicting direct associative learning, traditional occasion setting (i.e., 1<sup>st</sup>-order occasion setting), and 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting. This model operationalizes stimulus ambiguity as a mechanism to engage in higher-order Pavlovian learning. Both behavioral and computational modeling results suggest that 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting was learned, as evidenced by lack and presence of transfer of occasion setting properties when expected and the superior fit of our 2<sup>nd</sup>-order occasion setting model compared to the 1<sup>st</sup>-order occasion setting or direct associations models. These results provide a controlled investigation into highly complex associative learning and may ultimately lead to improvements in the treatment of Pavlovian-based mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, substance use).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A transcriptional cycling model recapitulates chromatin-dependent features of noisy inducible transcription</a></h4>

              
                <p>by M. Elise Bullock, Nataly Moreno-Martinez, Kathryn Miller-Jensen</p>

Activation of gene expression in response to environmental cues results in substantial phenotypic heterogeneity between cells that can impact a wide range of outcomes including differentiation, viral activation, and drug resistance. An important source of gene expression noise is transcriptional bursting, or the process by which transcripts are produced during infrequent bursts of promoter activity. Chromatin accessibility impacts transcriptional bursting by regulating the assembly of transcription factor and polymerase complexes on promoters, suggesting that the effect of an activating signal on transcriptional noise will depend on the initial chromatin state at the promoter. To explore this possibility, we simulated transcriptional activation using a transcriptional cycling model with three promoter states that represent chromatin remodeling, polymerase binding and pause release. We initiated this model over a large parameter range representing target genes with different chromatin environments, and found that, upon increasing the polymerase pause release rate to activate transcription, changes in gene expression noise varied significantly across initial promoter states. This model captured phenotypic differences in activation of latent HIV viruses integrated at different chromatin locations and mediated by the transcription factor NF-κB. Activating transcription in the model via increasing one or more of the transcript production rates, as occurs following NF-κB activation, reproduced experimentally measured transcript distributions for four different latent HIV viruses, as well as the bimodal pattern of HIV protein expression that leads to a subset of reactivated virus. Importantly, the parameter ‘activation path’ differentially affected gene expression noise, and ultimately viral activation, in line with experimental observations. This work demonstrates how upstream signaling pathways can be connected to biological processes that underlie transcriptional bursting, resulting in target gene-specific noise profiles following stimulation of a single upstream pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantitative prediction of ensemble dynamics, shapes and contact propensities of intrinsically disordered proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Yu, Rafael Brüschweiler</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly dynamic systems that play an important role in cell signaling processes and their misfunction often causes human disease. Proper understanding of IDP function not only requires the realistic characterization of their three-dimensional conformational ensembles at atomic-level resolution but also of the time scales of interconversion between their conformational substates. Large sets of experimental data are often used in combination with molecular modeling to restrain or bias models to improve agreement with experiment. It is shown here for the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (p53TAD) and Pup, which are two IDPs that fold upon binding to their targets, how the latest advancements in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations methodology produces native conformational ensembles by combining replica exchange with series of microsecond MD simulations. They closely reproduce experimental data at the global conformational ensemble level, in terms of the distribution properties of the radius of gyration tensor, and at the local level, in terms of NMR properties including <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation, without the need for reweighting. Further inspection revealed that 10–20% of the individual MD trajectories display the formation of secondary structures not observed in the experimental NMR data. The IDP ensembles were analyzed by graph theory to identify dominant inter-residue contact clusters and characteristic amino-acid contact propensities. These findings indicate that modern MD force fields with residue-specific backbone potentials can produce highly realistic IDP ensembles sampling a hierarchy of nano- and picosecond time scales providing new insights into their biological function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence, causes and impacts of human trafficking in Asian countries: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Asian countries, human trafficking is often encountered as forced labor, forced marriage, sex trafficking, men, women, and children exploitation. This review points out how human trafficking activities are prevalent in Asian countries and also reveals different causes that are the basis of increasingly human trafficking in Asian countries such as poverty, unemployment, political uncertainty, war, natural disaster, corruption and weak policies. Human trafficking also creates huge health, physical, psychological and social implications on individuals and the overall society. Methods: The purpose of this study is to collect evidence on human trafficking in Asian countries. A scoping review methodology was used to systematically search online databases including Sage Journals Online, Wiley Online, Hein Online, Taylor & Francis Online, Web of Science, and Scopus literature to amalgamate information on this issue. For the purposes of this article, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria after searching and screening a total number of 1,278 studies. Results: The findings of this study were classified under three categories: prevalence of human trafficking in Asia, causes of human trafficking in Asia (poverty and unemployment, environmental and manmade disaster, weak policies and corruption), and impacts of human trafficking including social, health, physical, psychological impacts. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the prevalence and impacts of human trafficking, the author also recommends some meaningful and practical steps for policymakers and researchers to effectively tackle human trafficking in Asian countries.

                Background: Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is a highly transmissible disease representing a significant global public health burden. The provision of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) has contributed to the reduction of malaria across endemic countries. However, the detection of insecticide resistance in many mosquito vector species potentially threatens the long-term effectiveness of ITNs. A novel method to reduce the impact of insecticide resistance is to treat mosquito nets with multiple active ingredients. Methods and analysis: This review will comprehensively search the literature (both published and unpublished) for any studies investigating the effectiveness of mosquito nets treated with multiple active ingredients, known henceforth as dual-active-ingredient (DAI) ITNs. The DAI ITNs of interest include those treated with a pyrethroid and non-pyrethroid insecticide (review question 1) or with a pyrethroid and an insect growth regulator (review question 2).  Studies will be screened to meet the inclusion criteria by a minimum of two authors, followed by assessment of risk of bias (using appropriate risk of bias tools for randomised and non-randomised studies) and extraction of relevant information using structured forms by two independent authors. Meta-analyses will be carried out where possible for epidemiological outcomes and subgrouping will be considered. Certainty in the evidence will be established with GRADE assessments. Ethics and dissemination: A full review report will be submitted to the Vector Control and Insecticide Resistance Unit, Global Malaria Program, WHO. A version of this report will be submitted for publication in an open access peer-reviewed journal. The report will inform the development of WHO recommendations regarding the use of DAI ITNs for the prevention of malaria. This systematic review does not require ethics approval as it is a review of primary studies. Registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42022333044

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">How critical is brain criticality?</a></h4>

              
                Criticality is the singular state of complex systems poised at the brink of a phase transition between order and randomness. Such systems display remarkable information-processing capabilities, evoking the compelling hypothesis that the brain may itself be critical. This foundational idea is now drawing renewed interest thanks to high-density data and converging cross-disciplinary knowledge. Together, these lines of inquiry have shed light on the intimate link between criticality, computation, and cognition.

                Feedforward and feedback pathway interactions are widespread, yet poorly understood. Rindner et al. show that subpopulations of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the PPC integrate sensory and frontal afferents with distinct nonlinear synaptic dynamics that arise from an interaction of ionic mechanisms and cell-type-specific feedforward inhibition.

                LSD is the prototypical psychedelic drug that profoundly alters human sensation, perception, and mood. Cao et al. determined the high-resolution cryo-EM structures of LSD-bound HTR2B in transducer-free, G-protein-coupled, and β-arrestin-1-coupled states, which reveal the molecular bases underlying the differential engagement of downstream signaling transducers for LSD.

                Bratkowski, Burdett, et al. elucidate the molecular basis of NAD-dependent, active-site inhibition of related NAD hydrolases SARM1 and CD38 by compounds that function by forming covalent adducts with a hydrolysis product, ADPR. They show that the SARM1 inhibitors are neuroprotective in preclinical models of nerve injury and disease.

                Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) is an adaptive physiological process that regulates neurotransmission, contributing to nervous system resilience. Orr and colleagues harness both mice and Drosophila to define a presynaptic protein assembly that drives the initiation and expression of PHP, creating a dynamic model for the adaptive control synaptic transmission.

                How do forces activate mechanical nociceptors? Gong and Chen et al. find that poking a Drosophila larva elicits shear stress to activate nociceptors through select TrpA1 isoforms. Single-channel recordings further demonstrate TrpA1 as a conserved mechanosensitive channel that is specifically activated by shear stress but not stretch.

                The oncogenic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) is a key transducer of the hedgehog (HH) morphogen, which plays an essential role in the patterning of epithelial structures. Here, we examine how HH controls SMO subcellular localization and activity in a polarized epithelium using the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal disc as a model. We provide evidence that HH promotes the stabilization of SMO by switching its fate after endocytosis toward recycling. This effect involves the sequential and additive action of protein kinase A, casein kinase I, and the Fused (FU) kinase. Moreover, in the presence of very high levels of HH, the second effect of FU leads to the local enrichment of SMO in the most basal domain of the cell membrane. Together, these results link the morphogenetic effects of HH to the apico-basal distribution of SMO and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of a GPCR.

                Redox reactions are central to biochemistry and are both controlled by and induce protein structural changes. Here, we describe structural rearrangements and crosstalk within the <i>Bacillus cereus</i> ribonucleotide reductase R2b–NrdI complex, a di-metal carboxylate-flavoprotein system, as part of the mechanism generating the essential catalytic free radical of the enzyme. Femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free electron laser was utilized to obtain structures at room temperature in defined redox states without suffering photoreduction. Together with density functional theory calculations, we show that the flavin is under steric strain in the R2b–NrdI protein complex, likely tuning its redox properties to promote superoxide generation. Moreover, a binding site in close vicinity to the expected flavin O<sub>2</sub> interaction site is observed to be controlled by the redox state of the flavin and linked to the channel proposed to funnel the produced superoxide species from NrdI to the di-manganese site in protein R2b. These specific features are coupled to further structural changes around the R2b–NrdI interaction surface. The mechanistic implications for the control of reactive oxygen species and radical generation in protein R2b are discussed.

                Human esophageal cancer has a global impact on human health due to its high incidence and mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to treat or prevent the prominent pathological subtype of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Based upon a screening of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, we discovered that Arbidol could effectively inhibit the proliferation of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma <i>in vitro</i>. Next, we conducted a series of cell-based assays and found that Arbidol treatment inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of ESCC cells and promoted G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Phospho-proteomics experiments, <i>in vitro</i> kinase assays and pull-down assays were subsequently performed in order to identify the underlying growth inhibitory mechanism. We verified Arbidol is a potential ATR inhibitor via binding to ATR kinase to reduce the phosphorylation and activation of MCM2 at Ser108. Finally, we demonstrated Arbidol had the inhibitory effect of ESCC <i>in vivo</i> by a PDX model. All together, Arbidol inhibits the proliferation of ESCC <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> through the DNA replication pathway and is associated with the cell cycle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Automatically tracking feeding behavior in populations of foraging C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> feeds on bacteria and other small microorganisms which it ingests using its pharynx, a neuromuscular pump. Currently, measuring feeding behavior requires tracking a single animal, indirectly estimating food intake from population-level metrics, or using restrained animals. To enable large throughput feeding measurements of unrestrained, crawling worms on agarose plates at a single worm resolution, we developed an imaging protocol and a complementary image analysis tool called PharaGlow. We image up to 50 unrestrained crawling worms simultaneously and extract locomotion and feeding behaviors. We demonstrate the tool’s robustness and high-throughput capabilities by measuring feeding in different use-case scenarios, such as through development, with genetic and chemical perturbations that result in faster and slower pumping, and in the presence or absence of food. Finally, we demonstrate that our tool is capable of long-term imaging by showing behavioral dynamics of mating animals and worms with different genetic backgrounds. The low-resolution fluorescence microscopes required are readily available in <i>C. elegans</i> laboratories, and in combination with our python-based analysis workflow makes this methodology easily accessible. PharaGlow therefore enables the observation and analysis of the temporal dynamics of feeding and locomotory behaviors with high-throughput and precision in a user-friendly system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Foveal vision anticipates defining features of eye movement targets</a></h4>

              
                High-acuity foveal processing is vital for human vision. Nonetheless, little is known about how the preparation of large-scale rapid eye movements (saccades) affects visual sensitivity in the center of gaze. Based on findings from passive fixation tasks, we hypothesized that during saccade preparation, foveal processing anticipates soon-to-be fixated visual features. Using a dynamic large-field noise paradigm, we indeed demonstrate that defining features of an eye movement target are enhanced in the pre-saccadic center of gaze. Enhancement manifested as higher Hit Rates for foveal probes with target-congruent orientation and a sensitization to incidental, target-like orientation information in foveally presented noise. Enhancement was spatially confined to the center of gaze and its immediate vicinity, even after parafoveal task performance had been raised to a foveal level. Moreover, foveal enhancement during saccade preparation was more pronounced and developed faster than enhancement during passive fixation. Based on these findings, we suggest a crucial contribution of foveal processing to trans-saccadic visual continuity: Foveal processing of saccade targets commences before the movement is executed and thereby enables a seamless transition once the center of gaze reaches the target.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">GENESPACE tracks regions of interest and gene copy number variation across multiple genomes</a></h4>

              
                The development of multiple chromosome-scale reference genome sequences in many taxonomic groups has yielded a high-resolution view of the patterns and processes of molecular evolution. Nonetheless, leveraging information across multiple genomes remains a significant challenge in nearly all eukaryotic systems. These challenges range from studying the evolution of chromosome structure, to finding candidate genes for quantitative trait loci, to testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. Here, we present GENESPACE, which addresses these challenges by integrating conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. We demonstrate this utility by dissecting presence–absence, copy-number, and structural variation at three levels of biological organization: spanning 300 million years of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic orthology in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-body sorcin invalidation does not cause hypothalamic ER stress nor worsens obesity in C57BL/6 male mice fed a westernized diet.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Soluble Resistance Related Calcium Binding Protein (sorcin) is a calcium (Ca2+) binding protein which has been shown to play a role in maintaining intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and lowering ER stress. Recently, our lab has demonstrated that sorcin expression was downregulated in the islets of Langerhans of mice fed a high-fat diet or in human islets incubated with the saturated fatty acid palmitate. We also showed that overexpression of sorcin under control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP7) in C57BL/6J mice, or whole body sorcin deletion in 129S1/SvImJ mice, improves or impairs insulin secretion and pancreatic {beta}-cell function respectively. The mechanisms behind this beneficial role of sorcin in the pancreatic {beta}-cell might depend on protection against lipotoxic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through improved ER Ca2+ dynamics and activation of the Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Whether sorcin is also implicated in hypothalamic ER stress during the progression of obesity is unknown. This could potentially contribute to the diminished satiety typically observed in overweight individuals. Aim: To investigate a potential role of sorcin in hypothalamic ER stress, leptin resistance, hyperphagia and obesity. Methods: Whole-body sorcin null mice, backcrossed onto the C57BL/6J genetic background, were used. Body weight, food intake and EchoMRI body composition were measured in vivo whereas qRT-PCR analysis of sorcin and ER stress markers expression were performed on the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Leptin signalling through STAT3 phosphorylation was measured by Western blots on sorcin-null HEK293 cells, engineered by CRISPR/Cas9, and transfected with leptin receptor (LepRb). Results: Sorcin expression was not influenced in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus by diet-induced obesity. Whole-body sorcin ablation did not cause ARC ER stress nor changes in body weight, body composition or food intake in C57BL/6 male mice exposed to a high-fat, high-sugar diet. STAT3 phosphorylation (Y705) in response to leptin was not impaired in sorcin-null HEK293 cells. Conclusion: In our model, whole body sorcin ablation did not increase hypothalamic ER stress nor influenced food intake or body weight.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of persistent functional brain impairment and results in a robust, but poorly understood, neuroinflammatory response that contributes to the long-term pathology. Here, we used single-nuclei RNA-sequencing to study transcriptomic changes in different cell populations from human brain tissue obtained acutely after severe, life-threatening TBI. We found a unique transcriptional response in several cell types, including the activation of an interferon response in oligodendrocytes coupled with the transcriptional activation of MHC-class I and class II related genes. Thus, oligodendrocytes undergo a transformation to an immune-like cell state immediately after TBI, indicating an important role for these cells in the initiation of neuroinflammation. Notably, the activation of immune-related genes correlated with the expression of endogenous retroviruses in oligodendrocytes, linking these ancient viral sequences to neuroinflammation. In summary, this work provides a unique insight into the initiating events of the neuroinflammatory response in TBI, which has new therapeutic implications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The thermoception task: a thermal-imaging based procedure for measuring awareness of changes in peripheral body temperature</a></h4>

              
                Although thermal body signals provide crucial information about the state of an organism, and changes in body temperature may be a sign of affective states (e.g., stress, pain, sexual arousal), research on thermal awareness is limited. Here we developed a task measuring awareness of changes in peripheral body temperature (thermal interoception) and compared it to the classical heartbeat counting task (cardiac interoception). With an infrared lightbulb we delivered stimuli of different temperature intensities to the right hand of 31 healthy participants. Thermal interoceptive accuracy, i.e., the difference between participants' real and perceived change in hand temperature, showed good inter-individual variability. We found that thermal interoception did not correlate with (and was generally higher than) cardiac interoception, suggesting that different interceptive channels provide separate contributions to awareness of bodily states. Moreover, the results hint at the great salience of thermal signals and the need for thermoregulation in day-to-day life. Finally, thermal interoceptive accuracy was associated with self-reported awareness of body temperature changes, and with the ability to regulate distress by focusing on body sensations. Our task has the potential to significantly increase current knowledge about the role of interoception in cognition and behavior, particularly in social and emotional contexts.

                The spinal cord has poor ability to regenerate after injury, which may be due to cell loss, cyst formation, inflammation, and scarring. A promising approach to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) is the use of biomaterials. We have developed a novel hydrogel scaffold fabricated from oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) as a 0.08 mm thick sheet containing polymer ridges and a cell-attractive surface chemistry on the other side. When the cells are cultured on OPF with the chemical patterning, the cells attach, align, and deposit ECM along the direction of the pattern. Animals implanted with the rolled scaffold sheets had greater hindlimb recovery compared to the multichannel scaffold control, likely due to the greater number of axons growing across. Inflammation, scarring, and ECM deposits were equal across conditions. Overall, the results suggest that the scaffold sheets promote axon outgrowth that can be guided across the scaffold, thereby promoting hindlimb recovery.

                As the demand for prosthetic limbs with reliable and multi-functional control increases, recent advances in myoelectric pattern recognition and implanted sensors have proven considerably advantageous. Additionally, sensory feedback from the prosthesis can be achieved via stimulation of the residual nerves, enabling closed-loop control over the prosthesis. However, this stimulation can cause interfering artifacts in the electromyographic (EMG) signals which deteriorate the reliability and function of the prosthesis. Here, we implement two real-time stimulation artifact removal algorithms, Template Subtraction and {varepsilon}-Normalized Least Mean Squares, and investigate their performance in offline and real-time myoelectric pattern recognition in two transhumeral amputees implanted with nerve cuff and EMG electrodes. We show that both algorithms are capable of significantly improving signal-to-noise ratio and offline pattern recognition accuracy of artifact-corrupted EMG signals. Furthermore, both algorithms improved real-time decoding of motor intention during active neurostimulation. Although these outcomes are dependent on the user-specific sensor locations and neurostimulation settings, they nonetheless represent progress towards bi-directional neuromusculoskeletal prostheses capable of multifunction control and simultaneous sensory feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolution of predictive memory in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The brain organizes experiences into memories that can be used to guide future behavior. Hippocampal CA1 population activity may reflect the retrieval of predictive models that contain information about future events, but little is known about how these kinds of memories develop with experience. We trained mice on a series of tone discrimination problems with or without a common statistical structure to observe how memories are formed and updated during learning. Mice that learned structured problems integrated their experiences into a predictive model that contained the solutions to upcoming novel problems. Retrieving the model during learning improved discrimination accuracy and facilitated learning by decreasing the amount of new information that needed to be acquired. Using calcium imaging to track the activity of thousands of CA1 neurons during learning on this task, we observed the emergence of a persistent hippocampal ensemble at the same time that mice formed a predictive model of their environment. This ensemble was reactivated during training and incorporated new neuronal activity patterns from each training problem. Interestingly, the degree to which mice reactivated the ensemble was related to how well their model predicted the content of the current problem, ensuring that the model was only updated with congruent information. In contrast, mice trained on unstructured problems did not form a predictive model or engage a persistent ensemble. These results show how hippocampal activity supports building predictive models by organizing newly learned information according to its congruence with existing memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semantic-Specific and Domain-General Mechanisms for Integration and Update of Contextual Information</a></h4>

              
                Recent research has highlighted the importance of domain-general processes and brain regions for language and semantic cognition. Yet, this has been mainly observed in executively demanding tasks, leaving open the question of the contribution of domain-general processes to natural language and semantic cognition. Using fMRI, we investigated whether neural processes reflecting context integration and context update - two key aspects of naturalistic language and semantic processing - are domain-specific versus domain-general. Thus, we compared neural responses during integration of contextual information across semantic and non-semantic tasks. Whole-brain results revealed both shared (left posterior-dorsal inferior frontal gyrus, left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, and left dorsal angular gyrus/intraparietal sulcus) and distinct (left anterior-ventral inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior ventral angular gyrus, left posterior middle temporal gyrus for semantic control only) regions involved in context integration and update. Furthermore, data-driven functional connectivity analysis clustered domain-specific versus domain-general brain regions into distinct but interacting functional neural networks. These results provide a first characterisation of the neural processes required for context-dependent integration during language processing along the domain-specificity dimension, and at the same time, they bring new insights on the role of left posterior lateral temporal cortex and left angular gyrus for semantic cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysregulation of The Chromatin Environment Leads to Differential Alternative Splicing as A Mechanism Of Disease In a Human Model of Autism Spectrum Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 44 children. Chromatin regulatory proteins are overrepresented among genes that contain high risk variants in ASD. Disruption of the chromatin environment leads to widespread dysregulation of gene expression, which is traditionally thought as a mechanism of disease pathogenesis associated with ASD. Alternatively, alterations in chromatin dynamics could also lead to dysregulation of alternative splicing, which is understudied as a mechanism of ASD pathogenesis. The anticonvulsant valproic acid (VPA) is a well-known environmental risk factor for ASD that acts as a class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying defects in human neuronal development associated with exposure to VPA are understudied. To dissect how VPA exposure and subsequent chromatin hyperacetylation influence molecular signatures involved in ASD pathogenesis, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in human cortical neurons that were treated with VPA. We observed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched for mRNA splicing, mRNA processing, histone modification, and metabolism related gene sets. Furthermore, we observed widespread increase in the number and the type of alternative splicing events. Analysis of differential transcript usage (DTU) showed that exposure to VPA induces extensive alterations in transcript isoform usage across neurodevelopmentally important genes. Finally, we find that DEGs and genes that display DTU overlap with known ASD-risk genes. Together, these findings suggest that, in addition to differential gene expression, changes in alternative splicing correlated with alterations in the chromatin environment could act as an additional mechanism of disease in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">When Abstract Becomes Concrete: Naturalistic Encoding of Concepts in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Humans learn and process language in complex and dynamic contexts, involving simultaneous processing of connected speech, faces, bodies, objects and including, at times, touch, odor, and taste. How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real world processing is unclear. We investigated the representational structure of conceptual encoding in a naturalistic setting and asked to what extent brain responses dynamically depend on context. Across different contexts, we find evidence that concrete and abstract concepts encode experience-based information in roughly differential sets of brain regions. However, these differences reduce when contextual variance is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract concepts becomes more concrete-like when they are processed in context highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when context is unrelated to a given concrete concept, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. Our results suggest that while concepts encode habitual experiences on average, the underlying neurobiological organization is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information at the time of processing.

                Humans can adapt when complex patterns unfold at a faster or slower pace, for instance when remembering a grocery list that is dictated at an increasingly fast pace. Integrating information over such timescales crucially depends on working memory, but although state-of-the-art theories assume that working memory capacity can be flexibly adapted, these theories assume that encoding speed cannot. In a series of experiments, we found that humans encoded at a faster rate when they were adapted to overall and recent rate of incoming information. Interestingly, our participants were unable to use explicit cues to speed up encoding, even though these cues were more informative than statistical information. Our findings suggest that adaptive tuning of encoding speed in working memory is a fundamental but largely implicit mechanism underlying our ability to keep up with the pace of our surroundings.

	<p>The technology for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has significantly changed over the years, with important improvements in the signal generators, the coils, the positioning systems, and the software for modeling, optimization, and therapy planning. In this systematic literature review (SLR), the evolution of each component of TMS technology is presented and analyzed to assess the limitations to overcome. This SLR was carried out following the PRISMA 2020 statement. Published articles of TMS were searched for in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, IEEE). Conference papers and other reviews were excluded. Records were filtered using terms about TMS technology with a semi-automatic software; articles that did not present new technology developments were excluded manually. After this screening, 101 records were included, with 19 articles proposing new stimulator designs (18.8%), 46 presenting or adapting coils (45.5%), 18 proposing systems for coil placement (17.8%), and 43 implementing algorithms for coil optimization (42.6%). The articles were blindly classified by the authors to reduce the risk of bias. However, our results could have been influenced by our research interests, which would affect conclusions for applications in psychiatric and neurological diseases. Our analysis indicates that more emphasis should be placed on optimizing the current technology with a special focus on the experimental validation of models. With this review, we expect to establish the base for future TMS technological developments.</p>

	<p>Background and Aims. Most research on Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) focuses on describing symptoms and movement characteristics. Studies rarely focus on the early detection of PD and the search for suitable markers of a prodromal stage. Early detection is important, so treatments that may potentially change the course of the disease can be attempted early on. While gait disturbances are less pronounced in the early stages of the disease, the prevalence, and severity increase with disease progression. Therefore, postural instability and gait difficulties could be identified as sensitive biomarkers. The aim was to evaluate the discriminatory power of the Trail-Walking Test (TWT; Schott, 2015) as a potential diagnostic instrument to improve the predictive power of the clinical evaluation concerning the severity of the disease and record the different aspects of walking. Methods. A total of 20 older healthy (M = 72.4 years, SD = 5.53) adults and 43 older adults with PD and the motor phenotypes postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD; M = 69.7 years, SD = 8.68) and tremor dominant (TD; M = 68.2 years, SD = 8.94) participated in the study. The participants performed a motor-cognitive dual task (DT) of increasing cognitive difficulty in which they had to walk a given path (condition 1), walk to numbers in ascending order (condition 2), and walk to numbers and letters alternately and in ascending order (condition 3). Results. With an increase in the cognitive load, the time to complete the tasks (seconds) became longer in all groups, F(1.23, 73.5) = 121, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;#627;2p = 0.670. PIGD showed the longest times in all conditions of the TWT, F(2, 60) = 8.15, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, &amp;amp;#627;2p = 0.214. Mutual interferences in the cognitive and motor domain can be observed. However, clear group-specific patterns cannot be identified. A differentiation between the motor phenotypes of PD is especially feasible with the purely motor condition (TWT-M; AUC = 0.685, p = 0.44). Conclusions. PD patients with PIGD must be identified by valid, well-evaluated clinical tests that allow for a precise assessment of the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s individual fall risk, the severity of the disease, and the prognosis of progression. The TWT covers various aspects of mobility, examines the relationship between cognitive functions and walking, and enables differentiation of the motor phenotypes of PD.</p>

	<p>Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the only etiological technique for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Whilst there is a consensus MVD is likely effective regardless of age, the elderly population is thought to be more prone to have a higher rate of surgical complication, morbidity, and mortality. The main objective of our single-center, retrospective study was to analyze the surgical and clinical outcomes of MVD in TN elderly patients. From a surgical series of patients with TN who had undergone MVD from April 2018 to April 2022, 76 patients who matched the inclusion criteria were divided into two groups: twenty-five (32.9%) patients were older than 65 years and included in the elderly group, while the remaining fifty-one (61.1%) patients were below 65 years included in the non-elderly one. There were no differences between the groups in terms of acute pain relief (APR), Barrow Neurological Index (BNI) at follow-up, complications, and recurrence rate. In multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression analysis) the presence of an offending artery with nerve root distortion/indentation emerged as the only independent prognostic factor for pain-free survival (p = 0.0001). Our data endorse MVD as a safe and effective surgical procedure also for elderly patients with TN.</p>

	<p>The current study investigated the bottom-up experiential emotion regulation in comparison to the cognitiveve top down-approach of cognitive defusion. Rooted in an experiential- and client-centered psychotherapeutic approach, experiential emotion regulation involves an active, non-intervening, accepting, open and welcoming approach towards the bodily felt affective experience in a welcoming, compassionate way, expressed in &amp;amp;lsquo;experiential awareness&amp;amp;rsquo; in a first phase, and its verbalization or &amp;amp;lsquo;experiential expression&amp;amp;rsquo; in a second phase. Defusion refers to the ability to observe one&amp;amp;rsquo;s thoughts and feelings in a detached manner. Nineteen healthy participants completed an emotion regulation task during fMRI scanning by processing highly arousing negative events by images. Both experiential emotion regulation and cognitive defusion resulted in higher negative emotion compared to a &amp;amp;lsquo;watch&amp;amp;rsquo; control condition. On the neurophysiological level, experiential emotion regulation recruited brain areas that regulate attention towards affective- and somatosensorial experience such as the anterior cingulate cortex, the paracingulate gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the prefrontal pole, areas underlying multisensory information integration (e.g., angular gyrus), and linking body states to emotion recognition and awareness (e.g., postcentral gyrus). Experiential emotion regulation, relative to the control condition, also resulted in a higher interaction between the anterior insular cortex and left amygdala while participants experienced less negative emotion. Cognitive defusion decreased activation in the subcortical areas such as the brainstem, the thalamus, the amygdala, and the hippocampus. In contrast to cognitive defusion, experiential emotion regulation relative to demonstrated greater activation in the left angular gyrus, indicating more multisensory information integration. These findings provide insight into different and specific neural networks underlying psychotherapy-based experiential emotion regulation and cognitive defusion.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study was designed to gain insights regarding patterns of social representations (values, ideas, beliefs) of tinnitus and their relation to demographic and clinical factors. Method: A cross-sectional survey design was used including 399 adults seeking help and reporting interest in internet-based cognitive behavior therapy for tinnitus. Data were collected using a free association task and analysis used qualitative (content analysis) and quantitative (cluster analysis and chi-square analysis) using the Iramuteq software. Results: The social representations identified the negative impact of tinnitus and included the way it sounded (descriptions of the way tinnitus sounds (18%), annoyance (13.5%), and persistence (8%)). Four clusters were identified representing four levels of tinnitus severity, namely debilitating tinnitus (24%), distressing tinnitus (10%), annoying tinnitus (46%), and accepting tinnitus (20%). Cluster identity was associated with demographic and clinical variables. Discussion: The identified clusters represented tinnitus severity experience in four stages, ranging from debilitating tinnitus to acceptance of tinnitus. These findings are important for clinical practice where tinnitus descriptions can indicate the stage of the tinnitus experience and which intervention pathway may be most appropriate.</p>

	<p>Several harmonization techniques have recently been proposed for connectomics/networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) acquired at multiple sites. These techniques have the objective of mitigating site-specific biases that complicate its subsequent analysis and, therefore, compromise the quality of the results when these images are analyzed together. Thus, harmonization is indispensable when large cohorts are required in which the data obtained must be independent of the particular condition of each resonator, its make and model, its calibration, and other features or artifacts that may affect the significance of the acquisition. To date, no assessment of the actual efficacy of these harmonization techniques has been proposed. In this work, we apply recently introduced Information Theory tools to analyze the effectiveness of these techniques, developing a methodology that allows us to compare different harmonization models. We demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology by applying it to some of the most widespread harmonization frameworks and datasets. As a result, we are able to show that some of these techniques are indeed ineffective since the acquisition site can still be determined from the fMRI data after the processing.</p>

	<p>Background: It is well-established that environmental noise can disrupt sleep, and cause a mismatch between subjective and objective sleep, which is known as &amp;amp;ldquo;sleep misperception&amp;amp;rdquo;. Naturalistic studies indicate that pre-sleep cognitive arousal and sleep misperception are associated in the context of noise. However, it is not known if this is the case when ecologically valid noises are specifically played during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which is susceptible to noise-related disruption. The present study evaluated if pre-sleep cognitive arousal was associated with sleep misperception in healthy normal sleepers, when unexpected ecologically valid common nocturnal noises were played during NREM sleep. Methods: Eighteen healthy sleepers (Mage = 23.37 years, SDage = 3.21 years) participated. Sleep was measured objectively on three consecutive nights using polysomnography, in a sleep laboratory environment, and subjectively, through participant estimates of total sleep time (TST). Night 1 was a baseline night where no noises were played. On Night 2, noises, which were chosen to be representative of habitual nocturnal noises heard in home environments, were played to participants via in-ear headphones after 5 min of objective sleep. Results: Unexpectedly, habitual pre-sleep cognitive arousal was not associated with subjective&amp;amp;ndash;objective TST discrepancy on Night 2. Conclusions: These results suggest that in healthy sleepers, when ecologically valid noises are played unexpectedly during NREM sleep in an unfamiliar sleep laboratory environment the subjective experience of sleep is not associated with pre-sleep cognitive arousal, or negatively impacted by noise exposure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Lateralization of Autonomic Output in Response to Limb-Specific Threat</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In times of stress or danger, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) signals the fight or flight response. A canonical function of ANS activity is to globally mobilize metabolic resources, preparing the organism to respond to threat. Yet a body of research has demonstrated that, rather than displaying a homogenous pattern across the body, autonomic responses to arousing events, as measured through changes in electrodermal activity (EDA), can differ between right and left body locations. Surprisingly, an attempt to identify a function of ANS asymmetry consistent with its metabolic role has not been investigated. In the current study, we investigated whether asymmetric autonomic responses could be induced through limb-specific aversive stimulation. Participants were given mild electric stimulation to either the left or right arm while EDA was monitored bilaterally. In a group-level analyses, an ipsilateral EDA response bias was observed, with increased EDA response in the hand adjacent to the stimulation. This effect was observable in ~50% of individual participants. These results demonstrate that autonomic output is more complex than canonical interpretations suggest. We suggest that, in stressful situations, autonomic outputs can prepare either the whole-body fight or flight response, or a simply a limb-localized flick, which can effectively neutralize the threat while minimizing global resource consumption. These findings are consistent with recent theories proposing evolutionary leveraging of neural structures organized to mediate sensory responses for processing of cognitive emotional cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hierarchical Individual Naturalistic Functional Brain Networks with Group Consistency Uncovered by a Two-Stage NAS-Volumetric Sparse DBN Framework</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The functional magnetic resonance imaging under naturalistic paradigm (NfMRI) showed great advantages in identifying complex and interactive functional brain networks (FBNs) because of its dynamics and multimodal information. In recent years, various deep learning models, such as deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE), deep belief network (DBN), and volumetric sparse DBN (vsDBN), can obtain hierarchical FBNs and temporal features from fMRI data. Among them, the vsDBN model revealed a good capability in identifying hierarchical FBNs by modeling fMRI volume images. However, because of the high dimensionality of fMRI volumes and the diverse training parameters of deep learning methods, especially the network architecture that is the most critical parameter for uncovering the hierarchical organization of human brain function, researchers still face challenges in designing an appropriate deep learning framework with automatic network architecture optimization to model volumetric NfMRI. In addition, most of the existing deep learning models ignore the group-wise consistency and intersubject variation properties embedded in NfMRI volumes. To solve these problems, we proposed a two-stage neural architecture search (NAS) and vsDBN model (two-stage NAS-vsDBN model) to identify the hierarchical human brain spatiotemporal features possessing both group consistency and individual uniqueness under naturalistic condition. Moreover, our model defined reliable network structure for modeling volumetric NfMRI data via NAS framework, and the group-level and individual-level FBNs and associated temporal features exhibited great consistency. In general, our method well identified the hierarchical temporal and spatial features of the brain function and revealed the crucial properties of neural processes under natural viewing condition.</p>

                Background: Medical students` engagement in research activities continues to be below the expectation. In this study we aimed to investigate students` views about research, and to identify the barriers preventing them from participation in research projects. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Qassim University. A total of 230 students were included. The perceptions of students were assessed using a 16-item questionnaire. The mean scores were compared between students using Mann-Whitney test .Factors associated with students` perception of research barriers were analyzed using four separate logistic regression models. Results: The overall response rate was 89.4%. The results indicate that the students generally possess a moderately positive attitude towards research with a mean score of 14.8±2.7 (range: 5-25). A substantial number of participants reported their willingness to take part in any research-related task (77.0%). However, the participants highly agreed that lack of time (70.4%), lack of supervision and guidance (72.6%), lack of research training and support (73.9%), and lack of research exposure and opportunities (75.2%) were major barriers to their participation in research .We found that students having lower CGPA ranks are almost three times more likely to indicate lack of time as a challenge (AOR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.09,7.94; p.value=0.033). Overall, female students were more likely to report concerns about research training and availability of research opportunities, while male students were more likely to indicate lack of time and lack of supervision as research barriers. Conclusions: The barriers addressed in the current study —both discretely and cumulatively—are highly demotivating for students, and negatively affect their participation in research. Efforts should be invested to shift the focus from providing superficial research exposure to incorporating more in-depth and effective research training for undergraduate students

                Background: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and its associated factors among people living with HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh.   Methods: This cross-sectional study, which took place in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from July to December 2020, included 338 HIV-positive people. The method used was a simple random sampling technique. The Beck Depression Inventory assessed depression in HIV-positive people (BDI).    Results: More than 62 percent of the 338 people surveyed had severe depression, 30.5 percent had moderate depression, 5.6 percent had mild depression, and 1.8 percent had no depression at all. Age, being a man, being married, and having a low monthly income were all significant predictors of depression.  Conclusions: This study found that depressive symptoms are highly prevalent among HIV-positive patients in Bangladesh. The authors recommend that health care providers address depressive disorders for people with HIV/ AIDS comprehensively.

                The last 50 years have witnessed extraordinary discoveries in the field of circadian rhythms. However, there are still several mysteries that remain. One of these chronobiological mysteries is the circadian rhythm that is revealed by administration of stimulant drugs to rodents. Herein we describe the discovery of this circadian rhythm and its underlying oscillator, which is frequently called the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator, or MASCO. This oscillator is distinct from canonical circadian oscillators because it controls robust activity rhythms independently of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and canonical circadian genes are not essential for its timekeeping. We discuss these fundamental properties of MASCO and synthesize studies of strain, sex, and circadian gene mutations on MASCO. The anatomical loci of MASCO are not known, so it has not been possible thus far to discover its novel molecular timekeeping mechanism or its functional significance. However, studies in mutant mice suggest that genetic approaches can be used to identify the neural network involved in the rhythm generation of MASCO. We also discuss parallels between human and rodent studies that support our working hypothesis that a function of MASCO may be to regulate sleep-wake cycles.

                Background: Dictyostelium discoideum is a ~10 µm diameter unicellular eukaryote that lives on soil surfaces. When starved, D. discoideum cells aggregate into streams of cells in a process called chemotaxis. In this report, we studied D. discoideum cells during chemotaxis using 3D - mass spectrometry imaging (3D-MSI). Methods: The 3D-MSI consisted of the sequential generation of 2D molecular maps using burst alignment coupled to delayed extraction time-of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) combined with a soft sputtering beam to access the different layers. Results: Molecular maps with sub-cellular high spatial resolution (~300 nm) indicated the presence of ions at m/z = 221 and 236 at the front and sides, but reduced levels at the back, of cells moving toward of aggregation streams. The 3D-MSI also detected an ion at m/z = 240 at the edges and back, but reduced levels at the front, of aggregating cells. Other ions showed an even distribution across the cells. Conclusions: Together, these results demonstrate the utility of sub-micron MSI to study eukaryotic chemotaxis.

                Antecedentes La malaria urbana es un problema de salud pública en Colombia y aún existe desconocimiento sobre sus características epidemiológicas, las cuales son clave para la implementación de medidas de control. La presencia de casos de malaria urbana y el diagnóstico de la enfermedad son algunos de los desafíos que enfrentan los programas de eliminación de la malaria. El objetivo de esta investigación fue estimar la prevalencia de malaria, explorar factores asociados y detectar genes pfhrp 2/3 , en la zona urbana de Tumaco entre julio y diciembre de 2019. Métodos Se realizó un estudio de prevalencia utilizando un muestreo probabilístico aleatorio estratificado. Se administraron encuestas estructuradas y se tomaron muestras de sangre y se examinaron mediante microscopía óptica, pruebas de diagnóstico rápido (RDT) y reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR). Se utilizó un modelo de regresión logística para explorar los factores asociados. Resultados Se encuestó a 1.504 personas que vivían en 526 hogares. La prevalencia global fue del 2,97% (IC 95%: 2,1 - 4,3%). Fue mayor en varones, en el grupo de edad de 10 a 19 años y en casos asintomáticos. La prevalencia de la amplificación de pfhrp2 fue del 2,16 % (IC del 95 %: 1,6 - 2,9 %). Los hogares con tres o más personas tenían un mayor riesgo de infección por paludismo (odds ratio ajustado [ORa] 4,05; intervalo de confianza [IC] del 95%: 1,57-10,43). Todos los casos se debieron a P. falciparum. Conclusiones La prevalencia de malaria urbana fue baja. Las estrategias para eliminar la malaria en áreas urbanas deben ajustarse considerando el acceso al diagnóstico temprano, la infección asintomática y las PDR utilizadas para detectar la presencia del gen pfhrp2 .

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stability criteria for the consumption and exchange of essential resources</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Theo Gibbs, Yifan Zhang, Zachary R. Miller, James P. O’Dwyer</p>

Models of consumer effects on a shared resource environment have helped clarify how the interplay of consumer traits and resource supply impact stable coexistence. Recent models generalize this picture to include the exchange of resources alongside resource competition. These models exemplify the fact that although consumers shape the resource environment, the outcome of consumer interactions is context-dependent: such models can have either stable or unstable equilibria, depending on the resource supply. However, these recent models focus on a simplified version of microbial metabolism where the depletion of resources always leads to consumer growth. Here, we model an arbitrarily large system of consumers governed by Liebig’s law, where species require and deplete multiple resources, but each consumer’s growth rate is only limited by a single one of these resources. Resources that are taken up but not incorporated into new biomass are leaked back into the environment, possibly transformed by intracellular reactions, thereby tying the mismatch between depletion and growth to cross-feeding. For this set of dynamics, we show that feasible equilibria can be either stable or unstable, again depending on the resource environment. We identify special consumption and production networks which protect the community from instability when resources are scarce. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the qualitative stability patterns derived analytically apply to a broader class of network structures and resource inflow profiles, including cases where multiple species coexist on only one externally supplied resource. Our stability criteria bear some resemblance to classic stability results for pairwise interactions, but also demonstrate how environmental context can shape coexistence patterns when resource limitation and exchange are modeled directly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Investigating differential abundance methods in microbiome data: A benchmark study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marco Cappellato, Giacomo Baruzzo, Barbara Di Camillo</p>

The development of increasingly efficient and cost-effective high throughput DNA sequencing techniques has enhanced the possibility of studying complex microbial systems. Recently, researchers have shown great interest in studying the microorganisms that characterise different ecological niches. Differential abundance analysis aims to find the differences in the abundance of each taxa between two classes of subjects or samples, assigning a significance value to each comparison. Several bioinformatic methods have been specifically developed, taking into account the challenges of microbiome data, such as sparsity, the different sequencing depth constraint between samples and compositionality. Differential abundance analysis has led to important conclusions in different fields, from health to the environment. However, the lack of a known biological truth makes it difficult to validate the results obtained. In this work we exploit metaSPARSim, a microbial sequencing count data simulator, to simulate data with differential abundance features between experimental groups. We perform a complete comparison of recently developed and established methods on a common benchmark with great effort to the reliability of both the simulated scenarios and the evaluation metrics. The performance overview includes the investigation of numerous scenarios, studying the effect on methods’ results on the main covariates such as sample size, percentage of differentially abundant features, sequencing depth, feature variability, normalisation approach and ecological niches. Mainly, we find that methods show a good control of the type I error and, generally, also of the false discovery rate at high sample size, while recall seem to depend on the dataset and sample size.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constructing functional models from biophysically-detailed neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Duggins, Chris Eliasmith</p>

Improving biological plausibility and functional capacity are two important goals for brain models that connect low-level neural details to high-level behavioral phenomena. We develop a method called “oracle-supervised Neural Engineering Framework” (osNEF) to train biologically-detailed spiking neural networks that realize a variety of cognitively-relevant dynamical systems. Specifically, we train networks to perform computations that are commonly found in cognitive systems (communication, multiplication, harmonic oscillation, and gated working memory) using four distinct neuron models (leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, Izhikevich neurons, 4-dimensional nonlinear point neurons, and 4-compartment, 6-ion-channel layer-V pyramidal cell reconstructions) connected with various synaptic models (current-based synapses, conductance-based synapses, and voltage-gated synapses). We show that osNEF networks exhibit the target dynamics by accounting for nonlinearities present within the neuron models: performance is comparable across all four systems and all four neuron models, with variance proportional to task and neuron model complexity. We also apply osNEF to build a model of working memory that performs a delayed response task using a combination of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons connected with NMDA and GABA synapses. The baseline performance and forgetting rate of the model are consistent with animal data from delayed match-to-sample tasks (DMTST): we observe a baseline performance of 95% and exponential forgetting with time constant <i>τ</i> = 8.5s, while a recent meta-analysis of DMTST performance across species observed baseline performances of 58 − 99% and exponential forgetting with time constants of <i>τ</i> = 2.4 − 71s. These results demonstrate that osNEF can train functional brain models using biologically-detailed components and open new avenues for investigating the relationship between biophysical mechanisms and functional capabilities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Architect: A tool for aiding the reconstruction of high-quality metabolic models through improved enzyme annotation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nirvana Nursimulu, Alan M. Moses, John Parkinson</p>

Constraint-based modeling is a powerful framework for studying cellular metabolism, with applications ranging from predicting growth rates and optimizing production of high value metabolites to identifying enzymes in pathogens that may be targeted for therapeutic interventions. Results from modeling experiments can be affected at least in part by the quality of the metabolic models used. Reconstructing a metabolic network manually can produce a high-quality metabolic model but is a time-consuming task. At the same time, current methods for automating the process typically transfer metabolic function based on sequence similarity, a process known to produce many false positives. We created Architect, a pipeline for automatic metabolic model reconstruction from protein sequences. First, it performs enzyme annotation through an ensemble approach, whereby a likelihood score is computed for an EC prediction based on predictions from existing tools; for this step, our method shows both increased precision and recall compared to individual tools. Next, Architect uses these annotations to construct a high-quality metabolic network which is then gap-filled based on likelihood scores from the ensemble approach. The resulting metabolic model is output in SBML format, suitable for constraints-based analyses. Through comparisons of enzyme annotations and curated metabolic models, we demonstrate improved performance of Architect over other state-of-the-art tools, notably with higher precision and recall on the eukaryote <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> and when compared to UniProt annotations in two bacterial species. Code for Architect is available at https://github.com/ParkinsonLab/Architect. For ease-of-use, Architect can be readily set up and utilized using its Docker image, maintained on Docker Hub.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparing and linking machine learning and semi-mechanistic models for the predictability of endemic measles dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Max S. Y. Lau, Alex Becker, Wyatt Madden, Lance A. Waller, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Bryan T. Grenfell</p>

Measles is one the best-documented and most-mechanistically-studied non-linear infectious disease dynamical systems. However, systematic investigation into the comparative performance of traditional mechanistic models and machine learning approaches in forecasting the transmission dynamics of this pathogen are still rare. Here, we compare one of the most widely used semi-mechanistic models for measles (TSIR) with a commonly used machine learning approach (LASSO), comparing performance and limits in predicting short to long term outbreak trajectories and seasonality for both regular and less regular measles outbreaks in England and Wales (E&W) and the United States. First, our results indicate that the proposed LASSO model can efficiently use data from multiple major cities and achieve similar short-to-medium term forecasting performance to semi-mechanistic models for E&W epidemics. Second, interestingly, the LASSO model also captures annual to biennial bifurcation of measles epidemics in E&W caused by susceptible response to the late 1940s baby boom. LASSO may also outperform TSIR for predicting less-regular dynamics such as those observed in major cities in US between 1932–45. Although both approaches capture short-term forecasts, accuracy suffers for both methods as we attempt longer-term predictions in highly irregular, post-vaccination outbreaks in E&W. Finally, we illustrate that the LASSO model can both qualitatively and quantitatively reconstruct mechanistic assumptions, notably susceptible dynamics, in the TSIR model. Our results characterize the limits of predictability of infectious disease dynamics for strongly immunizing pathogens with both mechanistic and machine learning models, and identify connections between these two approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Connectivity concepts in neuronal network modeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Johanna Senk, Birgit Kriener, Mikael Djurfeldt, Nicole Voges, Han-Jia Jiang, Lisa Schüttler, Gabriele Gramelsberger, Markus Diesmann, Hans E. Plesser, Sacha J. van Albada</p>

Sustainable research on computational models of neuronal networks requires published models to be understandable, reproducible, and extendable. Missing details or ambiguities about mathematical concepts and assumptions, algorithmic implementations, or parameterizations hinder progress. Such flaws are unfortunately frequent and one reason is a lack of readily applicable standards and tools for model description. Our work aims to advance complete and concise descriptions of network connectivity but also to guide the implementation of connection routines in simulation software and neuromorphic hardware systems. We first review models made available by the computational neuroscience community in the repositories ModelDB and Open Source Brain, and investigate the corresponding connectivity structures and their descriptions in both manuscript and code. The review comprises the connectivity of networks with diverse levels of neuroanatomical detail and exposes how connectivity is abstracted in existing description languages and simulator interfaces. We find that a substantial proportion of the published descriptions of connectivity is ambiguous. Based on this review, we derive a set of connectivity concepts for deterministically and probabilistically connected networks and also address networks embedded in metric space. Beside these mathematical and textual guidelines, we propose a unified graphical notation for network diagrams to facilitate an intuitive understanding of network properties. Examples of representative network models demonstrate the practical use of the ideas. We hope that the proposed standardizations will contribute to unambiguous descriptions and reproducible implementations of neuronal network connectivity in computational neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Impact of gender on the formation and outcome of formal mentoring relationships in the life sciences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leah P. Schwartz, Jean F. Liénard, Stephen V. David</p>

Despite increasing representation in graduate training programs, a disproportionate number of women leave academic research without obtaining an independent position that enables them to train the next generation of academic researchers. To understand factors underlying this trend, we analyzed formal PhD and postdoctoral mentoring relationships in the life sciences during the years 2000 to 2020. Student and mentor gender are both associated with differences in rates of student’s continuation to positions that allow formal academic mentorship. Although trainees of women mentors are less likely to take on positions as academic mentors than trainees of men mentors, this effect is reduced substantially after controlling for several measurements of mentor status. Thus, the effect of mentor gender can be explained at least partially by gender disparities in social and financial resources available to mentors. Because trainees and mentors tend to be of the same gender, this association between mentor gender and academic continuation disproportionately impacts women trainees. On average, gender homophily in graduate training is unrelated to mentor status. A notable exception to this trend is the special case of scientists having been granted an outstanding distinction, evidenced by membership in the National Academy of Sciences, being a grantee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, or having been awarded the Nobel Prize. This group of mentors trains men graduate students at higher rates than their most successful colleagues. These results suggest that, in addition to other factors that limit career choices for women trainees, gender inequities in mentors’ access to resources and prestige contribute to women’s attrition from independent research positions.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Injury programs shape glioblastoma</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer in adults and is almost universally fatal due to its stark therapeutic resistance. During the past decade, although survival has not substantially improved, major advances have been made in our understanding of the underlying biology. It has become clear that these devastating tumors recapitulate features of neurodevelopmental hierarchies which are influenced by the microenvironment. Emerging evidence also highlights a prominent role for injury responses in steering cellular phenotypes and contributing to tumor heterogeneity.

                Infant animals spend the majority of each day asleep, but researchers are only beginning to delineate the contributions of sleep to sensory neurodevelopment. In this perspective, Blumberg et al. provide a conceptual framework to guide future progress.

                The medial entorhinal cortex supports not only the encoding of the position one occupies in space, but also that of object location in a given environment. Caputi et al. highlight the role of commissural input to the medial entorhinal cortex in the episodic memory retrieval of object location.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Low and high frequency intracranial neural signals match in the human associative cortex</a></h4>

              
                In vivo intracranial recordings of neural activity offer a unique opportunity to understand human brain function. Intracranial electrophysiological (iEEG) activity related to sensory, cognitive or motor events manifests mostly in two types of signals: event-related local field potentials in lower frequency bands (&lt;30 Hz, LF) and broadband activity in the higher end of the frequency spectrum (&gt;30 Hz, High frequency, HF). While most current studies rely exclusively on HF, thought to be more focal and closely related to spiking activity, the relationship between HF and LF signals is unclear, especially in human associative cortex. Here, we provide a large-scale in-depth investigation of the spatial and functional relationship between these 2 signals based on intracranial recordings from 121 individual brains (8000 recording sites). We measure category-selective responses to complex ecologically salient visual stimuli – human faces – across a wide cortical territory in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC), with a frequency-tagging method providing high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the same objective quantification of signal and noise for the two frequency ranges. While LF face-selective activity has higher SNR across the VOTC, leading to a larger number of significant electrode contacts especially in the anterior temporal lobe, LF and HF display highly similar spatial, functional, and timing properties. Specifically, and contrary to a widespread assumption, our results point to nearly identical spatial distribution and local spatial extent of LF and HF activity at equal SNR. These observations go a long way towards clarifying the relationship between the two main iEEG signals and reestablish the informative value of LF iEEG to understand human brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of pulmonary surfactant by the adhesion GPCR GPR116/ADGRF5 requires a tethered agonist-mediated activation mechanism</a></h4>

              
                The mechanistic details of the tethered agonist mode of activation for the adhesion GPCR ADGRF5/GPR116 has not been completely deciphered. We set out to investigate the physiologic importance of autocatalytic cleavage upstream of the agonistic peptide sequence, an event necessary for NTF displacement and subsequent receptor activation. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized tethered agonist-mediated activation of GPR116 <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. A knock-in mouse expressing a non-cleavable GPR116 mutant phenocopies the pulmonary phenotype of GPR116 knock-out mice, demonstrating that tethered agonist-mediated receptor activation is indispensable for function <i>in vivo</i>. Using site-directed mutagenesis and species swapping approaches we identified key conserved amino acids for GPR116 activation in the tethered agonist sequence and in extracellular loops 2/3 (ECL2/3). We further highlight residues in transmembrane7 (TM7) that mediate stronger signaling in mouse versus human GPR116 and recapitulate these findings in a model supporting tethered agonist:ECL2 interactions for GPR116 activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct regions of H. pylori's bactofilin CcmA regulate protein-protein interactions to control helical cell shape</a></h4>

              
                The helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells promotes robust stomach colonization, however, how the helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells is determined is unresolved. Previous work identified helical-cell-shape-promoting protein complexes containing a peptidoglycan-hydrolase (Csd1), a peptidoglycan precursor synthesis enzyme (MurF), a non-enzymatic homologue of Csd1 (Csd2), non-enzymatic transmembrane proteins (Csd5 and Csd7), and a bactofilin (CcmA). Bactofilins are highly conserved, spontaneously polymerizing cytoskeletal bacterial proteins. We sought to understand CcmA's function in generating the helical shape of <i>H. pylori</i> cells. Using CcmA deletion analysis, <i>in vitro</i> polymerization, and <i>in vivo</i> co-immunoprecipitation experiments we identified that the bactofilin domain and N-terminal region of CcmA are required for helical cell shape and the bactofilin domain of CcmA is sufficient for polymerization and interactions with Csd5 and Csd7. We also found that CcmA's N-terminal region inhibits interaction with Csd7. Deleting the N-terminal region of CcmA increases CcmA-Csd7 interactions and destabilizes the peptidoglycan-hydrolase Csd1. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that Csd5 recruits CcmA to the cell envelope and promotes CcmA enrichment at the major helical axis. Thus, CcmA helps organize cell-shape-determining proteins and peptidoglycan synthesis machinery to coordinate cell wall modification and synthesis, promoting the curvature required to build a helical cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cancer genome and tumor microenvironment: Reciprocal crosstalk shapes lung cancer plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Lung cancer classification and treatment has been revolutionized by improving our understanding of driver mutations and the introduction of tumor microenvironment (TME)-associated immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite the significant improvement of lung cancer patient survival in response to either oncogene-targeted therapy or anticancer immunotherapy, many patients show initial or acquired resistance to these new therapies. Recent advances in genome sequencing reveal that specific driver mutations favor the development of an immunosuppressive TME phenotype, which may result in unfavorable outcomes in lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapies. Clinical studies with follow-up after immunotherapy, assessing oncogenic driver mutations and the TME immune profile, not only reveal the underlying potential molecular mechanisms in the resistant lung cancer patients but also hold the key to better treatment choices and the future of personalized medicine. In this review, we discuss the crosstalk between cancer cell genomic features and the TME to reveal the impact of genetic alterations on the TME phenotype. We also provide insights into the regulatory role of cellular TME components in defining the genetic landscape of cancer cells during tumor development.
