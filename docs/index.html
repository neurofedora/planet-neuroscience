              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09672">Mechanoreceptive A$\beta$ primary afferents discriminate naturalistic social touch inputs at a functionally relevant time scale</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpersonal touch is an important channel of social emotional interaction. How these physical skin-to-skin touch expressions are processed in the peripheral nervous system is not well understood. From microneurography recordings in humans, we evaluated the capacity of six subtypes of cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents to differentiate human-delivered social touch expressions. Leveraging statistical and classification analyses, we found that single units of multiple mechanoreceptive A$\beta$ subtypes, especially slowly adapting type II (SA-II) and fast adapting hair follicle afferents (HFA), can reliably differentiate social touch expressions at accuracies similar to human recognition. We then identified the most informative firing patterns of SA-II and HFA afferents, which indicate that average durations of 3-4 s of firing provide sufficient discriminative information. Those two subtypes also exhibit robust tolerance to spike-timing shifts of up to 10-20 ms, varying with touch expressions due to their specific firing properties. Greater shifts in spike-timing, however, can change a firing pattern's envelope to resemble that of another expression and drastically compromise an afferent's discrimination capacity. Altogether, the findings indicate that SA-II and HFA afferents differentiate the skin contact of social touch at time scales relevant for such interactions, which are 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than those for non-social touch.

                arXiv:2503.09984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion regulation plays a crucial role in mental health, and difficulties in regulating emotions can contribute to psychological disorders. While reappraisal and suppression are well-studied strategies, the combined contributions of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) to these strategies remain unclear due to methodological limitations in previous studies. To address this, we applied a data fusion approach using Parallel Independent Component Analysis (Parallel ICA) to GM and WM MRI images from 165 individuals. Parallel ICA identified two networks associated with reappraisal usage. Network 1 included a large lateral and medial prefrontal cortical network, overlapping with the default mode network (DMN) and adjacent WM regions. Higher reappraisal frequency was associated with greater GM-WM density within this network, and this network was negatively correlated with perceived stress. Network 2 included the insula, precuneus, sub-gyral, and lingual gyri in its GM portion, showing a negative association with reappraisal usage. The WM portion, adjacent to regions of the central executive network (CEN), was positively associated with reappraisal usage. Regarding suppression, no significant network was associated with this strategy. This study provides new insights into individual differences in reappraisal use, showing a positive association between reappraisal frequency and increased gray and white matter concentration in a large frontal network, including regions of the frontal DMN and the CEN. Conversely, subcortical areas exhibited reduced gray and white concentration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09980">Thermodynamic Bound on Energy and Negentropy Costs of Inference in Deep Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.09980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental thermodynamic bound is derived for the energy cost of inference in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By applying Landauer's principle, we demonstrate that the linear operations in DNNs can, in principle, be performed reversibly, whereas the non-linear activation functions impose an unavoidable energy cost. The resulting theoretical lower bound on the inference energy is determined by the average number of neurons undergoing state transition for each inference. We also restate the thermodynamic bound in terms of negentropy, a metric which is more universal than energy for assessing thermodynamic cost of information processing. Concept of negentropy is further elaborated in the context of information processing in biological and engineered system as well as human intelligence. Our analysis provides insight into the physical limits of DNN efficiency and suggests potential directions for developing energy-efficient AI architectures that leverage reversible analog computing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10362">BioSerenity-E1: a self-supervised EEG model for medical applications</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as an essential diagnostic tool in neurology; however, its accurate manual interpretation is a time-intensive process that demands highly specialized expertise, which remains relatively scarce and not consistently accessible. To address these limitations, the implementation of automated pre-screening and analysis systems for EEG data holds considerable promise. Advances in self-supervised learning made it possible to pre-train complex deep learning architectures on large volumes of unlabeled EEG data to learn generalizable representations, that can later be used to enhance performance on multiple tasks while needing less downstream data. In the present paper, we introduce BioSerenity-E1, the first of a family of self-supervised foundation models for clinical EEG applications that combines spectral tokenization with masked prediction to achieve state-of-the-art performance across relevant diagnostic tasks. The two-phase self-supervised pretraining framework initially acquires compressed EEG representations via a transformer-based VQ-VAE architecture designed to reconstruct log-multitaper spectral projections, then implements extensive (70% block) masked token prediction to force the model to learn complex spatiotemporal dependencies in EEG signals. BioSerenity-E1 achieves strong performance across three clinical tasks, either in line or above state-of-the-art methods: seizure detection (AUROC = 0.926, Sensitivity = 0.909), normal/abnormal classification (AUPRC = 0.970 on proprietary data; 0.910 on TUH-Abnormal), and multiclass pathology differentiation on unbalanced data (Weighted F1 = 0.730). The utility of BioSerenity-E1 is further confirmed in low-data regimes scenarios, showing clear improvements in AUPRC (from +2% to 17%) when trained on less than 10% of the available data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10518">Why the Brain Cannot Be a Digital Computer: History-Dependence and the Computational Limits of Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel information-theoretic proof demonstrating that the human brain as currently understood cannot function as a classical digital computer. Through systematic quantification of distinguishable conscious states and their historical dependencies, we establish that the minimum information required to specify a conscious state exceeds the physical information capacity of the human brain by a significant factor. Our analysis calculates the bit-length requirements for representing consciously distinguishable sensory "stimulus frames" and demonstrates that consciousness exhibits mandatory temporal-historical dependencies that multiply these requirements beyond the brain's storage capabilities. This mathematical approach offers new insights into the fundamental limitations of computational models of consciousness and suggests that non-classical information processing mechanisms may be necessary to account for conscious experience.

Abstract: In this study, we examined whether a short-form AI literacy intervention could reduce the adoption of incorrect recommendations from large language models. High school seniors were randomly assigned to either a control or an intervention group, which received an educational text explaining ChatGPT's working mechanism, limitations, and proper use. Participants solved math puzzles with the help of ChatGPT's recommendations, which were incorrect in half of the cases. Results showed that students adopted incorrect suggestions 52.1% of the time, indicating widespread over-reliance. The educational intervention did not significantly reduce over-reliance. Instead, it led to an increase in ignoring ChatGPT's correct recommendations. We conclude that the usage of ChatGPT is associated with over-reliance and it is not trivial to increase AI literacy to counter over-reliance.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of open-sourced vision-language models (VLMs) has catalyzed a plethora of applications across diverse domains. Ensuring the transparency and interpretability of these models is critical for fostering trustworthy and responsible AI systems. In this study, our objective is to delve into the internals of VLMs to interpret the functions of individual neurons. We observe the activations of neurons with respects to the input visual tokens and text tokens, and reveal some interesting findings. Particularly, we found that there are neurons responsible for only visual or text information, or both, respectively, which we refer to them as visual neurons, text neurons, and multi-modal neurons, respectively. We build a framework that automates the explanation of neurons with the assistant of GPT-4o. Meanwhile, for visual neurons, we propose an activation simulator to assess the reliability of the explanations for visual neurons. System statistical analyses on top of one representative VLM of LLaVA, uncover the behaviors/characteristics of different categories of neurons.

                arXiv:2503.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising tool for event-based optical flow estimation tasks due to their ability to leverage spatio-temporal information and low-power capabilities. However, the performance of SNN models is often constrained, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel neural network architecture, ST-FlowNet, specifically tailored for optical flow estimation from event-based data. The ST-FlowNet architecture integrates ConvGRU modules to facilitate cross-modal feature augmentation and temporal alignment of the predicted optical flow, improving the network's ability to capture complex motion dynamics. Additionally, to overcome the challenges associated with training SNNs, we introduce a novel approach to derive SNN models from pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) through ANN-to-SNN conversion or our proposed BISNN method. Notably, the BISNN method alleviates the complexities involved in biological parameter selection, further enhancing the robustness of SNNs in optical flow estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark event-based datasets demonstrate that the SNN-based ST-FlowNet model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior performance in accurate optical flow estimation across a diverse range of dynamic visual scenes. Furthermore, the inherent energy efficiency of SNN models is highlighted, establishing a compelling advantage for their practical deployment. Overall, our work presents a novel framework for optical flow estimation using SNNs and event-based data, contributing to the advancement of neuromorphic vision applications.

Abstract: Human language and logic abilities are computationally quantified within the well-studied grammar-automata hierarchy. We identify three hierarchical tiers and two corresponding transitions and show their correspondence to specific abilities in transformer-based language models (LMs). These emergent abilities have often been described in terms of scaling; we show that it is the transition between tiers, rather than scaled size itself, that determines a system's capabilities. Specifically, humans effortlessly process language yet require critical training to perform arithmetic or logical reasoning tasks; and LMs possess language abilities absent from predecessor systems, yet still struggle with logical processing. We submit a novel benchmark of computational power, provide empirical evaluations of humans and fifteen LMs, and, most significantly, provide a theoretically grounded framework to promote careful thinking about these crucial topics. The resulting principled analyses provide explanatory accounts of the abilities and shortfalls of LMs, and suggest actionable insights into the expansion of their logic abilities.

                arXiv:2503.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in neuromorphic computing requires efficient implementation of standard computational problems, like adding numbers. Here we implement one sequential and two parallel binary adders in the Lava software framework, and deploy them to the neuromorphic chip Loihi 2. We describe the time complexity, neuron and synaptic resources, as well as constraints on the bit width of the numbers that can be added with the current implementations. Further, we measure the time required for the addition operation on-chip. Importantly, we encounter trade-offs in terms of time complexity and required chip resources for the three considered adders. While sequential adders have linear time complexity $\bf\mathcal{O}(n)$ and require a linearly increasing number of neurons and synapses with number of bits $n$, the parallel adders have constant time complexity $\bf\mathcal{O}(1)$ and also require a linearly increasing number of neurons, but nonlinearly increasing synaptic resources (scaling with $\bf n^2$ or $\bf n \sqrt{n}$). This trade-off between compute time and chip resources may inform decisions in application development, and the implementations we provide may serve as a building block for further progress towards efficient neuromorphic algorithms.

                arXiv:2503.09781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equality reasoning is ubiquitous and purely abstract: sameness or difference may be evaluated no matter the nature of the underlying objects. As a result, same-different tasks (SD) have been extensively studied as a starting point for understanding abstract reasoning in humans and across animal species. With the rise of neural networks (NN) that exhibit striking apparent proficiency for abstractions, equality reasoning in NNs has also gained interest. Yet despite extensive study, conclusions about equality reasoning vary widely and with little consensus. To clarify the underlying principles in learning SD, we develop a theory of equality reasoning in multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Following observations in comparative psychology, we propose a spectrum of behavior that ranges from conceptual to perceptual outcomes. Conceptual behavior is characterized by task-specific representations, efficient learning, and insensitivity to spurious perceptual details. Perceptual behavior is characterized by strong sensitivity to spurious perceptual details, accompanied by the need for exhaustive training to learn the task. We develop a mathematical theory to show that an MLP's behavior is driven by learning richness. Rich-regime MLPs exhibit conceptual behavior, whereas lazy-regime MLPs exhibit perceptual behavior. We validate our theoretical findings in vision SD experiments, showing that rich feature learning promotes success by encouraging hallmarks of conceptual behavior. Overall, our work identifies feature learning richness as a key parameter modulating equality reasoning, and suggests that equality reasoning in humans and animals may similarly depend on learning richness in neural circuits.

                arXiv:2503.10052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present a more energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by harnessing spatio-temporal dynamics and event-driven spikes. Effective utilization of temporal information is crucial for SNNs, leading to the exploration of attention mechanisms to enhance this capability. Conventional attention operations either apply identical operation or employ non-identical operations across target dimensions. We identify that these approaches provide distinct perspectives on temporal information. To leverage the strengths of both operations, we propose a novel Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention (DTA) mechanism that integrates both identical/non-identical attention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to concentrate on both the correlation and dependency of temporal-channel using both identical and non-identical attention operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the DTA mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k) and dynamic dataset (CIFAR10-DVS), elevating spike representation and capturing complex temporal-channel relationship. We open-source our code: https://github.com/MnJnKIM/DTA-SNN.

                arXiv:2503.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of learning based methods to vehicle routing problems has emerged as a pivotal area of research in combinatorial optimization. These problems are characterized by vast solution spaces and intricate constraints, making traditional approaches such as exact mathematical models or heuristic methods prone to high computational overhead or reliant on the design of complex heuristic operators to achieve optimal or near optimal solutions. Meanwhile, although some recent learning-based methods can produce good performance for VRP with straightforward constraint scenarios, they often fail to effectively handle hard constraints that are common in practice. This study introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines constraint-oriented hypergraphs with reinforcement learning to address vehicle routing problems. A central innovation of this work is the development of a constraint-oriented dynamic hyperedge reconstruction strategy within an encoder, which significantly enhances hypergraph representation learning. Additionally, the decoder leverages a double-pointer attention mechanism to iteratively generate solutions. The proposed model is trained by incorporating asynchronous parameter updates informed by hypergraph constraints and optimizing a dual loss function comprising constraint loss and policy gradient loss. The experiment results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach not only eliminates the need for sophisticated heuristic operators but also achieves substantial improvements in solution quality.

Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems address issues of accessibility and scalability of artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models, which are often represented by large language models. We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.

Abstract: Online reviews play a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions, especially in the context of e-commerce. However, the quality and reliability of these reviews can vary significantly. Some reviews contain misleading or unhelpful information, such as advertisements, fake content, or irrelevant details. These issues pose significant challenges for recommendation systems, which rely on user-generated reviews to provide personalized suggestions. This article introduces a recommendation system based on Passer Learning Optimization-enhanced Bi-LSTM classifier applicable to e-commerce recommendation systems with improved accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. It achieves as low as 1.24% MSE on the baby dataset. This lifts it as high as 88.58%. Besides, there is also robust performance of the system on digital music and patio lawn garden datasets at F1 of 88.46% and 92.51%, correspondingly. These results, made possible by advanced graph embedding for effective knowledge extraction and fine-tuning of classifier parameters, establish the suitability of the proposed model in various e-commerce environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04830">Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

Abstract: We introduce a biologically plausible RL framework for solving tasks in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The proposed algorithm combines three integral parts: (1) A Meta-RL architecture, resembling the mammalian basal ganglia; (2) A biologically plausible reinforcement learning algorithm, exploiting temporal difference learning and eligibility traces to train the policy and the value-function; (3) An online automatic differentiation algorithm for computing the gradients with respect to parameters of a shared recurrent network backbone. Our experimental results show that the method is capable of solving a diverse set of partially observable reinforcement learning tasks. The algorithm we call real-time recurrent reinforcement learning (RTRRL) serves as a model of learning in biological neural networks, mimicking reward pathways in the basal ganglia.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Low-level auditory processing difficulties have been previously reported in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and some studies showed the relationship between these difficulties in the primary auditory cortex and language impairment in ASD. However, there is still a limited number of studies that comprehensively assess (i) amplitudes, latencies, and sensory gating effects in all early components of auditory processing (M50–M100–M200 complex) at the source level in magnetoencephalography with their relation to structural anatomy (gray matter volume, thickness, gyrification) (ii) and the association between brain metrics and clinical phenotype in the same group of children. To address this question, we used a standard paired-clicks paradigm in magnetoencephalography and brain morphometry analysis in children with and without ASD (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><sub>ASD</sub> = 20, <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><sub>TD</sub> = 20). First, the results revealed a reduction of M200 and altered M200 sensory gating effect in the left auditory cortex in children with ASD. Second, these alterations were related to lower language comprehension skills and higher autistic symptom severity. Finally, altered MEG responses were associated with gray matter thickness reduction as well as abnormal gyrification in the primary auditory cortex in ASD.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Auditory selective spatial attention (ASSA) plays an important role in “cocktail party” scenes, but the effects of spatial separation between target and distractor sources and background noise on the associated brain responses have not been thoroughly investigated. This study utilized the multilayer time-varying brain network to reveal the effect patterns of different separation degrees and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels on brain functional connectivity during ASSA. Specifically, a multilayer time-varying brain network with six time-windows equally divided by each epoch was constructed to investigate the segregation and integration of brain functional connectivity. The results showed that the inter-layer connectivity strength was consistently lower than the intra-layer connectivity strength for various separation degrees and SNR levels. Moreover, the connectivity strength of the multilayer time-varying brain network increased with decreasing separation degrees and initially increased and subsequently decreased with decreasing SNR levels. The second time-window of the network showed the most significant variation under some conditions and was determined as the core layer. The topology within the core layer was mainly reflected in the connectivity between the frontal and parietal-occipital cortices. In conclusion, these results suggest that spatial separation and background noise significantly modulate brain functional connectivity during ASSA.</span>

	<p>Background: The beat-by-beat fluctuation of heart rate (HR) in its temporal sequence (HR dynamics) provides information on HR regulation by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and its dysregulation in pathological states. Commonly, linear analyses of HR and its variability (HRV) are used to draw conclusions about pathological states despite clear statistical and translational limitations. Objective: The main aim of this study was to compare linear and nonlinear HR measures, including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), based on ECG recordings by radiotelemetry in C57BL/6N mice to identify pathological HR dynamics. Methods: We investigated different behavioral and a wide range of pharmacological interventions which alter ANS regulation through various peripheral and/or central mechanisms including receptors implicated in psychiatric disorders. This spectrum of interventions served as a reference system for comparison of linear and nonlinear HR measures to identify pathological states. Results: Physiological HR dynamics constitute a self-similar, scale-invariant, fractal process with persistent intrinsic long-range correlations resulting in physiological DFA scaling coefficients of &amp;amp;alpha;~1. Strongly altered DFA scaling coefficients (&amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;ne; 1) indicate pathological states of HR dynamics as elicited by (1) parasympathetic blockade, (2) parasympathetic overactivation and (3) sympathetic overactivation but not inhibition. The DFA scaling coefficients are identical in mice and humans under physiological conditions with identical pathological states by defined pharmacological interventions. Conclusions: Here, we show the importance of tonic vagal function for physiological HR dynamics in mice, as reported in humans. Unlike linear measures, DFA provides an important translational measure that reliably identifies pathological HR dynamics based on altered ANS control by pharmacological interventions. Central ANS dysregulation represents a likely mechanism of increased cardiac mortality in psychiatric disorders.</p>

	<p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a group of conditions that arise early in development and are characterized by deficits in personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. These disorders frequently co-occur and include conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Mood disorders (MDs), such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, also pose significant global health challenges due to their high prevalence and substantial impact on quality of life. Emerging evidence highlights overlapping neurobiological mechanisms between NDDs and MDs, including shared genetic susceptibilities, neurotransmitter dysregulation (e.g., dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways), neuroinflammation, and hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. Environmental factors such as early-life adversity further exacerbate these vulnerabilities, contributing to the complexity of their clinical presentation and comorbidity. Functional neuroimaging studies reveal altered connectivity in brain regions critical for emotional regulation and executive function, such as the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, across these disorders. Despite these advances, integrative diagnostic frameworks and targeted therapeutic strategies remain underexplored, limiting effective intervention. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the shared neurobiological underpinnings of NDDs and MDs, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary research, including genetic, pharmacological, and psychological approaches, for unified diagnosis and treatment. Addressing these intersections can improve clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by these disorders.</p>

                Pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, often associated with metastatic spread at diagnosis. We report the case of a 61-year-old male with a history of renal stones who presented with a four-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and declining visual acuity in the right eye. Imaging revealed a left hilar tumor with carcinomatous consolidation, bilateral parenchymal nodules, and left pleural effusion. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed choroidal lesions in the right eye, confirmed by orbital MRI as a subretinal intraocular lesion. Biopsies confirmed pulmonary SCC. The patient received six cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy alongside choroidal radiotherapy. After four cycles, choroidal metastases regressed, and visual acuity improved. Post-treatment imaging showed complete resolution of the intraocular lesion and a 34% reduction in tumor burden per RECIST 1.1. This case underscores the efficacy of combined systemic and localized therapies in managing advanced metastatic pulmonary SCC.

                <p>Epilepsy, affecting millions globally, often leads to significant cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities, particularly in children. Anxiety and depression are particularly prevalent, with roughly a quarter of pediatric epilepsy patients having a comorbid diagnosis. Current treatments inadequately address these issues. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a melanocortin peptide, has shown promise in mitigating deficits after early-life seizures (ELS), potentially through mechanisms beyond its canonical action on the melanocortin 2 receptor. This study explores the hypothesis that recurrent ELS is associated with long-term anxiety and that treatment with ACTH can prevent this anxiety through a mechanism that involves the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the brain. Our findings reveal that ACTH ameliorates anxiety-like behavior associated with ELS, without altering seizure parameters, in wild-type but not in male and female MC4R knock-out mice. Our findings also show that knocking-in MC4R in either neurons or astrocytes was able to rescue the anxiety-like behavior after ACTH treatment. Furthermore, our results show that ACTH normalizes important astrocytic proteins like glial fibrillary acidic protein and aquaporin-4 after ELS. This suggests that ACTH's beneficial effects on anxiety are mediated through MC4R activation in both neuronal and astrocytic populations. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting MC4R as a treatment, highlighting its role in mitigating anxiety-like behaviors associated with ELS.</p>

                Background This study reviewed the environmental and economic impacts of urban development in mountainous areas, with special attention to the impacts on the livelihoods of people and biodiversity in Ghana. Forests in mountainous areas provide essential economic and ecosystem services ranging from food, medicinal plants, wood (for wood, construction, furniture, fuel for cooking and heating) and clean water. Economic benefits in the form of tourism are also important. The situation in Ghana is compared to global situations and trends. While few studies are conducted globally to protect mountain resources, in Ghana there is dearth of literature for this kind of study. Ironically, building on mountains is gradually becoming an acceptable practice in Ghana. Methods A descriptive design was adopted in this study which comprises monitoring and observing the rate of decline of forest resources within a specified period of time. The study also made use of mixed method approach which combined numerical data and textual information. Literature on the impacts of urban development on the livelihoods of mountain people and environment were reviewed. The general economy and environmental impact of mountainous infrastructure on mountain people were also reviewed. Results The study showed that fast urban development in mountainous areas has negative consequences for the livelihoods of forest dwellers, ecosystem services, and forest resources. Policies related to land use in mountainous areas were also reviewed, as well as the challenges faced by municipal assemblies’ planning departments. It was found that the work of municipal planning officials is influenced by political elites at the national level. Conclusions In order to discourage urban development on mountains, the planning department of municipal assemblies should be seen as autonomous, where independence should be given to the professionals involved.

                Background Radon gas, a decay product of radium, is a significant environmental health risk due to its radioactive properties. Understanding the radium content and radon exhalation rates in soil is crucial for evaluating potential radiological hazards and ensuring environmental safety. Methods Soil samples were collected from twelve different locations in Wukro, Tigray, representing various soil types. The sealed can technique, using LR-115 Type-II plastic track detectors, was employed to measure radium concentrations and radon exhalation rates over a four-month exposure period. Radon mass exhalation rates, surface exhalation rates, and radium concentrations were calculated, and the Alpha Index was also determined to assess radiological risk. Results and Discussion The radon mass exhalation rates ranged from 0.18 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1 to 0.82 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1, with a mean of 0.48 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1. Surface exhalation rates varied from 0.38 × 10−6Bq.m−2.d−1 to 1.72 × 10−6 Bq.m−2.d−1, averaging 1.02 × 10−6 Bq.m−2.d−1. Radium concentrations ranged from 0.33 to 1.47 Bq.kg−1, with an average of 0.87 Bq.kg−1. A significant positive correlation between radium content and radon exhalation rates was observed, indicating a direct relationship between these variables. Clay soils exhibited the highest radium concentrations, while sandy soils had the lowest. All measured values were below the safety limit of 370 Bq.kg−1 recommended by OECD and UNSCEAR, suggesting no significant radiological risk in the study area. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of monitoring natural radiation levels for environmental safety. The findings provide a baseline for future studies and emphasize the need for continuous assessment to detect any long-term changes in soil radioactivity.

                The article introduces the concept of ‘intellectual neighbourhood,’ a historical-philosophical framework emphasising the collaborative nature of knowledge production across time in Eurasia, where respect for diverse ideas flourished. The study traces the contributions of Ali Qushji and his followers, illustrating how their works emerged from this interconnected intellectual milieu. The analysis further highlights how cosmopolitan cities like Samarkand and Istanbul functioned as conduits for knowledge exchange and acknowledges the influence of key Islamic scholars such as Nasir al-Din Tusi. Ultimately, the article advocates for a deeper appreciation of historical contexts to inform the reconstruction of contemporary intellectual neighbourhoods. It underscores the critical importance of trust and collaboration in navigating today’s complex global landscape.

                Introduction Leptin, along with its receptor, are linked with mechanisms affecting a diverse array of pregnancy-specific pathologies that include gestational diabetes and intrauterine growth restriction. The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance. Methods 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62±29.23 and 59.88±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, ‘AA’ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

                Novel object recognition tasks are commonly used to assess memory in rodents. These tests rely on an innate preference for exploring objects that are new or have been moved or changed. However, this preference, while normally seen in control conditions, is not immutable. Stressful experiences as well as lesions and genetic mutations can lead mice and rats to show clear preferences for exploring familiar objects and familiar locations. This opinion article discusses the evidence for changes in novelty preference, implications of this lability for assessing memory, and the significance of shifts in novelty preference as a readout of changes in curiosity with implications in approach–avoidance behavior and explore–exploit decision-making. Finally, we provide some recommendations for reporting and interpreting novelty preference task findings moving forward.

                Cheung et al. discovered hypothalamic subsets that encode threat, safety, predator imminence, anxiety, and arousal in freely behaving mice. These neural dynamics correlate with individual variations in defensiveness, providing insights into how innate fear is represented and scaled in the brain to guide survival responses.

                Cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells are known to interact within the tumor microenvironment and influence each other to impact on tumor progression. Here, Kay et al. discuss how they can also potentially metabolically interact with each other to alter the overall phenotype of the tumor and influence response to therapy.

                Using a forward genetics screen, Wu et al. uncovered the role of an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, TMEM11, in regulating Th1 cell effector functions. Tmem11−/− Th1 cells show alterations in mitochondrial cristae integrity and increased mtROS levels that influence cellular metabolism and chromatin modifications, resulting in decreased effector functions.

                Watanabe et al. demonstrate that high maternal progesterone during pregnancy supports efficient glucose supply to the developing embryo by increasing maternal insulin resistance via mPRε. This study suggests the potential use of mPRε modulators for managing pregnancy-related glycemic disorders such as gestational diabetes mellitus and for managing metabolic syndromes in offspring.

                Lyon et al. identify genetic factors important for MRSA vaginal colonization through an in vivo Tn-seq screen. Validation reveals competitive fitness defects in qoxB, bshB2, nanE, and srrAB mutants. Cross-comparison of ΔsrrAB in vitro RNA-seq with vaginal transcriptomic data uncovers >30 SrrAB-regulated factors potentially driving MRSA vaginal fitness.

                Klatzmann et al. identify a network-based bifurcation mechanism underlying conscious access. Using a mesoscale biophysical model, they reveal all-or-none dynamics emerging from connectome structural organization via an NMDA/AMPA receptor gradient. They validated this prediction using cortex-wide in vitro autoradiography. These findings provide insights into neural dynamics supporting conscious access.

                Cai et al. show that OsNAT10 is an RNA acetyltransferase responsible for ac4C modification in rice, influencing the ac4C mRNA modification pattern. OsNAT10 mediates the ac4C modification of key photosynthesis regulators, thereby regulating their stability and translation efficiency, which enhances photosynthetic efficiency and promotes rice growth and yield.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102980">Impaired fatty acid import or catabolism in macrophages restricts intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) infection of macrophages reprograms cellular metabolism to promote lipid retention. While it is clearly known that intracellular <i>Mtb</i> utilize host-derived lipids to maintain infection, the role of macrophage lipid processing on the bacteria’s ability to access the intracellular lipid pool remains undefined. We utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic approach to assess the impact of sequential steps in fatty acid metabolism on the growth of intracellular <i>Mtb</i>. Our analyses demonstrate that macrophages that cannot either import, store, or catabolize fatty acids restrict <i>Mtb</i> growth by both common and divergent antimicrobial mechanisms, including increased glycolysis, increased oxidative stress, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced autophagy, and nutrient limitation. We also show that impaired macrophage lipid droplet biogenesis is restrictive to <i>Mtb</i> replication, but increased induction of the same fails to rescue <i>Mtb</i> growth. Our work expands our understanding of how host fatty acid homeostasis impacts <i>Mtb</i> growth in the macrophage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97330">Exploring the repository of de novo-designed bifunctional antimicrobial peptides through deep learning</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attractive candidates to combat antibiotic resistance for their capability to target biomembranes and restrict a wide range of pathogens. It is a daunting challenge to discover novel AMPs due to their sparse distributions in a vast peptide universe, especially for peptides that demonstrate potencies for both bacterial membranes and viral envelopes. Here, we establish a de novo AMP design framework by bridging a deep generative module and a graph-encoding activity regressor. The generative module learns hidden ‘grammars’ of AMP features and produces candidates sequentially pass antimicrobial predictor and antiviral classifiers. We discovered 16 bifunctional AMPs and experimentally validated their abilities to inhibit a spectrum of pathogens in vitro and in animal models. Notably, P076 is a highly potent bactericide with the minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.21 μM against multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, while P002 broadly inhibits five enveloped viruses. Our study provides feasible means to uncover the sequences that simultaneously encode antimicrobial and antiviral activities, thus bolstering the function spectra of AMPs to combat a wide range of drug-resistant infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100611">Protein absorption in the zebrafish gut is regulated by interactions between lysosome rich enterocytes and the microbiome</a></h4>

              
                Dietary protein absorption in neonatal mammals and fishes relies on the function of a specialized and conserved population of highly absorptive lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs). The gut microbiome has been shown to enhance absorption of nutrients, such as lipids, by intestinal epithelial cells. However, whether protein absorption is also affected by the gut microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we investigate connections between protein absorption and microbes in the zebrafish gut. Using live microscopy-based quantitative assays, we find that microbes slow the pace of protein uptake and degradation in LREs. While microbes do not affect the number of absorbing LRE cells, microbes lower the expression of endocytic and protein digestion machinery in LREs. Using transgene-assisted cell isolation and single cell RNA-sequencing, we characterize all intestinal cells that take up dietary protein. We find that microbes affect expression of bacteria-sensing and metabolic pathways in LREs, and that some secretory cell types also take up protein and share components of protein uptake and digestion machinery with LREs. Using custom-formulated diets, we investigated the influence of diet and LRE activity on the gut microbiome. Impaired protein uptake activity in LREs, along with a protein-deficient diet, alters the microbial community and leads to an increased abundance of bacterial genera that have the capacity to reduce protein uptake in LREs. Together, these results reveal that diet-dependent reciprocal interactions between LREs and the gut microbiome regulate protein absorption.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100797">GATA6 regulates WNT and BMP programs to pattern precardiac mesoderm during the earliest stages of human cardiogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Haploinsufficiency for <i>GATA6</i> is associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) with variable comorbidity of pancreatic or diaphragm defects, although the etiology of disease is not well understood. Here, we used cardiac directed differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a platform to study GATA6 function during early cardiogenesis. GATA6 loss-of-function hESCs had a profound impairment in cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) specification and cardiomyocyte (CM) generation due to early defects during the mesendoderm and lateral mesoderm patterning stages. Profiling by RNA-seq and CUT&amp;RUN identified genes of the WNT and BMP programs regulated by GATA6 during early mesoderm patterning. Furthermore, interactome analysis detected GATA6 binding with developmental transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, suggesting cooperative regulation of cardiac lineage gene accessibility. We show that modulating WNT and BMP inputs during the first 48 hr of cardiac differentiation is sufficient to partially rescue CPC and CM defects in <i>GATA6</i> heterozygous and homozygous mutant hESCs. This study provides evidence of the regulatory functions for GATA6 directing human precardiac mesoderm patterning during the earliest stages of cardiogenesis to further our understanding of haploinsufficiency causing CHD and the co-occurrence of cardiac and other organ defects caused by human <i>GATA6</i> mutations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101136">HIV-1 Vif disrupts phosphatase feedback regulation at the kinetochore, leading to a pronounced pseudo-metaphase arrest</a></h4>

              
                Virion Infectivity Factor (Vif) of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) targets and degrades cellular APOBEC3 proteins, key regulators of intrinsic and innate antiretroviral immune responses, thereby facilitating HIV-1 infection. While Vif’s role in degrading APOBEC3G is well-studied, Vif is also known to cause cell cycle arrest, but the detailed nature of Vif’s effects on the cell cycle has yet to be delineated. In this study, we employed high-temporal resolution single-cell live imaging and super-resolution microscopy to monitor individual cells during Vif-induced cell cycle arrest. Our findings reveal that Vif does not affect the G2/M boundary as previously thought. Instead, Vif triggers a unique and robust pseudo-metaphase arrest, distinct from the mild prometaphase arrest induced by Vpr. During this arrest, chromosomes align properly and form the metaphase plate, but later lose alignment, resulting in polar chromosomes. Notably, Vif, unlike Vpr, significantly reduces the levels of both Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2 A (PP2A) at kinetochores, which regulate chromosome-microtubule interactions. These results unveil a novel role for Vif in kinetochore regulation that governs the spatial organization of chromosomes during mitosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102226">Nuclear Argonaute protein NRDE-3 switches small RNA partners during embryogenesis to mediate temporal-specific gene regulatory activity</a></h4>

              
                RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved pathway that utilizes Argonaute proteins and their associated small RNAs to exert gene regulatory function on complementary transcripts. While the majority of germline-expressed RNAi proteins reside in perinuclear germ granules, it is unknown whether and how RNAi pathways are spatially organized in other cell types. Here, we find that the small RNA biogenesis machinery is spatially and temporally organized during <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> embryogenesis. Specifically, the RNAi factor, SIMR-1, forms visible concentrates during mid-embryogenesis that contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a poly-UG polymerase, and the unloaded nuclear Argonaute protein, NRDE-3. Curiously, coincident with the appearance of the SIMR granules, the small RNAs bound to NRDE-3 switch from predominantly CSR-class 22G-RNAs to ERGO-dependent 22G-RNAs. NRDE-3 binds ERGO-dependent 22G-RNAs in the somatic cells of larvae and adults to silence ERGO-target genes; here we further demonstrate that NRDE-3-bound, CSR-class 22G-RNAs repress transcription in oocytes. Thus, our study defines two separable roles for NRDE-3, targeting germline-expressed genes during oogenesis to promote global transcriptional repression, and switching during embryogenesis to repress recently duplicated genes and retrotransposons in somatic cells, highlighting the plasticity of Argonaute proteins and the need for more precise temporal characterization of Argonaute-small RNA interactions.

">The Endo-GeneScreen Platform Identifies Drug-Like Probes that Regulate Endogenous Protein Levels within Physiological Contexts</a></h4>

              
                Traditional phenotypic drug discovery platforms have suffered from poor scalability and a lack of mechanistic understanding of newly discovered phenotypic probes. To address this, we created Endo-GeneScreen (EGS), a high-throughput enabled screening platform that identifies bioactive small molecules capable of regulating endogenous protein expression encoded by any preselected target gene within a biologically appropriate context. As a proof-of-concept, EGS successfully identified drug candidates that up-regulate endogenous expression of neuronal Syngap1, a gene that causes a neurodevelopmental disorder when haploinsufficient. For example, SR-1815, a previously unknown and undescribed kinase inhibitor, alleviated major cellular consequences of Syngap1 loss-of-function by restoring normal SynGAP protein levels and dampening neuronal hyperactivity within haploinsufficient neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that EGS assays accelerate preclinical development of identified drug candidates and facilitate mode-of-action deconvolution studies. Thus, EGS identifies first-in-class bioactive small molecule probes that promote biological discovery and precision therapeutic development.

">Sustained attention is more closely related to long-term memory than to attentional control</a></h4>

              
                Individuals differ in their ability to sustain attention. However, whether differences in sustained attention reflect differences in processes related to attentional control and working memory or long-term memory (LTM) remains underexplored. In Experiment 1, we conducted an online study (n = 136) measuring participants' sustained attention, attention control and working memory, and LTM. We measured sustained attention with an audio-visual continuous performance task (avCPT) in which participants responded to images while inhibiting responses to infrequent targets; attention control and working memory with Flanker, change localization, and Simon tasks; and LTM with recognition and source memory tests. Factor analyses revealed that sustained attention formed a distinct factor from attention control and working memory and LTM. Individual differences in the sustained attention factor robustly predicted individual differences in LTM and, to a lesser extent, attention control and working memory. In Experiment 2, to test how neural signatures of sustained attention related to attention control and working memory and LTM, we analyzed fMRI functional connectivity patterns collected as 20 participants performed the avCPT. A pre-trained connectome-based model of sustained attention predicted participants' performance on out-of-scanner LTM, but not attention control and working memory, tasks. Together these results suggest that individual differences in sustained attention, although correlated with attention control and working memory, are more closely related to LTM.

">N-terminal oligomerization drives HDAC4 nuclear condensation and neurodevelopmental dysfunction in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Histone deacetylase four (HDAC4) undergoes dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, which is important in the regulation of its activity. However, aberrant nuclear accumulation of HDAC4 is associated with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease, and in our Drosophila model, impairs normal neuronal development. Upon nuclear accumulation, HDAC4 forms biomolecular condensates, previously termed aggregates, that correlate with the severity of defects in development of the Drosophila mushroom body and adult eye. Here we determined that nuclear condensation of HDAC4 is dependent on self-oligomerization, and that impairing oligomerization reduces condensation and the severity of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in Drosophila. HDAC4 condensates are highly dynamic and are stabilized by the presence of MEF2, which promotes their formation and coalescence, ultimately exacerbating phenotypic severity. These data provide insight into the role of HDAC4 condensates in normal neuronal function and suggest that their disruption may contribute to the onset or progression of neuronal disease. Consequently, targeting oligomerization of HDAC4 and its interaction with MEF2 present potential therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with HDAC4 nuclear accumulation.

">A proposal for unifying statistical learning at different scales: Long-Horizon Associative Learning</a></h4>

              
                Sensory inputs often display complex temporal interdependencies that typically conform to a latent underlying arrangement, whose learning facilitates the efficient interaction with the environment. However temporal dependencies may cover a large range of scales, from consecutive items (Saffran et al., 1996), to relations in longer sequences (Dehaene et al., 2015; Schapiro et al., 2013). Whereas numerous models have been proposed to explain statistical learning at different scales (Fiser and Lengyel, 2022), we argue here that a single and unifying model can account for the different scales of statistical learning including, adjacent and non-adjacent transitions as well as network structures, even in the absence of first order transition probability information. Based on behavioral and MEG results, we previously showed that a long-horizon associative learning process (a biologically plausible implementation of successor representation, or equivalently the Free-Energy Minimization Model (FEMM) originally proposed by Lynn and colleagues (2020a)) was able to explain learning based on local statistical properties but also based on high-order network properties (Benjamin et al., 2024, 2023a). Here, we extend our proposal and describe how this long-term associative learning model accounts for various results from the literature with different scales of dependency between elements. Long-horizon associative learning thus provides a unified framework that spans diverse statistical scales, offering a unique explanation of literature results. We thus aim at replacing the numerous metrics described in the statistical learning literature, each tuned to a specific scale and that occasionally conflict with each other by this unique parsimonious approach.

                Tau regulates neuronal integrity. In tauopathy, phosphorylated tau detaches from microtubules and aggregates, and is released into the extracellular space. Microglia are the first responders to the extracellular tau, a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP), which can be cleared by proteostasis and activate innate immune response gene expression by nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB). However, longitudinal NFkB activation in tauopathies and whether pathological tau (pTau) contributes to NF-kB activity is unknown. Here, we tau oligomers from human Alzheimers disease brain (AD-TO) activate NFkB in mouse microglia and macrophages reducing the IkBa via promoting its secretion in the extracellular space. NFkB activity peaks at 9- and 11-months age in PS19Luc+ and hTauLuc+ mice, respectively. Reducing pTau via pharmacological (DOX), genetic (Mapt knockout) or antibody-mediated neutralization (immunization with pT181-Qb vaccine) reduces NFkB activity, and together suggest pTau is a driver of NFkB and chronic neuroinflammation tauopathies.

">Sleep to remember, sleep to protect: increased sleep spindle and theta activity predict fewer intrusive memories after analogue trauma</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidence shows a strong correlative link between sleep disturbances and intrusive memories after traumatic events, presumably due to insufficient (nocturnal) memory integration. However, the underlying mechanisms of this link and the role of specific neural activities during sleep are poorly understood so far. Here, we investigated how the intra-individual affective response to an experimental trauma predicts changes in oscillatory activity during subsequent sleep and how these changes predict the processing of the experimental trauma. In a randomized within-subject comparison, twenty-two female, healthy participants (23.14 {+/-} 2.46 years) watched a well-validated film clip including traumatic contents and a neutral film clip before bedtime on two separate nights. Heart rate was recorded during the film clips and nocturnal brain activity was recorded using 64-channel high-density EEG during subsequent nights. Intrusive memories were assessed via a seven-days diary and negative affect was assessed using laboratory trauma film reminders one week after the trauma film. An increased intra-individual heart rate during the trauma film predicted higher intra-individual sleep spindle amplitude the following night. Increased theta activity (4.25 - 8 Hz) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep after the trauma film predicted fewer trauma film related intrusive memories and negative affect. Likewise, an increase in sleep spindles after the trauma film predicted fewer trauma film related intrusive memories. Our findings suggest that an experience-dependent up-regulation of these nocturnal oscillatory activity patterns, which are known to be involved in adaptive memory consolidation processes, serves as a protective factor against trauma-related intrusive memory development. Particularly, increased theta activity during REM sleep and sleep spindle activity seem to be of importance here.

">Amino acids activate parallel chemosensory pathways in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Amino acids (AAs) are essential dietary macronutrients that impact an organism's fitness in a concentration-dependent manner, but the mechanisms mediating AA detection to drive consumption are less clear. In Drosophila, we identified the full repertoire of taste cells and receptors involved in feeding initiation towards a glutamate-rich AA mixture, tryptone, using in vivo calcium imaging and the proboscis extension response (PER). We found that AA attraction occurs through sweet cells, whereas feeding aversion is mediated through Ionotropic Receptor 94e (IR94e) cells and bitter cells, dependent on concentration. Further, our results corroborate previous findings that ionotropic receptors IR76b, IR51b, and IR94e detect AAs in their respective cell types. Additionally, we describe a new role for the appetitive IR56d receptor and bitter gustatory receptors in detecting AAs. This work establishes a cellular and molecular framework of AA feeding initiation and highlights redundancy in aversive pathways that regulate AA feeding.

">Subliminal risk influences subjective value in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between conscious awareness and decisions has been heavily debated. Here we investigated whether subliminal probabilities are integrated with conscious rewards to form subjective value (SV) representations in the anterior ventral striatum (aVS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Participants played an incentivized competitive game with risky choice to accumulate points across trials in a behavioral and fMRI experiment. The game was a modified attentional-blink paradigm that rendered a probability cue unseen (indicating a 100% or 0% chance to win a risky reward). Following the probability cue, participants chose between a safe (1 point with certainty) or risky option (>1 or 0 points depending on probability cue). The risky reward was either 2 or 5 points, varying across trials. In some trials the probability cue was absent (replaced by a random distractor) and the probability to win the risky reward was 50%. When probability cues were unseen, they did not influence choice, as value-maximizing choice (d-prime) was not greater than chance, but they did influence reaction time in both experiments. Consistent with SV integration, the BOLD signal in aVS and vmPFC was higher for both conscious rewards (high > low) and subliminal probabilities (high > low) and could not be explained by subliminal salience (cue present > absent). Moreover, multivariate pattern similarity between conscious rewards and subliminal probabilities in vmPFC suggest integration into an abstract value representation. Additionally, we found brain-wide subliminal probability and salience effects. Taken together, these results suggest that conscious awareness is not necessary for probability to be integrated with conscious rewards to form an abstract common currency SV representation in vmPFC. Additionally, brain-wide subliminal probability and salience effects suggests information can have global access without conscious awareness.

">How sleeping minds decide: state-specific reconfigurations of lexical decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making is a core cognitive function that enables adaptive behavior across diverse contexts. While extensively studied in wakefulness, its persistence and reconfiguration across sleep states remain poorly understood. Here, we use computational modeling to examine lexical decision-making across wakefulness, N1 sleep, and lucid REM sleep in both healthy participants (HP) and participants with narcolepsy (NP). Using facial electromyography (EMG) to capture real-time behavioral responses to spoken words and pseudowords, we quantify how decision-making strategies adapt under different sleep and consciousness states. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, decision-making mechanisms are dynamically reconfigured across sleep states. In N1 sleep, the advantage for word (vs. pseudoword) judgments is supported by faster sensory encoding and motor preparation, combined with efficient evidence accumulation. In contrast, in lucid REM sleep, the word advantage is driven exclusively by enhanced evidence accumulation, while sensory encoding and motor preparation remain unchanged. Second, cross-state comparisons reveal distinct patterns of preservation and impairment. In N1 sleep, word processing remains largely intact, whereas pseudoword processing is significantly impaired, characterized by prolonged stimulus encoding, delayed motor preparation, and reduced evidence accumulation. In contrast, lucid REM sleep is marked by a global reduction in processing efficiency, reflected in slower evidence accumulation and elevated decision thresholds for both words and pseudowords. These results demonstrate that rather than being uniformly degraded, decision-making is dynamically reconfigured across sleep stages, reflecting adaptive neurocognitive strategies that sustain cognition in altered states of consciousness. By identifying state-specific computational mechanisms, this study provides new insights into the brain's resilience and flexibility under changing cognitive and physiological conditions.

">SORDINO for Silent, Sensitive, Specific, and Artifact-Resisting fMRI in awake behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized our understanding of the brain activity landscape, bridging circuit neuroscience in animal models with noninvasive brain mapping in humans. This immensely utilized technique, however, faces challenges such as acoustic noise, electromagnetic interference, motion artifacts, magnetic-field inhomogeneity, and limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Here, we introduce Steady-state On-the-Ramp Detection of INduction-decay with Oversampling (SORDINO), a transformative fMRI technique that addresses these challenges by maintaining a constant total gradient amplitude while acquiring data during continuously changing gradient direction. When benchmarked against conventional fMRI on a 9.4T system, SORDINO is silent, sensitive, specific, and resistant to motion and susceptibility artifacts. SORDINO offers superior compatibility with multimodal experiments and carries novel contrast mechanisms distinct from BOLD. It also enables brain-wide activity and connectivity mapping in awake, behaving mice, overcoming stress- and motion-related confounds that are among the most challenging barriers in current animal fMRI studies.

">A Brain-Computer Interface for Improving Auditory Attention in Multi-Talker Environments</a></h4>

              
                There is significant research in accurately determining the focus of a listener's attention in a multi-talker environment using auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms. These algorithms rely on neural signals to identify the intended speaker, assuming that these signals consistently reflect the listener's focus. However, some listeners struggle with this competing talkers task, leading to suboptimal tracking of the desired speaker due to potential interference from distractors. The goal of this study was to enhance a listener's attention to the target speaker in real time and investigate the underlying neural bases of this improvement. This paper describes a closed-loop neurofeedback system that decodes the auditory attention of the listener in real time, utilizing data from a non-invasive, wet electroencephalography (EEG) brain-computer interface (BCI). Fluctuations in the listener's real-time attention decoding accuracy was used to provide acoustic feedback. As accuracy improved, the ignored talker in the two-talker listening scenario was attenuated; making the desired talker easier to attend to due to the improved attended talker signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A one-hour session was divided into a 10-minute decoder training phase, with the rest of the session allocated to observing changes in neural decoding. In this study, we found evidence of suppression of (i.e., reduction in) neural tracking of the unattended talker when comparing the first and second half of the neurofeedback session (p = 0.012). We did not find a statistically significant increase in the neural tracking of the attended talker. These results establish a single session performance benchmark for a time-invariant, non-adaptive attended talker linear decoder utilized to extract attention from a listener integrated within a closed-loop neurofeedback system. This research lays the engineering and scientific foundation for prospective multi-session clinical trials of an auditory attention training paradigm.

                Astrocytes are integral to understand Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology but the existing serum-supplemented in vitro astrocyte culture models are not suitable to study certain stress response mechanisms. Here, we developed a serum-free murine primary cortical astrocyte culture model to study endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation to see the effect of amyloid-beta (A{beta}1-42). Astrocytes were cultured in a controlled serum-free environment to minimize interference from serum components. Serum-free astrocytes were exposed to oligomeric A{beta} to induce ER stress and inflammation. Initially no significant activation of eIF2, a key marker of ER stress, was observed under serum-free condition but with the removal of N-acetyl cysteine ER stress response was enhanced after 24 hours of A{beta} exposure. Subsequently, the inflammatory response, assessed through TNF- expression, was minimal in the presence of growth factors but became pronounced when these factors were withdrawn. Astrocytic reactivity, assessed by GFAP expression, was observed with prolonged A{beta} exposure, indicating a reactive astrogliosis response. Transcript analysis revealed a time-dependent shift in the expression of inflammatory modulators, with early time points showing increased anti-inflammatory markers and late exposure promoting pro-inflammatory responses. These findings highlight the potential of serum-free cultures for studying ER stress and inflammation together in astrocytes and offer insights into the complex role of these cells in AD pathophysiology.

">Effects of complex whole-body movements on EEG activity: a scoping review</a></h4>

              
                The influence of movements on brain activity has been part of research for decades. Recent advancements in electroencephalography (EEG) coupled with a shift in focus towards the effects of complex whole-body movements provided additional inspirations in this area. Besides the metabolic load, the amount of information to be processed in parallel provides rough indications of its influence on central nervous activity. Accordingly, this scoping review aimed to synthesize studies investigating the acute effects of complex whole-body movements with increased parallel information processing on electrical brain activity. A comprehensive search across five scientific databases resulted in thirteen studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The results showed increased theta and alpha activity in frontal, central and parietal areas in most studies during and after movement. However, in other frequency bands the findings were not consistent. Comparisons between complex movements with varying parallel demands revealed a trend towards higher theta for movements with more parallel actions. Based on a consistent EEG methodology, future research should consider movement complexity not only related to the length of sequences but rather in terms of parallel motor activities as a moderator of brain activity to obtain more consistent results in the context of neural effects of movement exercise.

">Acute supplementation of beta-hydroxybutyrate increases visual cortical excitability in humans: a combined EEG and MRS study</a></h4>

              
                Increasing plasma levels of ketone bodies via supplementation or dieting has been repeatedly used to ameliorate neurological symptoms and enhance cognitive performance. Here we aim to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms by characterizing the acute effects on visual cortical function of a single dose B-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation. Young human volunteers were orally administered a BHB ester; we used EEG to assess cortical excitability and responsivity to visual stimulation, and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to quantify glutamate and GABA+ concentrations in the occipital cortex. BHB supplementation increased the amplitude of Visual Evoked Potentials and enhanced the resting-state EEG alpha rhythm. These electrophysiological changes were paralleled by a neurometabolic change in the occipital cortex, where glutamate (but not GABA+) concentration increased. The glutamate increase was correlated with the increased Visual Evoked Potential amplitude. This suggests that acute BHB supplementation increases the excitability of the brain cortex, as assessed neurometabolically and electrophysiologically.

                To address suggestions that human brain responses to autonomous system errors may be used as brain-based measures of trust in automation, the present study asked participants to monitor the performance of either a virtual human or an autonomous system partner performing a novel, complex, real-world image classification task. We predicted visual feedback of partner errors would elicit the feedback-related negativity and P3 ERP components, and that these components would differ between the human and system groups. Behavioral results showed that while participants calibrated their trust in their partner according to our intended manipulation of error rates, no group differences were found. The ERP data, however, revealed FRN and P3 effects for both groups, modulated by accuracy and error rate. An unexpected finding was that the P3 topography differed between groups, as while the P3 for the human group was widespread, the P3 for the system group was limited to posterior electrodes with the P3a being completely absent. These results demonstrate the potential for EEG-based measures of real-time trust in automation to be used in applied scenarios with benefits beyond traditional methods. Further, we found that a distinct neural processing of autonomous system errors compared to human errors may exist, necessitating further research in this emerging field.

">Human pulvinar stimulation engages select cortical pathways in epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The pulvinar has been proposed as an effective neuromodulation target for patients with posterior quadrant and temporal epilepsies. However, the pulvinar has a large tissue volume, multiple subnuclei, and widespread cortical connections. It remains unknown whether electrical stimulation of distinct pulvinar subregions affects the temporal, occipital, and parietal areas differently. To address this gap, we delivered single-pulse electrical stimulation to the pulvinar and measured the resulting brain stimulation evoked potentials in twelve patients undergoing stereotactic EEG for drug-resistant epilepsy. Brain stimulation evoked potentials were parameterized across the occipital, temporal and parietal cortex. Stimulation of the lateral pulvinar elicited significant brain stimulation evoked potentials in striate and extrastriate areas that diminish as stimulation shifts towards the medial pulvinar. Conversely, stimulation of the ventral aspect of the medial pulvinar produced significant lateral temporal evoked potentials, which diminish with lateral pulvinar stimulation. We also found that stimulation of the dorsomedial pulvinar evoked significant parietal responses with limited striate/extrastriate and lateral temporal responses. These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation of specific pulvinar subregions influences distinct occipital, parietal and lateral temporal areas. Selective targeting of pulvinar subregions to maximize seizure network engagement may be essential for individualized treatment of posterior quadrant and temporal epilepsies.

">Spontaneous eye movements reveal that premotor cortex is involved in human thinking</a></h4>

              
                Non-visual saccades (NVS) are spontaneous eye movements humans make while thinking. Their role is puzzling and there is no framework to explain them in terms of their underlying neural systems. Here we studied neural activity preceding NVS when subjects performed standardized abstract thinking tasks. We used high-density EEG and focused on frontal and parietal channels representing oculomotor cortical areas. We found that NVS are preceded by neural activity changes in frontal and parietal EEG channels qualitatively different to that for voluntary saccades. However, only the rate of signal change in frontal channels, but not in parietal channels, surpassed that observed when comparing NVS to normal saccades. Frequency spectrum analyses showed activity patterns reflecting complex top-down and bottom-up processing. A source reconstruction analysis additionally revealed that presaccadic signals originated mainly in the premotor cortex. We propose that this presaccadic activity while thinking represents evidence accumulation and attentional shifts, as shown before in the premotor cortex during sensorimotor tasks. Our findings suggest that human thinking appears to function similarly to human actions and employs premotor areas responsible for evaluating and manipulating objects also when evaluating and manipulating concepts.

">Single-dose rapamycin increases brain glucose metabolism but reduces synaptic density in Long-Evans rats: A PET imaging study</a></h4>

              
                Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), has shown promise as a neuroprotective compound in preclinical studies. Reduced brain glucose metabolism and loss of synaptic density are key features of Alzheimer's disease that can be measured in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, allowing for assessment of treatment effects on brain function. Here, we used PET to investigate the acute effects of a single-dose of rapamycin on glucose metabolism and synaptic density in Long-Evans rats. In a repeated measures design, we quantified changes in brain glucose metabolism using [18F]FDG PET (n=13) at baseline, one day, and one week after intraperitoneal administration of rapamycin (8 mg/kg). In a separate cohort (n=6), we measured synaptic density using [18F]SynVesT-1 PET at baseline and one day after rapamycin administration. Regional standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated for [18F]FDG while total distribution volumes were estimated for [18F]SynVesT-1 using image-derived input functions of the heart. Rapamycin induced significant increases in [18F]FDG SUV across multiple brain regions one day after administration, an effect that persisted at one-week follow-up. In contrast, [18F]SynVesT-1 binding showed significant decreases throughout the brain at 24 hours post-administration, indicating reduced synaptic density. These opposing effects on glucose metabolism and synaptic density point to multifaceted actions of rapamycin in the brain, possibly reflecting improved metabolic function occurring simultaneously with acute synaptic loss. These results show that [18F]FDG and synaptic density PET imaging could serve as useful biomarkers in human clinical trials evaluating rapamycin's mechanistic and therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative disorders.

">Anle138b ameliorates pathological phenotypes in mouse and cellular models of Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a debilitating hereditary movement disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. HD is characterized by deposition of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates, and by severe neurodegeneration of the basal ganglia and neocortex. No cure is currently available, and new treatment options are urgently needed. Here, we show that the oligomer modifying molecule anle138b (INN: emrusolmin) improves multiple disease phenotypes in cell culture and in two mouse models of HD. Application of anle138b reduced mHTT aggregate formation and ameliorated neurotoxicity in primary neurons. Oral administration of anle138b delayed deposition of mHTT inclusions, reduced brain atrophy, mitigated neuroinflammation, improved motor function and extended life span in HD mice. Downregulation of striatal markers and synapse loss in striatal spiny projection neurons were also partially rescued. No adverse effects of anle138b were observed in wildtype animals. Moreover, anle138b markedly decreased mHTT aggregation in human neural precursor cells differentiated from HD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Altogether these results illustrate the potential of anle138b as a disease-modifying treatment for HD.

">Modulation of autism-associated serotonin transporters by palmitoylation: Insights into the molecular pathogenesis and targeted therapies for autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder of the nervous system characterized by a deficiency in interpersonal communication skills, a pathologic tendency for repetitive behaviors, and highly restrictive interests. The spectrum is a gradient-based construct used to categorize the widely varying degrees of ASD phenotypes, and has been linked to a genetic etiology in 25% of cases. Prior studies have revealed that 30% of ASD patients exhibit hyperserotonemia, or elevated whole blood serotonin, implicating the serotonergic system in the pathogenesis of ASD. Likewise, escitalopram, a selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been demonstrated to improve aberrant behavior and irritability in ASD patients, potentially by modulating abnormal brain activation. Prior studies have uncovered proband patients with rare mutations in the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) that manifest enhanced surface expression and transport capacity, suggesting that abnormal enhancement of hSERT function may be involved in the pathogenesis of ASD. Methods: HEK-293 cells stably expressing WT, C109A, I425L, F465L, L550V, or K605N hSERT were subject to analysis for palmitoylation via Acyl-Biotin Exchange followed with hSERT immunoblotting. F465L functional enhancement was confirmed by surface analysis via biotinylation and saturation analysis via 5HT transport. F465L palmitoylation, surface expression and transport capacity were then assessed following treatment with 2-bromopalmitate or escitalopram. Results: Here, we reveal that palmitoylation is enhanced in the ASD hSERT F465L and L550V coding variants, and confirm prior reports of enhanced kinetic activity and surface expression of F465L. Subsequently, treatment of F465L with the irreversible palmitoyl acyl-transferase inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate (2BP), or escitalopram, rectified enhanced F465L palmitoylation, surface expression, and transport capacity to basal WT levels. Limitations: Tests assessing L550V for surface expression, transport capacity, and reactivity to inhibition of palmitoylation was not assessed. In addition, further characterization is necessary for internalization rates, degradative mechanisms, the impact of cysteine-mediated substitutions, and other SSRIs on these processes. Conclusions: Overall, our results implicate disordered hSERT palmitoylation in the pathogenesis of serotonergic ASD subtypes, with basal recovery of these processes following escitalopram providing insight into its molecular utility as an ASD therapeutic.

">Motion-corrected eye tracking (MoCET) improves gaze accuracy during visual fMRI experiments</a></h4>

              
                Human eye movements are essential for understanding cognition, yet achieving high-precision eye tracking in fMRI remains challenging. Even slight head shifts from the initial calibration position can introduce drift in eye tracking data, leading to substantial gaze inaccuracies. To address this, we introduce Motion-Corrected Eye Tracking (MoCET), a novel approach that corrects drift using head motion parameters derived from the preprocessing of fMRI data. MoCET requires no additional hardware and can be applied retrospectively to existing datasets. We show that it outperforms traditional detrending methods with respect to accuracy of gaze estimation and offers higher spatial and temporal precision compared to MR-based eye tracking approaches. By overcoming a key limitation in integrating eye tracking with fMRI, MoCET facilitates investigations of naturalistic vision and cognition in fMRI research.

">Human insula neurons respond to simple sounds during passive listening</a></h4>

              
                The insula is critical for integrating sensory information from the body with that arising from the environment. Although previous studies suggest that posterior insula is sensitive to sounds, auditory response properties of insula neurons have not previously been reported. Here, we provide the first report of a population of human single neuron data from the insula and provide comparative data from the primary auditory cortex, recorded intracranially from human participants during passive listening. In each condition, more than 330 single neurons were recorded in 11 participants. Almost a third of neurons in posterior insula and a smaller subset in anterior insula responded to simple tones and clicks. Responsive neurons were distributed throughout posterior and anterior insula and showed preferred frequency tuning. Onset latencies in the insula were similar to those in the primary auditory cortex but response durations were significantly shorter. Overall, these data highlight that insula neurons respond to auditory stimuli even in non-behaviorally relevant contexts and suggest an important contribution of audition to the postulated integrative functions of insular cortex.

">The encoding of interoceptive-based predictions by the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus D2+ neurons</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain integrates internal physiological states with external sensory cues to guide behavior is a fundamental question in neuroscience. This process relies on interoceptive predictions which are internal models that anticipate changes in physiological state based on sensory inputs and prior experiences. Despite recent advances in identifying the neural substrates of interoceptive predictions, the precise neuronal circuits involved remain elusive. In our study, we demonstrate that Dopamine 2 Receptor (D2+) expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) play key roles in interoception and interoceptive predictions. Specifically, these neurons are engaged in behaviors leading to physiologically relevant outcomes, with their activity highly dependent on the interoceptive state of the mice and the expected outcome. Furthermore, we show that chronic inhibition of PVTD2+ neurons impairs the long-term performance of interoceptive-guided motivated behavior. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the role of PVTD2+ neurons in learning and updating state-dependent predictions, by integrating past experiences with current physiological conditions to optimize goal-directed behavior.

">In-vivo optogenetic manipulation approach for gerbil medial nucleus of trapezoid body</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: This study introduces an in-vivo optogenetic manipulation approach for the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in Mongolian gerbils, a species with a hearing range similar to humans. The MNTB is crucial for sound localization, but traditional methods lack temporal precision and reversibility. The aim of this study is to develop a specific, reversible method for controlling MNTB activity with fast and precise temporal control, an approach vital for studying sound localization. Methods: We stereotactically injected adeno-associated viral vectors encoding opsins into the gerbil MNTB. Precise targeting was achieved despite the MNTB's location in a deep, heavily myelinated area of the brainstem. Opsin expression was confirmed via confocal microscopy. In-vivo electrophysiology combined with optical stimulation was used to test optical activation and suppression of MNTB activity during sound stimuli. Results: Opsin expression was strong and stable in MNTB neurons over weeks and months. Laser stimulation during in-vivo recordings successfully induced both activation and suppression of MNTB neurons, demonstrating fast and precise control over neural activity. Conclusion: This in-vivo optogenetic method provides specific, reversible control of MNTB activity in gerbils with rapid, real-time modulation. It offers a powerful tool for investigating sound localization and auditory processing with high temporal precision.

">MicroRNAs alteration and unique distribution in the soma and synapses of substantia nigra in Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative condition after Alzheimer's. Abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (-syn) aggregates disrupts the balance of dopaminergic (DA-ergic) synapse components, interfering with dopamine transmission and leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss in PD. However exact molecular mechanism underlying DA-ergic neuronal cell loss in the SNpc in not known. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are observed in various compartments of neural elements including cell bodies, nerve terminals, mitochondria, synaptic vesicles and synaptosomes. However, miRNAs expression and cellular distribution are unknown in the soma and synapse compartment in PD and healthy state. To address this void of information, we isolated synaptosomes and cytosolic fractions (soma) from post-mortem brains of PD-affected individuals and unaffected controls (UC) and processed for miRNA sequencing analysis. A group of miRNAs were significantly altered (p < 0.05) with high fold changes (variance +/- > 2-fold) in their expressions in different comparisons: 1. UC synaptosome vs UC cytosol, 2. PD synaptosome vs PD cytosol, 3. PD synaptosome vs UC synaptosome, 4. PD cytosol vs UC cytosol. Our study unveiled some potential miRNAs in PD and their alteration and unique distribution in the soma and synapses of SNpc in PD and controls. Further, gene ontology enrichment analysis showed the involvement of deregulated miRNAs in several molecular function and cellular components: synapse assembly formation, cell junction organization, cell projections, mitochondria, Calcium ion binding and protein binding activities.

">Accurate spatiotemporal retinal responses require a color intensity balance fine-tuned to natural conditions</a></h4>

              
                Color vision is vital for animal survival, essential for foraging and predator detection. In mice, as in other mammals, color vision originates in the retina, where photoreceptor signals are processed by neural circuits. However, retinal responses to stimuli involving multiple colors are still not well understood. One possible explanation of this knowledge gap is that previous studies have not thoroughly examined how neuronal activity adapts to a 30 seconds to a few minutes timescale when exposed to multiple color sources. To address this, we systematically varied the UV-to-green light balance with a custom-built stimulator targeting mice opsins spectra while recording retinal ganglion cell responses in the ventral retina using multielectrode arrays. Responses to full-field chirp and checkerboard stimulations with alternating UV and green light revealed that more than one order of magnitude of intensity difference favoring green M-opsin over UV S-opsin is needed for a balanced reliability in retinal ganglion cell responses. An incorrect balance, with slightly increased UV light, silenced responses to green illumination. To determine if these values are consistent with natural conditions, we analyzed isomerisation rates in the mouse retina across different times of the day. We found that the M- to S-opsin activation ratio remains constant through the mesopic-photopic range, and our empirically determined values align well with these natural conditions, lying far from a simple equalization of M- and S-opsin isomerisation rates. In conclusion, a finely tuned color intensity balance is essential for accurately measuring both fast temporal responses and detailed spatial receptive fields.

">Dopamine and calcium dynamics in the nucleus accumbens core during food seeking</a></h4>

              
                Extinction-reinstatement paradigms have been used to study reward seeking for both food and drug rewards. The nucleus accumbens is of particular interest in reinstatement due to its ability to energize motivated behavior. Indeed, previous work has demonstrated that suppression of neuronal activity or dopaminergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens reduces reinstatement to food seeking. In this study, we sought to further establish a connection between glutamatergic input, measured by proxy via a genetically encoded calcium indicator, and dopamine (DA) tone, measured simultaneously with a red-shifted DA biosensor. We performed this sensor multiplexing in the nucleus accumbens core in the classic extinction-reinstatement paradigm with food reward. We detected DA transients that changed in magnitude and/or temporally shifted over the course of self-administration training. In our calcium traces we observed a decrease from baseline time-locked to the lever press for food reward, which became more prominent with training. Both patterns were reduced in the first session of extinction with no deflections from baseline detected in either the DA or calcium traces in the last extinction session. When we recorded during reinstatement tests, bootstrapping analysis detected a calcium response when reinstatement was primed by cue or pellet+cue presentation, while a DA response was detected for pellet+cue reinstatement. These data further establish a role for nucleus accumbens core activity and DA in reinstatement of food seeking and represent the first attempt to simultaneously record the two during an extinction-reinstatement task.

">Generation and Characterization of Col6a1 knock-in mice: A Promising Pre-Clinical Model for Collagen VI-Related Dystrophies</a></h4>

              
                Collagen VI Related Dystrophies (COL6-RD) are congenital muscle diseases, typically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. A frequent type of mutation involves glycine substitutions in the triple helical domain of collagen VI alpha chains, exerting a dominant-negative effect on the unaltered protein. Despite this, no prior animal model captured this mutation type. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated transgenic mice with the equivalent of the human COL6A1 c.877 G>A; p. Gly293Arg mutation. We characterized their skeletal muscle phenotype over time, utilizing computer-aided tools applied to standardized parameters of muscle pathology and function. Knock-in mice exhibited early-onset reduced muscle weight, myopathic histology, increased fibrosis, reduced collagen VI expression, muscle weakness, and impaired respiratory function. These features provide adequate outcome measures to assess therapeutic interventions. The different automated image analysis methods deployed here analyze thousands of features simultaneously, enhancing accuracy in describing muscle disease models. Overall, the Col6a1 Ki Gly292Arg mouse model offers a robust platform to deepen our understanding of COL6-RD and advance its therapeutic landscape

">Synthetic torpor in the rat recapitulates key deatures of torpor and protects the heart from ischaemia-reperfusion injury</a></h4>

              
                During hibernation, animals enter torpor, a reversible physiological state typically characterised by reductions in core temperature, heart rate and oxygen consumption. Species that enter this hypothermic and hypometabolic state are highly tolerant of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Consequently, there is a growing interest in utilizing aspects of torpor for clinical applications, such as protection from ischaemia-reperfusion injury during stroke or myocardial infarction. It is currently unknown, however, if a torpor-like state is protective in animals that do not naturally enter torpor. Using viral-vector mediated chemogenetics in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus, we induced synthetic torpor in the rat, a species that does not naturally enter torpor. We demonstrate this state is cardioprotective in an ex-vivo ischaemia-reperfusion injury model. Synthetic torpor induced cardioprotection of the normothermic, isolated heart is not dependent on hypothermia during synthetic torpor. These findings provide important insights into synthetic torpor states in novel species, and demonstrate feasibility for future clinical translation in humans.

">AAV-mediated ARSA replacement for the treatment of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene, resulting in lower sulfatase activity and the toxic accumulation of sulfatides in the central and peripheral nervous system. Children account for 70% of cases and become progressively disabled with death occurring within 10 years of disease onset. Gene therapy approaches to restore ARSA expression via adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) have been promising but hampered by limited brain biodistribution. We report the development of a novel capsid AAV.GMU01, demonstrating superior biodistribution and transgene expression in the central nervous system of non-human primates (NHPs). Next, we show that AAV.GMU01-ARSA treated MLD mice exhibit persistent, normal levels of sulfatase activity and a concomitant reduction in toxic sulfatides. Treated mice also show a reduction in MLD-associated pathology and auditory dysfunction. Lastly, we demonstrate that treatment with AAV.GMU01-ARSA in NHPs is well-tolerated and results in potentially therapeutic ARSA expression in the brain. In summary, we propose AAV.GMU01-ARSA mediated gene replacement as a clinically viable approach to achieve broad and therapeutic levels of ARSA.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We must reconcile the needs of the internal world and the demands of the external world to make decisions relevant to homeostasis, well-being, and flexible behavior. Engagement with the internal (eg interoceptive) world is linked to medial brain systems, whereas the extrapersonal space (eg exteroceptive) is associated with lateral brain systems. Using Human Connectome Project data, we found three association tracts connecting the action-related frontal lobe with perception-related posterior lobes. A lateral dorsal tract and a medial dorsal tract interact independently with a ventral tract at frontal and posterior hubs. The two frontal and the two posterior hubs are interconnected, forming a meta-loop that integrates lateral and medial brain systems. The four anatomical hubs correspond to the common nodes of the intrinsic cognitive brain networks such as the default mode network. These functional networks depend on the integration of both realms. Thus, the positioning of functional cognitive networks can be understood as the intersection of long anatomical association tracts. The strength of structural connectivity within lateral and medial brain systems correlates with performance on behavioral tests assessing theory of mind. The meta-loop provides an anatomical framework to associate neurological and psychiatric symptoms with functional and structural changes.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Manual dexterity and hand strength are common challenges in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP), limiting the use of their affected upper limb and impacting daily activities. The efficacy of a long-duration Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) program compared to Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT) in addressing these issues remains unreported. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of mCIMT and MVF in improving manual dexterity and hand strength in children with UCP. Methods: Fifty children with UCP (aged 5&amp;amp;ndash;9 years) were randomly assigned to either the MVF or mCIMT group. Children in both groups received their respective interventions for 30 min, five times per week, over 12 weeks. Additionally, all participants underwent traditional physical therapy for 12 weeks, three times per week, with each session lasting 45 to 60 min. Manual dexterity was assessed using the Box and Block Test (BBT), and maximum isometric hand strength was measured with a hydraulic handheld dynamometer. Evaluations were conducted before the intervention and 12 weeks later. Results: Repeated measures of MANOVA revealed significant enhancements in manual dexterity and hand strength in both groups after the intervention. However, the mCIMT group demonstrated significantly greater gains in BBT scores (p = 0.014) and maximum isometric hand strength (p = 0.017) compared to the MVF group, with effect sizes of 0.75 and 0.79, respectively. Conclusions: Incorporating either mCIMT or MVF into rehabilitation significantly enhances manual dexterity and hand strength in children with UCP, with mCIMT yielding superior outcomes.</p>

	<p>Sleep health is a multidimensional construct encompassing sleep quality, duration, efficiency, regularity, and alignment with circadian rhythms, playing a crucial role in overall well-being. Sleep health remains inconsistently defined across research and clinical settings despite its importance, limiting the ability to standardize assessments and interventions. Recent studies have emphasized the significance of defining sleep health beyond the absence of sleep disorders, integrating subjective and objective measures to assess its impact on physical and mental health outcomes. Disparities in sleep health exist across gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic regions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where inconsistent work schedules, economic stress, and healthcare access influence sleep patterns. Poor sleep health is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and mental health disorders, reinforcing its role as a modifiable risk factor in public health. Lifestyle factors such as caffeine consumption, physical activity, and irregular eating patterns also contribute to sleep disturbances, highlighting the need for behavioral interventions. This narrative review aims to synthesize the current knowledge on sleep health, focusing on its definitions, measurement tools, global disparities, and associations.</p>

	<p>Background and Purpose: The infarct growth rate (IGR) is a major modifier of the therapeutic effect of endovascular thrombectomy. The objective of this paper was to explore the utility of the IGR measured by perfusion the imaging in predicting early neurological improvement (ENI) of patients treated with EVT. Methods: We reviewed consecutive large vessel occlusive stroke in the anterior circulation and treated by thrombectomy between October 2019 to July 2024. The IGR was defined as the ischemic core volume (apparent diffusion coefficient &amp;amp;le; 620 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;6 mm2/s or relative cerebral blood flow &amp;amp;lt; 30%) divided by the time from stroke onset to imaging. ENI was defined as a reduction &amp;amp;ge; 6 points in the NIH Stroke Scale score at 24 h after the procedure, or an NIH Stroke Scale score of 0 or 1 on day 7 of hospitalization or at discharge if it occurred before day 7. Results: A total of 407 patients (mean age, 69.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.5 years; 63.1% of male) were included, of whom 149 (36.6%) achieved ENI. Among all enrolled patients, 281 patients were classified as slow (IGR &amp;amp;lt; 10 mL/h) and 126 fast progressors (IGR &amp;amp;ge; 10 mL/h). In multivariable analyses, fast progressors had a lower likelihood of achieving ENI after endovascular thrombectomy (odds ratio, 0.442; 95% confidence intervals, 0.269&amp;amp;ndash;0.729, p = 0.001) as compared to slow progressors. Subgroup analyses further confirmed these results. Furthermore, the odds of ENI decreased by 7.3% for each 5 mL/h increase in the IGR (odds ratio, 0.927; 95% confidence intervals, 0.875&amp;amp;ndash;0.982, p = 0.011). Conclusions: The present study found that the pre-treatment IGR was associated with ENI in thrombectomy patients.</p>

                Background Pregnancy loss, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and early losses, affects millions globally. Approximately 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affecting 1-2% of couples. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological, psychological, and assisted reproductive technology (ART) interventions in improving clinical and psychological outcomes for women experiencing pregnancy loss. Objective To assess the impact of pharmacological, psychological, and ART interventions on clinical and psychological outcomes in women experiencing pregnancy loss and identify gaps in healthcare delivery. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, 18 studies published between 2020 and 2024 were analyzed using data from PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Studies were included if they assessed interventions for pregnancy loss, focusing on pharmacological therapies, psychological approaches, and ART. Statistical heterogeneity (I2 statistic) and publication bias (Egger’s regression test) were evaluated. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses explored variations across geographic, demographic, and methodological factors. Results Pharmacological therapies, including mifepristone and misoprostol, significantly improved tissue expulsion (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.8–4.3) and patient satisfaction. Low-dose aspirin increased live birth rates by 22% (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10–1.35). Psychological interventions such as mindfulness and art therapy reduced stress (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.30) and enhanced quality of life. ART interventions, especially immediate frozen embryo transfer (FET), improved clinical pregnancy rates (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07–1.23). Subgroup analyses identified lower intervention efficacy in low-resource settings, while home-based misoprostol showed safety but limited efficacy in reducing postpartum hemorrhage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-286/v1?src=rss">Agroforestry systems in Ethiopia: A systematic review of climate change mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable land management potential [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This review examines the role of agroforestry systems in Ethiopia, focusing on their contributions to soil health improvement and carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. The study utilized a meta-analysis approach, gathering data from prominent databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and AGRICOLA. Keywords related to agroforestry and climate change mitigation were used to screen relevant studies. A total of 54 studies were included after systematic screening and full-text review based on eligibility criteria. The analysis employed both descriptive and quantitative synthesis to evaluate the effectiveness of agroforestry in improving soil fertility, carbon sequestration, and resilience to climate change. The results showed that agroforestry systems, including parkland and coffee-based systems enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) and increase soil fertility. Coffee-based agroforestry systems, for instance, sequester up to 7.2 tons of CO₂ per hectare annually, while home-gardens in southern Ethiopia store up to 150 tons of carbon per hectare. The integration of drought-resistant species further improves soil moisture retention and boosts productivity in arid areas. In addition to environmental benefits, agroforestry systems also support food security and economic resilience by diversifying income sources and stabilizing yields in the face of climate variability. The findings underscore the significant potential of agroforestry systems in enhancing soil health, sequestering carbon, and contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation in Ethiopia.

                <p>Motivated behaviors, such as social interactions, are governed by the interplay between mesocorticolimbic structures, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Adverse childhood experiences and early life stress (ELS) can impact these networks and behaviors, which is associated with increased risk for psychiatric illnesses. While it is known that the VTA projects to both the BLA and mPFC, the influence of these inputs on local network activity which govern behavioral states&mdash;and whether ELS impacts VTA-mediated network communication&mdash;remains unknown. Our study demonstrates that VTA inputs influence BLA oscillations and entrainment of mPFC activity in mice and that ELS weakens the ability of the VTA to coordinate BLA network states, while also impairing dopaminergic signaling between VTA and BLA. Optogenetic stimulation of VTA<SUB>BLA</SUB> terminals decreased social interaction in ELS mice, which can be recapitulated in control mice by inhibiting VTA-&gt;BLA communication. These data suggest that ELS impacts social reward via the VTA-&gt;BLA dopamine network.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/11/e0135242025?rss=1">Reference Frames for Encoding of Translation and Tilt in the Caudal Cerebellar Vermis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many daily behaviors rely on estimates of our body's motion and orientation in space. Vestibular signals are essential for such estimates, but to contribute appropriately, two key computations are required. First, ambiguous motion information from otolith organs must be combined with spatially transformed rotational signals (e.g., from the canals) to distinguish head translation from tilt. Second, tilt and translation estimates must be transformed from a head- to a body-centered reference frame to correctly interpret the body's motion. Studies have shown that cells in the caudal cerebellar vermis (nodulus and ventral uvula, NU) reflect the output of the first set of computations to estimate translation and tilt. However, it remains unknown whether these estimates are encoded exclusively in head-centered coordinates or whether they reflect further transformation toward body-centered coordinates. Here, we addressed this question by examining how the 3D spatial tuning of otolith and canal signals on translation- and tilt-selective NU Purkinje cells in male rhesus monkeys varies with changes in head-re-body and body-re-gravity orientation. We show that NU cell tuning properties are consistent with head-centered otolith signal coding during translation. Furthermore, while canal signals in the NU have been transformed into a specific world-referenced rotation signal indicating reorientation relative to gravity (tilt), as needed to resolve the tilt/translation ambiguity, the resulting tilt estimates are encoded in head-centered coordinates. Our results thus suggest that body-centered motion and orientation estimates required for postural control, navigation, and reaching are computed elsewhere, either by further transforming NU outputs or via computations in other parallel pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/11/e0238242024?rss=1">Does Amplitude Compression Help or Hinder Attentional Neural Speech Tracking?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amplitude compression is an indispensable feature of contemporary audio production and especially relevant in modern hearing aids. The cortical fate of amplitude-compressed speech signals is not well studied, however, and may yield undesired side effects: We hypothesize that compressing the amplitude envelope of continuous speech reduces neural tracking. Yet, leveraging such a "compression side effect" on unwanted, distracting sounds could potentially support attentive listening if effectively reducing their neural tracking. In this study, we examined 24 young normal hearing (NH) individuals, 19 older hearing-impaired (HI) individuals, and 12 older normal hearing individuals. Participants were instructed to focus on one of two competing talkers while ignoring the other. Envelope compression (1:8 ratio, loudness-matched) was applied to one or both streams containing short speech repeats. Electroencephalography allowed us to quantify the cortical response function and degree of speech tracking. With compression applied to the attended target stream, HI participants showed reduced behavioral accuracy, and compressed speech yielded generally lowered metrics of neural tracking. Importantly, we found that compressing the ignored stream resulted in a stronger neural representation of the uncompressed target speech. Our results imply that intelligent compression algorithms, with variable compression ratios applied to separated sources, could help individuals with hearing loss suppress distraction in complex multitalker environments.</p>

                <p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) effectively treats motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), with the globus pallidus interna (GPi) commonly targeted. However, its therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. We employed optogenetic stimulation in the entopeduncular nucleus (EP), the rat homolog of GPi, in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned female Sprague Dawley rat model of PD. We quantified behavioral effects of optogenetic EP DBS on motor symptoms and conducted single-unit recordings in EP and ventral lateral motor thalamus (VL) to examine changes in neural activity. High-frequency optogenetic EP DBS (75, 100, 130&nbsp;Hz) reduced ipsilateral turning and corrected forelimb stepping, while low-frequency stimulation (5 and 20&nbsp;Hz) had no effect. EP and VL neurons exhibited mixed response during stimulation, with both increased and decreased firing. The average firing rate of all recorded neurons in the EP and VL significantly increased at 130&nbsp;Hz but not at other frequencies. Beta-band oscillatory activity was reduced in most EP neurons across high frequencies (75, 100, 130&nbsp;Hz), while reductions in beta-band oscillations in VL occurred only at 130&nbsp;Hz. These findings suggest that the neural firing rates within EP and VL circuits were differentially modulated by EP DBS; they may not fully explain the frequency-dependent behavioral effect. Instead, high-frequency optogenetic EP DBS at 130&nbsp;Hz may ameliorate parkinsonian motor symptoms by reducing abnormal oscillatory activity in the EP&ndash;VL circuits. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of circuit-specific modulation in the pallidothalamic pathway using optogenetic EP DBS to alleviate motor deficits in a PD rat model.</p>

                <p>Birdsong is hierarchically organized in time, like speech and other communication behaviors. Syllables are produced in sequences to form song motifs and bouts. While syllables are copied from tutors, the factors that determine song temporal organization, including syllable sequencing (syntax), are unknown. Here, we tested the roles of learning and species genetics in song organization. We manipulated juvenile song experience and genetics in three species of estrildid finches (zebra finches, <I>Taeniopygia guttata castanotis</I>; long-tailed finches, <I>Poephila acuticauda</I>; Bengalese finches, <I>Lonchura striata</I> var. <I>domestica</I>). We analyzed the adult songs of male birds that were: (1) tutored by conspecifics; (2) untutored; (3) tutored by heterospecifics; and (4) genetic hybrids. Song macrostructure, syllable sequencing, and syllable timing were quantified and compared within and across species. Results showed that song organization was consistent within a species and differed across species, regardless of experience. Temporal features did not differ between tutored and untutored birds of the same species. The songs of birds tutored by other species were composed of heterospecific syllables produced in sequences typical of conspecific songs. The songs of genetic hybrids showed the organization of both parental species, despite the fact that only males sing. Results indicate that song organization is predicted by species rather than experience.</p>

                <p>When we listen to speech, our brain&rsquo;s neurophysiological responses "track" its acoustic features, but it is less well understood how these auditory responses are enhanced by linguistic content. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography responses while subjects of both sexes listened to four types of continuous speechlike passages: speech envelope&ndash;modulated noise, English-like nonwords, scrambled words, and a narrative passage. Temporal response function (TRF) analysis provides strong neural evidence for the emergent features of speech processing in the cortex, from acoustics to higher-level linguistics, as incremental steps in neural speech processing. Critically, we show a stepwise hierarchical progression of progressively higher-order features over time, reflected in both bottom-up (early) and top-down (late) processing stages. Linguistically driven top-down mechanisms take the form of late N400-like responses, suggesting a central role of predictive coding mechanisms at multiple levels. As expected, the neural processing of lower-level acoustic feature responses is bilateral or right lateralized, with left lateralization emerging only for lexicosemantic features. Finally, our results identify potential neural markers, linguistic-level late responses, derived from TRF components modulated by linguistic content, suggesting that these markers are indicative of speech comprehension rather than mere speech perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/11/e1209242025?rss=1">The Evolving Cerebellar and Cerebello-cortical Functional Connectivity Architecture during Infancy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The conventional understanding of the cerebellum as a sole movement control center has become obsolete, given its role in various higher-order functions, including cognition, emotion, and social processing. As these functions emerge during infancy, it is logical to assume that the cerebellum's functional organization evolve in tandem or preemptively to underpin these functions. However, the longitudinal development of the cerebellum's functional architecture during the crucial early years of infant life remains largely unexplored, highlighting a significant research gap. In this study, leveraging a large cohort of both male and female full-term (FT; <I>n</I> = 155) and preterm (PT; <I>n</I> = 67) infants, we aimed to delineate the development of within-cerebellum and cerebello-cortical functional connections during the first 2&nbsp;years of life. Our findings highlight comprehensive functional synchronization within the neonatal cerebellum with a striking cortical projection focus on primary sensorimotor and visual cortices. While the within-cerebellum synchronization demonstrated early emergence in neonates and developmental stability during the initial 2&nbsp;years, the cerebello-cortical projection patterns evolved dramatically, marked by specialization, shifting, and higher-order cortex integration, providing exciting evidence of the cerebellum's potential involvement in higher-order functions from infancy. Furthermore, PT infants exhibited decreased cerebello-cortical connectivity compared with their FT counterparts, suggesting potential developmental alterations. These findings collectively illustrate a dynamic growth pattern of cerebellar functional organization marked by both within-cerebellum stability and cerebello-cortical projection plasticity with significant implications for long-term cognitive and socioemotional development.</p>

                <p>The influence of neural activity on astrocytes and their reciprocal interactions with neurons has emerged as an important modulator of synapse function. Astrocytes exhibit activity-dependent changes in gene expression, yet the molecular mechanisms by which neural activity is coupled to gene expression are not well understood. The molecular signaling pathway, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), mediates neuron&ndash;astrocyte communication and regulates the organization of cortical synapses. Here, we demonstrate that neural activity stimulates Shh signaling in cortical astrocytes and upregulates expression of Hevin and SPARC, astrocyte-derived molecules that modify synapses. Whisker stimulation in both male and female mice promotes activity-dependent Shh signaling selectively in the somatosensory, but not in the visual cortex, whereas sensory deprivation reduces Shh activity, demonstrating bidirectional regulation of the pathway by sensory experience. Selective loss of Shh signaling in astrocytes reduces expression of Hevin and SPARC and occludes activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Taken together, these data identify Shh signaling as an activity-dependent, molecular signaling pathway that regulates astrocyte gene expression and promotes astrocyte modulation of synaptic plasticity.</p>

                <p>Microglia respond to cytotoxic protein aggregates associated with the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Pathological protein aggregates activate the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in proinflammatory signaling, secretion, and potentially pyroptotic cell death. We characterized mixed sex primary mouse microglia exposed to microbial stressors and alpha synuclein preformed fibrils (&alpha;syn PFFs) to identify cellular mechanisms related to Parkinson's disease. Microglia package and release the endosome fate regulator Coronin1A (Coro1A) in EVs in an <I>Nlrp3</I>-dependent manner in widely used experimental activation conditions. We were surprised to find that Coro1A packaging and release was not <I>Nlrp3</I>-dependent in &alpha;syn PFF exposure conditions. <I>Coro1A<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> microglia exposed to &alpha;syn PFFs trafficked more &alpha;syn to the lysosomal compartment increasing lysosomal membrane permeabilization. This corresponds to a decrease in &alpha;syn released in EVs suggesting that Coro1A functions to shunt pathological proteins to a secretory pathway to attenuate lysosomal stress. &alpha;syn PFF-driven lysosomal stress resulting from <I>Coro1a</I> loss was associated with enhanced cytotoxicity. Intrinsic apoptosis signaling was unaffected, but we observed elevated cytosolic cathepsin B and the presence of a cathepsin-associated 55&nbsp;kD PARP cleavage product. Postmortem analysis of the PD mesencephalon supported a role for Coro1A in microglia, revealing elevated levels of Coro1A protein in human PD brains compared with those of healthy donors. Findings are relevant to the distribution of pathological &alpha;syn and indicate that <I>Coro1a</I> protects microglia from lysosomal overload, inflammasome activation, and pyroptotic demise.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/11/e1385242025?rss=1">Local Differences in Network Organization in the Auditory and Parietal Cortex, Revealed with Single Neuron Activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The structure of local circuits is highly conserved across the cortex, yet the spatial and temporal properties of population activity differ fundamentally in sensory-level and association-level areas. In the sensory cortex, population activity has a shorter timescale and decays sharply over distance, supporting a population code for the fine-scale features of sensory stimuli. In the association cortex, population activity has a longer timescale and spreads over wider distances, a code that is suited to holding information in memory and driving behavior. We tested whether these differences in activity dynamics could be explained by differences in network structure. We targeted photostimulations to single excitatory neurons of layer 2/3, while monitoring surrounding population activity using two-photon calcium imaging. Experiments were performed in the auditory (AC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) within the same mice of both sexes, which also expressed a red fluorophore in somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM). In both cortical regions, photostimulations resulted in a spatially restricted zone of positive influence on neurons closely neighboring the targeted neuron and a more spatially diffuse zone of negative influence affecting more distant neurons (akin to a network-level "suppressive surround"). However, the relative spatial extents of positive and negative influence were different in AC and PPC. In PPC, the central zone of positive influence was wider, but the negative suppressive surround was more narrow than in AC, which could account for the larger-scale network dynamics in PPC. The more narrow central positive influence zone and wider suppressive surround in AC could serve to sharpen sensory representations.</p>

                <p>For a proper representation of the causal structure of the world, it is adaptive to consider both evidence for and evidence against causality. To take punishment as an example, the causality of a stimulus is unlikely if there is a temporal gap before punishment is received, but causality is credible if the stimulus immediately precedes punishment. In contrast, causality can be ruled out if the punishment occurred first. At the behavioral level, this is reflected in the associative principle of timing-dependent valence reversal: aversive memories are formed when a stimulus occurs before the punishment, whereas memories of appetitive valence are formed when a stimulus is presented upon the relieving termination of punishment. We map the temporal profile of memories induced by optogenetic activation of the PPL1-01 neuron in the fly <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> (of either sex) and find that compromising tyrosine hydroxylase function, either acutely by pharmacological methods or by cell-specific RNAi, extends and blunts this profile. Specifically, it (1) enhances learning with a time gap between the stimulus and PPL1-01 punishment (better trace conditioning), (2) impairs learning when the stimulus immediately precedes PPL1-01 punishment (worse delay conditioning), and (3) prevents learning about a stimulus presented after PPL1-01 punishment has ceased (worse relief conditioning). Under conditions of low dopamine, we furthermore observe a role for serotonin that is pronounced in trace conditioning, weaker in delay conditioning, and absent in relief conditioning. We discuss the psychiatric implications if related alterations in the temporal profile of reinforcement were to occur in humans.</p>

                <p>How the prefrontal cortex contributes to working memory remains controversial, as theories differ in their emphasis on its role in storing memories versus controlling their content. To adjudicate between these competing ideas, we tested how perturbations to the human (both sexes) lateral prefrontal cortex impact the storage and control aspects of working memory during a task that requires human subjects to allocate resources to memory items based on their behavioral priority. Our computational model made a strong prediction that disruption of this control process would counterintuitively improve memory for low-priority items. Remarkably, transcranial magnetic stimulation of retinotopically-defined superior precentral sulcus, but not intraparietal sulcus, unbalanced the prioritization of resources, improving memory for low-priority items as predicted by the model. Therefore, these results provide direct causal support for models in which the prefrontal cortex controls the allocation of resources that support working memory, rather than simply storing the features of memoranda.</p>

                <p>Early age at menarche (early AAM) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are reproductive and metabolic disorders with overlapping pathophysiological and genetic features. Epidemiological studies suggest a link between these two conditions, both of which are characterized by dysregulation of the neuroendocrine pathways that control pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, thus affecting gonadotropin release, particularly luteinizing hormone secretion. A common pathophysiology involving positive energy balance and abnormal metabolic status is evident in both disorders. Genetic and epigenetic factors influence the onset of puberty and reproductive outcomes. Genome-wide association studies have identified common genetic variants associated with AAM and PCOS, particularly in genes related to the neuroendocrine axis (e.g., <I>FSHB</I>) and obesity (e.g., <I>FTO</I>). In addition, high-throughput sequencing has revealed rare loss-of-function variants in the <I>DLK1</I> gene in women with central precocious puberty (CPP), early menarche, and PCOS, who experienced adverse metabolic outcomes in adulthood. This review explores the shared pathophysiological mechanisms between CPP/early AAM and PCOS, examines potential genetic and epigenetic factors that may link these neuroendocrine reproductive conditions, and offers insights into future research and treatment strategies. Understanding these connections may provide new targets for therapeutic interventions and improve outcomes for individuals with these reproductive disorders.</p>

                <p>Dopamine critically regulates neuronal excitability and promotes synaptic plasticity in the striatum, thereby shaping network connectivity and influencing behavior. These functions establish dopamine as a key neuromodulator, whose release properties have been well studied in rodents but remain understudied in nonhuman primates. This study aims to close this gap by investigating the properties of dopamine release in macaque striatum and comparing/contrasting them to better-characterized mouse striatum, using ex vivo brain slices from male and female animals. Using combined electrochemical techniques and photometry with fluorescent dopamine sensors, we found that evoked dopamine signals have smaller amplitudes in macaques compared with those in mice. Interestingly, cholinergic-dependent dopamine release, which accounts for two-thirds of evoked dopamine release in mouse slices, is significantly reduced in macaques, providing a potential mechanistic underpinning for the observed species difference. In macaques, only nicotinic receptors with alpha-6 subunits contribute to evoked dopamine release, whereas in mice, both alpha-6 and non-alpha6-containing receptors are involved. We also identified robust potentiation of dopamine release in both species when GABA<SUB>A</SUB> and GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors were blocked. This potentiation was stronger in macaques, with an average increase of 50%, compared with 15% in mice. Together, these results suggest that dopamine release in macaque is under stronger GABA-mediated inhibition and that weaker cholinergic-mediated dopamine release may account for the smaller amplitude of evoked dopamine signals in macaque slices.</p>

                <p>Odor perception plays a critical role in early human development, but the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood. To investigate these, we presented appetitive and aversive odors to infants of both sexes at 1&nbsp;month of age while recording functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and nasal airflow data. Infants slept during odor presentation to allow MRI scanning. We found that odors evoke robust fMRI activity in the bilateral olfactory cortex and thalamus and that fMRI response magnitudes in the olfactory cortex differ across odors. However, in contrast to prior work in adults, we did not find compelling evidence that odor stimuli evoke discriminable fMRI activity patterns in the olfactory cortex or thalamus using two different multivariate pattern analysis techniques. Finally, the average inhale airflow rate was higher for appetitive odors than aversive odors, which tentatively suggests that infants could modulate their respiration to reflect odor valence. Overall, these results show strong neural responses to odors at this early developmental stage and highlight nasal airflow as a behavioral metric for assessing odor preference in infants.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease is characterized by the presence of alpha-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) primarily containing Lewy bodies in neurons. Despite decades of extensive research on &alpha;-syn accumulation, its molecular mechanisms have remained largely unexplored. Recent studies by us and others have suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosomes, can mediate the release of &alpha;-syn from cells and inhibiting this pathway could result in increased intracellular &alpha;-syn levels. In this study, we have discovered that elevated levels of &alpha;-syn themselves lead to reduced &alpha;-syn -containing EVs in &alpha;-syn&ndash;inducible H4 cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons from both sexes. Our investigations have revealed that the impairment in EV secretion is not due to their generation but rather a consequence of changes in a soluble <I>N</I>-ethylmaleimide&ndash;sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein, YKT6. Specifically, as &alpha;-syn levels increase, membrane-associated YKT6 is reduced. Pharmacological inhibition of farnesylation using FTI has led to decreased EV secretion and subsequent elevated levels of &alpha;-syn. In summary, our findings suggest that increased levels of &alpha;-syn impair YKT6-mediated EV secretion, establishing a detrimental cycle of intracellular &alpha;-syn accumulation in human DA neurons.</p>

                <p>Recent findings have shifted the view of cholecystokinin (CCK) from being a cellular neuronal marker to being recognized as a crucial neuropeptide pivotal in synaptic plasticity and memory processes. Despite its now appreciated importance in various brain regions and abundance in the basal ganglia, its role in the striatum, which is vital for motor control, remains unclear. This study sought to fill this gap by performing a comprehensive investigation of the role of CCK in modulating striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) membrane properties, as well as the secondary somatosensory cortex S2 to MSN synaptic transmission and plasticity in rodents. Using in vivo optopatch-clamp recording in mice on identified MSNs, we showed that the application of CCK receptor Type 2 (CCK2R) antagonists decreases corticostriatal transmission in both direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moving to an ex vivo rat preparation to maximize experimental access, we showed that CCK2R inhibition impacts MSN membrane properties by reducing spike threshold and rheobase, suggesting an excitability increase. Moreover, CCK modulates corticostriatal transmission mainly via CCK2R, and CCK2R blockage shifted spike-timing&ndash;dependent plasticity from long-term potentiation to long-term depression. Our study advances the understanding of CCK's importance in modulating corticostriatal transmission. By showing how CCK2R blockade influences synaptic function and plasticity, we provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying striatal functions, opening new paths for exploring its potential relevance to neurological disorders involving basal ganglia-related behaviors.</p>

                <p>Electrophysiology recordings from the brain using laminar multielectrode arrays allow researchers to measure the activity of many neurons simultaneously. However, laminar microelectrode arrays move relative to their surrounding neural tissue for a variety of reasons, such as pulsation, changes in intracranial pressure, and decompression of neural tissue after insertion. Inferring and correcting for this motion stabilizes the recording and is critical to identify and track single neurons across time. Such motion correction is a preprocessing step of standard spike-sorting methods. However, estimating motion robustly and accurately in electrophysiology recordings is challenging due to the stochasticity of the neural data. To tackle this problem, we introduce <b>MEDiCINe</b> (<b>M</b>otion <b>E</b>stimation by <b>Di</b>stributional <b>C</b>ontrastive <b>I</b>nference for <b>Ne</b>urophysiology), a novel motion estimation method. We show that MEDiCINe outperforms existing motion estimation methods on an extensive suite of simulated neurophysiology recordings and leads to more accurate spike sorting. We also show that MEDiCINe accurately estimates the motion in primate and rodent electrophysiology recordings with a variety of motion and stability statistics. We open-source MEDiCINe, usage instructions, examples integrating MEDiCINe with common tools for spike sorting, and data and code for reproducing our results. This open software will enable other researchers to use MEDiCINe to improve spike sorting results and get the most out of their electrophysiology datasets.</p>

                Hydatid disease is a significant public health concern in endemic regions. The liver and lungs are the primary sites of infection, and mediastinal localization is extremely rare. We report the case of a 34-year-old patient with no significant medical history, who presented with right basithoracic pain and exertional dyspnea. Chest radiography revealed mediastinal widening, and further imaging with chest CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a right anterosuperior multivesicular mediastinal hydatid cyst adjacent to the pericardium. The patient underwent surgery with favorable postoperative outcomes.

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring. Conclusion Ethiopian forests are home for various yeast species including the stress-tolerant wild yeasts. This study highlights the significant yeast diversity in Ethiopian forests, with potential applications in improving industrial fermentation processes that operate under stressful conditions.

                <p>by Zachary B. Haiman, Alicia Key, Angelo D’Alessandro, Bernhard O. Palsson</p>

Advancements with cost-effective, high-throughput omics technologies have had a transformative effect on both fundamental and translational research in the medical sciences. These advancements have facilitated a departure from the traditional view of human red blood cells (RBCs) as mere carriers of hemoglobin, devoid of significant biological complexity. Over the past decade, proteomic analyses have identified a growing number of different proteins present within RBCs, enabling systems biology analysis of their physiological functions. Here, we introduce RBC-GEM, one of the most comprehensive, curated genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of a specific human cell type to-date. It was developed through meta-analysis of proteomic data from 29 studies published over the past two decades resulting in an RBC proteome composed of more than 4,600 distinct proteins. Through workflow-guided manual curation, we have compiled the metabolic reactions carried out by this proteome to form a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of the RBC. RBC-GEM is hosted on a version-controlled GitHub repository, ensuring adherence to the standardized protocols for metabolic reconstruction quality control and data stewardship principles. RBC-GEM represents a metabolic network is a consisting of 820 genes encoding proteins acting on 1,685 unique metabolites through 2,723 biochemical reactions: a 740% size expansion over its predecessor. We demonstrated the utility of RBC-GEM by creating context-specific proteome-constrained models derived from proteomic data of stored RBCs for 616 blood donors, and classified reactions based on their simulated abundance dependence. This reconstruction as an up-to-date curated GEM can be used for contextualization of data and for the construction of a computational whole-cell models of the human RBC.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Grid and place cells typically fire at progressively earlier phases within each cycle of the theta rhythm as rodents run across their firing fields, a phenomenon known as theta phase precession. Here, we report theta phase precession relative to turning angle in theta-modulated head direction cells within the anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AVN). As rodents turn their heads, these cells fire at progressively earlier phases as head direction sweeps over their preferred tuning direction. The degree of phase precession increases with angular head velocity. Moreover, phase precession is more pronounced in those theta-modulated head direction cells that exhibit theta skipping, with a stronger theta-skipping effect correlating with a higher degree of phase precession. These findings are consistent with a ring attractor model that integrates external theta input with internal firing rate adaptation—a phenomenon we identified in head direction cells within AVN. Our results broaden the range of information known to be subject to neural phase coding and enrich our understanding of the neural dynamics supporting spatial orientation and navigation.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) is proposed to be the molecular mechanism underlying learning and memory in the brain. A key event for LTP is the influx of calcium into post-synaptic neurons via multiple ion channel control systems. One such system involves <i>N</i>-methyl-<i>D</i>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which were originally believed to be essential for LTP and new learning. Recent studies have demonstrated that hippocampal NMDARs are critical for learning new spatial information in a novel environment; however, when pre-training occurs prior to new spatial learning, these receptors are not needed. Additionally, researchers have shown that activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and their associated calcium influx can induce LTP independent of NMDARs. These findings led to the idea that the amount of calcium required for learning in hippocampus depends on whether the new learning takes place in a novel or familiar environment, with a novel environment demanding greater calcium influx. It was hypothesized that to impair new learning in a familiar environment both NMDARs and VGCCs would need to be blocked. Long-Evans rats were trained in a three-phase version of the Morris water task, which included pre-training, new learning mass-training, and a probe test. Prior to mass-training, intrahippocampal VGCCs were blocked individually or in combination with NMDARs blockade to evaluate their effects on the rats learning and memory. The results showed that blocking both NMDARs and VGCCs simultaneously impaired new spatial learning with familiar information, whereas VGCC blockade alone did not.</p>

                The extensive use of plastic without an effective management system is linked to significant environmental pollution issues. The fragmentation of various types of plastic waste leads to the formation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). NPs, measuring less than 0.1 μm pose a latent danger to the human food chain caused by the ability to traverse biological membranes than MPs, potentially leading to various chronic diseases. The widespread distribution of NPs across diverse environmental matrices and their subsequent infiltration into food and feed chains precipitates various emerging health concerns. NPs contaminate food production systems and leach from plastic packaging, infiltrating organisms at various trophic levels. Seafood, processed foods, and drinking water serve as vectors for absorption and accumulation in human tissues. The pervasive contamination pathway poses substantial risks to human health through multiple exposure routes, primarily ingestion. It can lead to cytotoxicity, inflammation, genotoxicity, and apoptosis. This review summarizes the implications of NPs exposure that triggers various diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), kidney dysfunction, liver disease, heart problems, brain disorders, reproductive issues, and cancer. Currently, no established method exists to treat NPs that humans may have already ingested. Hence, it is urgent to mitigate the harmful effects of NPs through the development and implementation of innovative, efficient, and sustainable environmental decontamination strategies. This discussion highlights several advanced remediation techniques that can effectively reduce the toxicity of NPs in environmental systems, thus mitigating their associated risks.
