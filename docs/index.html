              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08140">ConFER: A Neurally Constrained Computational Model of Context-Dependent Fear Extinction Recall and Relapse</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure therapy, a standard treatment for anxiety disorders, relies on fear extinction. However, extinction recall is often limited to the spatial and temporal context in which it is learned leading to fear relapse in novel contexts or after delays. While animal studies provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying extinction recall, their invasive nature limits direct applicability to human research. Computational models that incorporate findings from animal research and generate testable hypotheses for human studies can bridge this gap. Current models, however, often focus either on detailed neuron-level activity, limiting their scope, or simulate behavior by abstracting away from neural mechanisms. Moreover, they tend not to disentangle the distinct roles of cue and context information in fear extinction and recall. To address these limitations, we present the Context-Dependent Fear Extinction Recall Model (ConFER), a systems-level, neurally constrained model of fear extinction and recall, and fear relapse. ConFER integrates findings from the neural fear circuit, including distinct pathways for processing cue and context information and valence-based stimulus-responsive regions in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that encode extinction and fear memories. These pathways independently activate positive and/or negative BLA representations based on learned associations, which compete to produce the final fear response. ConFER simulates fear renewal across various contexts and spontaneous recovery after delays, while also generating novel, testable predictions. Notably, it predicts that counterconditioning may confer greater resilience than extinction in preventing relapse in new contexts or after delays. By providing a mechanistic view of the relapse of fear, ConFER offers potential insights to enhance clinical interventions by improving exposure therapy outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08221">SynapsNet: Enhancing Neuronal Population Dynamics Modeling via Learning Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of large-scale neuronal population datasets necessitates new methods to model population dynamics and extract interpretable, scientifically translatable insights. Existing deep learning methods often overlook the biological mechanisms underlying population activity and thus exhibit suboptimal performance with neuronal data and provide little to no interpretable information about neurons and their interactions. In response, we introduce SynapsNet, a novel deep-learning framework that effectively models population dynamics and functional interactions between neurons. Within this biologically realistic framework, each neuron, characterized by a latent embedding, sends and receives currents through directed connections. A shared decoder uses the input current, previous neuronal activity, neuron embedding, and behavioral data to predict the population activity in the next time step. Unlike common sequential models that treat population activity as a multichannel time series, SynapsNet applies its decoder to each neuron (channel) individually, with the learnable functional connectivity serving as the sole pathway for information flow between neurons. Our experiments, conducted on mouse cortical activity from publicly available datasets and recorded using the two most common population recording modalities (Ca imaging and Neuropixels) across three distinct tasks, demonstrate that SynapsNet consistently outperforms existing models in forecasting population activity. Additionally, our experiments on both real and synthetic data showed that SynapsNet accurately learns functional connectivity that reveals predictive interactions between neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08251">Rethinking category-selectivity in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wealth of studies report evidence that occipitotemporal cortex tessellates into "category-selective" brain regions that are apparently specialized for representing ecologically important visual stimuli like faces, bodies, scenes, and tools. Here, we argue that while valuable insights have been gained through the lens of category-selectivity, a more complete view of visual function in occipitotemporal cortex requires centering the behavioral relevance of visual properties in real-world environments rather than stimulus category. Focusing on behavioral relevance challenges a simple mapping between stimulus and visual function in occipitotemporal cortex because the environmental properties relevant to a behavior are visually diverse and how a given property is represented is modulated by our goals. Grounding our thinking in behavioral relevance rather than category-selectivity raises a host of theoretical and empirical issues that we discuss while providing proposals for how existing tools can be harnessed in this light to better understand visual function in occipitotemporal cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08343">Brain Treebank: Large-scale intracranial recordings from naturalistic language stimuli</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Brain Treebank, a large-scale dataset of electrophysiological neural responses, recorded from intracranial probes while 10 subjects watched one or more Hollywood movies. Subjects watched on average 2.6 Hollywood movies, for an average viewing time of 4.3 hours, and a total of 43 hours. The audio track for each movie was transcribed with manual corrections. Word onsets were manually annotated on spectrograms of the audio track for each movie. Each transcript was automatically parsed and manually corrected into the universal dependencies (UD) formalism, assigning a part of speech to every word and a dependency parse to every sentence. In total, subjects heard over 38,000 sentences (223,000 words), while they had on average 168 electrodes implanted. This is the largest dataset of intracranial recordings featuring grounded naturalistic language, one of the largest English UD treebanks in general, and one of only a few UD treebanks aligned to multimodal features. We hope that this dataset serves as a bridge between linguistic concepts, perception, and their neural representations. To that end, we present an analysis of which electrodes are sensitive to language features while also mapping out a rough time course of language processing across these electrodes. The Brain Treebank is available at https://BrainTreebank.dev/

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08308">A Novel Approach to Characterize Dynamics of ECG-Derived Skin Nerve Activity via Time-Varying Spectral Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessment of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the major approaches for studying affective states. Skin nerve activity (SKNA) derived from high-frequency components of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has been a promising surrogate for assessing the SNS. However, current SKNA analysis tools have shown high variability across study protocols and experiments. Hence, we propose a time-varying spectral approach based on SKNA to assess the SNS with higher sensitivity and reliability. We collected ECG signals at a sampling frequency of 10 KHz from sixteen subjects who underwent various SNS stimulations. Our spectral analysis revealed that frequency bands between 150 - 1,000 Hz showed significant increases in power during SNS stimulations. Using this information, we developed a time-varying index of sympathetic function measurement based on SKNA, termed, Time-Varying Skin Nerve Activity (TVSKNA). TVSKNA is calculated in three steps: time-frequency decomposition, reconstruction using selected frequency bands, and smoothing. TVSKNA indices exhibited generally higher Youden's J, balanced accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, indicating higher sensitivity. The coefficient of variance was lower with TVSKNA indices for most SNS tasks. TVSKNA can serve as a highly sensitive and reliable marker of quantitative assessment of sympathetic function, especially during emotion and stress.

                arXiv:2111.10719v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network representations of the nervous system have been useful for the understanding of brain phenomena such as perception, motor coordination, and memory. Although brains are composed of both neurons and glial cells, neuron-glial networks have been little studied so far. Given the emergent role of glial cells in information transmission in the brain, we developed a mathematical representation for neuron-glial networks ($\Upsilon$-graph). We also defined the concepts of isomorphisms, unnested form (multidigraph) and matrix equation for $\Upsilon$-graphs. Although we found several network motives where the isomorphism between unnested forms does not guarantees the isomorphism between their respective $\Upsilon$-graphs, we found that if the matrix equations satisfy some conditions, the unnested forms isomorphism guarantees the isomorphism between $\Upsilon$-graphs. Finally, we introduced a novel approach to modeling the network shape. Our work presents a mathematical framework for working with neuron-glia networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08437">Evolutionary Algorithm with Detection Region Method for Constrained Multi-Objective Problems with Binary Constraints</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) is a challenging task. While many practical algorithms have been developed to tackle CMOPs, real-world scenarios often present cases where the constraint functions are unknown or unquantifiable, resulting in only binary outcomes (feasible or infeasible). This limitation reduces the effectiveness of constraint violation guidance, which can negatively impact the performance of existing algorithms that rely on this approach. Such challenges are particularly detrimental for algorithms employing the epsilon-based method, as they hinder effective relaxation of the feasible region. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called DRMCMO based on the detection region method. In DRMCMO, detection regions dynamic monitor feasible solutions to enhance convergence, helping the population escape local optima. Additionally, these regions collaborate with the neighbor pairing strategy to improve population diversity within narrow feasible areas. We have modified three existing test suites to serve as benchmark test problems for CMOPs with binary constraints(CMOP/BC) and conducted comprehensive comparative experiments with state-of-the-art algorithms on these test suites and real-world problems. The results demonstrate the strong competitiveness of DRMCMO against state-of-the-art algorithms. Given the limited research on CMOP/BC, our study offers a new perspective for advancing this field.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08735">New advances in universal approximation with neural networks of minimal width</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in diverse applications, prompting the need for a solid theoretical foundation. Recent research has identified the minimal width $\max\{2,d_x,d_y\}$ required for neural networks with input dimensions $d_x$ and output dimension $d_y$ that use leaky ReLU activations to universally approximate $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d_x},\mathbb{R}^{d_y})$ on compacta. Here, we present an alternative proof for the minimal width of such neural networks, by directly constructing approximating networks using a coding scheme that leverages the properties of leaky ReLUs and standard $L^p$ results. The obtained construction has a minimal interior dimension of $1$, independent of input and output dimensions, which allows us to show that autoencoders with leaky ReLU activations are universal approximators of $L^p$ functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalizing flow LU-Net serves as a distributional universal approximator. We broaden our results to show that smooth invertible neural networks can approximate $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{d},\mathbb{R}^{d})$ on compacta when the dimension $d\geq 2$, which provides a constructive proof of a classical theorem of Brenier and Gangbo. In addition, we use a topological argument to establish that for FNNs with monotone Lipschitz continuous activations, $d_x+1$ is a lower bound on the minimal width required for the uniform universal approximation of continuous functions $C^0(\mathbb{R}^{d_x},\mathbb{R}^{d_y})$ on compacta when $d_x\geq d_y$.

                arXiv:2411.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Printed electronics technology offers a cost-effectiveand fully-customizable solution to computational needs beyondthe capabilities of traditional silicon technologies, offering ad-vantages such as on-demand manufacturing and conformal, low-cost hardware. However, the low-resolution fabrication of printedelectronics, which results in large feature sizes, poses a challengefor integrating complex designs like those of machine learn-ing (ML) classification systems. Current literature optimizes onlythe Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) circuit within the classificationsystem, while the cost of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)is overlooked. Printed applications frequently require on-sensorprocessing, yet while the digital classifier has been extensivelyoptimized, the analog-to-digital interfacing, specifically the ADCs,dominates the total area and energy consumption. In this work,we target digital printed MLP classifiers and we propose thedesign of customized ADCs per MLP's input which involvesminimizing the distinct represented numbers for each input,simplifying thus the ADC's circuitry. Incorporating this ADCoptimization in the MLP training, enables eliminating ADC levelsand the respective comparators, while still maintaining highclassification accuracy. Our approach achieves 11.2x lower ADCarea for less than 5% accuracy drop across varying MLPs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08798">Learning Gaussian Multi-Index Models with Gradient Flow: Time Complexity and Directional Convergence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the gradient flow dynamics of a neural network model that uses correlation loss to approximate a multi-index function on high-dimensional standard Gaussian data. Specifically, the multi-index function we consider is a sum of neurons $f^*(x) \!=\! \sum_{j=1}^k \! \sigma^*(v_j^T x)$ where $v_1, \dots, v_k$ are unit vectors, and $\sigma^*$ lacks the first and second Hermite polynomials in its Hermite expansion. It is known that, for the single-index case ($k\!=\!1$), overcoming the search phase requires polynomial time complexity. We first generalize this result to multi-index functions characterized by vectors in arbitrary directions. After the search phase, it is not clear whether the network neurons converge to the index vectors, or get stuck at a sub-optimal solution. When the index vectors are orthogonal, we give a complete characterization of the fixed points and prove that neurons converge to the nearest index vectors. Therefore, using $n \! \asymp \! k \log k$ neurons ensures finding the full set of index vectors with gradient flow with high probability over random initialization. When $ v_i^T v_j \!=\! \beta \! \geq \! 0$ for all $i \neq j$, we prove the existence of a sharp threshold $\beta_c \!=\! c/(c+k)$ at which the fixed point that computes the average of the index vectors transitions from a saddle point to a minimum. Numerical simulations show that using a correlation loss and a mild overparameterization suffices to learn all of the index vectors when they are nearly orthogonal, however, the correlation loss fails when the dot product between the index vectors exceeds a certain threshold.

                arXiv:2410.05787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) by introducing novel approaches for accelerating prediction strategies within the evolutionary algorithm framework. Since the objectives of DMOPs evolve over time, both the Pareto optimal set (PS) and the Pareto optimal front (PF) are dynamic. To effectively track the changes in the PS and PF in both decision and objective spaces, we propose an adaptive prediction strategy that incorporates second-order derivatives to predict and adjust the algorithms search behavior. This strategy enhances the algorithm's ability to anticipate changes in the environment, allowing for more efficient population re-initialization. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method against four state-of-the-art algorithms using standard DMOPs benchmark problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the other algorithms across most test problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02406">Automated Placement of Analog Integrated Circuits using Priority-based Constructive Heuristic</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a heuristic approach for solving the placement of Analog and Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits. Placement is a crucial step in the physical design of integrated circuits. During this step, designers choose the position and variant of each circuit device. We focus on the specific class of analog placement, which requires so-called pockets, their possible merging, and parametrizable minimum distances between devices, which are features mostly omitted in recent research and literature. We formulate the problem using Integer Linear Programming and propose a priority-based constructive heuristic inspired by algorithms for the Facility Layout Problem. Our solution minimizes the perimeter of the circuit's bounding box and the approximated wire length. Multiple variants of the devices with different dimensions are considered. Furthermore, we model constraints crucial for the placement problem, such as symmetry groups and blockage areas. Our outlined improvements make the heuristic suitable to handle complex rules of placement. With a search guided either by a Genetic Algorithm or a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, we show the quality of the proposed method on both synthetically generated and real-life industrial instances accompanied by manually created designs. Furthermore, we apply reinforcement learning to control the hyper-parameters of the genetic algorithm. Synthetic instances with more than 200 devices demonstrate that our method can tackle problems more complex than typical industry examples. We also compare our method with results achieved by contemporary state-of-the-art methods on the MCNC and GSRC datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08310">TreeC: a method to generate interpretable energy management systems using a metaheuristic algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2304.08310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy management systems (EMS) have traditionally been implemented using rule-based control (RBC) and model predictive control (MPC) methods. However, recent research has explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising alternative. This paper introduces TreeC, a machine learning method that utilizes the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy metaheuristic algorithm to generate an interpretable EMS modeled as a decision tree. Unlike RBC and MPC approaches, TreeC learns the decision strategy of the EMS based on historical data, adapting the control model to the controlled energy grid. The decision strategy is represented as a decision tree, providing interpretability compared to RL methods that often rely on black-box models like neural networks. TreeC is evaluated against MPC with perfect forecast and RL EMSs in two case studies taken from literature: an electric grid case and a household heating case. In the electric grid case, TreeC achieves an average energy loss and constraint violation score of 19.2, which is close to MPC and RL EMSs that achieve scores of 14.4 and 16.2 respectively. All three methods control the electric grid well especially when compared to the random EMS, which obtains an average score of 12 875. In the household heating case, TreeC performs similarly to MPC on the adjusted and averaged electricity cost and total discomfort (0.033 EUR/m$^2$ and 0.42 Kh for TreeC compared to 0.037 EUR/m$^2$ and 2.91 kH for MPC), while outperforming RL (0.266 EUR/m$^2$ and 24.41 Kh).

                arXiv:2404.07361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directly parameterizing and learning gradients of functions has widespread significance, with specific applications in inverse problems, generative modeling, and optimal transport. This paper introduces gradient networks (GradNets): novel neural network architectures that parameterize gradients of various function classes. GradNets exhibit specialized architectural constraints that ensure correspondence to gradient functions. We provide a comprehensive GradNet design framework that includes methods for transforming GradNets into monotone gradient networks (mGradNets), which are guaranteed to represent gradients of convex functions. Our results establish that our proposed GradNet (and mGradNet) universally approximate the gradients of (convex) functions. Furthermore, these networks can be customized to correspond to specific spaces of potential functions, including transformed sums of (convex) ridge functions. Our analysis leads to two distinct GradNet architectures, GradNet-C and GradNet-M, and we describe the corresponding monotone versions, mGradNet-C and mGradNet-M. Our empirical results demonstrate that these architectures provide efficient parameterizations and outperform existing methods by up to 15 dB in gradient field tasks and by up to 11 dB in Hamiltonian dynamics learning tasks.

                Background Glioma is the second most common type of brain tumor, accounting for 24% of all brain tumor cases. The current diagnostic procedure is through an invasive tissue sampling to obtain histopathological analysis, however, not all patients are able to undergo a high-risk procedure. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as promising biomarkers for glioma due to their sensitivity, specificity, and non-invasive properties. There is currently no defined miRNA profile that contributes to determining the grade of glioma. This study aims to find the answer for “Is there any significant miRNA that able to distinguish different grades of glioma?”. Methods This study was conducted to compare the expression of miRNAs between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG). Eighteen blood plasma samples from glioma patients and 6 healthy controls were analyzed for 798 human miRNA profiles using NanoString nCounter Human v3 miRNA Expression Assay. The differential expressions of miRNAs were then analyzed to identify the differences in miRNA expression between LGG and HGG. Results Analyses showed significant expressions in 12 miRNAs between LGG and HGG, where all of them were downregulated. Out of these significant miRNAs, miR-518b, miR-1271-3p, and miR-598-3p showed the highest potential for distinguishing HGG from LGG, with area under curve (AUC) values of 0.912, 0.889, and 0.991, respectively. Conclusion miR-518b, miR-1271-3p, and miR-598-3p demonstrate significant potentials in distinguishing LGG and HGG.

                Abstract Climate change is rapidly transforming ecosystems and reshaping the landscapes of animal health, with profound consequences for public health, food security, and biodiversity. Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters are driving the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, particularly zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. These environmental shifts endanger the health and welfare of animals and the delicate balance between human populations, livestock, and wildlife. As the stewards of animal health, veterinarians are uniquely positioned to lead the change in addressing these complex challenges at the nexus of human, animal, and environmental health and well-being. This article calls for urgent actions to integrate climate adaptation and mitigation strategies into veterinary practice and education. It underscores the critical need for veterinarians to embrace the One Health approach to tackle climate-driven disease outbreaks and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance to safeguard human and animal populations while protecting natural ecosystems. The article further explores the role of veterinarians in fostering sustainable agricultural practices, reducing the environmental impact of livestock production, conserving biodiversity and advocating for policy reforms that protect both animal and planetary health. As we face an era of unprecedented climate disruption, this call to action aims to inspire the global veterinary community to actively get involved in combating climate change and its worst impacts. By building climate-resilient practices, enhancing disease surveillance, and championing environmental stewardship, veterinarians can contribute significantly to a healthier, more sustainable future for all species on Earth.

                Background This study examines the growing trend of ethnicized leadership in Ethiopian higher education institutions and advocates for a shift toward merit-based governance to improve institutional integrity and performance. Since 1991, with the introduction of ethnic federalism, leadership appointments in Ethiopian universities have increasingly been based on ethnic identity rather than qualifications. This has led to governance challenges, weakened academic standards, and reduced institutional efficiency. The study highlights the need for governance reforms prioritizing meritocracy to enhance the quality and sustainability of Ethiopia’s ethnically diverse higher education system. Methods The study utilizes a qualitative research approach, combining both primary and secondary data. Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews with university administrators, faculty, and governance experts, while secondary data were gathered from institutional reports, government policies, and academic literature. Institutional theory, principal-agent theory, and meritocratic theory frame the analysis, providing insights into how ethnic-based leadership appointments affect university governance and performance. Results The findings reveal that ethnicized leadership has eroded governance structures, lowered academic quality, and compromised institutional efficiency. Leadership appointments based on ethnicity rather than merit have led to poor decision-making, weakened accountability, and reduced transparency. In contrast, merit-based governance improves accountability, decision-making, and institutional performance. The study emphasizes that transitioning to a meritocratic leadership model is vital for restoring institutional integrity and academic excellence in Ethiopian universities. Conclusions Ethnic federalism, while initially designed to empower regions, has politicized federal institutions, including universities, reducing them to regional entities rather than national institutions. This system of ethnicized leadership has fostered a culture of favoritism, rampant corruption, and ineffective governance, ultimately weakening Ethiopia’s higher education system. Recommendations Governance reforms that prioritize merit-based appointments are urgently needed. Legal reforms, transparent leadership selection processes, depoliticization efforts, and capacity-building initiatives are recommended to foster a meritocratic culture and improve institutional performance in Ethiopian universities.

                Background Traditional dietary assessments are often inaccurate and prone to self-reporting biases. Tracking the physiological responses associated with eating and digestion events via wearable technologies may provide an effective approach for continuously monitoring food intake and estimating energy consumption. Eating and digestion are accompanied by a series of changes in the heart rate, skin temperature, blood oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. These changes can be tracked by wearable devices, such as smartwatches, which have been widely accepted in the market. This systematic review is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking such physiological biomarkers in differentiating between high- and low-calorie meals, potentially paving the way for more accurate dietary monitoring. Methods Following the PRISMA-P guidelines, we will conduct a systematic literature search through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed for clinical trials that investigated physiological responses following meal intake in healthy subjects. Two independent reviewers will screen and select articles based on pre-defined eligibility criteria, with a third review to resolve any discrepancies. This will be followed by data extraction and quality assessment of the included studies. Statistical analyses, including meta-analyses, will be performed using R Studio software. Our primary outcome will be the comparison of physiological biomarkers before and after meal intake, while secondary outcomes will include comparisons of physiological biomarkers between high- and low-calorie meal consumption and the correlation between the caloric content of consumed meals and postprandial physiological changes. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will identify physiological indicators for eating events and inform the design of wearable sensors that estimate food intake in healthy subjects.

This increased burden demands new targeted therapies with novel compounds either synthetically produced or derived from indigenous plants, which could be a promising approach for the development of drugs. Euphorbia thymifolia L is a widely growing tropical herb that has been reported to have various ethnopharmacological properties. Although Euphorbia genus is reported to have anticancer properties, E. thymifolia is not reported to have anticancer properties to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to screen the phytoconstituents and identify the active compounds present in the methanolic extract of E. thymifolia (ME.ET) as ligands to inhibit human cancer cell lines with special reference to potential protein targets implicated in breast cancer using an In-silico approach. Methods ME.ET was subjected to GC-MS analysis to screen the phytoconstituents, and the identified compounds were docked with protein targets such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1), a serine/threonine kinase-1(AKT1), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), polo-like kinase-1(PLK1), and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK6). Compounds with good docking scores were further subjected to dynamic studies to understand the protein ligand binding stability, ligand pathway calculation, and molecular mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) calculations using the Schrodinger suite. Results GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 245 phytoconstituents, 219 of which were unique. When subjected to docking, these phytocompounds, namely 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl dibenzoate (TTDB) and succinic acid, 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl 4-isopropylphenyl ester (SADPE), showed good docking scores. Molecular dynamics studies showed a high affinity and low binding energy for TTDB with HER2, ERK1, and SADPE with ER. Conclusions Hence, in this study, we identified two lead compounds in E.thymifolia linn. Further invitro and invivo anticancer studies can be performed to confirm these results and to understand the molecular mechanism by which they exhibit anticancer activity against breast cancer.

                <p>Basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons are engaged by emotionally salient stimuli. An area of increasing interest is how BLA dynamics relate to evolving reward-seeking behavior, especially under situations of uncertainty or ambiguity. Here, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in male rats across the acquisition and extinction of conditioned reward seeking. We assessed ongoing neural dynamics in a task where long reward cue presentations preceded an unpredictable, variably time reward delivery. We found that, with training, BLA neurons discriminated the CS+ and CS&ndash; cues with sustained cue-evoked activity that correlated with behavior and terminated only after reward receipt. BLA neurons were bidirectionally modulated, with a majority showing prolonged inhibition during cued reward seeking. Strikingly, population-level analyses revealed that neurons showing cue-evoked inhibitions and those showing excitations similarly represented the CS+ and behavioral state. This sustained population code rapidly extinguished in parallel with conditioned behavior. We next assessed the contribution of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a major reciprocal partner to the BLA. Inactivation of the OFC while simultaneously recording in the BLA revealed a blunting of sustained cue-evoked activity in the BLA that accompanied reduced reward seeking. Optogenetic disruption of BLA activity and OFC terminals in the BLA also reduced reward seeking. Our data indicate that the BLA represents reward-seeking states via sustained, bidirectional cue-driven neural encoding. This code is regulated by cortical input and is important for the maintenance of vigilant reward-seeking behavior.</p>

                <p>The extent to which neural representations of fear experience depend on or generalize across the situational context has remained unclear. We systematically manipulated variation within and across three distinct fear-evocative situations including fear of heights, spiders, and social threats. Participants (<I>n</I> = 21; 10 females and 11 males) viewed ~20&nbsp;s clips depicting spiders, heights, or social encounters and rated fear after each video. Searchlight multivoxel pattern analysis was used to identify whether and which brain regions carry information that predicts fear experience and the degree to which the fear-predictive neural codes in these areas depend on or generalize across the situations. The overwhelming majority of brain regions carrying information about fear did so in a situation-dependent manner. These findings suggest that local neural representations of fear experience are unlikely to involve a singular pattern but rather a collection of multiple heterogeneous brain states.</p>

                <p>The prefrontal cortex is critical for decision-making across species, with its activity linked to choosing between options. Drift diffusion models (DDMs) are commonly employed to understand the neural computations underlying this behavior. Studies exploring the specific roles of regions of the rodent prefrontal cortex in controlling the decision process are limited. This study explored the role of the prelimbic cortex (PLC) in decision-making using a two-alternative forced-choice task. Rats first learned to report the location of a lateralized visual stimulus. The brightness of the stimulus indicated its reward value. Then, the rats learned to make choices between pairs of stimuli. Sex differences in learning were observed, with females responding faster and more selectively to high-value stimuli than males. DDM analysis found that males had decreased decision thresholds during initial learning, whereas females maintained a consistently higher drift rate. Pharmacological manipulations revealed that PLC inactivation reduced the decision threshold for all rats, indicating that less information was needed to make a choice in the absence of normal PLC processing. &mu;-Opioid receptor stimulation of the PLC had the opposite effect, raising the decision threshold and reducing bias in the decision process toward high-value stimuli. These effects were observed without any impact on the rats&rsquo; choice preferences. Our findings suggest that PLC has an inhibitory role in the decision process and regulates the amount of evidence that is required to make a choice. That is, PLC activity controls "when," but not "how," to act.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/46/e0583242024?rss=1">Deciphering Peripheral Taste Neuron Diversity: Using Genetic Identity to Bridge Taste Bud Innervation Patterns and Functional Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral taste neurons exhibit functional, genetic, and morphological diversity, yet understanding how or if these attributes combine into taste neuron types remains unclear. In this study, we used male and female mice to relate taste bud innervation patterns to the function of a subset of proenkephalin-expressing (Penk+) taste neurons. We found that taste arbors (the portion of the axon within the taste bud) stemming from Penk+ neurons displayed diverse branching patterns and lacked stereotypical endings. The range in complexity observed for individual taste arbors from Penk+ neurons mirrored the entire population, suggesting that taste arbor morphologies are not primarily regulated by the neuron type. Notably, the distinguishing feature of arbors from Penk+ neurons was their propensity to come within 110&nbsp;nm (in apposition with) different types of taste-transducing cells within the taste bud. This finding is contrary to the expectation of genetically defined taste neuron types that functionally represent a single stimulus. Consistently, further investigation of Penk+ neuron function revealed that they are more likely to respond to innately aversive stimuli&mdash;sour, bitter, and high salt concentrations&mdash;as compared with the full taste population. Penk+ neurons are less likely to respond to nonaversive stimuli&mdash;sucrose, umami, and low salt&mdash;compared with the full population. Our data support the presence of a genetically defined neuron type in the geniculate ganglion that is responsive to innately aversive stimuli. This implies that genetic expression might categorize peripheral taste neurons into hedonic groups, rather than simply identifying neurons that respond to a single stimulus.</p>

                <p>The sudden appearance of a visual distractor shortly before saccade initiation can capture spatial attention and modulate the saccade trajectory in spite of the ongoing execution of the initial plan to shift gaze straight to the saccade target. To elucidate the neural correlates underlying these curved saccades, we recorded from single neurons in the frontal eye field of two male rhesus monkeys shifting gaze to a target while a distractor with the same eccentricity appeared either left or right of the target at various delays after target presentation. We found that the population level of presaccadic activity of neurons representing the distractor location encoded the direction of the saccade trajectory. Stronger activity occurred when saccades curved toward the distractor, and weaker when saccades curved away. This relationship held whether the distractor was ipsilateral or contralateral to the recorded neurons. Meanwhile, visually responsive neurons showed asymmetrical patterns of excitatory responses that varied with the location of the distractor and the duration of distractor processing relating to attentional capture and distractor inhibition. During earlier distractor processing, neurons encoded curvature toward the distractor. During later distractor processing, neurons encoded curvature away from the distractor. This was observed when saccades curved away from distractors contralateral to the recording site and when saccades curved toward distractors ipsilateral to the recording site. These findings indicate that saccadic motor planning involves dynamic push&ndash;pull hemispheric interactions producing attraction or repulsion for potential but unselected saccade targets.</p>

                <p>The activation of autonomic and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) systems occurs interdependently with behavioral adjustments under varying environmental demands. Nevertheless, laboratory rodent studies examining the neural bases of stress responses have generally attributed increments in these systems to be monolithic, regardless of whether an active or passive coping strategy is employed. Using the shock probe defensive burying test (SPDB) to measure stress-coping features naturalistically in male and female rats, we identify a neural pathway whereby activity changes may promote distinctive response patterns of hemodynamic and HPA indices typifying active and passive coping phenotypes. Optogenetic excitation of the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) input to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) decreased passive behavior (immobility), attenuated the glucocorticoid hormone response, but did not prevent arterial pressure and heart rate increases associated with rats&rsquo; active behavioral (defensive burying) engagement during the SPDB. In contrast, inhibition of the same pathway increased behavioral immobility and attenuated hemodynamic output but did not affect glucocorticoid increases. Further analyses confirmed that hemodynamic increments occurred preferentially during active behaviors and decrements during immobility epochs, whereas pathway manipulations, regardless of the directionality of effect, weakened these correlational relationships. Finally, neuroanatomical evidence indicated that the influence of the rostral mPFC-&gt;vlPAG pathway on coping response patterns is mediated predominantly through GABAergic neurons within vlPAG. These data highlight the importance of this prefrontal-&gt;midbrain connection in organizing stress-coping responses and in coordinating bodily systems with behavioral output for adaptation to aversive experiences.</p>

                <p>Endogenous reprogramming of glia into neurogenic progenitors holds great promise for neuron restoration therapies. Using lessons from regenerative species, we have developed strategies to stimulate mammalian Mu&#x0308;ller glia to regenerate neurons in vivo in the adult retina. We have demonstrated that the transcription factor Ascl1 can stimulate Mu&#x0308;ller glia neurogenesis. However, Ascl1 is only able to reprogram a subset of Mu&#x0308;ller glia into neurons. We have reported that neuroinflammation from microglia inhibits neurogenesis from Mu&#x0308;ller glia. Here we found that the peripheral immune response is a barrier to CNS regeneration. We show that monocytes from the peripheral immune system infiltrate the injured retina and negatively influence neurogenesis from Mu&#x0308;ller glia. Using CCR2 knock-out mice of both sexes, we found that preventing monocyte infiltration improves the neurogenic and proliferative capacity of Mu&#x0308;ller glia stimulated by Ascl1. Using scRNA-seq analysis, we identified a signaling axis wherein Osteopontin, a cytokine highly expressed by infiltrating immune cells is sufficient to suppress mammalian neurogenesis. This work implicates the response of the peripheral immune system as a barrier to regenerative strategies of the retina.</p>

                <p>Somatosensory coding in rodents has been mostly studied in the whisker system and hairy skin, whereas the function of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) in the rodent glabrous skin has received scant attention, unlike in primates where the glabrous skin has been the focus. The relative activation of different LTMR subtypes carries information about vibrotactile stimuli, as does the rate and temporal patterning of LTMR spikes. Rate coding depends on the probability of a spike occurring on each stimulus cycle (reliability), whereas temporal coding depends on the timing of spikes relative to the stimulus cycle (precision). Using in vivo extracellular recordings in male rats and mice of either sex, we measured the reliability and precision of LTMR responses to tactile stimuli including sustained pressure and vibration. Similar to other species, rodent LTMRs were separated into rapid-adapting (RA) or slow-adapting based on their response to sustained pressure. However, unlike the dichotomous frequency preference characteristic of RA1 and RA2/Pacinian afferents in other species, rodent RAs fell along a continuum. Fitting generalized linear models to experimental data reproduced the reliability and precision of rodent RAs. The resulting model parameters highlight key mechanistic differences across the RA spectrum; specifically, the integration window of different RAs transitions from wide to narrow as tuning preferences across the population move from low to high frequencies. Our results show that rodent RAs can support both rate and temporal coding, but their heterogeneity suggests that coactivation patterns play a greater role in population coding than for dichotomously tuned primate RAs.</p>

                <p>Goal-directed visual attention is a fundamental cognitive process that enables animals to selectively focus on specific regions of the visual field while filtering out irrelevant information. However, given the domain specificity of social behaviors, it remains unclear whether attention to faces versus nonfaces recruits different neurocognitive processes. In this study, we simultaneously recorded activity from temporal and frontal nodes of the attention network while macaques performed a goal-directed visual search task. V4 and inferotemporal (IT) visual category-selective units, selected during cue presentation, discriminated fixations on targets and distractors during the search but were differentially engaged by face and house targets. V4 and IT category-selective units also encoded fixation transitions and search dynamics. Compared with distractors, fixations on targets reduced spike&ndash;LFP coherence within the temporal cortex. Importantly, target-induced desynchronization between the temporal and prefrontal cortices was only evident for face targets, suggesting that attention to faces differentially engaged the prefrontal cortex. We further revealed bidirectional theta influence between the temporal and prefrontal cortices using Granger causality, which was again disproportionate for faces. Finally, we showed that the search became more efficient with increasing target-induced desynchronization. Together, our results suggest domain specificity for attending to faces and an intricate interplay between visual attention and social processing neural networks.</p>

                <p>A unique population of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons co-transmits glutamate and GABA. However, the circuit inputs to VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons are unknown, limiting our understanding of their functional capabilities. By coupling monosynaptic rabies tracing with intersectional genetic targeting in male and female mice, we found that VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons received diverse brainwide inputs. The largest numbers of monosynaptic inputs to VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons were from superior colliculus (SC), lateral hypothalamus (LH), midbrain reticular nucleus, and periaqueductal gray, whereas the densest inputs relative to brain region volume were from the dorsal raphe nucleus, lateral habenula, and VTA. Based on these and prior data, we hypothesized that LH and SC inputs were from glutamatergic neurons. Optical activation of glutamatergic LH neurons activated VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons regardless of stimulation frequency and resulted in flee-like ambulatory behavior. In contrast, optical activation of glutamatergic SC neurons activated VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons for a brief period of time at high frequency and resulted in head rotation and arrested ambulatory behavior (freezing). Stimulation of glutamatergic LH neurons, but not glutamatergic SC neurons, was associated with VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ footshock-induced activity and inhibition of LH glutamatergic neurons disrupted VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ tailshock-induced activity. We interpret these results such that inputs to VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons may integrate diverse signals related to the detection and processing of motivationally salient outcomes.</p>

                <p>Selective modifications in the expression or function of dendritic ion channels regulate the propagation of synaptic inputs and determine the intrinsic excitability of a neuron. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide&ndash;gated (HCN) channels open upon membrane hyperpolarization and conduct a depolarizing inward current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>). HCN channels are enriched in the dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons where they regulate the integration of synaptic inputs. Synaptic plasticity can bidirectionally modify dendritic HCN channels in excitatory neurons depending on the strength of synaptic potentiation. In inhibitory neurons, however, the dendritic expression and modulation of HCN channels are largely unknown. In this study, we systematically compared the modulation of <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> by synaptic potentiation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and stratum radiatum (sRad) interneurons in mouse organotypic cultures. <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> properties were similar in inhibitory and excitatory neurons and contributed to resting membrane potential and action potential firing. We found that in sRad interneurons, HCN channels were downregulated after synaptic plasticity, irrespective of the strength of synaptic potentiation. This suggests differential regulation of <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, possibly signifying their distinct role in network activity.</p>

                <p>The complexity of natural environments requires highly flexible mechanisms for adaptive processing of single and multiple stimuli. Neuronal oscillations could be an ideal candidate for implementing such flexibility in neural systems. Here, we present a framework for structuring attention-guided processing of complex visual scenes in humans, based on multiplexing and phase coding schemes. Importantly, we suggest that the dynamic fluctuations of excitability vary rapidly in terms of magnitude, frequency and wave-form over time, i.e., they are not necessarily sinusoidal or sustained oscillations. Different elements of single objects would be processed within a single cycle (burst) of alpha activity (7&ndash;14 Hz), allowing for the formation of coherent object representations while separating multiple objects across multiple cycles. Each element of an object would be processed separately in time&mdash;expressed as different gamma band bursts (&gt;30 Hz)&mdash;along the alpha phase. Since the processing capacity per alpha cycle is limited, an inverse relationship between object resolution and size of attentional spotlight ensures independence of the proposed mechanism from absolute object complexity. Frequency and wave-shape of those fluctuations would depend on the nature of the object that is processed and on cognitive demands. Multiple objects would further be organized along the phase of slower fluctuations (e.g., theta), potentially driven by saccades. Complex scene processing, involving covert attention and eye movements, would therefore be associated with multiple frequency changes in the alpha and lower frequency range. This framework embraces the idea of a hierarchical organization of visual processing, independent of environmental temporal dynamics.</p>

                <p>Relationships among membrane currents allow central pattern generator (CPG) neurons to reliably drive motor programs. We hypothesize that continually active CPG neurons utilize activity-dependent feedback to correlate expression of ion channel genes to balance essential membrane currents. However, episodically activated neurons experience absences of activity-dependent feedback and, thus, presumably employ other strategies to coregulate the balance of ionic currents necessary to generate appropriate output after periods of quiescence. To investigate this, we compared continually active pyloric dilator (PD) neurons with episodically active lateral gastric (LG) CPG neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) in male <I>Cancer borealis</I> crabs. After experimentally activating LG for 8&nbsp;h, we measured three potassium currents and abundances of their corresponding channel mRNAs. We found that ionic current relationships were correlated in LG's silent state, but ion channel mRNA relationships were correlated in the active state. In continuously active PD neurons, ion channel mRNAs and ionic currents are simultaneously correlated. Therefore, two distinct relationships exist between channel mRNA abundance and the ionic current encoded in these cells: in PD, a direct correlation exists between <I>Shal</I> channel mRNA levels and the A-type potassium current it carries. Conversely, such channel mRNA&ndash;current relationships are not detected and appear to be temporally uncoupled in LG neurons. Our results suggest that ongoing feedback maintains membrane current and channel mRNA relationships in continually active PD neurons, while in LG neurons, episodic activity serves to establish channel mRNA relationships necessary to produce the ionic current profile necessary for the next bout of activity.</p>

                Background Undescended testes (UDT) is a condition where one or both testes is absent in the scrotum. The general age recommendation in which the treatment should be performed is before 18 months old due to the infertility risk and malignancy in later life. In post-pubertal UDT, the current guideline recommends orchiectomy; however, the strength rating of this recommendation is weak. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic review of post-pubertal UDT treatment, focusing on the malignancy risk point of view. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Wiley Online Library and the Cochrane Library up to 5 March 2023. Any study with either post-pubertal orchiectomy or orchidopexy in patients with UDT and reporting the testicular malignancy was included. The exclusion criteria were studies with lack of information of UDT correction time, no history of correction and the full text wasn’t available. The data collected were the occurrence of testicular malignancy in post-pubertal UDT patients corrected with any method. Quality and bias assessment was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Results Seven articles (three case reports and four observational studies) were reviewed with a total of 42 patients who underwent post-pubertal correction of either unilateral or bilateral UDT. The correction age ranged from 13 to 34 years old, with follow-up of 48.7–252 months. Among those who developed malignancies, the most common were seminoma, teratoma and carcinoma in situ of the testes. In addition, this study was able to propose an algorithm for post-pubertal UDT treatment strategy. Conclusions The scarce resource was the main limitation of this study. Nevertheless, this review showed that post-pubertal UDT management should be tailored individually. Several factors that should be considered include the condition of the contralateral descended testis, UDT location, serum testosterone level, patient’s age, comorbidities, and interest in fertility.

                <p>by Yuanchen Zhao, Otto X. Cordero, Mikhail Tikhonov</p>

Microbial communities play key roles across diverse environments. Predicting their function and dynamics is a key goal of microbial ecology, but detailed microscopic descriptions of these systems can be prohibitively complex. One approach to deal with this complexity is to resort to coarser representations. Several approaches have sought to identify useful groupings of microbial species in a data-driven way. Of these, recent work has claimed some empirical success at <i>de novo</i> discovery of coarse representations predictive of a given function using methods as simple as a linear regression, against multiple groups of species or even a single such group (the ensemble quotient optimization (EQO) approach). Modeling community function as a linear combination of individual species’ contributions appears simplistic. However, the task of identifying a predictive coarsening of an ecosystem is distinct from the task of predicting the function well, and it is conceivable that the former could be accomplished by a simpler methodology than the latter. Here, we use the resource competition framework to design a model where the “correct” grouping to be discovered is well-defined, and use synthetic data to evaluate and compare three regression-based methods, namely, two proposed previously and one we introduce. We find that regression-based methods can recover the groupings even when the function is manifestly nonlinear; that multi-group methods offer an advantage over a single-group EQO; and crucially, that simpler (linear) methods can outperform more complex ones.

                <p>by Rym Ben Boubaker, Daniel Henrion, Marie Chabbert</p>

Environmental factors, including mechanical stress and surrounding lipids, can influence the response of GPCRs, such as the mechanosensitive angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1). To investigate the impact of these factors on AT1 activation, we developed a steered molecular dynamics simulations protocol based on quaternion formalism. In this protocol, a pulling force was applied to the N-terminus of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) to induce the TM6 opening characteristic of activation. Subsequently, the simulations were continued without constraints to allow the receptor to relax around the novel TM6 conformation under different conditions. We analyzed the responses of AT1 to membrane stretching, modeled by applying surface tension, in different bilayers. In phosphocholine bilayers without surface tension, we could observe a transient atypical structure of AT1, with an outward TM7 conformation, at the beginning of the activation process. This atypical structure then evolved toward a pre-active structure with outward TM6 and inward TM7. Strikingly, the presence of anionic phosphoglycerol lipids and application of surface tension synergistically favored the atypical structure, which led to an increase in the cross-section area of the receptor intracellular domain. Lipid internalization and H-bonds between lipid heads and the receptor C-terminus increased in phosphoglycerol vs phosphocholine bilayers, but did not depend on surface tension. The difference in the cross-section area of the atypical and pre-active conformations makes the conformational transition sensitive to lateral pressure, and favors the atypical conformation upon surface tension. Anionic lipids act as allosteric modulators of the conformational transition, by stabilizing the atypical conformation. These findings contribute to decipher the mechanisms underlying AT1 activation, highlighting the influence of environmental factors on GPCR responses. Moreover, our results reveal the existence of intermediary conformations that depend on receptor environment and could be targeted in drug design efforts.

                <p>by Suhwan Gim, Seok-Jun Hong, Elizabeth A. Reynolds Losin, Choong-Wan Woo</p>

Pain is not a mere reflection of noxious input. Rather, it is constructed through the dynamic integration of current predictions with incoming sensory input. However, the temporal dynamics of the behavioral and neural processes underpinning this integration remain elusive. In the current study involving 59 human participants, we identified a series of brain mediators that integrated cue-induced expectations with noxious inputs into ongoing pain predictions using a semicircular scale designed to capture rating trajectories. Temporal mediation analysis revealed that during the early-to-mid stages of integration, the frontoparietal and dorsal attention network regions, such as the lateral prefrontal, premotor, and parietal cortex, mediated the cue effects. Conversely, during the mid-to-late stages of integration, the somatomotor network regions mediated the effects of stimulus intensity, suggesting that the integration occurs along the cortical hierarchy from the association to sensorimotor brain systems. Our findings advance the understanding of how the brain integrates contextual and sensory information into pain experience over time.

                Aging leads to a decrease in white matter volume and damage to myelinated axons, contributing to neurodegeneration. Myelin breakdown can trigger inflammation, creating a vicious cycle that causes further damage. Understanding these changes is key to preventing age-related neurodegenerative disease.

                Wilson et al. demonstrate that KRT14+ leader cells drive ovarian cancer metastasis by promoting immunosuppression. Loss of KRT14+ leader cells impairs tumor progression, while their overexpression accelerates metastasis through chemokine-mediated immune evasion. These findings reveal KRT14+ leader cells as a potential therapeutic target to hinder metastasis and enhance anti-tumor immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93792">Reorganization of the flagellum scaffolding induces a sperm standstill during fertilization</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian sperm delve into the female reproductive tract to fertilize the female gamete. The available information about how sperm regulate their motility during the final journey to the fertilization site is extremely limited. In this work, we investigated the structural and functional changes in the sperm flagellum after acrosomal exocytosis (AE) and during the interaction with the eggs. The evidence demonstrates that the double helix actin network surrounding the mitochondrial sheath of the midpiece undergoes structural changes prior to the motility cessation. This structural modification is accompanied by a decrease in diameter of the midpiece and is driven by intracellular calcium changes that occur concomitant with a reorganization of the actin helicoidal cortex. Midpiece contraction occurs in a subset of cells that undergo AE, and live-cell imaging during in vitro fertilization showed that the midpiece contraction is required for motility cessation after fusion is initiated. These findings provide the first evidence of the F-actin network’s role in regulating sperm motility, adapting its function to meet specific cellular requirements during fertilization, and highlighting the broader significance of understanding sperm motility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92820">Hemispheric divergence of interoceptive processing across psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Interactions between top-down attention and bottom-up visceral inputs are assumed to produce conscious perceptions of interoceptive states, and while each process has been independently associated with aberrant interoceptive symptomatology in psychiatric disorders, the neural substrates of this interface are unknown. We conducted a preregistered functional neuroimaging study of 46 individuals with anxiety, depression, and/or eating disorders (ADE) and 46 propensity-matched healthy comparisons (HC), comparing their neural activity across two interoceptive tasks differentially recruiting top-down or bottom-up processing within the same scan session. During an interoceptive attention task, top-down attention was voluntarily directed towards cardiorespiratory or visual signals. In contrast, during an interoceptive perturbation task, intravenous infusions of isoproterenol (a peripherally-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist) were administered in a double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to drive bottom-up cardiorespiratory sensations. Across both tasks, neural activation converged upon the insular cortex, localizing within the granular and ventral dysgranular subregions bilaterally. However, contrasting hemispheric differences emerged, with the ADE group exhibiting (relative to HCs) an asymmetric pattern of overlap in the left insula, with increased or decreased proportions of co-activated voxels within the left or right dysgranular insula, respectively. The ADE group also showed less agranular anterior insula activation during periods of bodily uncertainty (i.e. when anticipating possible isoproterenol-induced changes that never arrived). Finally, post-task changes in insula functional connectivity were associated with anxiety and depression severity. These findings confirm the dysgranular mid-insula as a key cortical interface where attention and prediction meet real-time bodily inputs, especially during heightened awareness of interoceptive states. Furthermore, the dysgranular mid-insula may indeed be a ‘locus of disruption’ for psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97279">Metastasis of colon cancer requires Dickkopf-2 to generate cancer cells with Paneth cell properties</a></h4>

              
                Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Paneth cells provide stem cell niche factors in homeostatic conditions, but the underlying mechanisms of cancer stem cell niche development are unclear. Here, we report that Dickkopf-2 (DKK2) is essential for the generation of cancer cells with Paneth cell properties during colon cancer metastasis. Splenic injection of <i>Dkk2</i> knockout (KO) cancer organoids into C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significant reduction of liver metastases. Transcriptome analysis showed reduction of Paneth cell markers such as lysozymes in KO organoids. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of murine metastasized colon cancer cells and patient samples identified the presence of lysozyme positive cells with Paneth cell properties including enhanced glycolysis. Further analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility suggested hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) as a downstream target of DKK2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis revealed that HNF4A binds to the promoter region of <i>Sox9</i>, a well-known transcription factor for Paneth cell differentiation. In the liver metastatic foci, DKK2 knockout rescued HNF4A protein levels followed by reduction of lysozyme positive cancer cells. Taken together, DKK2-mediated reduction of HNF4A protein promotes the generation of lysozyme positive cancer cells with Paneth cell properties in the metastasized colon cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95044">CXCR3-expressing myeloid cells recruited to the hypothalamus protect against diet-induced body mass gain and metabolic dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Microgliosis plays a critical role in diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation. A few hours after a high-fat diet (HFD), hypothalamic microglia shift to an inflammatory phenotype, and prolonged fat consumption leads to the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to the hypothalamus. However, the transcriptional signatures and functions of these cells remain unclear. Using dual-reporter mice, this study reveals that CX3CR1-positive microglia exhibit minimal changes in response to a HFD, while significant transcriptional differences emerge between microglia and CCR2-positive recruited myeloid cells, particularly affecting chemotaxis. These recruited cells also show sex-specific transcriptional differences impacting neurodegeneration and thermogenesis. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is emphasized for its role in chemotaxis, displaying notable differences between recruited cells and resident microglia, requiring further investigation. Central immunoneutralization of CXCL10, a ligand for CXCR3, resulted in increased body mass and decreased energy expenditure, especially in females. Systemic chemical inhibition of CXCR3 led to significant metabolic changes, including increased body mass, reduced energy expenditure, elevated blood leptin, glucose intolerance, and decreased insulin levels. This study elucidates the transcriptional differences between hypothalamic microglia and CCR2-positive recruited myeloid cells in diet-induced inflammation and identifies CXCR3-expressing recruited immune cells as protective in metabolic outcomes linked to HFD consumption, establishing a new concept in obesity-related hypothalamic inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90376">Rescuable sleep and synaptogenesis phenotypes in a Drosophila model of O-GlcNAc transferase intellectual disability</a></h4>

              
                O-GlcNAcylation is an essential intracellular protein modification mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Recently, missense mutations in <i>OGT</i> have been linked to intellectual disability, indicating that this modification is important for the development and functioning of the nervous system. However, the processes that are most sensitive to perturbations in O-GlcNAcylation remain to be identified. Here, we uncover quantifiable phenotypes in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> carrying a patient-derived OGT mutation in the catalytic domain. Hypo-O-GlcNAcylation leads to defects in synaptogenesis and reduced sleep stability. Both these phenotypes can be partially rescued by genetically or chemically targeting OGA, suggesting that a balance of OGT/OGA activity is required for normal neuronal development and function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95170">Functional characteristics and computational model of abundant hyperactive loci in the human genome</a></h4>

              
                Enhancers and promoters are classically considered to be bound by a small set of transcription factors (TFs) in a sequence-specific manner. This assumption has come under increasing skepticism as the datasets of ChIP-seq assays of TFs have expanded. In particular, high-occupancy target (HOT) loci attract hundreds of TFs with often no detectable correlation between ChIP-seq peaks and DNA-binding motif presence. Here, we used a set of 1003 TF ChIP-seq datasets (HepG2, K562, H1) to analyze the patterns of ChIP-seq peak co-occurrence in combination with functional genomics datasets. We identified 43,891 HOT loci forming at the promoter (53%) and enhancer (47%) regions. HOT promoters regulate housekeeping genes, whereas HOT enhancers are involved in tissue-specific process regulation. HOT loci form the foundation of human super-enhancers and evolve under strong negative selection, with some of these loci being located in ultraconserved regions. Sequence-based classification analysis of HOT loci suggested that their formation is driven by the sequence features, and the density of mapped ChIP-seq peaks across TF-bound loci correlates with sequence features and the expression level of flanking genes. Based on the affinities to bind to promoters and enhancers we detected five distinct clusters of TFs that form the core of the HOT loci. We report an abundance of HOT loci in the human genome and a commitment of 51% of all TF ChIP-seq binding events to HOT locus formation thus challenging the classical model of enhancer activity and propose a model of HOT locus formation based on the existence of large transcriptional condensates.

">Multimodal state-dependent connectivity analysis of arousal and autonomic centers in the brainstem and basal forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Vigilance is a continuously altering state of cortical activation that influences cognition and behavior and is disrupted in multiple brain pathologies. Neuromodulatory nuclei in the brainstem and basal forebrain are implicated in arousal regulation and are key drivers of widespread neuronal activity and communication. However, it is unclear how their large-scale brain network architecture changes across dynamic variations in vigilance state (i.e., alertness and drowsiness). In this study, we leverage simultaneous EEG and 3T multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the vigilance-dependent connectivity of arousal regulation centers in the brainstem and basal forebrain. During states of low vigilance, most of the neuromodulatory nuclei investigated here exhibit a stronger global correlation pattern and greater connectivity to the thalamus, precuneus, and sensory and motor cortices. In a more alert state, the nuclei exhibit the strongest connectivity to the salience, default mode, and auditory networks. These vigilance-dependent correlation patterns persist even after applying multiple preprocessing strategies to reduce systemic vascular effects. To validate our findings, we analyze two large 3T and 7T fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project and demonstrate that the static and vigilance-dependent connectivity profiles of the arousal nuclei are reproducible across 3T multi-echo, 3T single-echo, and 7T single-echo fMRI modalities. Overall, this work provides novel insights into the role of neuromodulatory systems in vigilance-related brain activity.

">Serum metabolome profiling in patients with mild cognitive impairment reveals sex differences in lipid metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) affects more women than men. Although women live longer than men, it is not longevity alone, but other factors, including metabolic changes, that contribute to the higher risk of AD in women. Metabolic pathways have been implicated in AD progression, but studies to date examined targeted pathways, leaving many metabolites unmeasured. Sex is often a neglected biological variable, and most metabolomic studies were not designed to investigate sex differences in metabolomic profiles. Here, we performed untargeted metabolomic profiling of sera from male and female patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a common precursor to AD, and matched controls. We discovered significant metabolic changes in individuals with MCI, and found several pathways that were strongly associated with sex. Peptide energy metabolism demonstrated sexual dimorphism. Lipid pathways exhibited the strongest differences between female and male MCI patients, including specific phosphatidylcholine lipids, lysophospholipids, long-chain fatty acids, and monoacylglycerols. 1-palmitoleoyl glycerol and 1-arachidonoyl glycerol were higher in female MCI subjects than in male MCI subjects with no differences between control males and females. Conversely, specific dicarboxylic fatty acids were lower in female MCI subjects than male MCI subjects. In cultured astrocytes, 1-arachidonoyl glycerol promoted phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator sphingosine kinase 2, which was inhibited by the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor antagonists, as well as chromatin remodelling. Overall, we identified novel sex-specific metabolites in MCI patients that could serve as biomarkers of MCI in both sexes, help further define AD etiology, and reveal new potential prevention strategies for AD.

                Biases in information gathering are common in the general population and can reach pathological extremes in paralysing indecisiveness, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, we adopt a new perspective on information gathering and demonstrate an information integration bias where most recent information is over-weighted by means of evidence strength updates ({Delta}ES). In a large, crowd-sourced sample (N=5,237), we find reduced {Delta}ES-weighting drives indecisiveness along an OC spectrum. We replicate the attenuated {Delta}ES-weighting in a second lab-based study (N=105) that includes a transdiagnostic OC spectrum encompassing OCD and generalised anxiety patients. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we trace {Delta}ES signals to a late neural signal peaking around 920 ms. Critically, OC participants show an attenuated neural {Delta}ES signal in medio-frontal areas while other decision-relevant processes remain intact. Our findings establish biased information-weighting as a key driver of information gathering, where attenuated {Delta}ES can lead to indecisiveness across an OC spectrum.

">Exploration of novel biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases using proteomic analysis and ligand-binding assays</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and their public health burden continues to increase. There is an urgent need to develop reliable and sensitive biomarkers to aid the timely diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and therapeutic development for neurodegenerative disorders. Proteomic screening strategies, including antibody microarrays, are a powerful tool for biomarker discovery, but their findings should be confirmed using quantitative assays. The current study explored the feasibility of combining an exploratory proteomic strategy and confirmatory ligand-binding assays to screen for and validate biomarker candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. It analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis and healthy controls. The screening antibody microarray identified differentially expressed proteins between patients with neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls. Quantitative ligand-binding assays confirmed that cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) levels were elevated in CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease, whereas osteopontin levels were increased in CSF of patients with Parkinson's disease. The current study demonstrated the utility of combining an exploratory proteomic approach and quantitative ligand-binding assays to identify biomarker candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. To further validate and expand these findings, large-scale analyses using well characterized samples should be conducted.

">Chronic variable mild stress alters the transcriptome and signaling properties of the anterodorsal bed nuceleus of the stria terminalis in a sex-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress is a physiological state marked by dysregulation of the hypo-pituitary-adrenal axis and high circulating levels of stress hormones, such as corticosterone in mice or cortisol in humans. This dysregulated state may result in the development of mood disorders but the process by which this occurs is still unknown. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) serves as an integration center for stress signaling and is therefore likely an important area for the development of mood disorders. This project utilized a chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) paradigm to persistently stress mice for 6 weeks followed by RNA-Sequencing of the anterodorsal (ad) BNST and electrophysiology of corticotropin releasing hormone-expressing cells in the adBNST. Our results show significant sex-biases in the transcriptome of the adBNST as well as effects of CVMS on the transcriptome of the adBNST specifically in males. Female biased genes are related to synaptic transmission while male biased genes are related to RNA processing. Stress sensitive genes in males are related to synaptic transmission and synapse formation. Additionally, electrophysiology data showed that CVMS suppressed the M-current in males but not females. However, CVMS increased the strength of excitatory post-synaptic currents in females but not males. This suggests significant differences in how males and females process chronic stress. It also suggests that the BNST is more sensitive to chronic stress in males than in females.

">Wireless recordings from dragonfly target detecting neurons during prey interception flight</a></h4>

              
                Target interception is a complex sensorimotor behavior which requires fine tuning of the sensory system and its strategic coordination with the motor system. Despite various theories about how interception is achieved, its neural implementation remains unknown. We have previously shown that hunting dragonflies employ a balance of reactive and predictive control to intercept prey, using sophisticated model driven predictions to account for expected prey and self-motion. Here we explore the neural substrate of this interception system by investigating a well-known class of target-selective descending neurons (TSDNs). These cells have long been speculated to underlie interception steering but have never been studied in a behaving dragonfly. We combined detailed neuroanatomy, high-precision kinematics data and state-of-the-art neural telemetry to measure TSDN activity during flight. We found that TSDNs are exquisitely tuned to prey angular size and speed at ethological distances, and that they synapse directly onto neck and wing motoneurons in an unusual manner. However, we found that TSDNs were only weakly active during flight and are thus unlikely to provide the primary steering signal. Instead, they appear to drive the foveating head movements that stabilize prey on the eye before and likely throughout the interception flight. We suggest the TSDN population implements the reactive portion of the interception steering control system, coordinating head and wing movements to compensate for unexpected prey motion.

">Lysosomes cell autonomously regulate myeloid cell states and immune responses</a></h4>

              
                Myeloid cells maintain tissue homeostasis via the recognition, engulfment, and lysosomal clearance of dying cells and cellular debris, which is often accompanied by changes from homeostatic to reactive states. While a role for phagocytic receptors in gating these transitions has been described, less is known about if and how lysosomes can contribute to transcriptional and functional plasticity. To determine how lysosomal health impacts myeloid cell states, we evaluated microglia and macrophages deficient for progranulin (encoded by Grn), a lysosomal protein with pleiotropic functions whose loss is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the aged mouse brain identified a Grn knockout (KO)-specific microglial subpopulation marked by high GPNMB expression that displays hallmarks of lysosomal dysfunction, including lipofuscin accumulation. Epigenetic analysis of aged microglia revealed MITF/TFE transcription factors as key mediators of the transcriptional states associated with Grn deficiency. In addition to identifying a core myeloid cell transcriptional response to diverse lysosomal stressors, targeted perturbations of various lysosomal properties in vitro uncovered a cell autonomous, TREM2-independent, response to lysosomal deacidification (via v-ATPase or VPS34 loss of function) that overlaps with Grn KO microglia phenotypes, including the induction of a lysosomal gene program, increased proliferation, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Compound loss-of-function approaches established GPNMB upregulation upon lysosomal stress is required for the compensatory response to enhance lysosomal function via promoting acidification. Finally, pharmacological endolysosomal reacidification through sodium/proton exchanger inhibition partially rescued Grn KO microglia phenotypes. Overall, these data establish a fundamental link between lysosomal health and myeloid cell epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional states observed in neurodegeneration models.

">ER Ca2+-levels control neuromodulator secretion by regulating STIM1 and L-type Ca2+-channel activity</a></h4>

              
                Regulated secretion typically depends on activity-induced Ca2+ influx. However, in invertebrates, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a distinct role, particularly in the release of neuromodulators from dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Here, we investigated the role of the neuronal ER as a Ca2+ source for neuromodulator secretion in primary mouse neurons by directly monitoring ER and cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics, along with DCV exocytosis at single vesicle resolution. During neuronal activity, neurons with a low initial [Ca2+]ER took up Ca2+ into the ER, while those with a high initial [Ca2+]ER released ER Ca2+. These latter neurons showed more DCV exocytosis. Acute ER Ca2+ release by caffeine or thapsigargin application, resulted in minute increases in bulk cytosolic free Ca2+ that did not trigger DCV exocytosis. Remarkably, following ER Ca2+ depletion levels, activity-dependent Ca2+ influx and DCV exocytosis were reduced by 50-90%, while synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis was unaffected. L-type Ca2+-channel inhibition by nimodipine reduced DCV exocytosis and Ca2+ influx by 80-90 % without affecting SV exocytosis, a phenocopy of ER store depletion. In addition, introducing L-type channels lacking STIM1 interaction sites restored DCV fusion following ER store depletion. We conclude that the ER functions as a dynamic Ca2+ store serving both as a Ca2+ source or sink. Moreover, ER depletion activates a feedback loop that controls L-type Ca2+ channel activity, essential for DCV exocytosis.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>What are the neural processes associated with perceptual awareness that are distinct from preconscious sensory encoding and postperceptual processes such as reporting an experience? Using electroencephalography and a no-report visual masking paradigm, we manipulated stimulus visibility by varying the time between stimuli and masks in linear steps (17, 33, 50, 67, and 83 ms). Awareness increased nonlinearly, with stimuli never seen at the two shortest intervals, always seen at the two longest, and 50% seen at the intermediate interval. Separate report and no-report conditions were used to isolate awareness from task performance. Our results revealed a neural signal closely linked to perceptual awareness, independent of the task: a fronto-central event-related potential that we refer to as the N2 (~250 to 300 ms). Earlier event-related potential signals reflected the linear manipulation of stimulus strength, while later signals like P3b and temporal generalization of decoding were tied to task performance, appearing only in the report condition. Taken together, these findings inform current debates regarding theories of consciousness and offer new avenues for exploring the neural mechanisms supporting conscious processing.</span>

	<p>Objectives: This systematic review evaluates the anti-suicidal properties of Lithium in children and adolescents with Bipolar Disorder (BD), addressing gaps in evidence regarding its efficacy and safety in reducing suicidality and self-harming behaviors. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to February 2024. Eligible studies were those focusing on patients aged 25 years or younger, examining Lithium therapy and its impact on suicidal ideation and behaviors. The review included randomized controlled trials, longitudinal prospective and retrospective studies, and cross-sectional studies, while excluding expert opinions and case reports. Results: Evidence generally supports the efficacy of Lithium in reducing suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviors in youth with BD, though results are mixed. Randomized controlled trials demonstrated its effectiveness in mitigating suicidal thoughts during acute manic episodes, with effects persisting post-treatment. Longitudinal studies suggested that Lithium might offer superior outcomes compared to other mood stabilizers, although its specific impact on suicidality remains inconclusive. Cross-sectional studies and retrospective analyses reveal associations between Lithium use and reduced self-harming behaviors, but causality remains uncertain. While mood-stabilizing effects of Lithium offer potential benefits for reducing suicidality in youth, evidence on its direct impact on emotional dysregulation (ED) and long-term efficacy is limited. Variability in individual responses and adherence issues underscore the need for further research. Future studies should include larger, diverse samples, focus on ED symptoms, and explore Lithium mechanisms in suicidality prevention. Conclusions: Lithium remains a promising treatment for mood stabilization and reduction in suicidality in youth with BD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Slow oscillation (SO) brainwaves observed during sleep have been shown to reflect the process of memory consolidation, that underlies the critical role of sleep in learning, memory, and other cognitive functions. Closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) uses tones presented in phase with SOs to increase their amplitude and number, along with other brainwave signatures related to memory consolidation. Prior studies have found that CLAS maximizes the ability to perform rote memorization tasks, although this remains controversial. The present study examined whether CLAS affects a broader range of learning tasks than has been tested previously, including a rote language learning task requiring basic memorization and also two discovery learning tasks requiring insight, hypothesis testing, and integration of experience, all processes that benefit from memory consolidation. Methods: Twenty-eight healthy participants performed language and discovery learning tasks before sleeping in our laboratory for three continuous nights per week over two weeks, with verum or control CLAS using a prototype NeuroGevity system (NeuroGeneces, Inc., Santa Fe, NM, USA) in a crossed, randomized, double-blind manner. Results: Language learning showed a 35% better word recall (p = 0.048), and discovery learning showed a 26% better performance (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) after three continuous nights of CLAS vs. control. EEG measures showed increased SO amplitude and entrainment, SO-spindle coupling, and other features that may underlie the learning benefits of CLAS. Conclusions: Taken together, the present results show that CLAS can alter brain dynamics and enhance learning, especially in complex discovery learning tasks that may benefit more from memory consolidation compared with rote word pair or language learning.</p>

	<p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a neuropsychiatric condition whose neurobiological characteristics include alterations in brain plasticity, modulated by Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). In animal models, environmental enrichment promotes neuroplasticity and reduces depressive-like behaviors. In humans, we proposed to assess the level of Enriched Environment (EE) using a questionnaire that includes different domains of the EE (cognitive, social, and physical), which we named the EE Indicator (EEI). Objective: To determine the relationship between the level of EE and serum BDNF in participants with MDD and healthy controls. Materials: Participants with MDD without antidepressant treatment and healthy controls were recruited, and their EE level and serum BDNF concentration were determined looking for correlations between their clinical characteristics and the cognitive, social, and physical activities according to the EEI. Results: A total of 25 participants were recruited, of which 6 participants with MDD and the same number of controls were selected in a paired manner. Although no differences were found in the concentration of BDNF between the groups, positive correlations were observed between cognitive EE and BDNF (r = 0.62, p = 0.035), as well as negative social EE and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.86, p = 0.001). The sum between cognitive and social EE showed a positive correlation with the serum concentration of BDNF (r = 0.34, p = 0.0451). Conclusions: The level of EE is potentially modulating the presence and severity of MDD at a clinical level, but it can also influence at a neuroplastic level through promoting or limiting the concentration of BDNF.</p>

                Appendicularians are planktonic tunicates abundant all over the world. Currently, only two complete annotated mitochondrial genome assemblies are available for appendicularians, both for cryptic species of Oikopleura dioica. This underrepresentation of available appendicularian mitochondrial genomes limits environmental DNA sequencing (eDNA) studies that rely on mitochondrial markers as a taxonomic barcode. We report the complete mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation of an unknown appendicularian species isolated from the Amami Oshima island, Kagoshima prefecture, Japan, that has significant sequence difference with other currently available assemblies and will serve as a useful resource for ecological studies and further mitochondrial studies of appendicularians.

                Through its wide-ranging effects on human physiology and behaviour, daily light exposure is an important environmental modulator of healthy ageing. Integrating mobile health (mHealth) technology with behaviour change strategies offers a promising approach to optimise light exposure and positively impact sleep, rest-wake cycles, cognitive function, and mood at scale. This study aims to develop the LightSPAN mHealth behaviour change intervention to optimise light exposure across the lifespan. Employing a co-design methodology, the study comprises two distinct workstreams. The first focuses on conceptualising the theoretical framework and implementation strategies through a comprehensive review of light exposure interventions, behaviour change theories, mHealth user personas, and recommendations for designing mHealth interventions for older adults. The second workstream centres on co-designing the intervention, involving consultation with community service providers and engagement with older adults at ageing community centres (≥60 years of age). Community service providers will be consulted through open-ended discussions (target n=5). Older adult participants (n=20) will engage in telephone interviews, focus group discussions and prototyping workshops to explore older adult participants’ characteristics, needs, preferences, and mHealth intervention design elements and co-design the LightSPAN mHealth behaviour change intervention. The insights generated in these co-design components will ensure that the intervention addresses the needs of its future users.

                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concomitant illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months after the ethics committee’s approval. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in early identification and prevention of DDIs, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

Despite advancements in understanding the structure and functions of the Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR), gaps persist in our knowledge of the specific functions of its residues. In this study, we used phylogeny-based techniques to identify functionally equivalent orthologs of CaSR, predict residue significance, and compute specificity-determining position (SDP) scores to understand its evolutionary basis. The analysis revealed exceptional conservation of the CaSR subfamily, emphasizing the critical role of residues with high SDP scores in receptor activation and pathogenicity. To further enhance the findings, gradient-boosting trees were applied to differentiate between gain- and loss-of-function mutations responsible for hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia. Lastly, we investigated the importance of these mutations in the context of receptor activation dynamics. In summary, through comprehensive exploration of the evolutionary history of the CaSR subfamily, coupled with innovative phylogenetic methodologies, we identified activating and inactivating residues, providing valuable insights into the regulation of calcium homeostasis and its connections to associated disorders.

                <p>by Marta Kryven, Suhyoun Yu, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Tomer Ullman, Joshua Tenenbaum</p>

How people plan is an active area of research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. However, tasks traditionally used to study planning in the laboratory tend to be constrained to artificial environments, such as Chess and bandit problems. To date there is still no agreed-on model of how people plan in realistic contexts, such as navigation and search, where values intuitively derive from interactions between perception and cognition. To address this gap and move towards a more naturalistic study of planning, we present a novel spatial Maze Search Task (MST) where the costs and rewards are physically situated as distances and locations. We used this task in two behavioral experiments to evaluate and contrast multiple distinct computational models of planning, including optimal expected utility planning, several one-step heuristics inspired by studies of information search, and a family of planners that deviate from optimal planning, in which action values are estimated by the interactions between perception and cognition. We found that people’s deviations from optimal expected utility are best explained by planners with a limited horizon, however our results do not exclude the possibility that in human planning action values may be also affected by cognitive mechanisms of numerosity and probability perception. This result makes a novel theoretical contribution in showing that limited planning horizon generalizes to spatial planning, and demonstrates the value of our multi-model approach for understanding cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012114">An electrodiffusive network model with multicompartmental neurons and synaptic connections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marte J. Sætra, Yoichiro Mori</p>

Most computational models of neurons assume constant ion concentrations, disregarding the effects of changing ion concentrations on neuronal activity. Among the models that do incorporate ion concentration dynamics, simplifications are often made that sacrifice biophysical consistency, such as neglecting the effects of ionic diffusion on electrical potentials or the effects of electric drift on ion concentrations. A subset of models with ion concentration dynamics, often referred to as electrodiffusive models, account for ion concentration dynamics in a way that ensures a biophysical consistent relationship between ion concentrations, electric charge, and electrical potentials. These models include compartmental single-cell models, geometrically explicit models, and domain-type models, but none that model neuronal network dynamics. To address this gap, we present an electrodiffusive network model with multicompartmental neurons and synaptic connections, which we believe is the first compartmentalized network model to account for intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics in a biophysically consistent way. The model comprises an arbitrary number of “units,” each divided into three domains representing a neuron, glia, and extracellular space. Each domain is further subdivided into a somatic and dendritic layer. Unlike conventional models which focus primarily on neuronal spiking patterns, our model predicts intra- and extracellular ion concentrations (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>), electrical potentials, and volume fractions. A unique feature of the model is that it captures ephaptic effects, both electric and ionic. In this paper, we show how this leads to interesting behavior in the network. First, we demonstrate how changing ion concentrations can affect the synaptic strengths. Then, we show how ionic ephaptic coupling can lead to spontaneous firing in neurons that do not receive any synaptic or external input. Lastly, we explore the effects of having glia in the network and demonstrate how a strongly coupled glial syncytium can prevent neuronal depolarization blocks.

H5 influenza is considered a potential pandemic threat. Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple nonhuman mammalian species. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here, we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind α2-6-linked sialic acids and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine virus, and we show that a mutation present in some recent H5 HAs causes a large antigenic change. Overall, the systematic nature of deep mutational scanning combined with the safety of pseudoviruses enables comprehensive measurements of the phenotypic effects of mutations that can inform real-time interpretation of viral variation observed during surveillance of H5 influenza.

                <p>by Yunlu Zhu, Hannah Gelnaw, Franziska Auer, Kyla R. Hamling, David E. Ehrlich, David Schoppik</p>

The sensation of gravity anchors our perception of the environment and is important for navigation. However, the neural circuits that transform gravity into commands for navigation are undefined. We first determined that larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) navigate vertically by maintaining a consistent heading across a series of upward climb or downward dive bouts. Gravity-blind mutant fish swim with more variable heading and excessive veering, leading to less effective vertical navigation. After targeted photoablation of ascending vestibular neurons and spinal projecting midbrain neurons, but not vestibulospinal neurons, vertical navigation was impaired. These data define a sensorimotor circuit that uses evolutionarily conserved brainstem architecture to transform gravitational signals into persistent heading for vertical navigation. The work lays a foundation to understand how vestibular inputs allow animals to move effectively through their environment.

                <p>by Guy Lhomond, Michael Schubert, Jenifer Croce</p>

Establishment of the 3 primordial germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) during early animal development represents an essential prerequisite for the emergence of properly patterned embryos. β-catenin is an ancient protein that is known to play essential roles in this process. However, these roles have chiefly been established through inhibition of β-catenin translation or function at the time of fertilization. Comprehensive analyses reporting the totality of functions played by nuclear β-catenin, during the early embryogenesis of a given animal, i.e., at different developmental stages and in different germ layers, are thus still lacking. In this study, we used an inducible, conditional knockdown system in the sea urchin to characterize all possible requirements of β-catenin for germ layer establishment and patterning. By blocking β-catenin protein production starting at 7 different time points of early development, between fertilization and 12 h post fertilization, we established a clear correlation between the position of a germ layer along the primary embryonic axis (the animal-vegetal axis) and its dependence on nuclear β-catenin activity. For example, in the vegetal hemisphere, we determined that the 3 germ layers (skeletogenic mesoderm, non-skeletogenic mesoderm, and endoderm) require distinct and highly specific durations of β-catenin production for their respective specification, with the most vegetal germ layer, the skeletogenic mesoderm, requiring the shortest duration. Likewise, for the 2 animal territories (ectoderm and anterior neuroectoderm), we established that their restriction, along the animal-vegetal axis, relies on different durations of β-catenin production, and that the longest duration is for the most animal territory, the anterior neuroectoderm. Moreover, we found that 2 of the vegetal germ layers, the non-skeletogenic mesoderm and the endoderm, further require a prolonged period of nuclear β-catenin activity, after their specification, to maintain their respective germ layer identities through time. Finally, we determined that restriction of the anterior neuroectoderm territory depends on at least 2 nuclear β-catenin-dependent inputs and a nuclear β-catenin-independent mechanism. Taken together, this work is the first to comprehensively define the spatiotemporal requirements of β-catenin during the early embryogenesis of a single animal, the sea urchin <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i>, thereby providing new experimental evidence for a better understanding of the roles played by this evolutionary conserved protein during animal development.

                <p>by Ariana S. Huffmyer, Jill Ashey, Emma Strand, Eric N. Chiles, Xiaoyang Su, Hollie M. Putnam</p>

Rising sea surface temperatures are increasingly causing breakdown in the nutritional relationship between corals and algal endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), threatening the basis of coral reef ecosystems and highlighting the critical role of coral reproduction in reef maintenance. The effects of thermal stress on metabolic exchange (i.e., transfer of fixed carbon photosynthates from symbiont to host) during sensitive early life stages, however, remains understudied. We exposed symbiotic <i>Montipora capitata</i> coral larvae in Hawaiʻi to high temperature (+2.5°C for 3 days), assessed rates of photosynthesis and respiration, and used stable isotope tracing (4 mM <sup>13</sup>C sodium bicarbonate; 4.5 h) to quantify metabolite exchange. While larvae did not show any signs of bleaching and did not experience declines in survival and settlement, metabolic depression was significant under high temperature, indicated by a 19% reduction in respiration rates, but with no change in photosynthesis. Larvae exposed to high temperature showed evidence for maintained translocation of a major photosynthate, glucose, from the symbiont, but there was reduced metabolism of glucose through central carbon metabolism (i.e., glycolysis). The larval host invested in nitrogen cycling by increasing ammonium assimilation, urea metabolism, and sequestration of nitrogen into dipeptides, a mechanism that may support the maintenance of glucose translocation under thermal stress. Host nitrogen assimilation via dipeptide synthesis appears to be used for nitrogen limitation to the Symbiodiniaceae, and we hypothesize that nitrogen limitation contributes to retention of fixed carbon by favoring photosynthate translocation to the host. Collectively, our findings indicate that although these larvae are susceptible to metabolic stress under high temperature, diverting energy to nitrogen assimilation to maintain symbiont population density, photosynthesis, and carbon translocation may allow larvae to avoid bleaching and highlights potential life stage specific metabolic responses to stress.

                Introduction This research is a systematic review aimed at synthesizing scientific evidence on the causes of university dropout, focusing on the subcategories of vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects between 2020 and June 2024. Methods Only articles addressing university dropout were considered, analyzing dimensions such as vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects. Articles published in indexed scientific journals with double-blind, double-blind peer, or open reviews between 2020 and June 2024 were included. The main databases used were Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. To assess the risk of bias in qualitative studies, the criteria from the article “Validity criteria for qualitative research: three epistemological strands for the same purpose” were used. For quantitative studies, the criteria from the article “Evaluating survey research in articles published in Library Science journals” were followed. For mixed-method studies, both sets of criteria were combined. Results A total of 23 studies were included: 15 quantitative (65.22%), 3 qualitative (13.04%), and 5 mixed-method (21.74%). All studies (100%) addressed the subcategories of socioeconomic status and institutional aspects. Regarding the academic performance subcategory, 86% of the studies addressed it, while the vocational guidance subcategory was covered by 73.91% of the studies. Conclusions Vocational guidance, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and institutional aspects are crucial for reducing university dropout. Providing adequate professional guidance, academic support, financial assistance, and strong institutional support is fundamental to improving student retention and academic success.

     alt="Frequency-Specific Alternations in the Amplitude of Fluctuations in Tension-Type Headache: A Machine Learning Study"/>
<p>Tension-type headache (TTH) patients exhibited abnormal brain amplitude of fluctuations in several brain regions including frontal lobe, parietal lobe, cerebellum, thalamus, anterior cingulum gyrus and fusiform in conventional frequency band, slow-4 frequency band, and slow-5 frequency band. The altered brain amplitude of fluctuations could serve as effective neuromarker to distinguish TTH patients and healthy controls.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Brain neural signal at different frequency bands relates to different functions. However, the frequency-specific properties of spontaneous brain activity in tension-type headache (TTH)—the most rampant primary headache—remain largely unknown. We investigated the local neural activity of 33 TTH patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs) in the conventional frequency band and two sub-frequency bands (slow-4 and slow-5 frequency band), employing fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), percent amplitude fluctuations (PerAF) and Wavelet-ALFF analytic methods. Using age as covariate, we performed two sample <i>t</i>-test to compare the between-group differences of each metrics in each frequency band. Support vector machine (SVM) was conducted to classify TTH patients and HCs on the basis of altered spontaneous brain activities. TTH patients showed lower fALFF values in the left cerebellar lobule X, left parahippocampal gyrus, and right supplementary motor area in slow-5 band. TTH patients showed lower PerAF in the left fusiform and cerebellar regions in three bands. Altered Wavelet-ALFF values in the right thalamus, left anterior cingulum gyrus, superior parietal gyrus and middle and parietal frontal regions in three frequency bands were detected. And the SVM classifier obtained an overall accuracy of 77.38%, 82.38%, and 95% based on fALFF, PerAF, and Wavelet ALFF values, respectively. TTH patients exhibited abnormal neural activity in various brain regions. The abnormal brain activities serve as powerful features for distinguishing TTH patients. This preliminary exploration provides a novel insight into the underlying mechanism of TTH.</p>

                Background Inflammatory idiopathic myopathies (IIM) are a heterogeneous group of complex connective tissue diseases (CTD), primarily characterized by inflammatory involvement of skeletal muscles. Several other organs may also be affected, including lungs, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and joints. Objective Describe the clinical and immunological characteristics of IIM among Tunisian patients. Method A retrospective study conducted in the internal medicine department at the Rabta Hospital over 22 years, including adult patients with IIM according to the ACR/EULAR classification criteria, and anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS) according to Connors’ criteria. Inclusion body myositis was excluded. Demographic, clinical, and immunological characteristics were analyzed. Results Ninety-seven patients were included (Male/female ratio= 0.36, mean age = 48.4 +- 13.8 years). The ACR/EULAR criteria enabled the inclusion of 88% of the patients. Dermatomyositis (DM) was the most frequent entity (47%), followed by Polymyositis (PM) (36%) and Amyotrophic dermatomyositis (ADM) (4%). Connors criteria allowed the inclusion and classification with ASS of 33 patients, including those excluded by the ACR/EULAR criteria (12%). Muscular involvement was present in 88% of patients, affecting locomotor (88%), gastrointestinal (43%), laryngeal (10%), cardiac (8%), and respiratory (1%) muscles. Myolysis was observed in 77% of patients, and histological evidence of myositis in 73%. ILD was reported across all subgroup: ASS (85%), PM (57%), DM (17%), and ADM (100%). NSIP was the most common radiologic pattern (59%). Skin involvement (85%), consistently present in DM and ADM, affected 91% of ASS patients. Joint involvement (48%) was predominantly polyarticular (68%). Myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) were detected in 52% of patients, with a predominance of anti-synthetase antibodies (ASAs). Another CTD was noted in 24% of patients and cancer in 17% of patients. Conclusion Our study underscored the clinical diversity among IIM patients and the systemic nature of these diseases, where muscular involvement is not always uniform.

                Introduction Dengue fever poses a significant public health threat, particularly in tropical regions like Malaysia. The rising incidence of dengue outbreaks challenges healthcare systems and highlights the urgent need for effective preventive measures. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns, is expected to worsen the dengue situation in the coming years. Methods . This is a cross-sectional study conducted among adult residents of low-cost housing apartments in an urban poor community in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia involving approximately 16,000 residents. A representative sample of 1,636 residents was calculated using the Krejcie and Morgan formula, and stratified random sampling was used to ensure proportional representation across the various floors of each PPR community apartment block. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from a validated Malay version. The questionnaire assessed respondents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to dengue prevention, categorising KAP scores as “Good” (≥80%) or “Poor” (<80%). Descriptive statistics summarized population characteristics and KAP scores, while logistic regression identified predictors of KAP levels, with significance set at p ≤ 0.05. Results In this community, 76.7% of participants exhibited poor knowledge and 83.1% had a negative attitude towards dengue, despite 66.7% demonstrating good preventive practices. The PPR location significantly predicts dengue knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices, with p-values of less than 0.001 for all domains. Marital status also predicts dengue knowledge (p = 0.007) and preventive practices (p = 0.023), while prior infection with dengue is a predictor of preventive practices (p = 0.047). Conclusion Despite the community’s good dengue prevention practices, likely influenced by environmental expectations, there remains a critical need for education to sustain and strengthen these efforts, as climate change continues to worsen in the coming years. It is crucial to help residents grasp the relevance of these practices, so they can apply them more effectively as climate-driven risks intensify. Targeted interventions should de designed differently for each of the four PPR communities as their levels of knowledge, attitude and practices vary significantly, taking into account independent factors like marital status and prior dengue infection, which shape preventive behaviors.

                Han et al. identify crosstalk between CAFs and pancreatic cancer cells under hypoxia and nutrient scarcity. Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), as the key mediators, can be utilized for phosphatidylcholine biogenesis in PDAC cells under hypoxia. Targeting LPC metabolism reactivates lipid saturation stress and resensitizes cancer cells to O2 and nutrient deprivation.

They develop a new bio-informatics tool to infer absolute copy numbers at low tumor cell percentages. This study finds the plasticity of karyotypes, suggesting adaptive evolution.

                Curren and Ahmed et al. demonstrate that a maternal high-fat diet predisposes the offspring to low-grade systemic inflammation (LGSI), severe lower respiratory tract infections, and later asthma. Blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling, increased by elevated and persistent hepatic neutropoiesis in early life, confers protection against severe lower respiratory tract infections and subsequent asthma.

                Yang et al. demonstrate how the PP2A protein phosphatase complex specifically dephosphorylates FANCD2, thereby licensing the FANCD2/FANCI complex to be loaded onto chromosomes for DNA interstrand crosslink repair. Suppression of PP2A activity deregulates the Fanconi anemia pathway and sensitizes cells to DNA interstrand crosslinks.

                Etter et al. develop unsupervised approaches to extract the population and single-neuron representations of space and time. Using these methods, they find that freely moving mice continuously track time and distance and that these idiothetic neural representations are directly modulated by the availability of contextual cues. While these idiothetic representations are weakest in the presynaptic CA3, they are recapitulated in downstream lateral septum neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96266">Root cap cell corpse clearance limits microbial colonization in Arabidopsis thaliana</a></h4>

              
                Programmed cell death occurring during plant development (dPCD) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction. Here, we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus <i>Serendipita indica</i>, primarily in the differentiation zone. <i>smb-3</i> mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of <i>S. indica</i>-induced root-growth promotion. This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Additionally, reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that <i>BFN1</i> expression is downregulated during <i>S. indica</i> colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89724">Complete suspension culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells supplemented with suppressors of spontaneous differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising resources for producing various types of tissues in regenerative medicine; however, the improvement in a scalable culture system that can precisely control the cellular status of hiPSCs is needed. Utilizing suspension culture without microcarriers or special materials allows for massive production, automation, cost-effectiveness, and safety assurance in industrialized regenerative medicine. Here, we found that hiPSCs cultured in suspension conditions with continuous agitation without microcarriers or extracellular matrix components were more prone to spontaneous differentiation than those cultured in conventional adherent conditions. Adding PKCβ and Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors in the suspension conditions suppressed the spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs into ectoderm and mesendoderm, respectively. In these conditions, we successfully completed the culture processes of hiPSCs, including the generation of hiPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the expansion of bulk population and single-cell sorted clones, long-term culture with robust self-renewal characteristics, single-cell cloning, direct cryopreservation from suspension culture and their successful recovery, and efficient mass production of a clinical-grade hiPSC line. Our results demonstrate that precise control of the cellular status in suspension culture conditions paves the way for their stable and automated clinical application.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100282">Direct and indirect salt effects on homotypic phase separation</a></h4>

              
                The low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1 (A1-LCD) phase separates in a salt-dependent manner. Unlike many intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) whose phase separation is suppressed by increasing salt concentrations, the phase separation of A1-LCD is promoted by &gt;100 mM NaCl. To investigate the atypical salt effect on A1-LCD phase separation, we carried out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of systems comprising multiple A1-LCD chains at NaCl concentrations from 50 to 1000 mM NaCl. The ions occupy first shell as well as more distant sites around the IDP chains, with Arg sidechains and backbone carbonyls the favored partners of Cl<sup>–</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, respectively. They play two direct roles in driving A1-LCD condensation. The first is to neutralize the high net charge of the protein (+9) by an excess of bound Cl<sup>–</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup>; the second is to bridge between A1-LCD chains, thereby fortifying the intermolecular interaction networks in the dense phase. At high concentrations, NaCl also indirectly strengthens π–π, cation–π, and amino–π interactions, by drawing water away from the interaction partners. Therefore, at low salt, A1-LCD is prevented from phase separation by net charge repulsion; at intermediate concentrations, NaCl neutralizes enough of the net charge while also bridging IDP chains to drive phase separation. This drive becomes even stronger at high salt due to strengthened π-type interactions. Based on this understanding, four classes of salt dependence of IDP phase separation can be predicted from amino-acid composition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99575">Systematic genetic characterization of the human PKR kinase domain highlights its functional malleability to escape a poxvirus substrate mimic</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary arms races can arise at the contact surfaces between host and viral proteins, producing dynamic spaces in which genetic variants are continually pursued.  However, the sampling of genetic variation must be balanced with the need to maintain protein function. A striking case is given by protein kinase R (PKR), a member of the mammalian innate immune system. PKR detects viral replication within the host cell and halts protein synthesis to prevent viral replication by phosphorylating eIF2α, a component of the translation initiation machinery. PKR is targeted by many viral antagonists, including poxvirus pseudosubstrate antagonists that mimic the natural substrate, eIF2α, and inhibit PKR activity. Remarkably, PKR has several rapidly evolving residues at this interface, suggesting it is engaging in an evolutionary arms race, despite the surface’s critical role in phosphorylating eIF2α. To systematically explore the evolutionary opportunities available at this dynamic interface, we generated and characterized a library of 426 SNP-accessible nonsynonymous variants of human PKR for their ability to escape inhibition by the model pseudosubstrate inhibitor K3, encoded by the vaccinia virus gene <i>K3L</i>. We identified key sites in the PKR kinase domain that harbor K3-resistant variants, as well as critical sites where variation leads to loss of function. We find K3-resistant variants are readily available throughout the interface and are enriched at sites under positive selection. Moreover, variants beneficial against K3 were also beneficial against an enhanced variant of K3, indicating resilience to viral adaptation. Overall, we find that the eIF2α-binding surface of PKR is highly malleable, potentiating its evolutionary ability to combat viral inhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94908">A non-conducting role of the Cav1.4 Ca2+ channel drives homeostatic plasticity at the cone photoreceptor synapse</a></h4>

              
                In congenital stationary night blindness, type 2 (CSNB2)—a disorder involving the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (L-type) Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel—visual impairment is mild considering that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 mediates synaptic release from rod and cone photoreceptors. Here, we addressed this conundrum using a Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 knockout (KO) mouse and a knock-in (G369i KI) mouse expressing a non-conducting Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4. Surprisingly, Ca<sub>v</sub>3 (T-type) Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were detected in cones of G369i KI mice and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice but not in cones of wild-type mouse, ground squirrels, and macaque retina. Whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice are blind, G369i KI mice exhibit normal photopic (i.e. cone-mediated) visual behavior. Cone synapses, which fail to form in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, are present, albeit enlarged, and with some errors in postsynaptic wiring in G369i KI mice. While Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice lack evidence of cone synaptic responses, electrophysiological recordings in G369i KI mice revealed nominal transmission from cones to horizontal cells and bipolar cells. In CSNB2, we propose that Ca<sub>v</sub>3 channels maintain cone synaptic output provided that the nonconducting role of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in cone synaptogenesis remains intact. Our findings reveal an unexpected form of homeostatic plasticity that relies on a non-canonical role of an ion channel.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97674">Contributions of mirror-image hair cell orientation to mouse otolith organ and zebrafish neuromast function</a></h4>

              
                Otolith organs in the inner ear and neuromasts in the fish lateral-line harbor two populations of hair cells oriented to detect stimuli in opposing directions. The underlying mechanism is highly conserved: the transcription factor EMX2 is regionally expressed in just one hair cell population and acts through the receptor GPR156 to reverse cell orientation relative to the other population. In mouse and zebrafish, loss of Emx2 results in sensory organs that harbor only one hair cell orientation and are not innervated properly. In zebrafish, Emx2 also confers hair cells with reduced mechanosensory properties. Here, we leverage mouse and zebrafish models lacking GPR156 to determine how detecting stimuli of opposing directions serves vestibular function, and whether GPR156 has other roles besides orienting hair cells. We find that otolith organs in <i>Gpr156</i> mouse mutants have normal zonal organization and normal type I-II hair cell distribution and mechano-electrical transduction properties. In contrast, <i>gpr156</i> zebrafish mutants lack the smaller mechanically evoked signals that characterize Emx2-positive hair cells. Loss of GPR156 does not affect orientation-selectivity of afferents in mouse utricle or zebrafish neuromasts. Consistent with normal otolith organ anatomy and afferent selectivity, <i>Gpr156</i> mutant mice do not show overt vestibular dysfunction. Instead, performance on two tests that engage otolith organs is significantly altered – swimming and off-vertical-axis rotation. We conclude that GPR156 relays hair cell orientation and transduction information downstream of EMX2, but not selectivity for direction-specific afferents. These results clarify how molecular mechanisms that confer bi-directionality to sensory organs contribute to function, from single hair cell physiology to animal behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97696">Isoleucine gate blocks K+ conduction in C-type inactivation</a></h4>

              
                Many voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels display a time-dependent phenomenon called C-type inactivation, whereby prolonged activation by voltage leads to the inhibition of ionic conduction, a process that involves a conformational change at the selectivity filter toward a non-conductive state. Recently, a high-resolution structure of a strongly inactivated triple-mutant channel kv1.2-kv2.1-3m revealed a novel conformation of the selectivity filter that is dilated at its outer end, distinct from the well-characterized conductive state. While the experimental structure was interpreted as the elusive non-conductive state, our molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiological measurements show that the dilated filter of kv1.2-kv2.1-3m is conductive and, as such, cannot completely account for the inactivation of the channel observed in the structural experiments. The simulation shows that an additional conformational change, implicating isoleucine residues at position 398 along the pore lining segment S6, is required to effectively block ion conduction. The I398 residues from the four subunits act as a state-dependent hydrophobic gate located immediately beneath the selectivity filter. By mutating I398 to Asparagine, ion permeation can be resumed in the kv1.2-kv2.1-3m channel, which was not a reversion C-type inactivation, since AgTxII fails to block the ionic permeation of kv1.2-kv2.1-3m_I398N. As a critical piece of the C-type inactivation machinery, this structural feature is the potential target of a broad class of QA blockers and negatively charged activators thus opening new research directions towards the development of drugs that specifically modulate gating-states of Kv channels.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89606">Identification of ERAD-dependent degrons for the endoplasmic reticulum lumen</a></h4>

              
                Degrons are minimal protein features that are sufficient to target proteins for degradation. In most cases, degrons allow recognition by components of the cytosolic ubiquitin proteasome system. Currently, all of the identified degrons only function within the cytosol. Using <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we identified the first short linear sequences that function as degrons from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. We show that when these degrons are transferred to proteins, they facilitate proteasomal degradation through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) system. These degrons enable degradation of both luminal and integral membrane ER proteins, expanding the types of proteins that can be targeted for degradation in budding yeast and mammalian tissue culture. This discovery provides a framework to target proteins for degradation from the previously unreachable ER lumen and builds toward therapeutic approaches that exploit the highly conserved ERAD system.

">Prefrontal cortex encodes behavior states decoupled from movement</a></h4>

              
                Prefrontal cortex is often viewed as an extension of the motor system, but little is understood of how it relates to natural motor behavior. We therefore tracked the kinematics of freely moving rats performing minimally structured tasks and measured which aspects of behavior were read out in prefrontal neural populations. Naturalistic behaviors such as rearing or chasing a bait were each encoded by unique neural ensembles, but the behavioral representations were not anchored to posture or movement. Rather, the coding of kinematic features depended on their relevance to the animals' current behavior or which task the animal performed. Behavior-specific ensembles often preceded and outlasted physical actions and, accordingly, prefrontal population activity evolved at slower timescales than in motor cortex. These findings argue that prefrontal coding of behavior is not locked to motor output, and may instead reflect motivations to perform certain actions rather than the actions themselves.

">Melanin concentrating hormone projections to the nucleus accumbens enhance the reward value of food consumption and do not induce feeding or REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of food intake and energy balance is critical to survival. Hunger develops as a response to energy deficit and drives food-seeking and consumption. However, motivations to eat are varied in nature, and promoted by factors other than energy deficit. When dysregulated, non-homeostatic drives to consume can contribute to disorders of food intake, adding to the increasing prevalence of restrictive eating disorders and obesity. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons have been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior, in addition to a number of other fundamental behaviors including sleep, anxiety, and maternal behavior. Several studies suggest that MCH peptide increases food consumption, while studies of MCH neurons show effects only on cued feeding, and others show no effect of MCH neuron manipulation on feeding. MCH neurons have widespread projections to diverse downstream brain regions yet few studies have investigated the function of specific projections or differentiated the behaviors they regulate. Here we use optogenetics, in combination with different behavioral paradigms, to elucidate the role of MCH projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in sleep and feeding behavior. We show that MCH neurons projecting to the NAc do not induce changes in baseline feeding or REM sleep, but do enhance the preference for a food paired with optogenetic stimulation. Furthermore, this effect is diminished in female mice relative to males, in line with previous results suggesting sex differences in the functional role of MCH neurons. These results suggest that MCH projections to the NAc can enhance the rewarding value of consumed food.

">The Interaction Of Diet-Induced Obesity And Chronic Stress In A Mouse Model Of Menopause</a></h4>

              
                Menopause is characterized by the cessation of ovarian hormone production. During postmenopause, cisgender women face increased risks of obesity, cognitive decline, and mood disorder. Mood disorders are associated with exposure to chronic stress. We investigated the combined effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) and chronic stress exposure in a mouse model of menopause using 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), a selective ovotoxicant that gradually depletes ovarian follicles and hormones. Starting at 6 months, 82 female WT C57BL/6J mice received saline or VCD (130 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days per week for 3 weeks. One month after injection, mice were fed either low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD for 8 weeks followed by 6 weeks of chronic variable mild stress (CVMS). Post-CVMS, mice were either processed for gene expression of the anterodorsal BNST or behavior tests to assess cognitive and anxiety-related behaviors. Plasma samples were collected to analyze metabolic hormones and corticosterone levels. VCD-treated HFD-fed mice had higher fat and body mass, and elevated fasting glucose levels compared to controls and more pronounced avoidance behaviors and cognitive impairments. LFD-fed, VCD-treated mice exhibited less exploration of novel objects and open spaces compared to OIL and HFD counterparts. VCD elevated corticosterone levels on LFD and increased BNST Pacap gene expression on HFD. These findings highlight cognitive repercussions of estrogen deficiency and suggest a potential protective effect of a HFD against some of the adverse outcomes associated with menopause. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering dietary and hormonal interactions in the development of therapeutic strategies.

">Functional segregation of cortical hand and speech areas by frequency detuning of an intrinsic motor rhythm.</a></h4>

              
                Many decades after Penfield's (1937) classic depiction of the motor homunculus, it remains unclear how spatially contiguous and interconnected representations within human sensorimotor cortex might separate their activities to achieve the directed and precise control of distinct body regions evident in activities as different as typing and speaking. One long-standing but relatively neglected explanation draws from models of simple physical systems (like swinging pendulums) to posit that small differences in the oscillatory properties of neuronal populations (termed 'frequency detuning') can result in highly effective segregation of their activities and outputs. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the peak frequencies of beta-band (13-30 Hz) motor rhythms measured in a magnetoencephalographic neuroimaging study of finger and speech movements in a group of healthy adults and a group of typically developing children. Our results confirm a peak frequency task difference of about 1.5 Hz in the beta motor rhythms of both left and right hemispheres in adults. A comparable task difference was obtained in children for the left but not for the right hemisphere. These results provide novel support for the role of frequency detuning in the functional organisation of the brain and suggest that this mechanism should play a more prominent role in current models of bodily representations and their development within the sensorimotor cortex.

">Human single-neuron activity is modulated by intracranial theta burst stimulation of the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a highly connected cluster of nuclei with input from multiple sensory modalities, particularly the ventral visual stream, and vast projections to distributed cortical and subcortical regions involved in autonomic regulation and cognition. Numerous studies have described the amygdala's capacity to facilitate the encoding of long-lasting emotional memories. Recently, direct electrical stimulation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) in humans revealed a more generalized ability to enhance declarative memory irrespective of the emotional valence, likely by promoting synaptic plasticity-related processes underlying memory consolidation in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. These effects were achieved with rhythmic theta-burst stimulation (TBS), which is known to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a key mechanism in memory formation. Emerging evidence suggests that intracranial TBS may also enhance memory specificity, evoke theta-frequency oscillations, and facilitate short-term plasticity in local field potential recordings. However, how amygdalar TBS modulates activity at the single-cell level and to what extent this modulation is associated with memory performance remains poorly understood. Here, we address this knowledge gap by conducting simultaneous microelectrode recordings from prefrontal and medial temporal structures during a memory task in which intracranial TBS was applied to the BLA. We observed a subset of neurons whose firing rate was modulated by TBS and exhibited highly heterogeneous responses with respect to onset latency, duration, and direction of effect. Notably, location and baseline activity predicted which neurons were most susceptible to modulation. These findings provide direct empirical support for stimulation-evoked modulation of single-neuron activity in humans, which has implications for the development and refinement of neuromodulatory therapies.

">Modeling neuron-astrocyte interactions in neural networks using distributed simulation</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes engage in local interactions with neurons, synapses, other glial cell types, and the vasculature through intricate cellular and molecular processes, playing an important role in brain information processing, plasticity, cognition, and behavior. This study aims to enhance computational modeling of local interactions between neurons and astrocytes to better understand how these interactions influence the activity regimes in neuron-astrocyte networks and overall brain function. We develop new algorithms for representing astrocytes and neuron-astrocyte interactions in distributed simulation code for large-scale spiking neuronal networks. These include an astrocyte model with calcium dynamics, an extension of a standard neuron model to receive calcium-dependent signals from astrocytes, connections that deliver these signals to neurons, and a connectivity concept that efficiently establishes interactions between groups of three elements (pre- and postsynaptic neurons and astrocytes) in large neuron-astrocyte populations. The latter extends the conventional concept of binary connectivity in neuronal circuits. We verify the efficiency of our reference implementation through a series of benchmarks that vary in computing resources and neuron-astrocyte network model sizes. Using the new technology, we reproduce experimental data on astrocytic effects on neuronal synchronization. Our in silico experiments demonstrate that astrocytes consistently induce local synchronization in groups of neurons across various connectivity schemes and global activity regimes. Changing only the efficiency of neuron-astrocyte interactions switches the global activity regime from asynchronous to network-wide synchronization. Our contribution supports reproducible and collaborative large-scale modeling projects of neuron-astrocyte circuits, addressing the growing interest in developing these models within the computational neuroscience community.

">The organization of high-level visual cortex is aligned with visual rather than abstract linguistic information</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies show that linguistic representations predict the response of high-level visual cortex to images, suggesting an alignment between visual and linguistic information. Here, using iEEG, we tested the hypothesis that such alignment is limited to textual descriptions of the visual content of the image and would not appear for their abstract textual descriptions. We generated two types of textual descriptions for images of famous people and places: visual-text, describing the visual content of the image, and abstract-text, based on their Wikipedia definitions, and extracted their relational-structure representations from a large language model. We used these linguistic representations, along with visual representation of the images based on deep neural network, to predict the iEEG responses to images. Neural relational-structures in high-level visual cortex were similarly predicted by visual-images and visual-text, but not abstract-text representations. These results demonstrate that visual-language alignment in high-level visual cortex is limited to visually grounded language.

">Nimodipine reduces microglial activation in vitro as evidenced by morphological phenotype, phagocytic activity and next generation RNA sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nimodipine, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, achieves vasorelaxation by suppressing Ca2+-dependent activation of cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells and is used to prevent delayed ischemic deficit following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our preclinical drug repurposing studies raised the possibility that nimodipine may attenuate the pro-inflammatory shift in microglial function in response to brain injury. We analyzed the effects of nimodipine on activated microglia at the level of morphological and functional phenotypes, as well as their transcriptomic profile. Methods: Live brain slice preparations from C57BL/6 mice and primary microglia cultures from the cortex of neonatal Sprague Dawley rats were used. Brain slices were subjected to ischemia, and microglial cultures were activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 ng/ml). Both preparations were treated with nimodipine (5-10-20 M). The degree of arborization was evaluated in Iba1-stained microglia and expressed as a transformation index (TI). Phagocytic activity of cultured microglia was visualized using fluorescent microbeads. TNF levels in the cultures were measured with ELISA. Total RNA was isolated from microglia and processed for next generation RNA sequencing to determine differentially expressed genes. Results: Nimodipine suppressed the ameboid morphological transformation and increased phagocytosis triggered by ischemia in brain slices and LPS in microglia cultures. At the transcriptional level, LPS resulted in a pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype, affecting the expression of cytokines, the complement system and phagocytosis-related genes. Focusing on the role of calcium in microglial activation, LPS increased RNA transcription of ionotropic purinergic and some TRP channels but decreased the expression of voltage- and ligand-gated calcium channels. In the endoplasmic reticulum, LPS downregulated gene expression of Ryr and IP3 receptors and increased transcription of the SERCA calcium pump gene. Nimodipine co-administered with LPS altered the expression of 110 genes in the opposite direction to LPS activation, of which at least 20 were associated with microglial immune response, 7 with cell adhesion and 2 with autophagy regulation. Conclusion: The effect of nimodipine goes beyond cerebral vasorelaxation. Nimodipine attenuates microglial activation by modulating Ca2+-dependent gene expression involved in intracellular signaling cascades to drive microglial immune responses. Consideration should be given to expanding the medical field of indication of nimodipine.

">SIMPL: Scalable and hassle-free optimization of neural representations from behaviour</a></h4>

              
                High-dimensional neural activity in the brain is known to encode low-dimensional, time-evolving, behaviour-related variables. A fundamental goal of neural data analysis consists of identifying such variables and their mapping to neural activity. The canonical approach is to assume the latent variables are behaviour and visualize the subsequent tuning curves. However, significant mismatches between behaviour and the encoded variables may still exist --- the agent may be thinking of another location, or be uncertain of its own --- distorting the tuning curves and decreasing their interpretability. To address this issue a variety of methods have been proposed to learn this latent variable in an unsupervised manner; these techniques are typically expensive to train, come with many hyperparameters or scale poorly to large datasets complicating their adoption in practice. To solve these issues we propose SIMPL (Scalable Iterative Maximization of Population-coded Latents), an EM-style algorithm which iteratively optimizes latent variables and tuning curves. SIMPL is fast, scalable and exploits behaviour as an initial condition to further improve convergence and identifiability. We show SIMPL accurately recovers latent variables in biologically-inspired spatial and non-spatial tasks. When applied to a large rodent hippocampal dataset SIMPL efficiently finds a modified latent space with smaller, more numerous, and more uniformly-sized place fields than those based on behaviour, suggesting the brain may encode space with greater resolution than previously thought.

">Latent encoding of movement in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are classically thought to encode spatial features of visual stimuli through simple population codes: each neuron exhibits a preferred orientation and preferred spatial frequency that are invariant to other aspects of the visual stimulus. Here, we show that this simple rule does not apply to the representation of major features of stimulus motion, including stimulus direction and temporal frequency (TF). We collected an extensive dataset of cat V1 responses to stimuli covarying in orientation, direction, spatial frequency, and TF to assess the extent of motion selectivity. In over half of V1, we found that the preferred direction changed with stimulus TF, revealing four distinct map motifs embedded within V1's functional architecture. Additionally, preferred TF was mostly uniform across the cortical surface. Despite the lack of spatial modulation for the preferred TF map and the lack of invariance for the preferred direction map, we found using convolutional neural networks that direction, TF and stimulus speed can be accurately decoded from V1 responses at all cortical locations. These findings suggest that subtle modulations of V1 activity may convey fine information about stimulus motion, pointing to a novel primary sensory encoding mechanism despite complex co-variation of responses to multiple attributes across V1 neurons.

">Spectrum of gamma-Secretase dysfunction as a unifying predictor of ADAD age at onset across PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP causal genes</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (ADAD), caused by mutations in Presenilins (PSEN1/2) and Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) genes, typically manifests before age 65. Age at symptom onset (AAO) is relatively consistent among carriers of the same PSEN1 mutation, but more variable for PSEN2 and APP variants, with these mutations associated with later AAOs than PSEN1. Understanding this clinical variability is crucial for developing predictive models and tailored interventions in ADAD. Biochemical in vitro assessment of gamma-secretase function is valuable in evaluating PSEN1 variant pathogenicity, disease onset and progression. Here, we examined Abeta profiles' relationships to AAO across causal genes. Our analysis showed linear correlations between mutation-induced shifts in Abeta profiles and AAO for PSEN2 and APP mutations. Integration with PSEN1 data revealed parallel but shifted correlations, indicating a common pathogenic mechanism with gene-specific onset timing shifts. Our data support a unified model of ADAD pathogenesis wherein gamma-secretase dysfunction and shifts in Abeta profiles define disease onset. This biochemical analysis of ADAD causality and established quantitative relationships deepen our understanding of ADAD pathogenesis, offering potential for predictive AAO modelling with implications for clinical practice, genetic research and development of therapeutic strategies modulating gamma-secretase across ADAD forms and potentially more broadly in AD.

">Hippocampal OLM interneurons regulate CA1 place cell plasticity and remapping</a></h4>

              
                OLM interneurons selectively target inhibition to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus but the role of this unique morphology in controlling place cell physiology remains a mystery. Here we show that OLM activity prevents associative synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells by inhibiting dendritic Ca2+ signalling initiated by entorhinal synaptic inputs. Furthermore, we find that OLM activity is reduced in novel environments suggesting that reducing OLM activity and thereby enhancing excitatory synaptic plasticity is important for the formation of new place cell representations. Supporting this, we show that selectively increasing OLM activity in novel environments enhances place cell stability and reduces remapping of newly formed place cells whilst increasing OLM activity in familiar environments led only to a transient silencing of place cells. Our results therefore demonstrate a critical role for distal dendrite targeting interneurons in regulating plasticity of neuronal representations.

">Relationships between migraine and interoception: normal accuracy but altered sensibility and behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Background: Migraine is typically precipitated by unaccustomed changes in one's internal state and/or external environment. Migraine symptoms largely involve increased, noxious, awareness of bodily changes and external stimuli. Links have been proposed between migraine and interoception (sensing and interpreting internal states), but direct evidence is limited. Methods: Unmedicated, otherwise healthy, age-matched female participants were grouped by migraine tendency: control (no unprovoked headaches, n=19); low-frequency (<=3 migraines/month, n=20); high-frequency (>=4 migraines/month, n=19). Interoception was assessed, interictally, with standardised questionnaires such as MAIA-2 and a widely used heartbeat counting task. Results: The notable significant questionnaire-based difference was in the 'noticing', 'not distracting' domain of the MAIA-2; controls were least likely to continue activities despite experiencing physical discomfort, and high-frequency migraineurs most likely. Follow-up questioning clarified that this behaviour related predominantly to migraine-related symptoms. The heartbeat task found no differences in accuracy, but lower confidence in the low-frequency migraine group than the control and high-frequency groups. Conclusions: We suggest that low interoceptive confidence is a risk factor for migraine, whilst amplification of interoceptive signals caused by migraine restores this confidence, but at the price of migraine's disabling symptoms. Self-reported tendency to deliberately ignore physical discomfort, including that caused by migraine, may result in more migraine attacks.

">A systematic and meta-analytic review of non-verbal auditory memory in the brain</a></h4>

              
                While sounds are essential for human development, existing research primarily emphasizes visual and spatial memory and speech in relation to auditory processes, with a lack of a cohesive understanding of memory mechanisms for non-verbal sounds. This systematic review and coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings aims to comprehensively organize the literature for identifying the key brain mechanisms involved in short-term memory, working memory, and long-term memory for non-verbal auditory information. Additionally, we aimed to identify whether and how individual differences in neural memory processes related to auditory expertise (musicianship), aging or auditory impairments such as amusia are explored in the literature. Our review included ninety studies meeting the selection criteria, with only thirteen studies containing brain coordinates could be included in the meta-analysis. The coordinate-based meta-analysis identified a frontal hub for non-verbal auditory memory encompassing the medial frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus and superior frontal gyrus.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ability to accurately retrieve visual details of past events is a fundamental cognitive function relevant for daily life. While a visual stimulus contains an abundance of information, only some of it is later encoded into long-term memory representations. However, an ongoing challenge has been to isolate memory representations that integrate various visual features and uncover their dynamics over time. To address this question, we leveraged a novel combination of empirical and computational frameworks based on the hierarchal structure of convolutional neural networks and their correspondence to human visual processing. This enabled to reveal the contribution of different levels of visual representations to memory strength and their dynamics over time. Visual memory strength was measured with distractors selected based on their shared similarity to the target memory along low or high layers of the convolutional neural network hierarchy. The results show that visual working memory relies similarly on low and high-level visual representations. However, already after a few minutes and on to the next day, visual memory relies more strongly on high-level visual representations. These findings suggest that visual representations transform from a distributed to a stronger high-level conceptual representation, providing novel insights into the dynamics of visual memory over time.</span>

	<p>Background: Intracranial AVMs are a highly heterogeneous group of lesions that, while not very common, can pose significant risks. The therapeutic management of AVMs is complicated by ambiguous guidelines, particularly regarding which Spetzler&amp;amp;ndash;Martin grades should dictate specific treatment options. This study analyzed the clinical presentations and treatment approaches of 128 brain AVM cases managed between 2014 and 2022 at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurovascular Diseases in Bucharest, Romania. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patient demographics, clinical symptoms, Spetzler&amp;amp;ndash;Martin categorization, nidus localization, therapeutic management, and outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed using Python 3.10. Results: In our cohort of patients, the median age was 45 years, with a slight male predominance (67 males, 61 females). At admission, 51.5% presented with elevated blood pressure. The majority of patients had a Spetzler&amp;amp;ndash;Martin score of 2 (37.5%), followed by scores of 3 (31.3%) and 1 (20.3%). Treatment strategies included microsurgical resection in 32% of cases, conservative management in 31.2%, Gamma Knife radiosurgery in 22.6%, and endovascular embolization in 13.3%. Notably, open surgery was predominantly chosen for Grade II AVMs. The functional outcomes were favorable, with 69.5% achieving a good recovery score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Only four in-hospital deaths occurred, all in patients who underwent open surgery, and no deaths were recorded during the two-year follow-up. Conclusions: AVMs within the same Spetzler&amp;amp;ndash;Martin grade display considerable complexity, necessitating personalized treatment strategies. Our findings highlight the limitations of open surgery for Grade I cases but affirm its effectiveness for Grade II AVMs.</p>

	<p>Objectives. Brain&amp;amp;ndash;behavior connections are a new means to evaluate sports performance. This electroencephalogram (EEG) study aims to estimate endurance exercise performance by investigating eigenvalue trends and comparing their sensitivity and linearity. Methods. Twenty-three cross-country skiers completed endurance cycling tasks. Twenty-four-channel full-brain EEG signals were recorded in the motor phase and recovery phase continuously. Eighteen EEG eigenvalues calculation methods were collected, commonly used in previous research. Time-frequency, band power, and nonlinear analyses were used to calculate the EEG eigenvalues. Their regression coefficients and correlation coefficients were calculated and compared, with the linear regression method. Results. The time-frequency eigenvalues shift slightly throughout the test. The power eigenvalues changed significantly before and after motor and recovery, but the linearity was not satisfactory. The sensitivity and linearity of the nonlinear eigenvalues were stronger than the other eigenvalues. Of all eigenvalues, Shannon entropy showed completely non-overlapping distribution intervals in the regression coefficients of the two phases, which were &amp;amp;minus;0.1474 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.0806 s&amp;amp;minus;1 in the motor phase and 0.2560 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.1365 s&amp;amp;minus;1 in the recovery phase. Shannon entropy amplitude decreased more in the F region of the brain than in the other regions. Additionally, the higher the level of sport, the slower the decline in Shannon entropy of the athlete. Conclusions. The Shannon entropy method provided more accurate estimations for endurance exercise performance compared to other eigenvalues.</p>

                Spigelian hernia is an uncommon form of ventral hernia, with an incidence ranging from 0.1% to 2%. This case report describes a 72-year-old female who presented with an obstructed right Spigelian hernia, a left Spigelian hernia, and an uncomplicated Meckel’s diverticulum, along with the management approach. The patient had experienced intermittent tenderness in the right iliac fossa for the last two months, which had worsened to severe pain over the previous two days, accompanied by a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an obstructed right Spigelian hernia containing dilated proximal small bowel, and a left uncomplicated spigelian hernia. The patient experienced worsening abdominal pain and vomiting. Emergency laparotomy was performed, revealing a right Spigelian hernia with viable small bowel loops, a non-complicated Meckel’s diverticulum located 20 cm from the ileocecal valve, and a small left Spigelian hernia. The right Spigelian hernia was repaired using intraperitoneal sublay mesh, while the left hernia was treated with primary repair. No bowel resection was performed at the site of the Meckel’s diverticulum, as it was non-inflamed, to prevent contamination of the mesh with bowel flora. Bilateral Spigelian hernias accompanied by Meckel’s diverticulum present a challenging clinical scenario. Although rare, this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain due to the potential for serious complications.

                <p>This study aims to elucidate the methodology and compare the accuracy of different blood biomarkers for diagnosing ischemic stroke (IS). We reviewed 29 articles retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus with Full Text. Among these, 23 articles involving 3,494 participants were suitable for meta-analysis. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) of all studies for meta-analysis was 0.89. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 (0.74&ndash;0.78) and 0.84 (0.83&ndash;0.86), respectively. Blood biomarkers from noninpatient settings demonstrated better diagnostic performance than those in inpatient settings (AUC 0.91 vs 0.88). Smaller sample sizes (&lt;100) showed better performance than larger ones (&ge;100; AUC 0.92 vs 0.86). Blood biomarkers from acute IS (AIS) patients showed higher diagnostic values than those from IS and other stroke types (AUC 0.91 vs 0.87). The diagnostic performance of multiple blood biomarkers was superior to that of a single biomarker (AUC 0.91 vs 0.88). The diagnostic value of blood biomarkers from Caucasians was higher than that from Asians and Africans (AUC 0.90 vs 0.89, 0.75). Blood biomarkers from those with comorbidities (AUC 0.92) showed a better diagnostic performance than those not reporting comorbidities (AUC 0.84). All the subgroups analyzed, including setting, sample size, target IS population, blood biomarker profiling, ethnicity, and comorbidities could lead to heterogeneity. Blood biomarkers have demonstrated sufficient diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing IS and hold promise for integration into routine clinical practice. However, further research is recommended to refine the optimal model for utilizing blood biomarkers in IS diagnosis.</p>

                Background COVID-19 pandemics increases venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk during hospitalization, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Limited radiological diagnosis in pandemic requires a guided protocol for anticoagulant adjustment. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single center as part of a quality improvement program evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation protocols. The study focused on implementing a guideline for anticoagulant dosing protocol based on dynamic changes in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The dosing guideline allowed for dose escalation from standard prophylactic levels to escalated prophylactic or therapeutic levels, depending on the patient's risk profile for VTE. The primary endpoints included in-hospital survival comparing between fix and dynamic adjustment treatment groups. Secondary endpoints encompassed major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events, incidence of breakthrough thrombosis, length of hospitalization and ICU stay, days of mechanical ventilator use, and survival duration. Findings Among the 260 COVID-19-infected patients hospitalized between March 15th and June 15th, 2020. The patients received fixed anticoagulant dosage in 188, 72.3%) patients, while 72 (27.7%) were up-titrated according to the protocol. In-hospital survival at 30 days demonstrated superiority among patients whose anticoagulation was up-titrated to either escalated prophylactic or therapeutic (80.2%) compared to receiving fixed anticoagulant dosage (51.3%) (p=0.01). Bleeding events were significantly higher in up-titrate group (12.5%) compared to fixed anticoagulant dosage group (2.13%). Most of them are CRNMB. Conclusion A dynamic, D-dimer-based dose escalation of anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 holds promise in improving in-hospital mortality rates without a significant increase in fatal bleeding events.

                Background Technology enhances teaching and learning quality, yet when educators lack tech proficiency, it hinders effective education and leads to frustration, lower confidence, and self-doubt. This study aims to investigate the experiences of university faculty members in relation to the impact of technology on their mental well-being. Methods Using a qualitative approach (grounded theory), ten university faculty members were selected for in-depth interviews based on criteria such as teaching experience, tenure, specific courses or subjects taught, and active engagement during the research period. The guiding research question, “What are the experiences and perceptions of university faculty members concerning techno-stress?” directed the study’s focus. The instrument (interview guide) that measured techno-stress consisted of 12 items and was administered virtually. Data were analyzed thematically to uncover common stressors, adaptive strategies, and institutional challenges faced by faculty in adapting to technology’s demands and work overload. Additionally, the study identified four subcategories: work overload, social and emotional interaction, adaption to new technologies, and expectations and teaching quality. Results Techno-stress is a composite of emotional and physical reactions triggered by the improper use of technology. Faculty members’ encounters with techno-stress have substantial implications for their quality of life. Conclusions This research highlights technology’s positive impact on higher education but notes faculty struggles with techno-stress, emphasizing the need for training, support, and boundaries to maintain work-life balance and enhance educational quality.

                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Background Fenugreek, or Trigonella foenum-graecum L, is an edible and medicinal plant of the Fabaceae family. Fenugreek seeds contain a variety of phytochemicals, including proteins, lipids, amino acids, vitamins, flavonoids, steroidal saponins, coumarin, and alkaloids. Trigonelline TG is a bioactive plant alkaloid initially extracted from fenugreek seeds. A substantial portion of fenugreek’s health benefits may rely on the presence of TG. This study addresses the research gap for a fast, green, and economical method for quantifying trigonelline (TG) in fenugreek. Methods Fenugreek seeds from various origins were extracted using three green solvents: acetone (ACt), ethanol (EtOH), and water (H2O). The UPLCMSMS method was developed and validated using a green mobile phase of H2O: EtOH, and an r2-value of 0.999 in the linearity range of 0.1-500 ppb was adopted. The method was validated with an accuracy of 98.6% for trace analysis of TG using a small amount (10 mg) of fenugreek samples from five different origins. Results The average extract yield (±SD) was 5.36±6.3, with the highest extract yield observed in H2O. The ESI (+ve) of the UPLCMSMS resulted in the fragmentation pattern (m/z) 138→94.10→92.05→78.20. The TG quantification revealed an average TG concentration of 181.4, with the highest amount of TG in H2O extract (392.7±132.4 ppb), followed by EtOH (91.9±83.3 ppb) and ACt (59.5±30.9 ppb). The TG amount observed in the validation step substantiated the efficiency and reproducibility of the developed method. Conclusions The method may be used as an effective tool for a green, rapid, economical, and eco-friendly extraction and quantification of TG in diverse matrices of pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, herbal, and food products.

Mitochondria and plastids import thousands of proteins. Their experimental localisation remains a frequent task, but can be resource-intensive and sometimes impossible. Hence, hundreds of studies make use of algorithms that predict a localisation based on a protein’s sequence. Their reliability across evolutionary diverse species is unknown. Here, we evaluate the performance of common algorithms (TargetP, Localizer and WoLFPSORT) for four photosynthetic eukaryotes (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Zea mays</i>, <i>Physcomitrium patens</i>, and <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) for which experimental plastid and mitochondrial proteome data is available, and 171 eukaryotes using orthology inferences. The match between predictions and experimental data ranges from 75% to as low as 2%. Results worsen as the evolutionary distance between training and query species increases, especially for plant mitochondria for which performance borders on random sampling. Specificity, sensitivity and precision analyses highlight cross-organelle errors and uncover the evolutionary divergence of organelles as the main driver of current performance issues. The results encourage to train the next generation of neural networks on an evolutionary more diverse set of organelle proteins for optimizing performance and reliability.

Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool that compares perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles. Typically a sample is represented by averaging across cells, but this fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. We introduce CytoSummaryNet: a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30–68% in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework, providing an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies. Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells. The approach requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets. CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets.

                <p>by Andrew J. Anderson, Chris Davis, Edmund C. Lalor</p>

To transform continuous speech into words, the human brain must resolve variability across utterances in intonation, speech rate, volume, accents and so on. A promising approach to explaining this process has been to model electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain responses to speech. Contemporary models typically invoke context invariant speech categories (e.g. phonemes) as an intermediary representational stage between sounds and words. However, such models may not capture the complete picture because they do not model the brain mechanism that categorizes sounds and consequently may overlook associated neural representations. By providing end-to-end accounts of speech-to-text transformation, new deep-learning systems could enable more complete brain models. We model EEG recordings of audiobook comprehension with the deep-learning speech recognition system Whisper. We find that (1) Whisper provides a self-contained EEG model of an intermediary representational stage that reflects elements of prelexical and lexical representation and prediction; (2) EEG modeling is more accurate when informed by 5-10s of speech context, which traditional context invariant categorical models do not encode; (3) Deep Whisper layers encoding linguistic structure were more accurate EEG models of selectively attended speech in two-speaker “cocktail party” listening conditions than early layers encoding acoustics. No such layer depth advantage was observed for unattended speech, consistent with a more superficial level of linguistic processing in the brain.

                <p>by Toshihito Umegaki, Hisashi Moriizumi, Fumiko Ogushi, Mutsuhiro Takekawa, Takashi Suzuki</p>

The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition (contact inhibition) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics (MD) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages. The source codes are freely available.

                <p>by Ciara Judge, Timothy Vaughan, Timothy Russell, Sam Abbott, Louis du Plessis, Tanja Stadler, Oliver Brady, Sarah Hill</p>

Accurately estimating the effective reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) of a circulating pathogen is a fundamental challenge in the study of infectious disease. The fields of epidemiology and pathogen phylodynamics both share this goal, but to date, methodologies and data employed by each remain largely distinct. Here we present EpiFusion: a joint approach that can be used to harness the complementary strengths of each field to improve estimation of outbreak dynamics for large and poorly sampled epidemics, such as arboviral or respiratory virus outbreaks, and validate it for retrospective analysis. We propose a model of R<sub>t</sub> that estimates outbreak trajectories conditional upon both phylodynamic (time-scaled trees estimated from genetic sequences) and epidemiological (case incidence) data. We simulate stochastic outbreak trajectories that are weighted according to epidemiological and phylodynamic observation models and fit using particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo. To assess performance, we test EpiFusion on simulated outbreaks in which transmission and/or surveillance rapidly changes and find that using EpiFusion to combine epidemiological and phylodynamic data maintains accuracy and increases certainty in trajectory and R<sub>t</sub> estimates, compared to when each data type is used alone. We benchmark EpiFusion’s performance against existing methods to estimate R<sub>t</sub> and demonstrate advances in speed and accuracy. Importantly, our approach scales efficiently with dataset size. Finally, we apply our model to estimate R<sub>t</sub> during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. EpiFusion is designed to accommodate future extensions that will improve its utility, such as explicitly modelling population structure, accommodations for phylogenetic uncertainty, and the ability to weight the contributions of genomic or case incidence to the inference.

Modeling the network topology of the human brain within the mesoscale has become an increasing focus within the neuroscientific community due to its variation across diverse cognitive processes, in the presence of neuropsychiatric disease or injury, and over the lifespan. Much research has been done on the creation of algorithms to detect these mesoscopic structures, called communities or modules, but less has been done to conduct inference on these structures. The literature on analysis of these community detection algorithms has focused on comparing them within the same subject. These approaches, however, either do not accomodate a more general association between community structure and an outcome or cannot accommodate additional covariates that may confound the association of interest. We propose a semiparametric kernel machine regression model for either a continuous or binary outcome, where covariate effects are modeled parametrically and brain connectivity measures are measured nonparametrically. By incorporating notions of similarity between network community structures into a kernel distance function, the high-dimensional feature space of brain networks, defined on input pairs, can be generalized to non-linear spaces, allowing for a wider class of distance-based algorithms. We evaluate our proposed methodology on both simulated and real datasets.

Neoantigen immunogenicity prediction is a highly challenging problem in the development of personalised medicines. Low reactivity rates in called neoantigens result in a difficult prediction scenario with limited training datasets. Here we describe ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach to immunogenicity prediction for CD8+ reactive epitopes. ImmugenX comprises of a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module and a set of context specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. Compared with state-of-the-art models for each task, ImmugenX’s encoding module performs comparably or better on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction and stability tasks. ImmugenX outperforms all compared models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.619, average precision: 0.514), with a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model. ImmugenX shows further improved performance on immunogenicity prediction with the integration of TCR context information. ImmugenX performance is further analysed for interpretability, which locates areas of weakness found across existing immunogenicity models and highlight possible biases in public datasets.

                <p>by Martina Bukač, Sunčica Čanić, Boris Muha, Yifan Wang</p>

We develop a computational algorithm based on a diffuse interface approach to study the design of bioartificial organ scaffold architectures. These scaffolds, composed of poroelastic hydrogels housing transplanted cells, are linked to the patient’s blood circulation via an anastomosis graft. Before entering the scaffold, the blood flow passes through a filter, and the resulting filtered blood plasma transports oxygen and nutrients to sustain the viability of transplanted cells over the long term. A key issue in maintaining cell viability is the design of ultrafiltrate channels within the hydrogel scaffold to facilitate advection-enhanced oxygen supply ensuring oxygen levels remain above a critical threshold to prevent hypoxia. In this manuscript, we develop a computational algorithm to analyze the plasma flow and oxygen concentration within hydrogels featuring various channel geometries. Our objective is to identify the optimal hydrogel channel architecture that sustains oxygen concentration throughout the scaffold above the critical hypoxic threshold.
The computational algorithm we introduce here employs a diffuse interface approach to solve a multi-physics problem. The corresponding model couples the time-dependent Stokes equations, governing blood plasma flow through the channel network, with the time-dependent Biot equations, characterizing Darcy velocity, pressure, and displacement within the poroelastic hydrogel containing the transplanted cells. Subsequently, the calculated plasma velocity is utilized to determine oxygen concentration within the scaffold using a diffuse interface advection-reaction-diffusion model. Our investigation yields a scaffold architecture featuring a hexagonal network geometry that meets the desired oxygen concentration criteria. Unlike classical sharp interface approaches, the diffuse interface approach we employ is particularly adept at addressing problems with intricate interface geometries, such as those encountered in bioartificial organ scaffold design. This study is significant because recent developments in hydrogel fabrication make it now possible to control hydrogel rheology and utilize computational results to generate optimized scaffold architectures.

                <p>by Christian Jarvers, Heiko Neumann</p>

Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system. One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision. Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape, deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture. While this problem has been widely documented, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We design simple, artificial image datasets in which shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict the image class. By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features. We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision.

                <p>by Jyoti Tanwar, Kriti Ahuja, Akshay Sharma, Paras Sehgal, Gyan Ranjan, Farina Sultan, Anushka Agrawal, Donato D’Angelo, Anshu Priya, Vamsi K. Yenamandra, Archana Singh, Anna Raffaello, Muniswamy Madesh, Rosario Rizzuto, Sridhar Sivasubbu, Rajender K. Motiani</p>

Mitochondria regulate several physiological functions through mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. However, role of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in melanosome biology remains unknown. Here, we show that pigmentation requires mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. In vitro gain and loss of function studies demonstrate that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) is crucial for melanogenesis while MCU rheostat, MCUb negatively control melanogenesis. Zebrafish, MCU<sup>+/-</sup> and MCUb<sup>-/-</sup> mice models show that MCU complex drives pigmentation in vivo. Mechanistically, MCU silencing activates transcription factor NFAT2 to induce expression of keratin (5, 7, and 8) filaments. Interestingly, keratin5 in turn augments mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and potentiates melanogenesis by regulating melanosome biogenesis and maturation. Hence this signaling module acts as a negative feedback loop that fine-tunes both mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and pigmentation. Notably, mitoxantrone, an FDA approved drug that inhibits MCU, reduces pigmentation thereby highlighting therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake for clinical management of pigmentary disorders. Taken together, we reveal an MCU-NFAT2-Keratin5 driven signaling axis that acts as a critical determinant of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and pigmentation. Given the vital role of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and keratin filaments in cellular physiology, this feedback loop could be operational in a variety of other patho-physiological processes.

                <p>by Chelsea A. Simpson, Zach R. Celentano, Nicholas W. Haas, James B. McKinlay, Carey D. Nadell, Julia C. van Kessel</p>

Bacteria sense population density via the cell–cell communication system called quorum sensing (QS). The evolution of QS and its maintenance or loss in mixed bacterial communities is highly relevant to understanding how cell–cell signaling impacts bacterial fitness and competition, particularly under varying environmental conditions such as nutrient availability. We uncovered a phenomenon in which <i>Vibrio</i> cells grown in minimal medium optimize expression of the methionine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthesis genes via QS. Strains that are genetically “locked” at high cell density grow slowly in minimal glucose media and suppressor mutants accumulate via inactivating-mutations in <i>metF</i> (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) and <i>luxR</i> (the master QS transcriptional regulator). In mixed cultures, QS mutant strains initially coexist with wild type, but as glucose is depleted, wild type outcompetes the QS mutants. Thus, QS regulation of methionine/THF synthesis is a fitness benefit that links nutrient availability and cell density, preventing accumulation of QS-defective mutants.

                <p>by David Richter, Tim C. Kietzmann, Floris P. de Lange</p>

Perception is shaped by both incoming sensory input and expectations derived from our prior knowledge. Numerous studies have shown stronger neural activity for surprising inputs, suggestive of predictive processing. However, it is largely unclear what predictions are made across the cortical hierarchy, and therefore what kind of surprise drives this up-regulation of activity. Here, we leveraged fMRI in human volunteers and deep neural network (DNN) models to arbitrate between 2 hypotheses: prediction errors may signal a local mismatch between input and expectation at each level of the cortical hierarchy, or prediction errors may be computed at higher levels and the resulting surprise signal is broadcast to earlier areas in the cortical hierarchy. Our results align with the latter hypothesis. Prediction errors in both low- and high-level visual cortex responded to high-level, but not low-level, visual surprise. This scaling with high-level surprise in early visual cortex strongly diverged from feedforward tuning. Combined, our results suggest that high-level predictions constrain sensory processing in earlier areas, thereby aiding perceptual inference.

                Background A holistic architectural education is the culmination of learning knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values, which eventually reflects in the quality of graduates. Even though different schools of thought have made various kinds of qualitative contributions towards the evolution of architectural education in India, it has largely been dominated by the quantitative and technical aspects of its regulating framework. Architects engage with the demanding contradictions between responsibilities of an ethical nature, the dynamic challenges of practice, and the intricacies of architectural imagination. The aesthetical and imaginative foundations of the field make it incumbent upon the architects to possess a balance of ecumenical proficiencies for accountability and personalization. The purpose of the study is to identify relevant attributes of Competency Based Education (CBE) that can be adopted for architectural education in India. Methods This research follows a narrative review approach and a descriptive-analytic method to broadly understand the attributes of CBE and its potential relevance to architectural education in India. 323 articles were searched on various search strings based on their relevance to the inquiry. 76 documents written in English language were included and appraised through the Scale of the Assessment for Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tool to avoid any risk of bias. The PRISMA 2020 checklist and flow diagram has been used to report the findings of this narrative review. Result The study identifies eight critical parameters of CBE with respect to its definitions, origins, transitions, regulatory environment, characteristics, approaches and implications on teaching-learning, frameworks and models of assessment; and challenges, which makes a case for the relevance of CBE for architectural education in India, which hasn’t been explored yet. Conclusion The broader expectations of ‘being competent’ can be addressed through a conscious adoption of strategies of relevant attributes of CBE which can encourage building attitudes and temperament for life-long learning.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Dental fluorosis, a condition characterized by enamel hypoplasia caused by excessive fluoride intake, can potentially affect the adhesion of dental materials. This systematic review aimed to assess the influence of dental fluorosis on shear bond strength (SBS) and to provide clinical recommendations. A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted, followed by a rigorous selection process to include relevant in vitro studies. The quality of the included studies was assessed and data were extracted for analysis. Based on these findings, it is recommended to consider alternative bonding techniques or to use specific dental materials for fluorosis-affected teeth. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the potential impact of dental fluorosis on shear bond strength and develop more targeted clinical strategies.

                Background Ethiopia’s potato seed system is currently hindered by a disjointed regulatory framework, insufficient quality assurance processes, and a lack of collaboration among stakeholders, which collectively impede agricultural productivity and food security. The regulatory environment is characterized by inconsistent seed certification practices and a dependence on informal seed sources, negatively affecting the quality of potato seeds available to farmers. Although potatoes play a crucial role in global food security by providing high yields compared to other staple crops, the sector grapples with significant challenges due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, limited technical expertise, and the widespread presence of counterfeit seeds throughout the value chain. Methods To tackle these challenges, this mini-review outlines potential improvements, stressing the necessity for a unified regulatory framework tailored to the unique issues of vegetatively propagated crops. For this reason, we have used different literature source from web of science, Pubmed, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and other scientific websites. We have documented the most relevant information focusing on potato seed system, regulatory frameworks, quality assurance bottlenecks and pathways for improvement across the seed value chain. Results our paper highlights key recommendations that includes enhancing training for regulatory staff, investing in research for disease-resistant varieties, and bolstering public-private partnerships to encourage innovation and resource sharing. Furthermore, improving traceability in the seed supply chain is essential for maintaining seed quality and integrity. Conclusions This review calls for a comprehensive strategy that fosters stakeholder engagement and promotes sustainable practices to rejuvenate Ethiopia’s potato seed system, thereby supporting the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers and strengthening national food security through integrated seed sector development and capacity improvement of the seed regulatory body as well as smallholder farmers.

                Background Current health recommender systems lack interactivity that relates to the current situation. Methods We designed and implemented an intervention study for obese patients that incorporates context information obtained from smartphone and smartwatch sensors, gamification, as well as joint goal management of patients and health coaches. We developed a health behaviour recommendation system comprising of a smartphone application, cloud platform for data management, and a data dashboard for coaches. Results We conducted a three months long study and analysed data from eight patients, focusing on system function, patient adherence, satisfaction and overall impact of the proposed system on changing health-related habits. Along with data analysis, we also provide patient feedback collected during interview round after the end of the study. Conclusion Patients could successfully implement the goals using the EghiFit app. Challenges regarding the data collection, recommendation synthesis, and patient engagement persist. Furthermore, reliable sensor data processing on current smartphone platforms is difficult due to system restrictions. Future research should further integrate sensor data, gaming, and health behaviour intervention design using smart devices.

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials and Gen Z”. Narcissism refers to a personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behavior, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of assessing correlations between perceived health, perceived oral health, selfie-taking behavior, narcissism and oral health behavior in an adolescent population. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque using DMFT index and Plaque index. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form. Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                Background Chromatin loops play a critical role in gene regulation by connecting regulatory loci and gene promoters. The identification of changes in chromatin looping between cell types or biological conditions is an important task for understanding gene regulation; however, the manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization of data sets describing 3D chromatin structure is challenging due to the large and complex nature of the relevant data sets. Methods Here, we describe a workflow for identifying and visualizing differential chromatin loops from Hi-C data from two biological conditions using the ‘mariner’, ‘DESeq2’ and ‘plotgardener’ Bioconductor/R packages. The workflow assumes that Hi-C data has been processed into ‘.hic’ or ‘.cool’ files and that loops have been identified using an existing loop-calling algorithm. Results First, the ‘mariner’ package is used to merge redundant loop calls and extract interaction frequency counts. Next, ‘DESeq2’ is used to identify loops that exhibit differential contact frequencies between conditions. Finally, ‘plotgardener’ is used to visualize differential loops. Conclusion Chromatin interaction data is an important modality for understanding the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. The workflow presented here outlines the use of ‘mariner’ as a tool to manipulate, extract, and aggregate chromatin interaction data, ‘DESeq2’ to perform differential analysis of these data across conditions, samples, and replicates, and ‘plotgardener’ to explore and visualize the results.

                Across species, social behaviors are shaped and maintained through positive reinforcement of affiliative social interactions. As with nonsocial rewards, the reinforcing properties of social interactions have been shown to involve interplay between various brain regions and the mesolimbic reward system. In this review, we summarize findings from rodent research on the neural circuits that encode and mediate different components of social reward-seeking behavior. We explore methods to parse and study social reward-related behaviors using available behavioral paradigms. We also compare the neural mechanisms that support social versus nonsocial reward-seeking. Finally, we discuss how internal state and neuromodulatory systems affect reward-seeking behavior and the neural circuits that underlie social reward.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95595">Large-scale characterization of drug mechanism of action using proteome-wide thermal shift assays</a></h4>

              
                In response to an ever-increasing demand of new small molecules therapeutics, numerous chemical and genetic tools have been developed to interrogate compound mechanism of action. Owing to its ability to approximate compound-dependent changes in thermal stability, the proteome-wide thermal shift assay has emerged as a powerful tool in this arsenal. The most recent iterations have drastically improved the overall efficiency of these assays, providing an opportunity to screen compounds at a previously unprecedented rate. Taking advantage of this advance, we quantified more than one million thermal stability measurements in response to multiple classes of therapeutic and tool compounds (96 compounds in living cells and 70 compounds in lysates). When interrogating the dataset as a whole, approximately 80% of compounds (with quantifiable targets) caused a significant change in the thermal stability of an annotated target. There was also a wealth of evidence portending off-target engagement despite the extensive use of the compounds in the laboratory and/or clinic. Finally, the combined application of cell- and lysate-based assays, aided in the classification of primary (direct ligand binding) and secondary (indirect) changes in thermal stability. Overall, this study highlights the value of these assays in the drug development process by affording an unbiased and reliable assessment of compound mechanism of action.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94657">The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF220 maintains hindbrain Hox expression patterns through regulation of WDR5 stability</a></h4>

              
                The spatial and temporal linear expression of <i>Hox</i> genes establishes a regional <i>Hox</i> code, which is crucial for the antero-posterior (A-P) patterning, segmentation, and neuronal circuit development of the hindbrain. RNF220, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is widely involved in neural development via targeting of multiple substrates. Here, we found that the expression of <i>Hox</i> genes in the pons was markedly up-regulated at the late developmental stage (post-embryonic day E15.5) in <i>Rnf220<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mouse embryos. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed different <i>Hox</i> de-repression profiles in different groups of neurons, including the pontine nuclei (PN). The <i>Hox</i> pattern was disrupted and the neural circuits were affected in the PN of <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice. We showed that this phenomenon was mediated by WDR5, a key component of the TrxG complex, which can be polyubiquitinated and degraded by RNF220. Intrauterine injection of WDR5 inhibitor (WDR5-IN-4) and genetic ablation of <i>Wdr5</i> in <i>Rnf220<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice largely recovered the de-repressed <i>Hox</i> expression pattern in the hindbrain. In P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, the retinoic acid-induced <i>Hox</i> expression was further stimulated by <i>Rnf220</i> knockdown, which can also be rescued by <i>Wdr5</i> knockdown. In short, our data suggest a new role of RNF220/WDR5 in <i>Hox</i> pattern maintenance and pons development in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98169">Derivation and internal validation of prediction models for pulmonary hypertension risk assessment in a cohort inhabiting Tibet, China</a></h4>

              
                Individuals residing in plateau regions are susceptible to pulmonary hypertension (PH) and there is an urgent need for a prediction nomogram to assess the risk of PH in this population. A total of 6603 subjects were randomly divided into a derivation set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Optimal predictive features were identified through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression technique, and nomograms were constructed using multivariate logistic regression. The performance of these nomograms was evaluated and validated using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, and decision curve analysis. Comparisons between nomograms were conducted using the net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) indices. Nomogram<sup>I</sup> was established based on independent risk factors, including gender, Tibetan ethnicity, age, incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB), atrial fibrillation (AF), sinus tachycardia (ST), and T wave changes (TC). The AUCs for Nomogram<sup>I</sup> were 0.716 in the derivation set and 0.718 in the validation set. Nomogram<sup>II</sup> was established based on independent risk factors, including Tibetan ethnicity, age, right axis deviation, high voltage in the right ventricle, IRBBB, AF, pulmonary P waves, ST, and TC. The AUCs for Nomogram<sup>II</sup> were 0.844 in the derivation set and 0.801 in the validation set. Both nomograms demonstrated satisfactory clinical consistency. The IDI and NRI indices confirmed that Nomogram<sup>II</sup> outperformed Nomogram<sup>I</sup>. Therefore, the online dynamic Nomogram<sup>II</sup> was established to predict the risks of PH in the plateau population.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90191">Hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons modulate sevoflurane anesthesia and the post-anesthesia stress responses</a></h4>

              
                General anesthesia (GA) is an indispensable procedure necessary for safely and compassionately administering a significant number of surgical procedures and invasive diagnostic tests. However, the undesired stress response associated with GA causes delayed recovery and even increased morbidity in the clinic. Here, a core hypothalamic ensemble, corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons), is discovered to play a role in regulating sevoflurane GA. Chemogenetic activation of these neurons delay the induction of and accelerated emergence from sevoflurane GA, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons accelerates induction and delays awakening. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons induce rapid cortical activation during both the steady and deep sevoflurane GA state with burst-suppression oscillations. Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons relieve the sevoflurane GA-elicited stress response (e.g., excessive self-grooming and elevated corticosterone level). These ﬁndings identify PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons modulate states of anesthesia in sevoflurane GA, being a part of anesthesia regulatory network of sevoflurane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96470">Exposure to live saprophytic Leptospira before challenge with a pathogenic serovar prevents severe leptospirosis and promotes kidney homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies demonstrated that <i>Leptospira biflexa</i>, a saprophytic species, triggers innate immune responses in the host during early infection. This raised the question of whether these responses could suppress a subsequent challenge with pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i>. We inoculated C3H/HeJ mice with a single or a double dose of <i>L. biflexa</i> before challenge with a pathogenic serovar, <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> serovar Copenhageni FioCruz (LIC). Pre-challenge exposure to <i>L. biflexa</i> did not prevent LIC dissemination and colonization of the kidney. However, it rescued weight loss and mouse survival thereby mitigating disease severity. Unexpectedly, there was correlation between rescue of overall health (weight gain, higher survival, lower kidney fibrosis marker ColA1) and higher shedding of LIC in urine. This stood in contrast to the <i>L. biflexa</i> unexposed LIC challenged control. Immune responses were dominated by increased frequency of effector T helper (CD4+) cells in spleen, as well as significant increases in serologic IgG2a. Our findings suggest that exposure to live saprophytic <i>Leptospira</i> primes the host to develop Th1 biased immune responses that prevent severe disease induced by a subsequent challenge with a pathogenic species. Thus, mice exposed to live saprophytic <i>Leptospira</i> before facing a pathogenic serovar may withstand infection with far better outcomes. Furthermore, a status of homeostasis may have been reached after kidney colonization that helps LIC complete its enzootic cycle.

                Organisms require dietary macronutrients in specific ratios to maximize performance, and variation in macronutrient requirements plays a central role in niche determination. Although it is well recognized that development and body size can have strong and predictable effects on many aspects of organismal function, we lack a predictive understanding of ontogenetic or scaling effects on macronutrient intake. We determined protein and carbohydrate intake throughout development on lab populations of locusts and compared to late instars of field populations. Self-selected protein:carbohydrate targets declined dramatically through ontogeny, due primarily to declines in mass-specific protein consumption rates which were highly correlated with declines in specific growth rates. Lab results for protein consumption rates partly matched results from field-collected locusts. However, field locusts consumed nearly double the carbohydrate, likely due to higher activity and metabolic rates. Combining our results with the available data for animals, both across species and during ontogeny, protein consumption scaled predictably and hypometrically, demonstrating a new scaling rule key for understanding nutritional ecology.

                Animals navigate by learning the spatial layout of their environment. We investigated spatial learning of mice in an open maze where food was hidden in one of a hundred holes. Mice leaving from a stable entrance learned to efficiently navigate to the food without the need for landmarks. We developed a quantitative framework to reveal how the mice estimate the food location based on analyses of trajectories and active hole checks. After learning, the computed ‘target estimation vector’ (TEV) closely approximated the mice’s route and its hole check distribution. The TEV required learning both the direction and distance of the start to food vector, and our data suggests that different learning dynamics underlie these estimates. We propose that the TEV can be precisely connected to the properties of hippocampal place cells. Finally, we provide the first demonstration that, after learning the location of two food sites, the mice took a shortcut between the sites, demonstrating that they had generated a cognitive map.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87962">A distributed brain response predicting the facial expression of acute nociceptive pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain is a private experience observable through various verbal and non-verbal behavioural manifestations, each of which may relate to different pain-related functions. Despite the importance of understanding the cerebral mechanisms underlying those manifestations, there is currently limited knowledge of the neural correlates of the facial expression of pain. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, noxious heat stimulation was applied in healthy volunteers and we tested if previously published brain signatures of pain were sensitive to pain expression. We then applied a multivariate pattern analysis to the fMRI data to predict the facial expression of pain. Results revealed the inability of previously developed pain neurosignatures to predict the facial expression of pain. We thus propose a facial expression of pain signature (FEPS) conveying distinctive information about the brain response to nociceptive stimulations with minimal or no overlap with other pain-relevant brain signatures associated with nociception, pain ratings, thermal pain aversiveness, or pain valuation. The FEPS may provide a distinctive functional characterization of the distributed cerebral response to nociceptive pain associated with the socio-communicative role of non-verbal pain expression. This underscores the complexity of pain phenomenology by reinforcing the view that neurosignatures conceived as biomarkers must be interpreted in relation to the specific pain manifestation(s) predicted and their underlying function(s). Future studies should explore other pain-relevant manifestations and assess the specificity of the FEPS against simulated pain expressions and other types of aversive or emotional states.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96962">Functional identification of soluble uric acid as an endogenous inhibitor of CD38</a></h4>

              
                Excessive elevation or reduction of soluble uric acid (sUA) levels has been linked to some of pathological states, raising another subject that sUA at physiological levels may be essential for the maintenance of health. Yet, the fundamental physiological functions and molecular targets of sUA remain largely unknown. Using enzyme assays and in vitro and in vivo metabolic assays, we demonstrate that sUA directly inhibits the hydrolase and cyclase activities of CD38 via a reversible non-competitive mechanism, thereby limiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) degradation. CD38 inhibition is restricted to sUA in purine metabolism, and a structural comparison using methyl analogs of sUA such as caffeine metabolites shows that 1,3-dihydroimidazol-2-one is the main functional group. Moreover, sUA at physiological levels prevents crude lipopolysaccharide (cLPS)-induced systemic inflammation and monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced peritonitis in mice by interacting with CD38. Together, this study unveils an unexpected physiological role for sUA in controlling NAD<sup>+</sup> availability and innate immunity through CD38 inhibition, providing a new perspective on sUA homeostasis and purine metabolism.

">Excitatory Cortical Neurons from CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder Patient-Derived Organoids Show Early Hyperexcitability Not Identified in Neurogenin2 Induced Neurons</a></h4>

              
                CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathy resulting from variants in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) that lead to impaired kinase activity or loss of function. CDD is one of the most common genetic etiologies identified in epilepsy cohorts. To study how CDKL5 variants impact human neuronal activity, gene expression and morphology, CDD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and their isogenic controls were differentiated into excitatory neurons using either an NGN2 induction protocol or a guided cortical organoid differentiation. Patient-derived neurons from both differentiation paradigms had decreased phosphorylated EB2, a known molecular target of CDKL5. Induced neurons showed no detectable differences between cases and isogenic controls in network activity using a multielectrode array, or in MAP2+ neurite length, and only two genes were differentially expressed. However, patient-derived neurons from the organoid differentiation showed increased synchrony and weighted mean firing rate on the multielectrode array within the first month of network maturation. CDD patient-derived cortical neurons had lower expression of CDKL5 and HS3ST1, which may change the extracellular matrix around the synapse and contribute to hyperexcitability. Similar to the induced neurons, there were no differences in neurite length across or within patient-control cell lines. Induced neurons have poor cortical specification while the organoid derived neurons expressed cortical markers, suggesting that the changes in neuronal excitability and gene expression are specific to cortical excitatory neurons. Examining molecular mechanisms of early hyperexcitability in cortical neurons is a promising avenue for identification of CDD therapeutics.

">Asymmetric neuromodulation in the respiratory network contributes to rhythm and pattern generation</a></h4>

              
                Like other brain circuits, the brainstem respiratory network is continually modulated by neurotransmitters that activate slow metabotropic receptors. In many cases, activation of these receptors only subtly modulates the respiratory motor pattern. However, activation of some receptor types evokes the arrest of the respiratory motor pattern as can occur following the activation of mu-opioid receptors. We propose that the varied effects of neuromodulation on the respiratory motor pattern depend on the pattern of neuromodulator receptor expression and their influence on the excitability of their post-synaptic targets. Because a comprehensive characterization of these cellular properties across the respiratory network remains challenging, we test our hypothesis by combining computational modelling with ensemble electrophysiologic recording in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BotC) using high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEA). Our computational model encapsulates the hypothesis that neuromodulatory transmission is organized asymmetrically across the respiratory network to promote rhythm and pattern generation. To test this hypothesis, we increased the strength of neuromodulatory connections in the model and used selective agonists in situ while monitoring pre-BotC ensemble activities. The model predictions of increasing slow inhibition were consistent with experiments examining the effect of systemic administration of the 5HT1aR agonist 8-OH-DPAT. Similarly, the predicted effects of increasing slow excitation in the model were experimentally confirmed in pre-BotC ensemble activities before and after systemic administration of the mu-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl. We conclude that asymmetric neuromodulation can contribute to respiratory rhythm and pattern generation and accounts for its varied effects on breathing.

                The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the connection between anxiety brought on by social stressors and the negative impact on relationship formation have remained elusive. In order to address this question, we used the social defeat model in the socially monogamous prairie vole to investigate the impact of this stress on pair bond formation. Social defeat experience inhibited partner preference formation in males but promoted preference in females. Furthermore, pair bonding increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in male prairie voles, while defeat experience increased BNST CRH expression in females. Chemogenetic excitation of BNST CRH neurons during a short cohabitation with a new partner promoted a partner preference in stress-naive prairie voles. Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of BNST CRH neurons during cohabitation with a new partner blocked partner preference in stress-naive males but promoted preference in defeated males. Inhibition of BNST CRH neurons also blocked partner preference in stress-naive females but did not alter preference behavior in defeated females. This study revealed sexual dimorphism in not only the impact of social defeat on pair bond formation, but also in the role BNST CRHergic neurons play in regulating changes in pair bonding following social conflict.

">Hunger modulates exploration through suppression of dopamine signaling in the tail of striatum</a></h4>

              
                Caloric depletion leads to behavioral changes that help an animal find food and restore its homeostatic balance. Hunger increases exploration and risk-taking behavior, allowing an animal to forage for food despite risks; however, the neural circuitry underlying this change is unknown. Here, we characterize how hunger restructures an animal's spontaneous behavior as well as its directed exploration of a novel object. We show that hunger-induced changes in exploration are accompanied by and result from modulation of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TOS). Dopamine signaling in the TOS is modulated by internal hunger state through the activity of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, putative "hunger neurons" in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These AgRP neurons are poly-synaptically connected to TOS-projecting dopaminergic neurons through the lateral hypothalamus, the central amygdala, and the periaqueductal grey. We thus delineate a hypothalamic-midbrain circuit that coordinates changes in exploration behavior in the hungry state.

">Generation of morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes from human iPSCs reveals a link between glial shape, function and reactivity</a></h4>

              
                Astrocyte morphology in vivo is heterogeneous across different subtypes and dynamically changes in response to various stimuli. However, several questions on the mechanistic links between shape and function remain unanswered. Here, we developed an efficient protocol to generate pure populations of morphologically distinct human astrocytes in vitro, which we used for a systematic analysis of shape-function relationships. We performed a structural, molecular, and functional characterization of these populations and highlighted how their distinct morphologies mirror distinct functional and transcriptional patterns at the population level. We were also able to both correlate gene expression profiles of these morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes with in vivo astrocytes in the human brain, and to validate our findings with primary isolated murine astrocytes in vitro. Moreover, we show that the observed morphological differences are correlated with changes in key cytoskeletal proteins, which offers a potential link to the observed functional differences. Finally, we demonstrated that different morphological subtypes of astrocytes have distinct reactivity responses to a common stimulus. This study offers a glimpse into the shape-function dynamics of human astrocytes, highlighting potential mechanistic links between cytoskeletal usage and astrocyte function, while also providing tools and datasets that will be useful for further studies into human glial biology in health and disease.

                The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a major health issue after nearly 7 millions of death toll in the last four years. As the world is recovering with improving vaccines and antiviral treatments, the alarming rate of long-COVID, or Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), calls for further investigations. Among a list of symptoms associated with multi-organ dysfunctions, the neurological complications are particularly intriguing, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. With the recently developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 stain, we are now able to model the mild COVID infection in C57BL/6 mice and study the chronic immune responses and subsequent damages in different organs long after the viruses are clearly naturally in the body. More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.

">Polystyrene nanoplastics promote neurodegeneration by catalyzing TDP43 hyperphosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                The ubiquity of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in our environment raises substantial concerns about their potential impact on human health. Recent studies have shown that PS-NPs cross the blood-brain-barrier and accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS), raising the concerns on the causal role of PS-NP exposure and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we utilized human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to examine the effects of PS-NPs on neuronal function and health. Our results revealed that PS-NPs penetrate neuronal cells in a size-dependent manner, and are bound by various cellular proteins, including TDP43, a key protein implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interestingly, CK1 and GSK3beta kinases that are known to phosphorylate TDP-43 were found to be associated with PS-NPs. This observation suggests that PS-NPs may play a role in facilitating conditions that lead to TDP43 phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that exposure to healthy motor neurons with PS-NPs resulted in ALS-like phenotypes, characterized by hyperphosphorylated TDP-43, disrupted neuronal morphology, impaired mitochondrial respiration, and accelerated motor neuron death. These findings suggest that PS-NPs contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and highlight the urgent need for strategies to limit human exposure to nanoplastics.

">Continuous sensorimotor transformation enhances robustness of neural dynamics to perturbation in macaque motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in the motor cortex dynamically evolves to plan and generate movement. How motor cortex adapts to dynamic environments or perturbations remains to be fully explored. In this study, we investigated whether dynamic nature of targets in a reach task requires distinct preparatory dynamics in motor cortex and result in varying levels of robustness against disruptions. Two monkeys were trained to perform delayed center-out reaches either to a static target (static condition) or a rotating target that needed to be intercepted (moving condition). Despite nearly identical hand kinematics in both two conditions, responses to the perturbation of intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) differed. In the static condition, ICMS led to prolonged reaction times, particularly when delivered shortly before movement onset and at anterior sites in PMd, aligning with previous findings. Unexpectedly, ICMS reduced reaction times in the moving condition. Furthermore, neural firing rates differed between the static and the moving conditions, with population activity in the latter exhibiting more rapid changes post-perturbation. Spatio-temporal sensorimotor transformation dominated throughout the preparation in the moving condition, while the static condition showed less stable motor intention representation, particularly during the late delay period. An input-driven model replicated the differences in RT-prolonging effect by assuming distinct input control strategy for the static and the moving condition. These findings suggest that input from a moving target to motor cortex can counteract ICMS effects, enabling the motor network to generate appropriate commands more quickly. Lastly, we propose that ICMS may facilitate go cue recognition, providing a potential explanation for the shortened reaction times in the moving condition.
