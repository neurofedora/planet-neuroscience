We labelled markers of cell division (PCNA), cell migration (DCX) and neuronal maturation (NeuN) in vocal control brain regions of male and female zebra finch brains at four different stages of song learning. Sex differences in the size of these regions emerged by the onset of song learning, and the rate of neurogenic processes varied across brain regions in a sex‐ and region‐specific manner.






Abstract
The brain regions that control the learning and production of song and other learned vocalizations in songbirds exhibit some of the largest sex differences in the brain known in vertebrates, and are associated with sex differences in singing behaviour. Song learning takes place through multiple stages: an early sensory phase when song models are memorized, followed by a sensorimotor phase in which auditory feedback is used to modify song output through subsong, plastic song, to adult crystalized song. However, how patterns of neurogenesis in these brain regions change through these learning stages, and differ between the sexes, is little explored. We collected brains from 63 young male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) over 4 stages of song learning. Using neurogenesis markers for cell division (PCNA), neuron migration (DCX), and mature neurons (NeuN) we demonstrate that there are sex‐specific changes in neurogenesis over song development that differ between the caudal motor pathway and anterior forebrain pathway of the vocal control circuit. In many of these regions sex differences emerged very early in development, by 25 days post hatch, at the beginning of song learning. The emergence of sex differences in other components of the system were more gradual and had specific trajectories depending on the brain region and its function. In conclusion, we found that sex differences occurred early and continued during song learning. Moreover, transitions from the different phases of song development do not seem to depend on large changes in neurogenesis in the vocal control areas measured.

By means of serial block‐face electron microscopy, Wang et al., revealed subcellular structural bases for row‐specific cytoarchitecture and innervation pattern in mouse cochlear amplifier.






Abstract
In mammalian cochlea, sound‐induced vibration is amplified by a three‐row lattice of Y‐shaped microstructures consisting of electromotile outer hair cell and supporting Deiters cell. This highly organized structure is thought to be essential for hearing of low‐level sounds. Prior studies reported differences in geometry and synaptic innervation of the outer hair cells between rows, but how these fine features are achieved at subcellular level still remains unclear. Using serial block‐face electron microscopy, we acquired few‐hundred‐micron‐sized cytoarchitecture of mouse organ of Corti at nanometer resolution. Structural quantifications were performed on the Y‐shapes as well as afferent and efferent projections to OHCs. Several new features which support the previously observed inter‐row heterogeneity are described. Our result provides structural bases for the gradient of mechanical properties and diverse centrifugal regulation of OHC rows.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07428">Genetic Improvement of Routing Protocols for Delay Tolerant Networks. (arXiv:2103.07428v1 [cs.NI])</a></h4>

<p>Routing plays a fundamental role in network applications, but it is
especially challenging in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). These are a kind of
mobile ad hoc networks made of e.g. (possibly, unmanned) vehicles and humans
where, despite a lack of continuous connectivity, data must be transmitted
while the network conditions change due to the nodes' mobility. In these
contexts, routing is NP-hard and is usually solved by heuristic "store and
forward" replication-based approaches, where multiple copies of the same
message are moved and stored across nodes in the hope that at least one will
reach its destination. Still, the existing routing protocols produce relatively
low delivery probabilities. Here, we genetically improve two routing protocols
widely adopted in DTNs, namely Epidemic and PRoPHET, in the attempt to optimize
their delivery probability. First, we dissect them into their fundamental
components, i.e., functionalities such as checking if a node can transfer data,
or sending messages to all connections. Then, we apply Genetic Improvement (GI)
to manipulate these components as terminal nodes of evolving trees. We apply
this methodology, in silico, to six test cases of urban networks made of
hundreds of nodes, and find that GI produces consistent gains in delivery
probability in four cases. We then verify if this improvement entails a
worsening of other relevant network metrics, such as latency and buffer time.
Finally, we compare the logics of the best evolved protocols with those of the
baseline protocols, and we discuss the generalizability of the results across
test cases.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07413">The general aspects of noise in analogue hardware deep neural networks. (arXiv:2103.07413v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Deep neural networks unlocked a vast range of new applications by solving
tasks of which many were previouslydeemed as reserved to higher human
intelligence. One of the developments enabling this success was a boost
incomputing power provided by special purpose hardware, such as graphic or
tensor processing units. However,these do not leverage fundamental features of
neural networks like parallelism and analog state variables.Instead, they
emulate neural networks relying on computing power, which results in
unsustainable energyconsumption and comparatively low speed. Fully parallel and
analogue hardware promises to overcomethese challenges, yet the impact of
analogue neuron noise and its propagation, i.e. accumulation,
threatensrendering such approaches inept. Here, we analyse for the first time
the propagation of noise in paralleldeep neural networks comprising noisy
nonlinear neurons. We develop an analytical treatment for both,symmetric
networks to highlight the underlying mechanisms, and networks trained with back
propagation.We find that noise accumulation is generally bound, and adding
additional network layers does not worsenthe signal to noise ratio beyond this
limit. Most importantly, noise accumulation can be suppressed entirelywhen
neuron activation functions have a slope smaller than unity. We therefore
developed the frameworkfor noise of deep neural networks implemented in analog
systems, and identify criteria allowing engineers todesign noise-resilient
novel neural network hardware.

<p>We constructed a hippocampal formation (HPF)-inspired probabilistic
generative model (HPF-PGM) using the structure-constrained interface
decomposition method. By modeling brain regions with PGMs, this model is
positioned as a module that can be integrated as a whole-brain PGM. We discuss
the relationship between simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in
robotics and the findings of HPF in neuroscience. Furthermore, we survey the
modeling for HPF and various computational models, including brain-inspired
SLAM, spatial concept formation, and deep generative models. The HPF-PGM is a
computational model that is highly consistent with the anatomical structure and
functions of the HPF, in contrast to typical conventional SLAM models. By
referencing the brain, we suggest the importance of the integration of
egocentric/allocentric information from the entorhinal cortex to the
hippocampus and the use of discrete-event queues.

<p>Process monitoring based on neural networks is getting more and more
attention. Compared with classical neural networks, high-order neural networks
have natural advantages in dealing with heteroscedastic data. However,
high-order neural networks might bring the risk of overfitting and learning
both the key information from original data and noises or anomalies. Orthogonal
constraints can greatly reduce correlations between extracted features, thereby
reducing the overfitting risk. This paper proposes a novel fault detection
method called second-order component analysis (SCA). SCA rules out the
heteroscedasticity of pro-cess data by optimizing a second-order autoencoder
with orthogonal constraints. In order to deal with this constrained
optimization problem, a geometric conjugate gradient algorithm is adopted in
this paper, which performs geometric optimization on the combination of Stiefel
manifold and Euclidean manifold. Extensive experiments on the Tennessee-Eastman
benchmark pro-cess show that SCA outperforms PCA, KPCA, and autoencoder in
missed detection rate (MDR) and false alarm rate (FAR).

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07279">Patient-specific virtual spine straightening and vertebra inpainting: An automatic framework for osteoplasty planning. (arXiv:2103.07279v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Symptomatic spinal vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) often require
osteoplasty treatment. A cement-like material is injected into the bone to
stabilize the fracture, restore the vertebral body height and alleviate pain.
Leakage is a common complication and may occur due to too much cement being
injected. In this work, we propose an automated patient-specific framework that
can allow physicians to calculate an upper bound of cement for the injection
and estimate the optimal outcome of osteoplasty. The framework uses the patient
CT scan and the fractured vertebra label to build a virtual healthy spine using
a high-level approach. Firstly, the fractured spine is segmented with a
three-step Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Next, a per-vertebra
rigid registration to a healthy spine atlas restores its curvature. Finally, a
GAN-based inpainting approach replaces the fractured vertebra with an
estimation of its original shape. Based on this outcome, we then estimate the
maximum amount of bone cement for injection. We evaluate our framework by
comparing the virtual vertebrae volumes of ten patients to their healthy
equivalent and report an average error of 3.88$\pm$7.63\%. The presented
pipeline offers a first approach to a personalized automatic high-level
framework for planning osteoplasty procedures.

<p>The transition away from carbon-based energy sources poses several challenges
for the operation of electricity distribution systems. Increasing shares of
distributed energy resources (e.g. renewable energy generators, electric
vehicles) and internet-connected sensing and control devices (e.g. smart
heating and cooling) require new tools to support accurate, datadriven decision
making. Modelling the effect of such growing complexity in the electrical grid
is possible in principle using state-of-the-art power-power flow models. In
practice, the detailed information needed for these physical simulations may be
unknown or prohibitively expensive to obtain. Hence, datadriven approaches to
power systems modelling, including feedforward neural networks and
auto-encoders, have been studied to leverage the increasing availability of
sensor data, but have seen limited practical adoption due to lack of
transparency and inefficiencies on large-scale problems. Our work addresses
this gap by proposing a data- and knowledge-driven probabilistic graphical
model for energy systems based on the framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). The model can explicitly factor in domain knowledge, in the form of
grid topology or physics constraints, thus resulting in sparser architectures
and much smaller parameters dimensionality when compared with traditional
machine-learning models with similar accuracy. Results obtained from a
real-world smart-grid demonstration project show how the GNN was used to inform
grid congestion predictions and market bidding services for a distribution
system operator participating in an energy flexibility market.

<p>Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hot topic in the field of AutoML, and
has begun to outperform human-designed architectures on many machine learning
tasks. Motivated by the natural representation form of neural networks by the
Cartesian genetic programming (CGP), we propose an evolutionary approach of NAS
based on CGP, called CPGNAS, for CNN architectures solving sentence
classification task. To evolve the CNN architectures under the framework of
CGP, the existing key operations are identified as the types of function nodes
of CGP and the evolutionary operations are designed based on evolutionary
strategy (ES). The experimental results show that the searched architecture can
reach the accuracy of human-designed architectures. The ablation tests identify
the Attention function as the single key function node and the Convolution and
Attention as the joint key function nodes. However, the linear transformations
along could keep the accuracy of evolved architectures over 70%, which is worth
of investigating in the future.

<p>Visual perceptions often come with illusions whose physical origin are not
well understood yet. The encoding of stochastic light intensity $x(t)$ into
spikes with firing rate $r(t)$ at time $t$ is investigated in an experiment
with retinas from bullfrogs to understand the mechanism of anticipation.
Partial information decomposition of the mutual information between $r$ and the
combined state $\{x,\dot x\}$ is found to be consistent with the encoding form:
$r(t) \sim (1-\lambda)x(t) + \lambda \dot x(t) \tau_0$ with $\lambda$ being a
system dependent parameter and $\tau_0$ a constant. This form of $r(t)$
indicates that a retina is capable of anticipation based on the synergistic
information generation between $x$ and $\dot x$. Our results suggest that
illusions such as the anticipation studied here during retinal perception can
originate from the recombination of information extracted in the retinal
network.

<p>The electroencephalographic (EEG) signals provide highly informative data on
brain activities and functions. However, their heterogeneity and high
dimensionality may represent an obstacle for their interpretation. The
introduction of a priori knowledge seems the best option to mitigate high
dimensionality problems, but could lose some information and patterns present
in the data, while data heterogeneity remains an open issue that often makes
generalization difficult. In this study, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA)
for feature selection that can be used with a supervised or unsupervised
approach. Our proposal considers three different fitness functions without
relying on expert knowledge. Starting from two publicly available datasets on
cognitive workload and motor movement/imagery, the EEG signals are processed,
normalized and their features computed in the time, frequency and
time-frequency domains. The feature vector selection is performed by applying
our GA proposal and compared with two benchmarking techniques. The results show
that different combinations of our proposal achieve better results in respect
to the benchmark in terms of overall performance and feature reduction.
Moreover, the proposed GA, based on a novel fitness function here presented,
outperforms the benchmark when the two different datasets considered are merged
together, showing the effectiveness of our proposal on heterogeneous data.

<p>How do pedestrians choose their paths within city street networks? Human path
planning has been extensively studied at the aggregate level of mobility flows,
and at the individual level with strictly designed behavioural experiments.
However, a comprehensive, individual-level model of how humans select
pedestrian paths in real urban environments is still lacking. Here, we analyze
human path planning behaviour in a large dataset of individual pedestrians,
whose GPS traces were continuously recorded as they pursued their daily goals.
Through statistical analysis we reveal two robust empirical discoveries, namely
that (1) people increasingly deviate from the shortest path as the distance
between origin and destination increases, and (2) individual choices exhibit
direction-dependent asymmetries when origin and destination are swapped. In
order to address the above findings, which cannot be explained by existing
models, we develop a vector-based navigation framework motivated by the neural
evidence of direction-encoding cells in hippocampal brain networks, and by
behavioural evidence of vector navigation in animals. Modelling pedestrian path
preferences by vector-based navigation increases the model's predictive power
by 35%, compared to a model based on minimizing distance with stochastic
effects. We show that these empirical findings and modelling results generalise
across two major US cities with drastically different street networks,
suggesting that vector-based navigation is a universal property of human path
planning, independent of specific city environments. Our results offer a
simple, unified explanation of numerous findings about human navigation, and
posit a computational mechanism that may underlie the human capacity to
efficiently navigate in environments at various scales.

<p>Networks of strongly-coupled neurons with random connectivity exhibit
chaotic, asynchronous fluctuations. In previous work, we showed that when
endowed with an additional low-rank connectivity consisting of the outer
product of orthogonal vectors, these networks generate large-scale coherent
fluctuations. Although a striking phenomenon, that result depended on a
fine-tuned choice of low-rank structure. Here we extend that work by
generalizing the theory of excitation-inhibition balance to networks with
arbitrary low-rank structure and show that low-dimensional variability emerges
intrinsically through what we call incomplete recurrent alignment. We say that
a low-rank connectivity structure exhibits incomplete alignment if its
row-space is not contained in its column-space. In the setting of incomplete
alignment, recurrent connectivity can be decomposed into a subspace-recurrent
component and an effective-feedforward component. We show that
high-dimensional, microscopic fluctuations are propagated via the
effective-feedforward component to a low-dimensional subspace where they are
dynamically balanced by macroscopic fluctuations. We present biologically
plausible examples from excitation-inhibition networks and networks with
heterogeneous degree distributions. Finally, we define the alignment matrix as
the overlap between left and right-singular vectors of the structured
connectivity, and show that the singular values of the alignment matrix
determine the amplitude of macroscopic variability, while its singular vectors
determine the structure. Our work shows how macroscopic fluctuations can emerge
generically in strongly-coupled networks with low-rank structure. Furthermore,
by generalizing excitation-inhibition balance to arbitrary low-rank structure
our work may find relevance in any setting with strongly interacting units,
whether in biological, social, or technological networks.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.655019">Research on the Modality Transfer Method of Brain Imaging Based on Generative Adversarial Network</a></h4>

<p>Brain imaging technology is an important means to study brain diseases. The commonly used brain imaging technologies are fMRI and EEG. Clinical practice has shown that although fMRI is superior to EEG in observing the anatomical details of some diseases that are difficult to diagnose, its costs are prohibitive. In particular, more and more patients who use metal implants cannot use this technology. In contrast, EEG technology is easier to implement. Therefore, to break through the limitations of fMRI technology, we propose a brain imaging modality transfer framework, namely BMT-GAN, based on a generative adversarial network. The framework introduces a new non-adversarial loss to reduce the perception and style difference between input and output images. It also realizes the conversion from EEG modality data to fMRI modality data and provides comprehensive reference information of EEG and fMRI for radiologists. Finally, a qualitative and quantitative comparison with the existing GAN-based brain imaging modality transfer approaches demonstrates the superiority of our framework.</p>

Background<p>In recent years, imaging technologies have been rapidly evolving, with an emphasis on the characterization of brain structure changes and functional imaging in patients with autoimmune encephalitis. However, the neural basis of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and its linked cognitive decline is unclear. Our research aimed to assess changes in the functional brain network in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and whether these changes lead to cognitive impairment.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-one anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients and 22 age-, gender-, and education status-matched healthy controls were assessed using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning and neuropsychological tests, including the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD<sub>24</sub>), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A functional brain network was constructed using fMRI, and the topology of the network parameters was analyzed using graph theory. Next, we extracted the aberrant topological parameters of the functional network as seeds and compared causal connectivity with the whole brain. Lastly, we explored the correlation of aberrant topological structures with deficits in cognitive performance.</p>Results<p>Relative to healthy controls, anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients exhibited decreased MoCA scores and increased HAMA and HAMD<sub>24</sub> scores (p &lt; 0.05). The nodal clustering coefficient and nodal local efficiency of the left insula (Insula_L) were significantly decreased in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients (p &lt; 0.05 following Bonferroni correction). Moreover, anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients showed a weakened causal connectivity from the left insula to the left inferior parietal lobe (Parietal_Inf_L) compared to healthy controls. Conversely, the left superior parietal lobe (Parietal_sup_L) exhibited an enhanced causal connectivity to the left insula in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients compared to controls. Unexpectedly, these alterations were not correlated with any neuropsychological test scores.</p>Conclusion<p>This research describes topological abnormalities in the functional brain network in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. These results will be conducive to understand the structure and function of the brain network of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and further explore the neuropathophysiological mechanisms.</p>

<p>Clinical responses to dopamine replacement therapy for individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are often difficult to predict. We characterized changes in MDS-UPDRS motor factor scores resulting from a short-duration L-Dopa response (SDR), and investigated how the inter-subject clinical differences could be predicted from motor cortical magnetoencephalography (MEG). MDS-UPDRS motor factor scores and resting-state MEG recordings were collected during SDR from twenty individuals with a PD diagnosis. We used a novel subject-specific strategy based on linear support vector machines to quantify motor cortical oscillatory frequency profiles that best predicted medication state. Motor cortical profiles differed substantially across individuals and showed consistency across multiple data folds. There was a linear relationship between classification accuracy and SDR of lower limb bradykinesia, although this relationship did not persist after multiple comparison correction, suggesting that combinations of spectral power features alone are insufficient to predict clinical state. Factor score analysis of therapeutic response and novel subject-specific machine learning approaches based on subject-specific neuroimaging provide tools to predict outcomes of therapies for PD.</p>

Aim<p>The present work proposes the study of the neuromotor activity of the masseter-jaw-tongue articulation during diadochokinetic exercising to establish functional statistical relationships between surface Electromyography (sEMG), 3D Accelerometry (3DAcc), and acoustic features extracted from the speech signal, with the aim of characterizing Hypokinetic Dysarthria (HD).

The dynamic and acoustic absolute kinematic velocities produced during the exercises were estimated by acoustic filter inversion and numerical integration and differentiation of the speech signal. The amplitude distributions of the absolute kinematic and acoustic velocities (AKV and AFV) are estimated to allow comparisons in terms of Mutual Information.</p>Results<p>The regression results show the relationships between sEMG and dynamic and acoustic estimates. The projection methodology may help in understanding the basic neuromotor muscle activity regarding neurodegenerative speech in remote monitoring neuromotor and neurocognitive diseases using speech as the vehicular tool, and in the study of other speech-related disorders. The study also showed strong and significant cross-correlations between articulation kinematics, both for the control and the PD cohorts. The absolute kinematic variables presents an observable difference for the PD participants compared to the control group.</p>Conclusion<p>Kinematic distributions derived from acoustic analysis may be useful biomarkers toward characterizing HD in neuromotor disorders providing new insights into PD.</p>

<p>Face recognition is impaired in patients with prosopagnosia, which may occur as a side effect of neurosurgical procedures. Face selective regions on the ventral temporal cortex have been localized with electrical cortical stimulation (ECS), electrocorticography (ECoG), and functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI). This is the first group study using within-patient comparisons to validate face selective regions mapping, utilizing the aforementioned modalities. Five patients underwent surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy and joined the study. Subdural grid electrodes were implanted on their ventral temporal cortices to localize seizure foci and face selective regions as part of the functional mapping protocol. Face selective regions were identified in all patients with fMRI, four patients with ECoG, and two patients with ECS. From 177 tested electrode locations in the region of interest (ROI), which is defined by the fusiform gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus, 54 face locations were identified by at least one modality in all patients. fMRI mapping showed the highest detection rate, revealing 70.4% for face selective locations, whereas ECoG and ECS identified 64.8 and 31.5%, respectively. Thus, 28 face locations were co-localized by at least two modalities, with detection rates of 89.3% for fMRI, 85.7% for ECoG and 53.6 % for ECS. All five patients had no face recognition deficits after surgery, even though five of the face selective locations, one obtained by ECoG and the other four by fMRI, were within 10 mm to the resected volumes. Moreover, fMRI included a quite large volume artifact on the ventral temporal cortex in the ROI from the anatomical structures of the temporal base. In conclusion, ECS was not sensitive in several patients, whereas ECoG and fMRI even showed activation within 10 mm to the resected volumes. Considering the potential signal drop-out in fMRI makes ECoG the most reliable tool to identify face selective locations in this study. A multimodal approach can improve the specificity of ECoG and fMRI, while simultaneously minimizing the number of required ECS sessions. Hence, all modalities should be considered in a clinical mapping protocol entailing combined results of co-localized face selective locations.</p>

<p>Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) is a diffusion model specifically designed for brain magnetic resonance imaging. Despite recent studies suggesting that NODDI modeling might be more sensitive to brain development than diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), these studies were limited to a relatively small age range and mainly based on the manually operated region of interest analysis. Therefore, this study applied NODDI to investigate brain development in a large sample size of 214 subjects ranging in ages from 0 to 14. The whole brain was automatically segmented into 122 regions. The maturation trajectory of each region was characterized by the time course of diffusion metrics and further quantified using nonlinear regression. The NODDI-derived metrics, neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI), increased with age. And these two metrics were superior to the DTI-derived metrics in SVM regression models of age. The NDI in white matter exhibited a more rapid growth than that in gray matter (including the cortex and deep nucleus). These diffusion indicators experienced conspicuous increases during early childhood and the growth speed slowed down in adolescence. Region-specific maturation patterns were described throughout the brain, including white matter, cortical and deep gray matter. These development patterns were evaluated and discussed on the basis of NODDI’s model assumptions. To summarize, this study verified the high sensitivity of NODDI to age over a crucial developmental period from newborn to adolescence. Moreover, the existing knowledge of brain development has been complemented, suggesting that NODDI has a potential capability in the investigation of brain development.</p>

<p>Motor learning is the process of updating motor commands in response to a trajectory error induced by a perturbation to the body or vision. The brain has a great capability to accelerate learning by increasing the sensitivity of the memory update to the perceived trajectory errors. Conventional theory suggests that the statistics of perturbations or the statistics of the experienced errors induced by the external perturbations determine the learning speeds. However, the potential effect of another type of error perception, a self-generated error as a result of motor command updates (i.e., an aftereffect), on the learning speeds has not been examined yet. In this study, we dissociated the two kinds of errors by controlling the perception of the aftereffect using a channel-force environment. One group experienced errors due to the aftereffect of the learning process, while the other did not. We found that the participants who perceived the aftereffect of the memory updates exhibited a significant decrease in error-sensitivity, whereas the participants who did not perceive the aftereffect did not show an increase or decrease in error-sensitivity. This suggests that the perception of the aftereffect of learning attenuated updating the motor commands from the perceived errors. Thus, both self-generated and externally induced errors may modulate learning speeds.</p>

<p>In this systematic review, we collected and analyzed literature works comparing self-reported fatigue and objectively-measured fatigue in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and in age-matched typically developing/typically developed (TD) controls (Healthy). The search was conducted on four electronic databases/platforms (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) using the key words “cerebral palsy” combined with “fatig<sup>*</sup>,” where the asterisk was used as a wildcard. As a critical appraisal tool, the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies (2017) was used. A total of 22 studies passed the critical appraisal rating and were included in both narrative and quantitative analyses. The overall evidence quality of the findings was considered very good. Data of objectively-measured fatigue in performing maximal fatiguing tasks indicated lower fatigue levels in participants with CP, possibly due to their pathological inability to recruit highly fatigable muscle fibers. Highly trained individuals with CP and TD controls performing maximal fatiguing tasks seem to be an exception to this, as they exhibited similar levels of fatigue. In submaximal fatiguing tasks, including daily physical activities, either objectively-measured or self-reported fatigue was higher in participants with CP than in TD controls, indicating a lower ability for development of neurophysiological compensation for fatigue among participants with CP. Further studies on fatigue are needed to gain an insight into the multifold mechanisms of fatigue in individuals with CP. Understanding fatigue mechanisms could help in setting up strategies for effective intervention programs, with benefits in healthcare and improved quality of life of individuals with CP.</p><p>Systematic Review Registration: [PROSPERO 2019], identifier [CRD42019143524].</p>

<p>Neuromodulation by acetylcholine plays a vital role in shaping the physiology and functions of cerebral cortex. Cholinergic neuromodulation influences brain-state transitions, controls the gating of cortical sensory stimulus responses, and has been shown to influence the generation and maintenance of persistent activity in prefrontal cortex. Here we review our current understanding of the role of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in primate prefrontal cortex during its engagement in the performance of working memory tasks. We summarize the localization of muscarinic receptors in prefrontal cortex, review the effects of muscarinic neuromodulation on arousal, working memory and cognitive control tasks, and describe the effects of muscarinic M1 receptor stimulation and blockade on the generation and maintenance of persistent activity of prefrontal neurons encoding working memory representations. Recent studies describing the pharmacological effects of M1 receptors on prefrontal persistent activity demonstrate the heterogeneity of muscarinic actions and delineate unexpected modulatory effects discovered in primate prefrontal cortex when compared with studies in rodents. Understanding the underlying mechanisms by which muscarinic receptors regulate prefrontal cognitive control circuitry will inform the search of muscarinic-based therapeutic targets in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Trans-regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) transmembrane proteins has emerged as a novel type of synaptic molecular interaction in the last decade. Several studies on LRR–GPCR interactions have revealed their critical role in synapse formation and in establishing synaptic properties. Among them, LRR–GPCR interactions between extracellular LRR fibronectin domain-containing family proteins (Elfn1 and Elfn2) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are particularly interesting as they can affect a broad range of synapses through the modulation of signaling by glutamate, the principal excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Elfn–mGluR interactions have been investigated in hippocampal, cortical, and retinal synapses. Postsynaptic Elfn1 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex mediates the tonic regulation of excitatory input onto somatostatin-positive interneurons (INs) through recruitment of presynaptic mGluR7. In the retina, presynaptic Elfn1 binds to mGluR6 and is necessary for synapse formation between rod photoreceptor cells and rod-bipolar cells. The repertoire of binding partners for Elfn1 and Elfn2 includes all group III mGluRs (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8), and both Elfn1 and Elfn2 can alter mGluR-mediated signaling through trans-interaction. Importantly, both preclinical and clinical studies have provided support for the involvement of the Elfn1–mGluR7 interaction in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and epilepsy. In fact, Elfn1–mGluR7-associated disorders may reflect the altered function of somatostatin-positive interneuron inhibitory neural circuits, the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, and habenular circuits, highlighting the need for further investigation into this interaction.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irrevocable neurodegenerative condition characterized by the presence of senile plaques comprising amassed β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles mainly comprising extremely phosphorylated Tau proteins. Recent studies have emphasized the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of AD. A number of miRNAs, namely, miR-200a-3p, miR-195, miR-338-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-132, miR-384, miR-339-5p, miR-135b, miR-425-5p, and miR-339-5p, have been shown to participate in the development of AD through interacting with BACE1. Other miRNAs might affect the inflammatory responses in the course of AD. Aberrant expression of several miRNAs in the plasma samples of AD subjects has been shown to have the aptitude for differentiation of AD subjects from healthy subjects. Finally, a number of AD-modifying agents affect miRNA profile in cell cultures or animal models. We have performed a comprehensive search and summarized the obtained data about the function of miRNAs in AD in the current review article.</p>

<p>Well-established literature indicates that older adults have poorer cerebral white matter integrity, as measured through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Age differences in DTI have been observed widely across white matter, although some tracts appear more sensitive to the effects of aging than others. Factors like APOE ε4 status and sex may contribute to individual differences in white matter integrity that also selectively impact certain tracts, and could influence DTI changes in aging. The present study explored the degree to which age, APOE ε4, and sex exerted global vs. tract specific effects on DTI metrics in cognitively healthy late middle-aged to older adults. Data from 49 older adults (ages 54–92) at two time-points separated by approximately 2.7 years were collected. DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were extracted from nine white matter tracts and global white matter. Results showed that across timepoints, FA and MD increased globally, with no tract-specific changes observed. Baseline age had a global influence on both measures, with increasing age associated with lower FA and higher MD. After controlling for global white matter FA, age additionally predicted FA for the genu, callosum body, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and both anterior and posterior cingulum. Females exhibited lower global FA on average compared to males. In contrast, MD was selectively elevated in the anterior cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), for females compared to males. APOE ε4 status was not predictive of either measure. In summary, these results indicate that age and sex are associated with both global and tract-specific alterations to DTI metrics among a healthy older adult cohort. Older women have poorer white matter integrity compared to older men, perhaps related to menopause-induced metabolic changes. While age-related alterations to white matter integrity are global, there is substantial variation in the degree to which tracts are impacted, possibly as a consequence of tract anatomical variability. The present study highlights the importance of accounting for global sources of variation in DTI metrics when attempting to investigate individual differences (due to age, sex, or other factors) in specific white matter tracts.</p>

<p>Background and Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the different subtypes of anterior choroidal artery (AChoA) aneurysm based on a new classification and to analyze the risk factors according to individual endovascular treatment (EVT).</p><p>Methods: In the new classification, AChoA aneurysms are classified into independent type (I type) and dependent type (II type) based on the relationship between the AChoA and the aneurysm. II type aneurysms have three subtypes, IIa (neck), IIb (body), and IIc (direct). We retrospectively analyzed 52 cases of AChoA aneurysm treated in our center between 2015 to 2019. There were 13 (25.0%) I type aneurysms, 24 (46.2%) IIa aneurysms, 15 (28.8%) IIb aneurysms, and no IIc type; 28 cases had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. According to our preoperative EVT plan for the different subtypes: II type should achieve Raymond-Roy Occlusion Class 1 (RROC 1) where possible. To protect the AChoA, it is best to preserve the neck of the IIa type aneurysms (RROC 2), and RROC 3 is enough for IIb type.</p><p>Results: Ten asymptomatic cases with minimal aneurysms were treated conservatively. Of the other cases, 42 were treated with individualized EVT (26 with a simple coil, 6 with balloon-assisted coiling, 7 with stent-assisted coiling, and 3 by flow diverter. Different subtypes had different RROC (Z = 14.026, P = 0.001). IIb type aneurysms (χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.54, P = 0.023) were one of the factors related to temporary or permanent AChoA injury during surgery. Overall, two patients (IIa = 1, IIb = 1) developed contralateral hemiparesis.</p><p>Conclusions: The new classification diagram clearly shows the features of all types of AChoA aneurysm and makes EVT planning more explicit. The II type (particularly IIb) was a potential risk factor for AChoA injury.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67932">Wnt signaling enhances macrophage responses to IL-4 and promotes resolution of atherosclerosis</a></h4>

Atherosclerosis is a disease of chronic inflammation. We investigated the roles of the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, the classical activators of STAT6, in the resolution of atherosclerosis inflammation. Using <i>Il4<sup>-/-</sup>Il13<sup>-/-</sup></i><sup> </sup>mice, resolution was impaired, and in control mice, in both progressing and resolving plaques, levels of IL-4 were stably low, and IL-13 was undetectable. This suggested that IL-4 is required for atherosclerosis resolution, but collaborates with other factors. We had observed increased Wnt signaling in macrophages in resolving plaques, and human genetic data from others showed that a loss-of-function Wnt mutation was associated with premature atherosclerosis. We now find an inverse association between activation of Wnt signaling and disease severity in mice and humans. Wnt enhanced the expression of inflammation resolving factors after treatment with plaque-relevant low concentrations of IL-4. Mechanistically, activation of the Wnt pathway following lipid lowering potentiates IL-4 responsiveness in macrophages via a PGE<sub>2</sub>/STAT3 axis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66668">GAF is essential for zygotic genome activation and chromatin accessibility in the early <i>Drosophila </i>embryo</a></h4>

Following fertilization, the genomes of the germ cells are reprogrammed to form the totipotent embryo. Pioneer transcription factors are essential for remodeling the chromatin and driving the initial wave of zygotic gene expression. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the pioneer factor Zelda is essential for development through this dramatic period of reprogramming, known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). However, it was unknown whether additional pioneer factors were required for this transition. We identified an additional maternally encoded factor required for development through the MZT, GAGA Factor (GAF). GAF is necessary to activate widespread zygotic transcription and to remodel the chromatin accessibility landscape. We demonstrated that Zelda preferentially controls expression of the earliest transcribed genes, while genes expressed during widespread activation are predominantly dependent on GAF. Thus, progression through the MZT requires coordination of multiple pioneer-like factors, and we propose that as development proceeds control is gradually transferred from Zelda to GAF.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65722">Quantifying absolute gene expression profiles reveals distinct regulation of central carbon metabolism genes in yeast</a></h4>

In addition to controlled expression of genes by specific regulatory circuits, the abundance of proteins and transcripts can also be influenced by physiological states of the cell such as growth rate and metabolism. Here we examine the control of gene expression by growth rate and metabolism, by analyzing a multi-omics dataset consisting of absolute-quantitative abundances of the transcriptome, proteome, and amino acids in 22 steady-state yeast cultures. We find that transcription and translation are coordinately controlled by the cell growth rate via RNA polymerase II and ribosome abundance, but they are independently controlled by nitrogen metabolism via amino acid and nucleotide availabilities. Genes in central carbon metabolism, however, are distinctly regulated and do not respond to the cell growth rate or nitrogen metabolism as all other genes. Understanding these effects allows the confounding factors of growth rate and metabolism to be accounted for in gene expression profiling studies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63661">Control and regulation of acetate overflow in <i>Escherichia coli</i></a></h4>

Overflow metabolism refers to the production of seemingly wasteful by-products by cells during growth on glucose even when oxygen is abundant. Two theories have been proposed to explain acetate overflow in <i>Escherichia coli</i> – global control of the central metabolism and local control of the acetate pathway – but neither accounts for all observations. Here, we develop a kinetic model of <i>E. coli</i> metabolism that quantitatively accounts for observed behaviors and successfully predicts the response of <i>E. coli</i> to new perturbations. We reconcile these theories and clarify the origin, control and regulation of the acetate flux. We also find that, in turns, acetate regulates glucose metabolism by coordinating the expression of glycolytic and TCA genes. Acetate should not be considered a wasteful end-product since it is also a co-substrate and a global regulator of glucose metabolism in <i>E. coli</i>. This has broad implications for our understanding of overflow metabolism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63407">Respiratory depression and analgesia by opioid drugs in freely-behaving larval zebrafish</a></h4>

An opioid epidemic is spreading in North America with millions of opioid overdoses annually. Opioid drugs, like fentanyl, target the mu opioid receptor system and induce potentially lethal respiratory depression. The challenge in opioid research is to find a safe pain therapy with analgesic properties but no respiratory depression. Current discoveries are limited by lack of amenable animal models to screen candidate drugs. Zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) is an emerging animal model with high reproduction and fast development, which shares remarkable similarity in their physiology and genome to mammals. However, it is unknown whether zebrafish possesses similar opioid system, respiratory and analgesic responses to opioids than mammals. In freely-behaving larval zebrafish, fentanyl depresses the rate of respiratory mandible movements and induces analgesia, effects reversed by mu-opioid receptor antagonists. Zebrafish presents evolutionary conserved mechanisms of action of opioid drugs, also found in mammals, and constitute amenable models for phenotype-based drug discovery.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63115">Genetic association and causal inference converge on hyperglycaemia as a modifiable factor to improve lung function</a></h4>

Measures of lung function are heritable, and thus, we sought to utilise genetics to propose drug repurposing candidates that could improve respiratory outcomes. Lung function measures were found to be genetically correlated with seven druggable biochemical traits, with further evidence of a causal relationship between increased fasting glucose and diminished lung function. Moreover, we developed polygenic scores for lung function specifically within pathways with known drug targets and investigated their relationship with pulmonary phenotypes and gene expression in independent cohorts to prioritise individuals who may benefit from particular drug repurposing opportunities. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of lung function was then performed which identified several drug-gene interactions with predicted lung function increasing modes of action. Drugs that regulate blood glucose were uncovered through both the polygenic scoring and TWAS methodologies. In summary, we provided genetic justification for a number of novel drug repurposing opportunities that could improve lung function.

Abstract
The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is composed of glutamatergic neurons at the midbrain‐hindbrain junction. These neurons form many subpopulations, one of which expresses Calca, which encodes the neuropeptide CGRP. This Calca‐expressing subpopulation has been implicated in a variety of homeostatic functions, but the overall distribution of Calca‐expressing neurons in this region remains unclear. Also, while previous studies in rats and mice have identified output projections from CGRP‐immunoreactive or Calca‐expressing neurons, we lack a comprehensive understanding of their efferent projections. We began by identifying neurons with Calca mRNA and CGRP immunoreactivity in and around the PB, including populations in the locus coeruleus and motor trigeminal nucleus. Calca‐expressing neurons in the PB prominently express the mu opioid receptor (Oprm1) and are distinct from neighboring neurons that express Foxp2 and Pdyn. Next, we used Cre‐dependent anterograde tracing with synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of these neurons. Calca‐expressing PB neurons heavily target subregions of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, basal forebrain, thalamic intralaminar and ventral posterior parvicellular nuclei, and hindbrain, in different patterns depending on the injection site location within the PB region. Retrograde axonal tracing revealed that the previously unreported hindbrain projections arise from a rostral‐ventral subset of CGRP/Calca neurons. Finally, we show that these efferent projections of Calca‐expressing neurons are distinct from those of neighboring PB neurons that express Pdyn. This information provides a detailed neuroanatomical framework for interpreting experimental work involving CGRP/Calca‐expressing neurons and opioid action in the PB region.

Twenty-five Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 5 in each): (1) healthy control (control), (2) Alzheimer disease (AD), (3) AD with treadmill exercise (AD + Exe), (4) AD with probiotic (combined administration of <em class="a-plus-plus">Bifidobacterium bifidum</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">Lactobacillus plantarum</em>) treatment (AD + Pro), and (5) AD with treadmill exercise and probiotic treatment (AD + Exe + Pro). AD was induced by intra-cerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 peptide. Then, the training groups exercised on treadmill for 8 weeks, 5 days per weeks. The rats were treated daily with probiotic supplements via gavage for 8 weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was administered to measure spatial learning. Then, the animals were sacrificed and <em class="a-plus-plus">Vegf</em> and ACH were analyzed using the qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods, respectively. Results showed that the β-amyloid plaques were significantly increased in the brains of the AD group compared with the control group (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). The combined use of probiotics and exercise training significantly increased the time spent in the target quadrant after removing the platform, compared with the AD group in the Morris water maze test (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). Crystal violet analysis showed that sole (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01) and combined exercise training and probiotic supplementation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) significantly reduced the number of dead cells in the brains of rats compared with the AD group. AD significantly decreased <em class="a-plus-plus">Vegf</em> mRNA and ACH in the CA1 area of the hippocampus (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). However, mono and combined therapy (exercise and probiotics) significantly increased ACH in the rats’ brain compared with the AD group. Overall, 8 weeks of an administration of <em class="a-plus-plus">Bifidobacterium bifidum </em>and <em class="a-plus-plus">Lactobacillus plantarum</em> combined with exercise training can improve spatial learning impairment in the AD rats. Exercise and probiotics seem to offer potential benefits to AD patients by upregulating ACH.</p>

Studies of hippocampal learning have obtained seemingly contradictory results, with manipulations that increase coactivation of memories sometimes leading to differentiation of these memories, but sometimes not. These results could potentially be reconciled using the nonmonotonic plasticity hypothesis, which posits that representational change (memories moving apart or together) is a U-shaped function of the coactivation of these memories during learning. Testing this hypothesis requires manipulating coactivation over a wide enough range to reveal the full U-shape. To accomplish this, we used a novel neural network image synthesis procedure to create pairs of stimuli that varied parametrically in their similarity in high-level visual regions that provide input to the hippocampus. Sequences of these pairs were shown to human participants during high-resolution fMRI. As predicted, learning changed the representations of paired images in the dentate gyrus as a U-shaped function of image similarity, with neural differentiation occurring only for moderately similar images.

The transmission of high-frequency temporal information across brain regions is critical to perception, but the mechanisms underlying such transmission remain unclear. Long-range projection patterns across brain areas are often comprised of paired feedforward excitation followed closely by delayed inhibition, including the thalamic triad synapse, thalamic projections to cortex, and projections within hippocampus. Previous studies have shown that these joint projections produce a shortened period of depolarization, sharpening the timing window over which the postsynaptic neuron can fire. Here we show that these projections can facilitate the transmission of high-frequency computations even at frequencies that are highly filtered by neuronal membranes. Further, they can coordinate computations across multiple brain areas, even amid ongoing local activity. We suggest that paired feedforward excitation and inhibition provides a hybrid signal - carrying both a value and a clock-like trigger - to allow circuits to be responsive to input whenever it arrives.

Cortical feedback has long been considered crucial for modulation of sensory processing. In the mammalian auditory system, studies have suggested that corticofugal feedback can have excitatory, inhibitory, or both effects on the response of subcortical neurons, leading to controversies regarding the role of corticothalamic influence. This has been further complicated by studies conducted under different brain states. In the current study, we used cryo-inactivation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) to examine the role of corticothalamic feedback on medial geniculate body (MGB) neurons in awake marmosets. The primary effects of A1 inactivation were a frequency-specific decrease in the auditory response of MGB neurons coupled with an increased spontaneous firing rate, which together resulted in a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we report for the first-time that A1 robustly modulated the long-lasting sustained response of MGB neurons which changed the frequency tuning after A1 inactivation, e.g., neurons with sharp tuning increased tuning bandwidth whereas those with broad tuning decreased tuning bandwidth. Taken together, our results demonstrate that corticothalamic modulation in awake marmosets serves to enhance sensory processing in a way similar to center-surround models proposed in visual and somatosensory systems, a finding which supports common principles of corticothalamic processing across sensory systems.

The increasing number of neuroimaging scans in recent years has facilitated the use of complex nonlinear approaches to analyzing such data. More specifically, deep learning, which has been previously hindered by the curse of dimensionality is now feasible. However, it remains challenging to use these techniques develop reliable biomarkers and find an optimal representation of data that explains the biological underpinnings of the mental disorders Here, we employed a 3-dimensional autoencoder with an architecture designed from the ground up for task-fMRI data. Our study presented a coherent strategy for optimizing model parameters and architecture and a method for visualizing and interpreting the latent space representation. We trained our model with multi-task fMRI data derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) that provides whole-brain coverage across a range of cognitive tasks. Next, in a transfer learning setting, we tested the generalization of our latent space on UK Biobank data as an independent dataset. We showed that the model did not only learn salient features such as age but also high-level behavioral characteristics and that this representation was highly generic and generalizable to an independent dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the projection of latent space back into the original space is meaningful and interpretable. Finally, our results show that with careful implementation, nonlinear features can provide complementary information that accessible to purely linear methods. Our results provide an important step toward learning interpretable and generalizable latent representations that link cognition with underlying brain systems

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a center for the control of wakefulness. The present study reveals an important role of excitatory LH glutamatergic neurons in controlling wakefulness. Activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induces rapid transitions from sleep to wakefulness and maintains wakefulness, whereas their inhibition decreases wakefulness and increases sleep.

Abstract
The lateral hypothalamus (LH) plays a key role in the maintenance of cortical activation and wakefulness. In the LH, the two main neuronal cell populations consist of excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Recent studies have shown that inhibitory LH GABAergic neurons are wake‐promoting. However, the mechanism by which excitatory LH glutamatergic neurons contribute to sleep‐wake regulation remains unclear. Using fiber photometry in male mice, we demonstrated that LH glutamatergic neurons exhibited high activities during both wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep. Chemogenetic activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induced an increase in wakefulness that lasted for 6 hr, whereas suppression of LH glutamatergic neuronal activity caused a reduction in wakefulness. Brief optogenetic activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induced an immediate transition from slow‐wave sleep to wakefulness, and long‐lasting optogenetic stimulation of these neurons maintained wakefulness. Moreover, we found that LH‐locus coeruleus/parabrachial nucleus and LH‐basal forebrain projections mediated the wake‐promoting effects of LH glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our data indicate that LH glutamatergic neurons are essential for the induction and maintenance of wakefulness. The results presented here may advance our understanding of the role of LH in the control of wakefulness.

Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral excitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, and synaptophysin expression, which was ameliorated by exposure to enriched environment.

Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsies. Pharmacoresistance and comorbidities pose significant challenges to its treatment necessitating the development of non‐pharmacological approaches. In an earlier study, exposure to enriched environment (EE) reduced seizure frequency and duration and ameliorated chronic epilepsy‐induced depression in rats. However, the cellular basis of beneficial effects of EE remains unknown. Accordingly, in the current study, we evaluated the effects of EE in chronic epilepsy‐induced changes in behavioral hyperexcitability, synaptic transmission, synaptophysin (SYN), and calbindin (CB) expression, hippocampal subfield volumes and cell density in male Wistar rats. Epilepsy was induced by lithium–pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus. Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral hyperexcitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, increased paired‐pulse facilitation ratio, decreased hippocampal subfields volumes. Moreover, epileptic rats showed decreased synaptophysin and CB expression in the hippocampus. Six weeks post‐SE, epileptic rats were exposed to EE for 2 weeks, 6 hr/day. EE significantly reduced the behavioral hyperexcitability and restored basal synaptic transmission correlating with increased expression of SYN and CB. Our results reaffirm the beneficial effects of EE on behavior in chronic epilepsy and establishes some of the putative cellular mechanisms. Since drug resistance and comorbidities are a major concern in TLE, we propose EE as a potent non‐pharmacological treatment modality to mitigate these changes in chronic epilepsy.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Accumulation of misfolded tau, amyloid β (Aβ), and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) proteins is the fundamental contributor to many neurodegenerative diseases, namely Parkinson’s (PD) and AD. Such protein aggregations trigger activation of immune mechanisms in neuronal and glial, mainly M1-type microglia cells, leading to release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and subsequent neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. Despite the described neurotoxic features for glial cells, recruitment of peripheral leukocytes to the brain and their conversion to neuroprotective M2-type microglia can mitigate neurodegeneration by clearing extracellular protein accumulations or residues. Based on these observations, it was speculated that Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination, by making use of DCs as natural adjuvants, could be used for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. DCs potentiated by disease-specific antigens can also enhance T helper 2 (Th2)-specific immune response and by production of specific antibodies contribute to clearance of intracellular aggregations, as well as enhancing regulatory T cell response. Thus, enhancement of immune response by DC vaccine therapy can potentially augment glial polarization into the neuroprotective phenotype, enhance antibody production, and at the same time balance neuronal cells’ repair, renewal, and protection. The characteristic feature of this method of treatment is to maintain the equilibrium in the immune response rather than targeting a single mediator in the disease and their application in other neurodegenerative diseases should be addressed. However, the safety of these methods should be investigated by clinical trials.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Glioma is one of the most common neurological malignancies worldwide. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), an inhibitory ligand-driven activation of the Notch pathway, has been shown to be significantly associated with overall survival in patients with glioma. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether DLL3 as a biomarker in glioma is associated with patients' clinicopathological features and prognosis. We identified differences in transcriptome and promoter methylation in the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) in patients with malignant glioma with shorter (less than 1 year) and longer (greater than 3 years) survival time. Further analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that four genes (DLL3, TSPAN15, RTN1, PAK7) are highly associated with patient prognosis and play an indispensable role in evolution. We chose the expression level of DLL3 in glioma patients for our study. Patients were divided into groups with low and high expression of DLL3 according to the cutoff values obtained, and Kaplan–Meier and Cox analysis were used to examine the correlation between DLL3 gene expression and patient survival. We then performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify significantly enriched signaling pathways. Our results confirmed that the overall survival of patients with low DLL3 expression was significantly shorter than that of patients with high DLL3 expression. GSEA showed that the signaling pathways of the immune process and immune response, among others, were enhanced with the DLL3 low-expression phenotype. Collectively, our findings signify that DLL3 is a potent prognostic factor for glioma, which can provide a viable approach for glioma prognostic assessment and valuable insights for anti-tumor immune-targeted therapies.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Aging is an inevitable process that negatively affects all living organisms and their vital functions. The brain is one of the most important organs in living beings and is primarily impacted by aging. The molecular mechanisms of learning, memory and cognition are altered over time, and the impairment in these mechanisms can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Transcriptomics can be used to study these impairments to acquire more detailed information on the affected molecular mechanisms. Here we analyzed learning- and memory-related transcriptome data by mapping it on the organism-specific protein–protein interactome network. Subnetwork discovery algorithms were applied to discover highly dysregulated subnetworks, which were complemented with co-expression-based interactions. The functional analysis shows that the identified subnetworks are enriched with genes having roles in synaptic plasticity, gliogenesis, neurogenesis and cognition, which are reported to be related to memory and learning. With a detailed analysis, we show that the results from different subnetwork discovery algorithms or from different transcriptomic datasets can be successfully reconciled, leading to a memory-learning network that sheds light on the molecular mechanisms behind aging and memory-related impairments.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The occurrence, severity, and consequences of falls were prospectively assessed for 6 months in 333 patients with early stage gait disorders due to vestibular, cerebellar, hypokinetic, vascular, functional, or other neurological diseases and 63 healthy controls.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify explanatory characteristics for predicting the (1) the fall status (non-faller vs. faller), (2) the fall frequency (occasional vs. frequent falls), and (3) the fall severity (benign vs. injurious fall) of patients.</p>

Most psychophysiological studies of working memory (WM) target only the short-term memory construct, while short-term memory is only a part of the WM responsible for the storage of sensory information. Much less effort has been devoted to study brain mechanisms supporting the executive components of WM - the part responsible for the manipulation of information. Here, 156 human participants (82 females) performed two tasks requiring either simple retention or retention and manipulation of verbal information in WM. A relatively long delay period (&gt; 6 s) was employed to investigate the temporal trajectory of the oscillatory brain activity using EEG. Compared to baseline, theta activity was significantly enhanced during encoding and the delay period. Alpha-band power decreased during encoding and switched to an increase in the first part of the delay before returning to the baseline in the second part; beta-band power remained below baseline during all three time intervals. The difference between the manipulation and retention tasks in spectral power had diverse temporal trajectories in different frequency bands. The difference maintained over encoding and the first part of the delay in theta, during the first part of the delay in beta, and during the whole delay period in alpha. Our results suggest that task-related modulations in theta power co-vary with the demands on the executive control network; beta suppression during mental manipulation can be related to the activation of motor networks; alpha is likely to reflect the activation of language areas simultaneously with sensory input blockade.

Symmetry is a highly salient feature of the natural world that is perceived by many species of the animal kingdom and that impacts a large array of behaviours such as partner selection or food choice. In humans, the cerebral areas processing symmetry are now well identified from neuroimaging measurements. However, we currently lack an animal model to explore the underlying neural mechanisms. Macaque is a potentially good candidate, but a previous comparative study (1) found that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to mirror symmetry in this species were substantially weaker than those observed in humans under similar experimental conditions. Here, we re-examined symmetry processing in macaques from a broader perspective, using both rotation (experiment 1) and reflection (experiment 2) symmetry. Our experimental design was directly derived from that of a previous human fMRI study (2), in order to facilitate the comparison between the two primate species. Highly consistent responses to symmetry were found in a large network of areas (notably V3, V3A, V4, V4A and PITd), in line with what has been observed in humans. Within this network, response properties in areas V3 and V4 (notably their dependency on the rotation symmetry order) were strikingly similar to those observed in their human counterparts. Our results suggest that the cortical networks that process symmetry in humans and macaques are much more similar than previously reported and point toward macaque as a relevant model for understanding symmetry processing.

Voices are arguably among the most relevant sounds in humans' everyday life, and several studies have suggested the existence of voice-selective regions in the human brain. Despite two decades of research, defining the human brain regions supporting voice recognition remains challenging. Moreover, whether neural selectivity to voices is merely driven by acoustic properties specific to human voices (e.g. spectrogram, harmonicity), or whether it also reflects a higher-level categorization response is still under debate. Here, we objectively measured rapid automatic categorization responses to human voices with Fast Periodic Auditory Stimulation (FPAS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were tested with stimulation sequences containing heterogeneous non-vocal sounds from different categories presented at 4 Hz (i.e., 4 stimuli/second), with vocal sounds appearing every 3 stimuli (1.333 Hz). A few minutes of stimulation are sufficient to elicit robust 1.333 Hz voice-selective focal brain responses over superior temporal regions of individual participants. This response is virtually absent for sequences using frequency-scrambled sounds, but is clearly observed when voices are presented among sounds from musical instruments matched for pitch and harmonicity-to-noise ratio. Overall, our FPAS paradigm demonstrates that the human brain seamlessly categorizes human voices when compared to other sounds including matched musical instruments and that voice-selective responses are at least partially independent from low-level acoustic features, making it a powerful and versatile tool to understand human auditory categorization in general.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.435193v1?rss=1">Synaptotagmin rings as high sensitivity regulators of synaptic vesicle docking and fusion</a></h4>

Synchronous release at neuronal synapses is accomplished by a machinery that senses calcium influx and fuses the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes to release neurotransmitters. Previous studies suggested the calcium sensor Synaptotagmin (Syt) is a facilitator of vesicle docking and both a facilitator and inhibitor of fusion. On phospholipid monolayers, the Syt C2AB domain spontaneously oligomerized into rings that are disassembled by Ca2+, suggesting Syt rings may clamp fusion as membrane-separating "washers" until Ca2+-mediated disassembly triggers fusion and release (Wang et al., 2014). Here we combined mathematical modeling with experiment to measure mechanical properties of Syt rings and to test this mechanism. Consistent with experiment, the model quantitatively recapitulates observed Syt ring-induced dome and volcano shapes on phospholipid monolayers, and predicts rings are stabilized by anionic phospholipid bilayers or bulk solution with ATP. The selected ring conformation is highly sensitive to membrane composition and bulk ATP levels, a property that may regulate vesicle docking and fusion in ATP-rich synaptic terminals. We find the Syt molecules hosted by a synaptic vesicle oligomerize into a halo, unbound from the vesicle, but in proximity to sufficiently PIP2-rich plasma membrane (PM) domains the PM-bound trans Syt ring conformation is preferred. Thus, the Syt halo serves as landing gear for spatially directed docking at PIP2-rich sites that define the active zones of exocytotic release, positioning the Syt ring to clamp fusion and await calcium. Our results suggest the Syt ring is both a Ca2+-sensitive fusion clamp and a high-fidelity sensor for directed docking.

Specific features of white-matter microstructure can be investigated by using biophysical models to interpret relaxation-diffusion MRI brain data. Although more intricate models have the potential to reveal more details of the tissue, they also incur time-consuming parameter estimation that may converge to inaccurate solutions due to a prevalence of local minima in a degenerate fitting landscape. Machine-learning fitting algorithms have been proposed to accelerate the parameter estimation and increase the robustness of the attained estimates. So far, learning-based fitting approaches have been restricted to lower-dimensional microstructural models where dense sets of training data are easy to generate. Moreover, the degree to which machine learning can alleviate the degeneracy problem is poorly understood. For conventional least-squares solvers, it has been shown that degeneracy can be avoided by acquisition with optimized relaxation-diffusion-correlation protocols that include tensor-valued diffusion encoding; whether machine-learning techniques can offset these acquisition requirements remains to be tested. In this work, we employ deep neural networks to vastly accelerate the fitting of a recently introduced high-dimensional relaxation-diffusion model of tissue microstructure. We also develop strategies for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of function fitting networks and use those strategies to explore the impact of acquisition protocol design on the performance of the network. The developed learning-based fitting pipelines were tested on relaxation-diffusion data acquired with optimized and sub-sampled acquisition protocols. We found no evidence that machine-learning algorithms can by themselves replace a careful design of the acquisition protocol or correct for a degenerate fitting landscape.

The dense network of capillaries composed of capillary endothelial cells (cECs) and pericytes lies in close proximity to all neurons, ideally positioning it to sense neuro/glial-derived compounds that regulate regional and global cerebral perfusion. The membrane potential (VM) of vascular cells serves as the essential output in this scenario, linking brain activity to vascular function. The ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) is a key regulator of vascular VM in other beds, but whether brain capillaries possess functional KATP channels remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that brain capillary ECs and pericytes express KATP channels that robustly control VM. We further show that the endogenous mediator adenosine acts through A2A receptors and the Gs/cAMP/PKA pathway to activate capillary KATP channels. Moreover, KATP channel stimulation in vivo causes vasodilation and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF). These findings establish the presence of KATP channels in cECs and pericytes and suggest their significant influence on CBF.

Neural circuits within the frontal cortex support the flexible selection of goal-directed behaviors by integrating input from brain regions associated with sensory, emotional, episodic, and semantic memory functions. From a connectomics perspective, determining how these disparate afferent inputs target their synapses to specific cell types in the frontal cortex may prove crucial in understanding circuit-level information processing. Here, we used monosynaptic retrograde rabies mapping to examine the distribution of afferent neurons targeting four distinct classes of local inhibitory interneurons and four distinct classes of excitatory projection neurons in mouse infralimbic cortex. Interneurons expressing parvalbumin, somatostatin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide received a large proportion of inputs from hippocampal regions, while interneurons expressing neuron-derived neurotrophic factor received a large proportion of inputs from thalamic regions. A more moderate hippocampal-thalamic dichotomy was found among the inputs targeting excitatory neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala, lateral entorhinal cortex, nucleus reuniens of the thalamus, and the periaqueductal gray. Together, these results show a prominent bias among hippocampal and thalamic afferent systems in their targeting to genetically or anatomically defined sets of frontal cortical neurons. Moreover, they suggest the presence of two distinct local microcircuits that control how different inputs govern frontal cortical information processing.

Humans and other primates interact with the world by observing and exploring visual objects. In particular, they often seek out the opportunities to view novel objects that they have never seen before, even when they have no extrinsic primary reward value. However, despite the importance of novel visual objects in our daily life, we currently lack an understanding of how primate brain circuits control the motivation to seek out novelty. We found that novelty-seeking is regulated by a small understudied subcortical region, the zona incerta (ZI). In a task in which monkeys made eye movements to familiar objects to obtain the opportunity to view novel objects, many ZI neurons were preferentially activated by predictions of future novel objects and displayed burst excitations before gaze shifts to gain access to novel objects. Low intensity electrical stimulation of ZI facilitated gaze shifts, while inactivations of ZI reduced novelty-seeking. Surprisingly, additional experiments showed that this ZI-dependent novelty seeking behavior is not regulated by canonical neural circuitry for reward seeking. The habenula-dopamine pathway, known to reflect reward predictions that control reward seeking, was relatively inactive during novelty-seeking behavior in which novelty had no extrinsic reward value. Instead, high channel-count electrophysiological experiments and anatomical tracing identified a prominent source of control signals for novelty seeking in the anterior ventral medial temporal cortex (AVMTC), a brain region known to be crucially involved in visual processing and object memory. In addition to their well-known function in signaling the novelty or familiarity of objects in the current environment, AVMTC neurons reflected the predictions of future novel objects, akin to the way neurons in reward-circuitry predict future rewards in order to control reward-seeking. Our data uncover a network of primate brain areas that regulate novelty-seeking. The behavioral and neural distinctions between novelty-seeking and reward-processing highlight how the brain can accomplish behavioral flexibility, providing a mechanism to explore novel objects.

<p>by Cosmin Stamate, Joan Saez Pons, David Weston, George Roussos</p>

PDkit is an open source software toolkit supporting the collaborative development of novel methods of digital assessment for Parkinson’s Disease, using symptom measurements captured continuously by wearables (passive monitoring) or by high-use-frequency smartphone apps (active monitoring). The goal of the toolkit is to help address the current lack of algorithmic and model transparency in this area by facilitating open sharing of standardised methods that allow the comparison of results across multiple centres and hardware variations. PDkit adopts the information-processing pipeline abstraction incorporating stages for data ingestion, quality of information augmentation, feature extraction, biomarker estimation and finally, scoring using standard clinical scales. Additionally, a dataflow programming framework is provided to support high performance computations. The practical use of PDkit is demonstrated in the context of the CUSSP clinical trial in the UK. The toolkit is implemented in the python programming language, the de facto standard for modern data science applications, and is widely available under the MIT license.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GvZaZx708vQ" width="1" />

Current advances in next-generation sequencing techniques have allowed researchers to conduct comprehensive research on the microbiome and human diseases, with recent studies identifying associations between the human microbiome and health outcomes for a number of chronic conditions. However, microbiome data structure, characterized by sparsity and skewness, presents challenges to building effective classifiers. To address this, we present an innovative approach for distance-based classification using mixture distributions (DCMD). The method aims to improve classification performance using microbiome community data, where the predictors are composed of sparse and heterogeneous count data. This approach models the inherent uncertainty in sparse counts by estimating a mixture distribution for the sample data and representing each observation as a distribution, conditional on observed counts and the estimated mixture, which are then used as inputs for distance-based classification. The method is implemented into a <i>k</i>-means classification and <i>k</i>-nearest neighbours framework. We develop two distance metrics that produce optimal results. The performance of the model is assessed using simulated and human microbiome study data, with results compared against a number of existing machine learning and distance-based classification approaches. The proposed method is competitive when compared to the other machine learning approaches, and shows a clear improvement over commonly used distance-based classifiers, underscoring the importance of modelling sparsity for achieving optimal results. The range of applicability and robustness make the proposed method a viable alternative for classification using sparse microbiome count data.

We introduce poly-adenine CRISPR gRNA-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (pAC-Seq), a method that enables the direct observation of guide RNAs (gRNAs) in scRNA-seq. We use pAC-Seq to assess the phenotypic consequences of CRISPR/Cas9 based alterations of gene cis-regulatory regions. We show that pAC-Seq is able to detect cis-regulatory-induced alteration of target gene expression even when biallelic loss of target gene expression occurs in only ~5% of cells. This low rate of biallelic loss significantly increases the number of cells required to detect the consequences of changes to the regulatory genome, but can be ameliorated by transcript-targeted sequencing. Based on our experimental results we model the power to detect regulatory genome induced transcriptomic effects based on the rate of mono/biallelic loss, baseline gene expression, and the number of cells per target gRNA.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KYWp8O1m05M" width="1" />

Cancer occurs via an accumulation of somatic genomic alterations in a process of clonal evolution. There has been intensive study of potential causal mutations driving cancer development and progression. However, much recent evidence suggests that tumor evolution is normally driven by a variety of mechanisms of somatic hypermutability, which act in different combinations or degrees in different cancers. These variations in mutability phenotypes are predictive of progression outcomes independent of the specific mutations they have produced to date. Here we explore the question of how and to what degree these differences in mutational phenotypes act in a cancer to predict its future progression. We develop a computational paradigm using evolutionary tree inference (tumor phylogeny) algorithms to derive features quantifying single-tumor mutational phenotypes, followed by a machine learning framework to identify key features predictive of progression. Analyses of breast invasive carcinoma and lung carcinoma demonstrate that a large fraction of the risk of future clinical outcomes of cancer progression—overall survival and disease-free survival—can be explained solely from mutational phenotype features derived from the phylogenetic analysis. We further show that mutational phenotypes have additional predictive power even after accounting for traditional clinical and driver gene-centric genomic predictors of progression. These results confirm the importance of mutational phenotypes in contributing to cancer progression risk and suggest strategies for enhancing the predictive power of conventional clinical data or driver-centric biomarkers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WBJn9WGSS0g" width="1" />

Alzheimer’s disease is associated with the formation of toxic aggregates of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides. Despite tremendous efforts, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aggregation, as well as cofactors that might influence it, remains incomplete. The small cyclic neuropeptide somatostatin-14 (SST<sub>14</sub>) was recently found to be the most selectively enriched protein in human frontal lobe extracts that binds Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregates. Furthermore, SST<sub>14</sub>’s presence was also found to promote the formation of toxic Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers <i>in vitro</i>. In order to elucidate how SST<sub>14</sub> influences the onset of Aβ oligomerization, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of model mixtures of Aβ<sub>42</sub> or Aβ<sub>40</sub> peptides with SST<sub>14</sub> molecules and analyzed the structure and dynamics of early-stage aggregates. For comparison we also analyzed the aggregation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in the presence of arginine vasopressin (AVP), a different cyclic neuropeptide. We observed the formation of self-assembled aggregates containing the Aβ chains and small cyclic peptides in all mixtures of Aβ<sub>42</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>–AVP, and Aβ<sub>40</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub>. The Aβ<sub>42</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub> mixtures were found to develop compact, dynamically stable, but small aggregates with the highest exposure of hydrophobic residues to the solvent. Differences in the morphology and dynamics of aggregates that comprise SST<sub>14</sub> or AVP appear to reflect distinct (1) regions of the Aβ chains they interact with; (2) the propensities to engage in hydrogen bonds with Aβ peptides; and (3) solvent exposures of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. The presence of SST<sub>14</sub> was found to impede aggregation in the Aβ<sub>42</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub> system despite a high hydrophobicity, producing a stronger “sticky surface” effect in the aggregates at the onset of Aβ<sub>42</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub> oligomerization.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GYdp5pngPhM" width="1" />

Many ischaemic stroke patients who have a mechanical removal of
their clot (thrombectomy) do not get reperfusion of tissue despite
the thrombus being removed. One hypothesis for this ‘no-reperfusion’ phenomenon is micro-emboli fragmenting off the large clot during thrombectomy and occluding smaller blood vessels downstream of the clot location. This is impossible to observe in-vivo and so we here develop an in-silico model based on in-vitro experiments to model the effect of micro-emboli on brain tissue. Through in-vitro experiments we obtain, under a variety of clot consistencies and thrombectomy techniques, micro-emboli distributions post-thrombectomy. Blood flow through the microcirculation is modelled for statistically accurate voxels of brain microvasculature including penetrating arterioles and capillary beds. A novel micro-emboli algorithm, informed by the experimental data, is used to simulate the impact of micro-emboli successively entering the penetrating arterioles and the capillary bed. Scaled-up blood flow parameters–permeability and coupling coefficients–are calculated under various conditions. We find that capillary beds are more susceptible to occlusions than the penetrating arterioles with a 4x greater drop in permeability per volume of vessel occluded. Individual microvascular geometries determine robustness to micro-emboli. Hard clot fragmentation leads to larger micro-emboli and larger drops in blood flow for a given number of micro-emboli. Thrombectomy technique has a large impact on clot fragmentation and hence occlusions in the microvasculature. As such, in-silico modelling of mechanical thrombectomy predicts that clot specific factors, interventional technique, and microvascular geometry strongly influence reperfusion of the brain. Micro-emboli are likely contributory to the phenomenon of no-reperfusion following successful removal of a major clot.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SPelYNVHMO0" width="1" />

Virus host shifts are generally associated with novel adaptations to exploit the cells of the new host species optimally. Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in <i>Sarbecoviruses</i> in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat <i>Sarbecoviruses</i>. In contrast, our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered “facilitating” intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human–human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0qRFd_2KaTo" width="1" />

Objective
Intracranial EEG (icEEG) studies show that interictal ripples propagate across the brain of children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) and the onset of this propagation (ripple‐onset‐zone, ROZ) estimates the epileptogenic zone. It is still unknown whether we can map this propagation non‐invasively. The goal of this study is to map ripples (ripple‐zone, RZ) and their propagation onset (ROZ) using high‐density EEG (HD‐EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and to estimate their prognostic value in pediatric epilepsy surgery.


Methods
We retrospectively analyzed simultaneous HD‐EEG and MEG data from 28 children with MRE who underwent icEEG and epilepsy surgery. Using electric and magnetic source imaging, we estimated virtual sensors (VSs) at brain locations that matched the icEEG implantation. We detected ripples on VSs, defined virtual‐RZ and virtual‐ROZ, and estimated their distance from icEEG. We assessed the predictive value of resecting virtual‐RZ and virtual‐ROZ for postsurgical outcome. Interictal spike localization on HD‐EEG and MEG was also performed and compared with ripples.


Results
We mapped ripple propagation in all patients with HD‐EEG and in 27 (96%) patients with MEG. The distance from icEEG did not differ between HD‐EEG and MEG when mapping the RZ (26–27 mm; p = 0.6) or ROZ (22–24 mm; p = 0.4). Resecting the virtual‐ROZ, but not virtual‐RZ or the sources of spikes, was associated with good outcome for HD‐EEG (p = 0.016) and MEG (p = 0.047).


Interpretation
HD‐EEG and MEG can map interictal ripples and their propagation onset (virtual‐ROZ). Mapping non‐invasively the ripple onset may augment epilepsy surgery planning and improve surgical outcome of children with MRE.

<p>This paper focuses on a class of reinforcement learning problems where
significant events are rare and limited to a single positive reward per
episode. A typical example is that of an agent who has to choose a partner to
cooperate with, while a large number of partners are simply not interested in
cooperating, regardless of what the agent has to offer. We address this problem
in a continuous state and action space with two different kinds of search
methods: a gradient policy search method and a direct policy search method
using an evolution strategy. We show that when significant events are rare,
gradient information is also scarce, making it difficult for policy gradient
search methods to find an optimal policy, with or without a deep neural
architecture. On the other hand, we show that direct policy search methods are
invariant to the rarity of significant events, which is yet another
confirmation of the unique role evolutionary algorithms has to play as a
reinforcement learning method.

<p>Usually, the systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) are discovered
from observational data in the single vector equation form. However, this
approach restricts the application to the real cases, where, for example, the
form of the external forcing is of interest. In the paper, a multi-objective
co-evolution algorithm is described. The single equations within the system and
the system itself are evolved simultaneously to obtain the system. This
approach allows discovering the systems with the form-independent equations. In
contrast to the single vector equation, a component-wise system is more
suitable for expert interpretation and, therefore, for applications. The
example of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation is considered.

<p>Information measures are often used to assess the efficacy of neural
networks, and learning rules can be derived through optimization procedures on
such measures. In biological neural networks, computation is restricted by the
amount of available resources. Considering energy restrictions, it is thus
reasonable to balance information processing efficacy with energy consumption.
Here, we studied networks of non-linear Hawkes neurons and assessed the
information flow through these networks using mutual information. We then
applied gradient descent for a combination of mutual information and energetic
costs to obtain a learning rule. Through this procedure, we obtained a rule
containing a sliding threshold, similar to the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule.
The rule contains terms local in time and in space plus one global variable
common to the whole network. The rule thus belongs to so-called three-factor
rules and the global variable could be related to a number of biological
processes. In neural networks using this learning rule, frequent inputs get
mapped onto low energy orbits of the network while rare inputs aren't learned.

<p>While deep learning is a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP)
problems, successful solutions to these problems rely heavily on large amounts
of annotated samples. However, manually annotating data is expensive and
time-consuming. Active Learning (AL) strategies reduce the need for huge
volumes of labeled data by iteratively selecting a small number of examples for
manual annotation based on their estimated utility in training the given model.
In this paper, we argue that since AL strategies choose examples independently,
they may potentially select similar examples, all of which may not contribute
significantly to the learning process. Our proposed approach,
Active$\mathbf{^2}$ Learning (A$\mathbf{^2}$L), actively adapts to the deep
learning model being trained to eliminate further such redundant examples
chosen by an AL strategy. We show that A$\mathbf{^2}$L is widely applicable by
using it in conjunction with several different AL strategies and NLP tasks. We
empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach is further able to reduce
the data requirements of state-of-the-art AL strategies by an absolute
percentage reduction of $\approx\mathbf{3-25\%}$ on multiple NLP tasks while
achieving the same performance with no additional computation overhead.

<p>Over-parameterization of neural networks benefits the optimization and
generalization yet brings cost in practice. Pruning is adopted as a
post-processing solution to this problem, which aims to remove unnecessary
parameters in a neural network with little performance compromised. It has been
broadly believed the resulted sparse neural network cannot be trained from
scratch to comparable accuracy. However, several recent works (e.g., [Frankle
and Carbin, 2019a]) challenge this belief by discovering random sparse networks
which can be trained to match the performance with their dense counterpart.
This new pruning paradigm later inspires more new methods of pruning at
initialization. In spite of the encouraging progress, how to coordinate these
new pruning fashions with the traditional pruning has not been explored yet.
This survey seeks to bridge the gap by proposing a general pruning framework so
that the emerging pruning paradigms can be accommodated well with the
traditional one. With it, we systematically reflect the major differences and
new insights brought by these new pruning fashions, with representative works
discussed at length. Finally, we summarize the open questions as worthy future
directions.

<p>Meta-learning models, or models that learn to learn, have been a long-desired
target for their ability to quickly solve new tasks. Traditional meta-learning
methods can require expensive inner and outer loops, thus there is demand for
algorithms that discover strong learners without explicitly searching for them.
We draw parallels to the study of evolvable genomes in evolutionary systems --
genomes with a strong capacity to adapt -- and propose that meta-learning and
adaptive evolvability optimize for the same objective: high performance after a
set of learning iterations. We argue that population-based evolutionary systems
with non-static fitness landscapes naturally bias towards high-evolvability
genomes, and therefore optimize for populations with strong learning ability.
We demonstrate this claim with a simple evolutionary algorithm,
Population-Based Meta Learning (PBML), that consistently discovers genomes
which display higher rates of improvement over generations, and can rapidly
adapt to solve sparse fitness and robotic control tasks.

<p>Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) are ubiquitous in
real-world engineering optimization scenarios. A key issue in constrained
multi-objective optimization is to strike a balance among convergence,
diversity and feasibility. A recently proposed two-archive evolutionary
algorithm for constrained multi-objective optimization (C-TAEA) has be shown as
a latest algorithm. However, due to its simple implementation of the
collaboration mechanism between its two co-evolving archives, C-TAEA is
struggling when solving problems whose \textit{pseudo} Pareto-optimal front,
which does not take constraints into consideration, dominates the
\textit{feasible} Pareto-optimal front. In this paper, we propose an improved
version C-TAEA, dubbed C-TAEA-II, featuring an improved update mechanism of two
co-evolving archives and an adaptive mating selection mechanism to promote a
better collaboration between co-evolving archives. Empirical results
demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed C-TAEA-II in comparison with
five representative constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization
algorithms.

<p>Microgrids with energy storage systems and distributed renewable energy
sources play a crucial role in reducing the consumption from traditional power
sources and the emission of $CO_2$. Connecting multi microgrid to a
distribution power grid can facilitate a more robust and reliable operation to
increase the security and privacy of the system. The proposed model consists of
three layers, smart grid layer, independent system operator (ISO) layer and
power grid layer. Each layer aims to maximise its benefit. To achieve these
objectives, an intelligent multi-microgrid energy management method is proposed
based on the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) techniques, leading
to a Pareto optimal set. A non-dominated solution is selected to implement a
fair design in order not to favour any particular participant. The simulation
results demonstrate the performance of the MORL and verify the viability of the
proposed approach.

<p>Standard Neural Networks can learn mathematical operations, but they do not
extrapolate. Extrapolation means that the model can apply to larger numbers,
well beyond those observed during training. Recent architectures tackle
arithmetic operations and can extrapolate; however, the equally important
problem of quantitative reasoning remains unaddressed. In this work, we propose
a novel architectural element, the Neural Status Register (NSR), for
quantitative reasoning over numbers. Our NSR relaxes the discrete bit logic of
physical status registers to continuous numbers and allows end-to-end learning
with gradient descent. Experiments show that the NSR achieves solutions that
extrapolate to numbers many orders of magnitude larger than those in the
training set. We successfully train the NSR on number comparisons, piecewise
discontinuous functions, counting in sequences, recurrently finding minimums,
finding shortest paths in graphs, and comparing digits in images.

<p>Among the various key networks in the human body, the nervous system occupies
central importance. The debilitating effects of spinal cord injuries (SCI)
impact a significant number of people throughout the world, and to date, there
is no satisfactory method to treat them. In this paper, we review the major
treatment techniques for SCI that include promising solutions based on
information and communication technology (ICT) and identify the key
characteristics of such systems. We then introduce two novel ICT-based
treatment approaches for SCI. The first proposal is based on neural interface
systems (NIS) with enhanced feedback, where the external machines are
interfaced with the brain and the spinal cord such that the brain signals are
directly routed to the limbs for movement. The second proposal relates to the
design of self-organizing artificial neurons (ANs) that can be used to replace
the injured or dead biological neurons. Apart from SCI treatment, the proposed
methods may also be utilized as enabling technologies for neural interface
applications by acting as bio-cyber interfaces between the nervous system and
machines. Furthermore, under the framework of Internet of Bio- Nano Things
(IoBNT), experience gained from SCI treatment techniques can be transferred to
nano communication research.

<p>Kinetic Ising models are powerful tools for studying the non-equilibrium
dynamics of complex systems. As their behavior is not tractable for large
networks, many mean-field methods have been proposed for their analysis, each
based on unique assumptions about the system's temporal evolution. This
disparity of approaches makes it challenging to systematically advance
mean-field methods beyond previous contributions. Here, we propose a unifying
framework for mean-field theories of asymmetric kinetic Ising systems from an
information geometry perspective. The framework is built on Plefka expansions
of a system around a simplified model obtained by an orthogonal projection to a
sub-manifold of tractable probability distributions. This view not only unifies
previous methods but also allows us to develop novel methods that, in contrast
with traditional approaches, preserve the system's correlations. We show that
these new methods can outperform previous ones in predicting and assessing
network properties near maximally fluctuating regimes.

<p>An effective and efficient architecture performance evaluation scheme is
essential for the success of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To save
computational cost, most of existing NAS algorithms often train and evaluate
intermediate neural architectures on a small proxy dataset with limited
training epochs. But it is difficult to expect an accurate performance
estimation of an architecture in such a coarse evaluation way. This paper
advocates a new neural architecture evaluation scheme, which aims to determine
which architecture would perform better instead of accurately predict the
absolute architecture performance. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{relativistic} architecture performance predictor in NAS (ReNAS). We
encode neural architectures into feature tensors, and further refining the
representations with the predictor. The proposed relativistic performance
predictor can be deployed in discrete searching methods to search for the
desired architectures without additional evaluation. Experimental results on
NAS-Bench-101 dataset suggests that, sampling 424 ($0.1\%$ of the entire search
space) neural architectures and their corresponding validation performance is
already enough for learning an accurate architecture performance predictor. The
accuracies of our searched neural architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and
NAS-Bench-201 datasets are higher than that of the state-of-the-art methods and
show the priority of the proposed method.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The goal of this short review is to call attention to a yawning gap of knowledge that separates two processes essential for saccade production. On the one hand, knowledge about the saccade generation circuitry within the brainstem is detailed and precise – push-pull interactions between gaze-shifting and gaze-holding processes control the time of saccade initiation, which begins when omnipause neurons are inhibited and brainstem burst neurons are excited. On the other hand, knowledge about the cortical and subcortical premotor circuitry accomplishing saccade initiation has crystalized around the concept of stochastic accumulation – the accumulating activity of saccade neurons reaching a fixed value triggers a saccade. Here is the gap: we do not know how the reaching of a threshold by premotor neurons causes the critical pause and burst of brainstem neurons that initiates saccades. Why this problem matters and how it can be addressed will be discussed. Closing the gap would unify two rich but curiously disconnected empirical and theoretical domains.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Background</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Clinical variants of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) include the classic Richardson’s syndrome (PSP-RS), as well as cortical presentations such as PSP-speech/language (PSP-SL) and subcortical presentations such as PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P). Patterns of white matter tract degeneration underlying these variants, and the degree to which white matter patterns could differentiate these variants, is unclear.</p>
                  </span>
                  <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Forty-nine PSP patients (28 PSP-RS, 12 PSP-P, and 9 PSP-SL) were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group and underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Regional diffusion tensor imaging metrics were compared across PSP variants using Bayesian linear mixed-effects models, with inter-variant differentiation assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC).</p>
                  </span>
                  <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3">
                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">All three variants showed degeneration of the body of the corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiation, superior cerebellar peduncle, internal and external capsule, and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus. PSP-RS showed greater degeneration of superior cerebellar peduncle compared to PSP-P and PSP-SL, whereas PSP-SL showed greater degeneration of body and genu of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, external capsule, and superior longitudinal fasciculus compared to the other variants. Fractional anisotropy in body of the corpus callosum provided excellent differentiation of PSP-SL from both PSP-P and PSP-RS (AUROC = 0.91 and 0.92, respectively). Moderate differentiation of PSP-RS and PSP-P was achieved with fractional anisotropy in superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (AUROC = 0.68) and mean diffusivity in the superior cerebellar peduncle (AUROC = 0.65).</p>
                  </span>
                  <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4">

<p>It is assumed that the cause of cognitive and behavioral capacities of living systems is to be found in the complex structure-function relationship of their brains; a property that is still difficult to decipher. Based on a neurodynamics approach to embodied cognition this paper introduces a method to guide the development of modular neural systems into the direction of enhanced cognitive abilities. It uses formally the synchronization of subnetworks to split the dynamics of coupled systems into synchronized and asynchronous components. The concept of a synchronization core is introduced to represent a whole family of parameterized neurodynamical systems living in a synchronization manifold. It is used to identify those coupled systems having a rich spectrum of dynamical properties. Special coupling structures—called generative—are identified which allow to make the synchronized dynamics more “complex” than the dynamics of the isolated parts. Furthermore, a criterion for coupling structures is given which, in addition to the synchronized dynamics, allows also for an asynchronous dynamics by destabilizing the synchronization manifold. The large class of synchronization equivalent systems contains networks with very different coupling structures and weights allsharing the same dynamical properties. To demonstrate the method a simple example is discussed in detail.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is the result of a group of transient abnormalities in brain function caused by an abnormal, highly synchronized discharge of brain neurons. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of endogenous non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules that participate in a series of important biological processes. Recent studies demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in a variety of central nervous system diseases, including epilepsy. Although the exact mechanism underlying the role of miRNAs in epilepsy pathogenesis is still unclear, these miRNAs may be involved in the inflammatory response in the nervous system, neuronal necrosis and apoptosis, dendritic growth, synaptic remodeling, glial cell proliferation, epileptic circuit formation, impairment of neurotransmitter and receptor function, and other processes. Here, we discuss miRNA metabolism and the roles of miRNA in epilepsy pathogenesis and evaluate miRNA as a potential new biomarker for the diagnosis of epilepsy, which enhances our understanding of disease processes.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by symptoms that impact both motor and non-motor domains. Outside of motor impairments, PD patients are at risk for impulse control disorders (ICDs), which include excessively disabling impulsive and compulsive behaviors. ICD symptoms in PD (PD + ICD) can be broadly conceptualized as a synergistic interaction between dopamine agonist therapy and the many molecular and circuit-level changes intrinsic to PD. Aside from discontinuing dopamine agonist treatment, there remains a lack of consensus on how to best address ICD symptoms in PD. In this review, we explore recent advances in the molecular and neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying ICD symptoms in PD by summarizing a rapidly accumulating body of clinical and preclinical studies, with a special focus on the utility of rodent models in gaining new insights into the neurochemical basis of PD + ICD. We also discuss the relevance of these findings to the broader problem of impulsive and compulsive behaviors that impact a range of neuropsychiatric syndromes.</p>

<p>Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is an umbrella term referring to several conditions causing a rapid neurological deterioration associated with cognitive decline and short disease duration. They comprise Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), the archetypal RPD, rapidly progressive variants of the most common neurodegenerative dementias (NDs), and potentially treatable conditions such as infectious or autoimmune encephalitis and cerebrovascular disease. Given the significant clinical and, sometimes, neuroradiological overlap between these different disorders, biofluid markers also contribute significantly to the differential diagnosis. Among them, the neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) has attracted growing attention in recent years as a biofluid marker of neurodegeneration due to its sensitivity to axonal damage and the reliability of its measurement in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Here, we summarize current knowledge regarding biological and clinical implications of NfL evaluation in biofluids across RPDs, emphasizing CJD, and other prion diseases. In the latter, NfL demonstrated a good diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and a potential value as a marker of proximity to clinical onset in pre-symptomatic PRNP mutation carriers. Similarly, in Alzheimer’s disease and other NDs, higher NfL concentrations seem to predict a faster disease progression. While increasing evidence indicates a potential clinical value of NfL in monitoring cerebrovascular disease, the association between NfL and prediction of outcome and/or disease activity in autoimmune encephalitis and infectious diseases has only been investigated in few cohorts and deserves confirmatory studies. In the era of precision medicine and evolving therapeutic options, CSF and blood NfL might aid the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of RPDs and the stratification and management of patients according to disease progression in clinical trials.</p>

<p>Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with chronic inflammation in the brain and periphery giving rise to a continuous imbalance of immune processes. Next to inflammation markers, activation of transposable elements, including long intrespersed nuclear elements (LINE) elements and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), has been identified during neurodegenerative disease progression and even correlated with the clinical severity of the disease. ERVs are remnants of viral infections in the human genome acquired during evolution. Upon activation, they produce transcripts and the phylogenetically youngest ones are still able to produce viral-like particles. In addition, ERVs can bind transcription factors and modulate immune response. Being between own and foreign, ERVs are reviewed in the context of viral infections of the central nervous system, in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, this review tests the hypothesis that viral infection may be a trigger at the onset of neuroinflammation and that ERVs sustain the inflammatory imbalance by summarizing existing data of neurodegenerative diseases associated with viruses and/or ERVs.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. ASDs affect nearly 2% of the United States child population and the worldwide prevalence has dramatically increased in recent years. The etiology is not clear but ASD is thought to be caused by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Circadian rhythms are the ∼24 h rhythms driven by the endogenous biological clock, and they are found in a variety of physiological processes. Growing evidence from basic and clinical studies suggest that the dysfunction of the circadian timing system may be associated with ASD and its pathogenesis. Here we review the findings that link circadian dysfunctions to ASD in both experimental and clinical studies. We first introduce the organization of the circadian system and ASD. Next, we review physiological indicators of circadian rhythms that are found disrupted in ASD individuals, including sleep–wake cycles, melatonin, cortisol, and serotonin. Finally, we review evidence in epidemiology, human genetics, and biochemistry that indicates underlying associations between circadian regulation and the pathogenesis of ASD. In conclusion, we propose that understanding the functional importance of the circadian clock in normal and aberrant neurodevelopmental processes may provide a novel perspective to tackle ASD, and clinical treatments for ASD individuals should comprise an integrative approach considering the dynamics of daily rhythms in physical, mental, and social processes.</p>

<p>Multimodal heterogeneous data, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are effective in improving the performance of automated dementia diagnosis by providing complementary information on degenerated brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment. Effectively integrating multimodal data has remained a challenging problem, especially when these heterogeneous data are incomplete due to poor data quality and patient dropout. Besides, multimodal data usually contain noise information caused by different scanners or imaging protocols. The existing methods usually fail to well handle these heterogeneous and noisy multimodal data for automated brain dementia diagnosis. To this end, we propose a high-order Laplacian regularized low-rank representation method for dementia diagnosis using block-wise missing multimodal data. The proposed method was evaluated on 805 subjects (with incomplete MRI, PET, and CSF data) from the real Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our method in three tasks of brain disease classification, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Introduction<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)–evoked potentials (TEPs) allow for probing cortical functions in health and pathology. However, there is uncertainty whether long-latency TMS-evoked potentials reflect functioning of the targeted cortical area. It has been suggested that components such as the TMS-evoked N100 are stereotypical and related to nonspecific sensory processes rather than transcranial effects of the changing magnetic field. In contrast, TEPs that vary according to the targeted brain region and are systematically lateralized toward the stimulated hemisphere can be considered to reflect activity in the stimulated brain region resulting from transcranial electromagnetic induction.</p>Methods<p>TMS with concurrent 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was sequentially performed in homologous areas of both hemispheres. One sample of healthy adults received TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; another sample received TMS to the temporo-occipital cortex. We analyzed late negative TEP deflections corresponding to the N100 component in motor cortex stimulation.</p>Results<p>TEP topography varied according to the stimulation target site. Long-latency negative TEP deflections were systematically lateralized (higher in ipsilateral compared to contralateral electrodes) in electrodes over the stimulated brain region. A calculation that removes evoked components that are not systematically lateralized relative to the stimulated hemisphere revealed negative maxima located around the respective target sites.</p>Conclusion<p>TEPs contain long-latency negative components that are lateralized toward the stimulated hemisphere and have their topographic maxima at the respective stimulation sites. They can be differentiated from co-occurring components that are invariable across different stimulation sites (probably reflecting coactivation of peripheral sensory afferences) according to their spatiotemporal patterns. Lateralized long-latency TEP components located at the stimulation site likely reflect activity evoked in the targeted cortex region by direct transcranial effects and are therefore suitable for assessing cortical functions.</p>

<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has attracted increasing attention in the field of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) owing to their advantages such as non-invasiveness, user safety, affordability, and portability. However, fNIRS signals are highly subject-specific and have low test-retest reliability. Therefore, individual calibration sessions need to be employed before each use of fNIRS-based BCI to achieve a sufficiently high performance for practical BCI applications. In this study, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for implementing a subject-independent fNIRS-based BCI. A total of 18 participants performed the fNIRS-based BCI experiments, where the main goal of the experiments was to distinguish a mental arithmetic task from an idle state task. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was employed to evaluate the average classification accuracy of the proposed subject-independent fNIRS-based BCI. As a result, the average classification accuracy of the proposed method was reported to be 71.20 ± 8.74%, which was higher than the threshold accuracy for effective BCI communication (70%) as well as that obtained using conventional shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (65.74 ± 7.68%). To achieve a classification accuracy comparable to that of the proposed subject-independent fNIRS-based BCI, 24 training trials (of approximately 12 min) were necessary for the traditional subject-dependent fNIRS-based BCI. It is expected that our CNN-based approach would reduce the necessity of long-term individual calibration sessions, thereby enhancing the practicality of fNIRS-based BCIs significantly.</p>

<p>The ipsilesional arm of stroke patients often has functionally limiting deficits in motor control and dexterity that depend on the side of the brain that is lesioned and that increase with the severity of paretic arm impairment. However, remediation of the ipsilesional arm has yet to be integrated into the usual standard of care for upper limb rehabilitation in stroke, largely due to a lack of translational research examining the effects of ipsilesional-arm intervention. We now ask whether ipsilesional-arm training, tailored to the hemisphere-specific nature of ipsilesional-arm motor deficits in participants with moderate to severe contralesional paresis, improves ipsilesional arm performance and generalizes to improve functional independence. We assessed the effects of this intervention on ipsilesional arm unilateral performance [Jebsen–Taylor Hand Function Test (JHFT)], ipsilesional grip strength, contralesional arm impairment level [Fugl–Meyer Assessment (FM)], and functional independence [Functional independence measure (FIM)] (N = 13). Intervention occurred over a 3 week period for 1.5 h/session, three times each week. All sessions included virtual reality tasks that targeted the specific motor control deficits associated with either left or right hemisphere damage, followed by graded dexterity training in real-world tasks. We also exposed participants to 3 weeks of sham training to control for the non-specific effects of therapy visits and interactions. We conducted five test-sessions: two pre-tests and three post-tests. Our results indicate substantial improvements in the less-impaired arm performance, without detriment to the paretic arm that transferred to improved functional independence in all three posttests, indicating durability of training effects for at least 3 weeks. We provide evidence for establishing the basis of a rehabilitation approach that includes evaluation and remediation of the ipsilesional arm in moderately to severely impaired stroke survivors. This study was originally a crossover design; however, we were unable to complete the second arm of the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the results from the first arm of the planned design as a longitudinal study.</p>

<p>Synchronous oscillations are ubiquitous throughout the cortex, but the frequency of oscillations differs from area to area. To elucidate the mechanistic architectures underlying various rhythmic activities, we tested whether spontaneous neural oscillations in different local cortical areas and large-scale networks can be phase-entrained by direct perturbation with distinct frequencies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). While recording the electroencephalogram (EEG), we applied single-pulse TMS (sp-TMS) and rTMS at 5, 11, and 23 Hz over the motor or visual cortex. We assessed local and global modulation of phase dynamics using the phase-locking factor (PLF). sp-TMS to the motor and the visual cortex triggered a transient increase in PLF in distinct frequencies that peaked at 21 and 8 Hz, respectively. rTMS at 23 Hz over the motor cortex and 11 Hz over the visual cortex induced a prominent and progressive increase in PLF that lasted for a few cycles after the termination of rTMS. Moreover, the local increase in PLF propagated to other cortical areas. These results suggest that distinct cortical areas have area-specific oscillatory frequencies, and the manipulation of oscillations in local areas impacts other areas through the large-scale oscillatory network with the corresponding frequency specificity. We speculate that rTMS that is close to area-specific frequencies (natural frequencies) enables direct manipulation of brain dynamics and is thus useful for investigating the causal roles of synchronous neural oscillations. Moreover, this technique could be used to treat clinical symptoms associated with impaired oscillations and synchrony.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that schizophrenia is a disorder of the brain’s communication, a result of functional and structural dysconnectivities. Patients with schizophrenia exhibit irregular neuronal circuit and network activity, but the causes and consequences of such activity remain largely unknown. Inhibition of 14-3-3 proteins in the mouse brain leads to the expression of multiple schizophrenia endophenotypes. Here we investigated how 14-3-3 inhibition alters neuronal network activity in the mouse hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), key brain regions implicated in schizophrenia pathophysiology. We implanted monopolar recording electrodes in these two regions to record local field potentials both at rest and during a cognitive task. Through our assessment of band power, coherence, and phase-amplitude coupling, we found that neural oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency ranges were altered as a result of 14-3-3 dysfunction. Utilizing transgenic and viral mouse models to assess the effects of chronic and acute 14-3-3 inhibition on oscillatory activities, respectively, we observed several fundamental similarities and differences between the two models. We localized viral mediated 14-3-3 protein inhibition to either the HPC or PFC, allowing us to assess the individual contributions of each region to the observed changes in neural oscillations. These findings identify a novel role of 14-3-3 proteins in neural oscillations that may have implications for our understanding of schizophrenia neurobiology.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.644743">Adjudicating Between Local and Global Architectures of Predictive Processing in the Subcortical Auditory Pathway</a></h4>

<p>Predictive processing, a leading theoretical framework for sensory processing, suggests that the brain constantly generates predictions on the sensory world and that perception emerges from the comparison between these predictions and the actual sensory input. This requires two distinct neural elements: generative units, which encode the model of the sensory world; and prediction error units, which compare these predictions against the sensory input. Although predictive processing is generally portrayed as a theory of cerebral cortex function, animal and human studies over the last decade have robustly shown the ubiquitous presence of prediction error responses in several nuclei of the auditory, somatosensory, and visual subcortical pathways. In the auditory modality, prediction error is typically elicited using so-called oddball paradigms, where sequences of repeated pure tones with the same pitch are at unpredictable intervals substituted by a tone of deviant frequency. Repeated sounds become predictable promptly and elicit decreasing prediction error; deviant tones break these predictions and elicit large prediction errors. The simplicity of the rules inducing predictability make oddball paradigms agnostic about the origin of the predictions. Here, we introduce two possible models of the organizational topology of the predictive processing auditory network: (1) the global view, that assumes that predictions on the sensory input are generated at high-order levels of the cerebral cortex and transmitted in a cascade of generative models to the subcortical sensory pathways; and (2) the local view, that assumes that independent local models, computed using local information, are used to perform predictions at each processing stage. In the global view information encoding is optimized globally but biases sensory representations along the entire brain according to the subjective views of the observer. The local view results in a diminished coding efficiency, but guarantees in return a robust encoding of the features of sensory input at each processing stage. Although most experimental results to-date are ambiguous in this respect, recent evidence favors the global model.</p>

<p>Neurons in the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (Vme) have axons that branch peripherally to innervate the orofacial region and project centrally to several motor nuclei in brainstem. The dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve (DMV) resides in the brainstem and takes a role in visceral motor function such as pancreatic exocrine secretion. The present study aimed to demonstrate the presence of Vme–DMV circuit, activation of which would elicit a trigeminal neuroendocrine response. A masticatory dysfunctional animal model termed unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) model created by disturbing the dental occlusion was used. Cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) was injected into the inferior alveolar nerve of rats to help identify the central axon terminals of Vme neurons around the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) positive motor neurons in the DMV. The level of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) expressed in DMV, the level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expressed in pancreas, the level of glucagon and insulin expression in islets and serum, and the blood glucose level were detected and compared between UAC and the age matched sham-operation control mice. Data indicated that compared with the controls, there were more CTb/VGLUT1 double labeled axon endings around the ChAT positive neurons in the DMV of UAC groups. Mice in UAC group expressed a higher VGLUT1 protein level in DMV, AChE protein level in pancreas, glucagon and insulin level in islet and serum, and higher postprandial blood glucose level, but lower fasting blood glucose level. All these were reversed at 15-weeks when UAC cessation was performed from 11-weeks (all, P &lt; 0.05). Our findings demonstrated Vme–DMV circuit via which the aberrant occlusion elicited a trigeminal neuroendocrine response such as alteration in the postprandial blood glucose level. Dental occlusion is proposed as a potential therapeutic target for reversing the increased postprandial glucose level.</p>

<p>Objective: Brain-computer interface (BCI) training is becoming increasingly popular in neurorehabilitation. However, around one third subjects have difficulties in controlling BCI devices effectively, which limits the application of BCI training. Furthermore, the effectiveness of BCI training is not satisfactory in stroke rehabilitation. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a powerful neural modulatory approach with strong facilitatory effects. Here, we investigated whether iTBS would improve BCI accuracy and boost the neuroplastic changes induced by BCI training.</p><p>Methods: Eight right-handed healthy subjects (four males, age: 20–24) participated in this two-session study (BCI-only session and iTBS+BCI session in random order). Neuroplastic changes were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In BCI-only session, fNIRS was measured at baseline and immediately after BCI training. In iTBS+BCI session, BCI training was followed by iTBS delivered on the right primary motor cortex (M1). Single-pulse TMS was measured at baseline and immediately after iTBS. fNIRS was measured at baseline, immediately after iTBS, and immediately after BCI training. Paired-sample t-tests were used to compare amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials, cortical silent period duration, oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) concentration and functional connectivity across time points, and BCI accuracy between sessions.</p><p>Results: No significant difference in BCI accuracy was detected between sessions (p &gt; 0.05). In BCI-only session, functional connectivity matrices between motor cortex and prefrontal cortex were significantly increased after BCI training (p's &lt; 0.05). In iTBS+BCI session, amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials were significantly increased after iTBS (p's &lt; 0.05), but no change in HbO2 concentration or functional connectivity was observed throughout the whole session (p's &gt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated how iTBS targeted on M1 influences BCI accuracy and the acute neuroplastic changes after BCI training. Our results revealed that iTBS targeted on M1 did not influence BCI accuracy or facilitate the neuroplastic changes after BCI training. Therefore, M1 might not be an effective stimulation target of iTBS for the purpose of improving BCI accuracy or facilitate its effectiveness; other brain regions (i.e., prefrontal cortex) are needed to be further investigated as potentially effective stimulation targets.</p>

<p>The pericyte is a perivascular cell type that encapsulates the microvasculature of the brain and spinal cord. Pericytes play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and have a multitude of important functions in the brain. Recent evidence indicates that pericyte impairment has been implicated in neurovascular pathology associated with various human diseases such as diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and stroke. Although the pericyte is essential for normal brain function, knowledge about its developmental trajectory and anatomical distribution is limited. This review article summarizes the scientific community’s current understanding of pericytes’ regional heterogeneity in the brain and their changes during major life stages. More specifically, this review article focuses on pericyte differentiation and migration during brain development, regional population differences in the adult brain, and changes during normal and pathological aging. Most of what is known about pericytes come from studies of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Therefore, we highlight the need to expand our understanding of pericyte distribution and function in the whole brain to better delineate this cell type’s role in the normal brain and pathological conditions.</p>

<p>Cerebellar hypoplasia is a major characteristic of the Down syndrome (DS) brain. However, the consequences of trisomy upon cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) and interneurons in DS are unclear. The present study performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of cerebellar neurons immunostained with antibodies against calbindin D-28k (Calb), parvalbumin (Parv), and calretinin (Calr), phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated intermediate neurofilaments (SMI-34 and SMI-32), and high (TrkA) and low (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors as well as tau and amyloid in DS (n = 12), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 10), and healthy non-dementia control (HC) (n = 8) cases. Our findings revealed higher Aβ<sub>42</sub> plaque load in DS compared to AD and HC but no differences in APP/Aβ plaque load between HC, AD, and DS. The cerebellar cortex neither displayed Aβ<sub>40</sub> containing plaques nor pathologic phosphorylated tau in any of the cases examined. The number and optical density (OD) measurements of Calb immunoreactive (-ir) PC soma and dendrites were similar between groups, while the number of PCs positive for Parv and SMI-32 were significantly reduced in AD and DS compared to HC. By contrast, the number of SMI-34-ir PC dystrophic axonal swellings, termed torpedoes, was significantly greater in AD compared to DS. No differences in SMI-32- and Parv-ir PC OD measurements were observed between groups. Conversely, total number of Parv- (stellate/basket) and Calr (Lugaro, brush, and Golgi)-positive interneurons were significantly reduced in DS compared to AD and HC. A strong negative correlation was found between counts for Parv-ir interneurons, Calr-ir Golgi and brush cells, and Aβ<sub>42</sub> plaque load. Number of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> positive PCs were reduced in AD compared to HC. These findings suggest that disturbances in calcium binding proteins play a critical role in cerebellar neuronal dysfunction in adults with DS.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65786">Synchronous activity patterns in the dentate gyrus during immobility</a></h4>

The hippocampal dentate gyrus is an important relay conveying sensory information from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus proper. During exploration, the dentate gyrus has been proposed to act as a pattern separator. However, the dentate gyrus also shows structured activity during immobility and sleep. The properties of these activity patterns at cellular resolution, and their role in hippocampal-dependent memory processes have remained unclear. Using dual-color in-vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we show that in immobile mice dentate granule cells generate sparse, synchronized activity patterns associated with entorhinal cortex activation. These population events are structured and modified by changes in the environment; and they incorporate place- and speed cells. Importantly, they are more similar than expected by chance to population patterns evoked during self-motion. Using optogenetic inhibition, we show that granule cell activity is not only required during exploration, but also during immobility in order to form dentate gyrus-dependent spatial memories.

The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) continues to increase, with limited therapies available for individuals with cochlear damage. We have previously established that the transcription factor FOXO3 is necessary to preserve outer hair cells (OHCs) and hearing thresholds up to two weeks following a mild noise exposure in mice. The mechanisms by which FOXO3 preserves cochlear cells and function are unknown. In this study, we analyzed the immediate effects of mild noise exposure on wild-type, Foxo3 heterozygous (Foxo3-het), and Foxo3-knockout (Foxo3-KO) mice to better understand Foxo3's roles in the mammalian cochlea. We used confocal and multiphoton microscopy to examine well-characterized components of noise-induced damage, including calcium regulators, oxidative stress, necrosis, and caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis. Lower immunoreactivity of the calcium buffer oncomodulin in Foxo3-KO OHCs correlated with cell loss beginning 4 hours post-noise exposure. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified parthanatos as the cell death pathway for OHCs. Oxidative stress response pathways were not significantly altered in FOXO3's absence. We used RNA sequencing to identify and RT-qPCR to confirm differentially expressed genes. We further investigated a gene downregulated in the unexposed Foxo3-KO mice that may contribute to OHC noise susceptibility. Glycerophosphodiester Phosphodiesterase Domain Containing 3 (GDPD3), a possible endogenous source of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), has not previously been described in the cochlea. As LPA reduces OHC loss after severe noise exposure, we treated noise exposed Foxo3-KO mice with exogenous LPA. LPA treatment delayed immediate damage to OHCs but was insufficient to ultimately prevent their death or prevent hearing loss. These results suggest that FOXO3 acts prior to acoustic insult to maintain cochlear resilience, possibly through sustaining endogenous LPA levels.

Temporal control of action is key for a broad range of behaviors and is disrupted in human diseases such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. A brain structure that is critical for temporal control is the dorsal striatum. Experience and learning can influence dorsal striatal neuronal activity, but it is unknown how these neurons change with experience in contexts which require precise temporal control of movement. We investigated this question by recording from medium-spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsal striatum of mice as they gained experience controlling their actions in time. We leveraged an interval timing task optimized for mice which required them to switch response ports after enough time had passed without receiving a reward. We report three main results. First, we found that time-related ramping activity and response-related activity increased with more experience. Second, temporal decoding by MSN ensembles improved with experience and was predominantly driven by time-related ramping activity. Finally, we found that some MSNs had differential modulation on error trials. These findings enhance our understanding of dorsal striatal temporal processing by demonstrating how MSN ensembles can evolve with experience. Our results can be linked to temporal habituation and illuminate striatal flexibility during interval timing, which may be relevant for human disease.

Robust automated segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in different datasets (domains) is highly challenging due to differences in acquisition (scanner, sequence), population (WMH amount and location) and limited availability of manual segmentations to train supervised algorithms. In this work we explore various domain adaptation techniques such as transfer learning and domain adversarial learning methods, including domain adversarial neural networks and domain unlearning, to improve the generalisability of our recently proposed triplanar ensemble network, which is our baseline model. We evaluated the domain adaptation techniques on source and target domains consisting of 5 different datasets with variations in intensity profile, lesion characteristics and acquired using different scanners. For transfer learning, we also studied various training options such as minimal number of unfrozen layers and subjects required for fine-tuning in the target domain. On comparing the performance of different techniques on the target dataset, unsupervised domain adversarial training of neural network gave the best performance, making the technique promising for robust WMH segmentation.

Resting-state functional connectivity is typically calculated as a correlation between regional activity. It is studied widely, both to gain insight into the brain's intrinsic organization but also to develop markers sensitive to changes in an individual's cognitive, clinical, and developmental state. Despite this, the origins and drivers of functional connectivity, especially at the level of densely sampled individuals, remain elusive. Here, we leverage novel methodology to decompose functional connectivity into its precise framewise contributions. Using two dense sampling datasets, we investigate the origins of individualized functional connectivity, focusing specifically on the role of brain network ``events'' -- short-lived patterns of high-amplitude co-fluctuations. Here, we develop a statistical test to identify events in empirical recordings. We show that the patterns of co-fluctuation expressed during events are repeated across multiple scans of the same individual and represent idiosyncratic variants of template patterns that are expressed at the group level. Lastly, we propose a simple model of functional connectivity based on event co-fluctuations, demonstrating that group-averaged co-fluctuations are suboptimal for explaining subject-specific connectivity. Our work complements recent studies implicating brief instants of high-amplitude co-fluctuations as the primary drivers of static, whole-brain functional connectivity. Our work also extends those studies, demonstrating that co-fluctuations during events are individualized, positing a dynamic basis for functional connectivity.

Lateral and recurrent connections are ubiquitous in biological neural circuits. The strong computational abilities of feedforward networks have been extensively studied; on the other hand, while certain roles for lateral and recurrent connections in specific computations have been described, a more complete understanding of the role and advantages of recurrent computations that might explain their prevalence remains an important open challenge. Previous key studies by Minsky and later by Roelfsema argued that the sequential, parallel computations for which recurrent networks are well suited can be highly effective approaches to complex computational problems. Such "tag propagation" algorithms perform repeated, local propagation of information and were introduced in the context of detecting connectedness, a task that is challenging for feedforward networks. Here, we advance the understanding of the utility of lateral and recurrent computation by first performing a large-scale empirical study of neural architectures for the computation of connectedness to explore feedforward solutions more fully and establish robustly the importance of recurrent architectures. In addition, we highlight a tradeoff between computation time and performance and demonstrate hybrid feedforward/recurrent models that perform well even in the presence of varying computational time limitations. We then generalize tag propagation architectures to multiple, interacting propagating tags and demonstrate that these are efficient computational substrates for more general computations by introducing and solving an abstracted biologically inspired decision-making task. More generally, our work clarifies and expands the set of computational tasks that can be solved efficiently by recurrent computation, yielding hypotheses for structure in population activity that may be present in such tasks.

Author SummaryLateral and recurrent connections are ubiquitous in biological neural circuits; intriguingly, this stands in contrast to the majority of current-day artificial neural network research which primarily uses feedforward architectures except in the context of temporal sequences. This raises the possibility that part of the difference in computational capabilities between real neural circuits and artificial neural networks is accounted for by the role of recurrent connections, and as a result a more detailed understanding of the computational role played by such connections is of great importance. Making effective comparisons between architectures is a subtle challenge, however, and in this paper we leverage the computational capabilities of large-scale machine learning to robustly explore how differences in architectures affect a networks ability to learn a task. We first focus on the task of determining whether two pixels are connected in an image which has an elegant and efficient recurrent solution: propagate a connected label or tag along paths. Inspired by this solution, we show that it can be generalized in many ways, including propagating multiple tags at once and changing the computation performed on the result of the propagation. To illustrate these generalizations, we introduce an abstracted decision-making task related to foraging in which an animal must determine whether it can avoid predators in a random environment. Our results shed light on the set of computational tasks that can be solved efficiently by recurrent computation and how these solutions may appear in neural activity.

White matter (WM) alterations have been identified as a relevant pathological feature of Huntingtons disease (HD). Increasing evidence suggests that WM changes in this disorder are due to alterations in myelin-associated biological processes. Multi-compartmental analysis of the complex gradient-echo MRI signal evolution in WM has been shown to quantify myelin in vivo, therefore pointing to the potential of this technique for the study of WM myelin changes in health and disease. This study first characterized the reproducibility of metrics derived from the complex multi-echo gradient-recalled echo (mGRE) signal across the corpus callosum in healthy participants, finding highest reproducibility in the posterior callosal segment. Subsequently, the same analysis pipeline was applied in this callosal region in a sample of premanifest HD patients (n = 19) and age, sex and education matched healthy controls (n = 21). In particular, we focused on two myelin-associated derivatives: i. the myelin water signal fraction (fm), a parameter dependent on myelin content; and ii. the difference in frequency between myelin and intra-axonal water pools ({Delta}{omega}), a parameter dependent on the ratio between the inner and the outer axonal radii. fm was found to be lower in HD patients ({beta} = -0.13, p = 0.03), while {Delta}{omega} did not show a group effect. Performance in tests of working memory, executive function, social cognition and movement was also assessed, and a greater age-related decline in executive function was detected in HD patients ({beta} = -0.06, p = 0.006), replicating previous evidence of executive dysfunction in HD. Finally, the correlation between fm, executive function, and proximity to disease onset was explored in patients, and a positive correlation between executive function and fm was detected (r = 0.542; p = 0.02). This study emphasises the potential of complex mGRE signal analysis for aiding understanding of HD pathogenesis and progression. Moreover, expanding on evidence from pathology and animal studies, it provides novel in vivo evidence supporting myelin breakdown as an early feature of HD.

The human voice is a primary channel for emotional communication. It is often presumed that being able to recognise vocal emotions is important for everyday socio-emotional functioning, but direct empirical evidence for this remains scarce. Here, we examined relationships between vocal emotion recognition and socio-emotional adjustment in children. The sample included 6 to 8-year-old children (N = 141). The emotion tasks required them to categorise five emotions conveyed by nonverbal vocalisations (e.g., laughter, crying) and speech prosody: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, plus neutrality. Socio-emotional adjustment was independently evaluated by the childrens teachers using a multi-dimensional questionnaire of self-regulation and social behaviour. Based on frequentist and Bayesian analyses, we found that higher emotion recognition in speech prosody related to better general socio-emotional adjustment. This association remained significant even after accounting for the childrens general cognitive ability, age, sex, and parental education in multiple regressions. Follow-up analyses indicated that the advantages were particularly robust for the socio-emotional dimensions prosocial behaviour and cognitive and behavioural self-regulation. For emotion recognition in nonverbal vocalisations, no associations with socio-emotional adjustment were found. Overall, these results support the close link between childrens emotional prosody recognition skills and their everyday social behaviour.

Psychiatry faces fundamental challenges with regard to mechanistically guided differential diagnosis, as well as prediction of clinical trajectories and treatment response of individual patients. This has motivated the genesis of two closely intertwined fields: (i) Translational Neuromodeling (TN), which develops "computational assays" for inferring patient-specific disease processes from neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and behavioral data; and (ii) Computational Psychiatry (CP), with the goal of incorporating computational assays into clinical decision making in everyday practice. In order to serve as objective and reliable tools for clinical routine, computational assays require end-to-end pipelines from raw data (input) to clinically useful information (output). While these are yet to be established in clinical practice, individual components of this general end-to-end pipeline are being developed and made openly available for community use.

In this paper, we present the Translational Algorithms for Psychiatry-Advancing Science (TAPAS) software package, an open-source collection of building blocks for computational assays in psychiatry. Collectively, the tools in TAPAS presently cover several important aspects of the desired end-to-end pipeline, including: (i) tailored experimental designs and optimization of measurement strategy prior to data acquisition, (ii) quality control during data acquisition, and (iii) artifact correction, statistical inference, and clinical application after data acquisition. Here, we review the different tools within TAPAS and illustrate how these may help provide a deeper understanding of neural and cognitive mechanisms of disease, with the ultimate goal of establishing automatized pipelines for predictions about individual patients. We hope that the openly available tools in TAPAS will contribute to the further development of TN/CP and facilitate the translation of advances in computational neuroscience into clinically relevant computational assays.

Environmental information plays an important role in remembering events. Information about stable aspects of the environment (here referred to as  context) and the event are combined by the hippocampal system and stored as context-dependent memory. In rodents (such as rats and mice), context-dependent memory is often investigated with the object-in-context task. However, the implementation and interpretation of this task varies considerably across studies. This variation hampers the comparison between studies and - for those who design a new experiment or carry out pilot experiments - the estimation of whether observed behavior is within the expected range. Also, it is currently unclear which of the variables critically influence the outcome of the task. To address these issues, we carried out a preregistered systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020191340) and provide an up-to-date overview of the animal-, task-, and protocol-related variations in the object-in-context task for rodents. Using a data-driven explorative meta-analysis we next identified critical factors influencing the outcome of this task, such as sex, testbox size and the delay between the learning trials. Based on these observations we provide recommendations to create more consensus in the set-up, procedure and interpretation of the object-in-context task for rodents. This could contribute to a more robust and evidence-based design in future animal experiments.

The neurophysiological bases of mind wandering (MW) - an experiential state wherein attention is disengaged from the external environment in favour of internal thoughts, and state meta-awareness are poorly understood. In parallel, the relationship between introspection confidence in experiential state judgements and neural representations remains unclear. Here, we recorded EEG whilst participants completed a listening task within which they made experiential state judgments and rated their confidence. Alpha power was reliably greater during MW episodes, with unaware MW further associated with greater delta and theta power. Multivariate pattern classification analysis revealed that MW, and meta-awareness can be decoded from the distribution of power in these three frequency bands. Critically, we show that individual decoding accuracies positively correlate with introspection confidence. Our results reaffirm the role of alpha oscillations in MW, implicate lower frequencies in meta-awareness, and are consistent with the proposal that introspection confidence indexes neurophysiological discriminability of representational states.

Behavioral flexibility, the ability to modify behavior according to changing conditions, is essential to optimize decision-making. Deficits in behavioral flexibility that persist into adulthood are one consequence of adolescent alcohol exposure, and another is decreased functional connectivity in brain structures involved in decision-making; however, a link between these two outcomes has not been established. We assessed effects of adolescent alcohol and sex on both Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors and functional connectivity in adult animals to determine associations between behavioral flexibility and resting-state functional connectivity. Alcohol exposure impaired attentional set reversals and decreased functional connectivity among cortical and subcortical regions-of-interest that underlie flexible behavior. Moreover, mediation analyses indicated that adolescent alcohol-induced reductions in functional connectivity within a subnetwork of affected brain regions mediated errors committed during reversal learning. These results provide a novel link between persistent reductions in brain functional connectivity and deficits in behavioral flexibility resulting from adolescent alcohol exposure.

The clinical importance of social cognition is well acknowledged in patients with psychosis, in particular those with first episode psychosis (FEP). Nevertheless, its brain substrates and circuitries remain elusive, lacking precise analysis between multimodal brain characteristics and behavioral sub-dimensions within social cognition. In the present study, we examined face processing of social cognition in 79 FEP patients and 80 healthy controls (HCs). We looked for a possible correlation between face processing and multimodal MRI characteristics such as resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and brain volume. We observed worse recognition accuracy, longer recognition response time, and longer memory response time in FEP patients when compared with HCs. Of these, memory response time was selectively correlated with specific rsFCs, which included the right subcallosal sub-region of BA24 in the ACC (scACC), only in FEP patients. The volume of this region was also correlated with memory response time in FEP patients. The scACC is functionally and structurally important in FEP-associated abnormalities of face processing measures in social cognition.

Ring attractor models for angular path integration have recently received strong experimental support. To function as integrators, head-direction (HD) circuits require precisely tuned connectivity, but it is currently unknown how such tuning could be achieved. Here, we propose a network model in which a local, biologically plausible learning rule adjusts synaptic efficacies during development, guided by supervisory allothetic cues. Applied to the Drosophila HD system, the model learns to path-integrate accurately and develops a connectivity strikingly similar to the one reported in experiments. The mature network is a quasi-continuous attractor and reproduces key experiments in which optogenetic stimulation controls the internal representation of heading, and where the network remaps to integrate with different gains. Our model predicts that path integration requires supervised learning during a developmental phase. The model setting is general and also applies to architectures that lack the physical topography of a ring, like the mammalian HD system.

The ability to recognize familiar visual objects is critical to survival. Neurons in inferotemporal (IT) cortex represent the percept of visual objects using a distributed axis code. However, the network code for the memory of visual objects remains elusive. Here, we measured neuronal responses to familiar and unfamiliar faces in two face patches, AM and PR. In both areas, familiar and unfamiliar faces were represented in distinct subspaces. The familiar face subspace was shifted relative to the unfamiliar face subspace at short latency and then distorted to increase neural distances between familiar faces at long latency. Our results suggest that memories of familiar faces are represented in IT and perirhinal cortex by a distinct long-latency code that is optimized to distinguish familiar identities.

One Sentence SummaryFamiliar and unfamiliar faces are represented in distinct neural subspaces, with the former represented by a unique long-latency geometry.

Links between cognitive deficits and psychiatric disorders have been studied predominantly at the group level, leaving unique individual characteristics largely unknown. Here, we applied normative modeling to UK Biobank data (N=18,634) and estimated the interplay of large-scale brain networks over time (i.e., dynamic brain state) at the individual level. Abnormality in such brain states was linked to individual variation in mental health. Specifically, brain state measures including fractional occupancy were estimated as a function of general cognitive ability and abnormality scores per participant were quantified to represent the degree of deviations relative to the estimated population norm. We found significant associations between the abnormality scores of several brain states and individuals overall mental health. Our findings suggest potential impact of mental health on dynamic brain states subserving cognitive functions and shed light on the relevant brain mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in mental illness.

Assemblies of neurons, called concepts cells, encode acquired concepts in human Medial Temporal Lobe. Those concept cells that are shared between two assemblies have been hypothesized to encode associations between concepts. Here we test this hypothesis in a computational model of attractor neural networks. We find that for concepts encoded in sparse neural assemblies there is a minimal fraction cmin of neurons shared between assemblies below which associations cannot be reliably implemented; and a maximal fraction cmax of shared neurons above which single concepts can no longer be retrieved. In the presence of a periodically modulated background signal, such as hippocampal oscillations, recall takes the form of association chains reminiscent of those postulated by theories of free recall of words. Predictions of an iterative overlap-generating model match experimental data on the number of concepts to which a neuron responds.

A clinically actionable understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology goes through GWAS interpretation, prompting research on new gene regulatory models. Our previous works on these topics suggested a stochastic etiologic model where small-scale random perturbations could eventually reach a threshold for MS onset and progression. A new sequencing technology has mapped the transient transcriptome (TT), including intergenic RNAs, and antisense intronic RNAs. Through a rigorous colocalization analysis, here we show that genomic regions coding for the TT were significantly enriched for both MS-associated GWAS variants, and DNA binding sites for molecular transducers mediating putative, non-genetic, etiopathogenetic factors for MS (e.g., vitamin D deficiency, Epstein Barr virus latent infection, B cell dysfunction). These results suggest a model whereby TT-coding regions are hotspots of convergence between genetic ad non-genetic factors of risk/protection for MS (and plausibly for other complex disorders). Our colocalization analysis also provides a freely available data resource at www.mscoloc.com for future research on transcriptional regulation in MS.

Musical expertise is a model of neuroplasticity associated with pervasive, long-lasting training effects. Indeed, decades of cognitive neuroscience widely investigated brain functional and structural changes associated with musical training, providing a widespread and variegated set of findings. However, several controversial results emerged, leading the neuroscientific community to lack a well-defined neuro-functional-anatomy of musical expertise. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of publications investigating brain functional and structural differences between musicians and non-musicians. Eighty-four publications were included in the qualitative synthesis. Coordinate-based meta-analyses were conducted using the anatomic/activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method implemented in GingerALE, with a total of 675 foci, 79 experiments and 2780 participants. Results showed a widespread and complex array of functional and structural changes in musicians' brains, revealing for the first time a comprehensive picture of the brain plasticity associated with musical training.

Risk factors for developing dementia from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) likely differ between MCI subtypes. We investigated how frailty relates to dementia risk in amnestic MCI (a‐MCI; N = 2799) and non‐amnestic MCI (na‐MCI; N = 629) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Even though higher frailty increased dementia risk for people with either a‐MCI or na‐MCI, the larger risk was in na‐MCI (interaction HR = 1.35 [95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.59], P &lt; .001). Even after the onset of clinically significant cognitive impairment, poor general health, quantified by a high degree of frailty, is a significant risk for dementia.

A rapidly expanding catalogue of neurogenetic disorders has encouraged a diagnostic shift towards early clinical whole exome sequencing (WES). Adult primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) frequently exhibit neurological manifestations that overlap with other nervous system disorders. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not routinely analyzed in standard clinical WES bioinformatic pipelines. We reanalyzed 11,424 exomes, enriched with neurological diseases, for pathogenic mtDNA variants. Twenty‐four different mtDNA mutations were detected in 64 exomes, 11 of which were considered disease causing based on the associated clinical phenotypes. These findings highlight the diagnostic uplifts gained by analyzing mtDNA from WES data in neurological diseases.

Although Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is hypothesized to be a prerequisite for multiple sclerosis (MS), up to 15% of children with a diagnosis of MS were reported to be EBV‐seronegative. When re‐evaluating 25 EBV‐seronegative children out of 189 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome/MS, we found anti‐myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody in 11/25 (44%) EBV‐seronegative, but only 9/164 (5.5%, p &lt; 0.001) EBV‐seropositive patients. After critical review, MS remained a plausible diagnosis in only four of 14 EBV‐seronegative/MOG antibody‐negative patients. In children with an MS‐like presentation, EBV seronegativity should alert clinicians to consider diagnoses other than MS, especially MOG‐antibody disease.

Objective
Many multiple sclerosis (MS) genetic susceptibility variants have been identified, but understanding disease heterogeneity remains a key challenge. Relapses are a core feature of MS and a common primary outcome of clinical trials, with prevention of relapses benefiting patients immediately and potentially limiting long‐term disability accrual. We aim to identify genetic variation associated with relapse hazard in MS by analyzing the largest study population to date.


Methods
We performed a genome‐wide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort and investigated the genome‐wide significant variants in a replication cohort. Combining both cohorts, we captured a total of 2231 relapses occurring before the start of any immunomodulatory treatment in 991 patients. For assessing time to relapse, we applied a survival analysis utilizing Cox proportional hazards models. We also investigated the association between MS genetic risk scores and relapse hazard and performed a gene ontology pathway analysis.


Results
The low‐frequency genetic variant rs11871306 within WNT9B reached genomewide significance in predicting relapse hazard and replicated (meta‐analysis hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.70–2.78, p = 2.07 × 10−10). A pathway analysis identified an association of the pathway “response to vitamin D" with relapse hazard (p = 4.33 × 10−6). The MS genetic risk scores, however, were not associated with relapse hazard.


Interpretation
Genetic factors underlying disease heterogeneity differ from variants associated with MS susceptibility. Our findings imply that genetic variation within the Wnt signaling and vitamin D pathways contributes to differences in relapse occurrence. The present study highlights these cross‐talking pathways as potential modulators of MS disease activity.

Objective
To determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other EEG patterns in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram monitoring (cEEG), and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes.


Methods
We identified 197 patients with COVID‐19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes.


Results
Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with versus 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, Odds Ratio (OR) 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A preexisting intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) 4.07 [1.44‐11.51], p &lt; 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length‐of‐stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: 0.21 [0.03‐0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36‐0.49])


Interpretation
This multi‐center retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically‐indicated cEEG, and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

<p>by Warren Woodrich Pettine, Kenway Louie, John D. Murray, Xiao-Jing Wang</p>

We are constantly faced with decisions between alternatives defined by multiple attributes, necessitating an evaluation and integration of different information sources. Time-varying signals in multiple brain areas are implicated in decision-making; but we lack a rigorous biophysical description of how basic circuit properties, such as excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) tone and cascading nonlinearities, shape attribute processing and choice behavior. Furthermore, how such properties govern choice performance under varying levels of environmental uncertainty is unknown. We investigated two-attribute, two-alternative decision-making in a dynamical, cascading nonlinear neural network with three layers: an input layer encoding choice alternative attribute values; an intermediate layer of modules processing separate attributes; and a final layer producing the decision. Depending on intermediate layer E/I tone, the network displays distinct regimes characterized by linear (I), convex (II) or concave (III) choice indifference curves. In regimes I and II, each option’s attribute information is additively integrated. In regime III, time-varying nonlinear operations amplify the separation between offer distributions by selectively attending to the attribute with the larger differences in input values. At low environmental uncertainty, a linear combination most consistently selects higher valued alternatives. However, at high environmental uncertainty, regime III is more likely than a linear operation to select alternatives with higher value. Furthermore, there are conditions where readout from the intermediate layer could be experimentally indistinguishable from the final layer. Finally, these principles are used to examine multi-attribute decisions in systems with reduced inhibitory tone, leading to predictions of different choice patterns and overall performance between those with restrictions on inhibitory tone and neurotypicals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L4auDjXY9Hc" width="1" />

<p>by Casey M. Zipfel, Vittoria Colizza, Shweta Bansal</p>

The lower an individual’s socioeconomic position, the higher their risk of poor health in low-, middle-, and high-income settings alike. As health inequities grow, it is imperative that we develop an empirically-driven mechanistic understanding of the determinants of health disparities, and capture disease burden in at-risk populations to prevent exacerbation of disparities. Past work has been limited in data or scope and has thus fallen short of generalizable insights. Here, we integrate empirical data from observational studies and large-scale healthcare data with models to characterize the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of health disparities in an infectious disease case study: influenza. We find that variation in social and healthcare-based determinants exacerbates influenza epidemics, and that low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals disproportionately bear the burden of infection. We also identify geographical hotspots of influenza burden in low SES populations, much of which is overlooked in traditional influenza surveillance, and find that these differences are most predicted by variation in susceptibility and access to sickness absenteeism. Our results highlight that the effect of overlapping factors is synergistic and that reducing this intersectionality can significantly reduce inequities. Additionally, health disparities are expressed geographically, and targeting public health efforts spatially may be an efficient use of resources to abate inequities. The association between health and socioeconomic prosperity has a long history in the epidemiological literature; addressing health inequities in respiratory-transmitted infectious disease burden is an important step towards social justice in public health, and ignoring them promises to pose a serious threat.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bQ2CRQXRBBc" width="1" />

<p>by Mark J. Panaggio, Daniel M. Abrams, Fan Yang, Tanvi Banerjee, Nirmish R. Shah</p>

Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience lifelong struggles with both chronic and acute pain, often requiring medical interventMaion. Pain can be managed with medications, but dosages must balance the goal of pain mitigation against the risks of tolerance, addiction and other adverse effects. Setting appropriate dosages requires knowledge of a patient’s subjective pain, but collecting pain reports from patients can be difficult for clinicians and disruptive for patients, and is only possible when patients are awake and communicative. Here we investigate methods for estimating SCD patients’ pain levels indirectly using vital signs that are routinely collected and documented in medical records. Using machine learning, we develop both sequential and non-sequential probabilistic models that can be used to infer pain levels or changes in pain from sequences of these physiological measures. We demonstrate that these models outperform null models and that objective physiological data can be used to inform estimates for subjective pain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tFm6S5JBD3o" width="1" />

Loss in intraspecific diversity can alter ecosystem functions, but the underlying mechanisms are still elusive, and intraspecific biodiversity–ecosystem function (iBEF) relationships have been restrained to primary producers. Here, we manipulated genetic and functional richness of a fish consumer (<i>Phoxinus phoxinus</i>) to test whether iBEF relationships exist in consumer species and whether they are more likely sustained by genetic or functional richness. We found that both genotypic and functional richness affected ecosystem functioning, either independently or interactively. Loss in genotypic richness reduced benthic invertebrate diversity consistently across functional richness treatments, whereas it reduced zooplankton diversity only when functional richness was high. Finally, losses in genotypic and functional richness altered functions (decomposition) through trophic cascades. We concluded that iBEF relationships lead to substantial top-down effects on entire food chains. The loss of genotypic richness impacted ecological properties as much as the loss of functional richness, probably because it sustains “cryptic” functional diversity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dncfvEH8D4E" width="1" />

The regulation of protein synthesis is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially during stress responses, and its dysregulation could underlie the development of human diseases. The critical step during translation regulation is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Here we report the identification of a direct kinase of eIF2α, microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), which phosphorylates eIF2α in response to proteotoxic stress. The activity of MARK2 was confirmed in the cells lacking the 4 previously known eIF2α kinases. MARK2 itself was found to be a substrate of protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), which serves as a sensor for protein misfolding stress through a dynamic interaction with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Both MARK2 and PKCδ are activated via phosphorylation in proteotoxicity-associated neurodegenerative mouse models and in human patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These results reveal a PKCδ-MARK2-eIF2α cascade that may play a critical role in cellular proteotoxic stress responses and human diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rN8bCJUYr8E" width="1" />

The apical complex is the instrument of invasion used by apicomplexan parasites, and the conoid is a conspicuous feature of this apparatus found throughout this phylum. The conoid, however, is believed to be heavily reduced or missing from <i>Plasmodium</i> species and other members of the class Aconoidasida. Relatively few conoid proteins have previously been identified, making it difficult to address how conserved this feature is throughout the phylum, and whether it is genuinely missing from some major groups. Moreover, parasites such as <i>Plasmodium</i> species cycle through 3 invasive forms, and there is the possibility of differential presence of the conoid between these stages. We have applied spatial proteomics and high-resolution microscopy to develop a more complete molecular inventory and understanding of the organisation of conoid-associated proteins in the model apicomplexan <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. These data revealed molecular conservation of all conoid substructures throughout Apicomplexa, including <i>Plasmodium</i>, and even in allied Myzozoa such as <i>Chromera</i> and dinoflagellates. We reporter-tagged and observed the expression and location of several conoid complex proteins in the malaria model <i>P</i>. <i>berghei</i> and revealed equivalent structures in all of its zoite forms, as well as evidence of molecular differentiation between blood-stage merozoites and the ookinetes and sporozoites of the mosquito vector. Collectively, we show that the conoid is a conserved apicomplexan element at the heart of the invasion mechanisms of these highly successful and often devastating parasites.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PlLVXG812RY" width="1" />

Malaria is caused by unicellular <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites. <i>Plasmodium</i> relies on diverse microtubule cytoskeletal structures for its reproduction, multiplication, and dissemination. Due to the small size of this parasite, its cytoskeleton has been primarily observable by electron microscopy (EM). Here, we demonstrate that the nanoscale cytoskeleton organisation is within reach using ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM). In developing microgametocytes, U-ExM allows monitoring the dynamic assembly of axonemes and concomitant tubulin polyglutamylation in whole cells. In the invasive merozoite and ookinete forms, U-ExM unveils the diversity across <i>Plasmodium</i> stages and species of the subpellicular microtubule arrays that confer cell rigidity. In ookinetes, we additionally identify an apical tubulin ring (ATR) that colocalises with markers of the conoid in related apicomplexan parasites. This tubulin-containing structure was presumed to be lost in <i>Plasmodium</i> despite its crucial role in motility and invasion in other apicomplexans. Here, U-ExM reveals that a divergent and considerably reduced form of the conoid is actually conserved in <i>Plasmodium</i> species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3UYvvaReJU0" width="1" />

Custom made antibodies against four putative neuropeptides where used on whole mounts of the box jellyfish, Tripedalia cystophora, and revealed new details of the neuroanatomy in both the rhopalium and in the bell. These neuropeptides are most likely neurotransmitters in most stained neurons but might also be involved in neuronal development.







Abstract
Box jellyfish have an elaborate visual system and perform advanced visually guided behaviors. However, the rhopalial nervous system (RNS), believed to be the main visual processing center, only has 1000 neurons in each of the four eye carrying rhopalia. We have examined the detailed structure of the RNS of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora, using immunolabeling with antibodies raised against four putative neuropeptides (T. cystophora RFamide, VWamide, RAamide, and FRamide). In the RNS, T. cystophora RF‐, VW‐, and RAamide antibodies stain sensory neurons, the pit eyes, the neuropil, and peptide‐specific subpopulations of stalk‐associated neurons and giant neurons. Furthermore, RFamide ir+ neurites are seen in the epidermal stalk nerve, whereas VWamide antibodies stain the gastrodermal stalk nerve. RFamide has the most widespread expression including in the ring and radial nerves, the pedalium nerve plexus, and the tentacular nerve net. RAamide is the putative neurotransmitter in the motor neurons of the subumbrellar nerve net, and VWamide is a potential marker for neuronal differentiation as it is found in subpopulations of undifferentiated cells both in the rhopalia and in the bell. The results from the FRamide antibodies were not included as only few cells were stained, and in an unreproducible way. Our studies show hitherto‐unseen details of the nervous system of T. cystophora and allowed us to identify specific functional groups of neurons. This identification is important for understanding visual processing in the RNS and enables experimental work, directly addressing the role of the different neuropeptides in vision.

<p>The vastness of the design space created by the combination of a large number
of computational mechanisms, including machine learning, is an obstacle to
creating an artificial general intelligence (AGI). Brain-inspired AGI
development, in other words, cutting down the design space to look more like a
biological brain, which is an existing model of a general intelligence, is a
promising plan for solving this problem. However, it is difficult for an
individual to design a software program that corresponds to the entire brain
because the neuroscientific data required to understand the architecture of the
brain are extensive and complicated. The whole-brain architecture approach
divides the brain-inspired AGI development process into the task of designing
the brain reference architecture (BRA) -- the flow of information and the
diagram of corresponding components -- and the task of developing each
component using the BRA. This is called BRA-driven development. Another
difficulty lies in the extraction of the operating principles necessary for
reproducing the cognitive-behavioral function of the brain from neuroscience
data. Therefore, this study proposes the Structure-constrained Interface
Decomposition (SCID) method, which is a hypothesis-building method for creating
a hypothetical component diagram consistent with neuroscientific findings. The
application of this approach has begun for building various regions of the
brain. Moving forward, we will examine methods of evaluating the biological
plausibility of brain-inspired software. This evaluation will also be used to
prioritize different computational mechanisms, which should be merged,
associated with the same regions of the brain.

<p>For many psychiatric disorders, neuroimaging offers a potential for
revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment by providing access to preverbal mental
processes. In their study "Machine learning of neural representations of
suicide and emotion concepts identifies suicidal youth."1, Just and colleagues
report that a Naive Bayes classifier, trained on voxelwise fMRI responses in
human participants during the presentation of words and concepts related to
mortality, can predict whether an individual had reported having suicidal
ideations with a classification accuracy of 91%. Here we report a reappraisal
of the methods employed by the authors, including re-analysis of the same data
set, that calls into question the accuracy of the authors findings.

<p>Prediction of human actions in social interactions has important applications
in the design of social robots or artificial avatars. In this paper, we model
human interaction generation as a discrete multi-sequence generation problem
and present SocialInteractionGAN, a novel adversarial architecture for
conditional interaction generation. Our model builds on a recurrent
encoder-decoder generator network and a dual-stream discriminator. This
architecture allows the discriminator to jointly assess the realism of
interactions and that of individual action sequences. Within each stream a
recurrent network operating on short subsequences endows the output signal with
local assessments, better guiding the forthcoming generation. Crucially,
contextual information on interacting participants is shared among agents and
reinjected in both the generation and the discriminator evaluation processes.
We show that the proposed SocialInteractionGAN succeeds in producing high
realism action sequences of interacting people, comparing favorably to a
diversity of recurrent and convolutional discriminator baselines. Evaluations
are conducted using modified Inception Score and Fr{\'e}chet Inception Distance
metrics, that we specifically design for discrete sequential generated data.
The distribution of generated sequences is shown to approach closely that of
real data. In particular our model properly learns the dynamics of interaction
sequences, while exploiting the full range of actions.

<p>Recent developments in graph theoretic analysis of complex networks have led
to deeper understanding of brain networks. Many complex networks show similar
macroscopic behaviors despite differences in the microscopic details. Probably
two most often observed characteristics of complex networks are scale-free and

<p>We discuss preliminary results from two experiments and put forth the notion
that the development of sensory systems might be more geared towards discerning
differences rather than for spotting similarities. We present the possibility
that the necessity to spot differences might have evolved to ensure the
survival of the organism, which suggests numerous other experiments to assess
the response of participants to various stimuli. We consider our present state
of affairs, wherein the need is to thrive and not merely survive, which
requires us to spot similarities around us. We provide some suggestions on how
this attribute can be developed, which includes mathematical education. We
conclude with an alternate measure for intelligence, termed the Involvement
Quotient (also, IQ), which gauges the level of involvement of the sense organs
to whatever is happening around the individual.

<p>Purpose: The development of metaheuristic algorithms has increased by
researchers to use them extensively in the field of business, science, and
engineering. One of the common metaheuristic optimization algorithms is called
Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). The algorithm works based on imitation of the
wolves' searching and the process of attacking grey wolves. The main purpose of
this paper to overcome the GWO problem which is trapping into local optima.
</p>
<p>Design or Methodology or Approach: In this paper, the K-means clustering
algorithm is used to enhance the performance of the original Grey Wolf
Optimization by dividing the population into different parts. The proposed
algorithm is called K-means clustering Grey Wolf Optimization (KMGWO).
</p>
<p>Findings: Results illustrate the efficiency of KMGWO is superior to GWO. To
evaluate the performance of the KMGWO, KMGWO applied to solve 10 CEC2019
benchmark test functions. Results prove that KMGWO is better compared to GWO.
KMGWO is also compared to Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), Whale Optimization
Algorithm-Bat Algorithm (WOA-BAT), and WOA, so, KMGWO achieves the first rank
in terms of performance. Statistical results proved that KMGWO achieved a
higher significant value compared to the compared algorithms. Also, the KMGWO
is used to solve a pressure vessel design problem and it has outperformed
results.
</p>
<p>Originality/value: Results prove that KMGWO is superior to GWO. KMGWO is also
compared to cat swarm optimization (CSO), whale optimization algorithm-bat
algorithm (WOA-BAT), WOA, and GWO so KMGWO achieved the first rank in terms of
performance. Also, the KMGWO is used to solve a classical engineering problem
and it is superior

<p>There is much to learn through synthesis of Developmental Biology, Cognitive
Science and Computational Modeling. One lesson we can learn from this
perspective is that the initialization of intelligent programs cannot solely
rely on manipulation of numerous parameters. Our path forward is to present a
design for developmentally-inspired learning agents based on the Braitenberg
Vehicle. Using these agents to exemplify artificial embodied intelligence, we
move closer to modeling embodied experience and morphogenetic growth as
components of cognitive developmental capacity. We consider various factors
regarding biological and cognitive development which influence the generation
of adult phenotypes and the contingency of available developmental pathways.
These mechanisms produce emergent connectivity with shifting weights and
adaptive network topography, thus illustrating the importance of developmental
processes in training neural networks. This approach provides a blueprint for
adaptive agent behavior that might result from a developmental approach: namely
by exploiting critical periods or growth and acquisition, an explicitly
embodied network architecture, and a distinction between the assembly of neural
networks and active learning on these networks.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Finding links between genes and structural connectivity is of the utmost importance for unravelling the underlying mechanism of the brain connectome. In this study we identify links between the gene expression and the axonal projection density in the mouse brain, by applying a modified version of the Linked ICA method to volumetric data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science for identifying independent sources of information that link both modalities at the voxel level. We performed separate analyses on sets of projections from the visual cortex, the caudoputamen and the midbrain reticular nucleus, and we determined those brain areas, injections and genes that were most involved in independent components that link both gene expression and projection density data, while we validated their biological context through enrichment analysis. We identified representative and literature-validated cortico-midbrain and cortico-striatal projections, whose gene subsets were enriched with annotations for neuronal and synaptic function and related developmental and metabolic processes. The results were highly reproducible when including all available projections, as well as consistent with factorisations obtained using the Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding technique. Hence, Linked ICA yielded reproducible independent components that were preserved under increasing data variance. Taken together, we have developed and validated a novel paradigm for linking gene expression and structural projection patterns in the mouse mesoconnectome, which can power future studies aiming to relate genes to brain function.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Although several progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) phenotypes have recently been described, studies identifying cognitive and neuropsychiatric differences between them are lacking.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">An extensive battery of cognitive and behavioural assessments was administered to 63 PSP patients, 25 PD patients with similar sociodemographic characteristics, and 25 healthy controls.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Regarding phenotypes, 64.6% met criteria for Richardson’s syndrome (PSP-RS), 10.7% PSP with predominant Parkinsonism (PSP-P), 10.7% with PSP progressive gait freezing (PSP-PGF), and 10.7% PSP with predominant speech/language disorder (PSP-SL). Impairment was more severe in the PSP group than in the PD and HC groups regarding motor scores, cognitive testing and neuropsychiatric scales. Cognitive testing did not clearly differentiate between PSP phenotypes, but PSP-RS and PSP-SL appeared to have more cognitive impairment than PSP-PGF and PSP-P, mainly due to an increased impairment in frontal executive domains. Regarding neuropsychiatric disturbances, no specific behavior was more common in any of the PSP subtypes.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Motor deficits delineate the phenotypes included in currently accepted MDS-PSP criteria.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">COQ4 is a component of an enzyme complex involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q<sub class="a-plus-plus">10</sub> (CoQ<sub class="a-plus-plus">10</sub>), a molecule with primary importance in cell metabolism. Mutations in the <em class="a-plus-plus">COQ4</em> gene are responsible for mitochondrial diseases showing heterogeneous age at onset, clinical presentations and association with CoQ<sub class="a-plus-plus">10</sub> deficiency. We herein expand the phenotypic and genetic spectrum of <em class="a-plus-plus">COQ4-</em>related diseases, by reporting two patients harboring bi-allelic variants but not showing CoQ<sub class="a-plus-plus">10</sub> deficiency<em class="a-plus-plus">.</em> One patient was found to harbor compound heterozygous mutations (specifically, c.577C&gt;T/p.Pro193Ser and the previously reported c.718C&gt;T/p.Arg240Cys) associated with progressive spasticity, while the other harbored two novel missense (c.284G&gt;A/p.Gly95Asp and c.305G&gt;A/p.Arg102His) associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder. Both patients presented motor impairment and ataxia. To further understand the role of COQ4, we performed functional studies in patient-derived fibroblasts, yeast and “crispant” zebrafish larvae. Micro-oxygraphy showed impaired oxygen consumption rates in one patient, while yeast complementation assays showed that all the mutations were presumably disease related. Moreover, characterization of the <em class="a-plus-plus">coq4</em> F0 CRISPR zebrafish line showed motor defects and cell reduction in a specific area of the hindbrain, a region reminiscent of the human cerebellum. Our expanded phenotype associated with <em class="a-plus-plus">COQ4</em> mutations allowed us to investigate, for the first time, the role of COQ4 in brain development in vivo.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Current neuroimaging research has revealed several brain alterations in idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) that mirror and precede those reported in PD. However, none have specifically addressed the presence of changes across the reward system, and their role in the emergence of impulse control disorders (ICDs). We aimed to compare the volumetric and functional connectivity characteristics of the reward system in relation to the psychobehavioral profile of patients with iRBD versus healthy controls and PD patients.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Twenty patients with polysomnography confirmed iRBD along with 17 PD patients and 14 healthy controls (HC) underwent structural and functional resting-state brain MRI analysis.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A higher percentage of iRBD patients reported hypersexuality, compared to HC and PD (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.008). Whole-brain and striatal voxel-based morphometry analyses showed no significant clusters of reduced grey matter volume between groups. However, iRBD compared to HC demonstrated functional hypoconnectivity between the limbic striatum and temporo-occipital regions. Furthermore, the presence of ICDs correlated with hypoconnectivity between the limbic striatum and clusters located in cuneus, lingual and fusiform gyrus.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Altered functional connectivity between the limbic striatum and posterior cortical regions was associated with increased hypersexuality in iRBD.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Neurological manifestations may be common in COVID-19 patients. They may include several syndromes, such as a suggested autoimmune abnormal response, which may result in encephalitis and new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE). Quickly recognizing such cases and starting the most appropriate therapy is mandatory due to the related rapid worsening and bad outcomes. This case series describes two adult patients admitted to the university hospital and positive to novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who developed drug-resistant status epilepticus. Both patients underwent early electroencephalography (EEG) assessment, which showed a pathological EEG pattern characterized by general slowing, rhythmic activity and continuous epileptic paroxysmal activity. A suspected autoimmune etiology, potentially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, encouraged a rapid work-up for a possible autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis. Therapeutic approach included the administration of 0.4 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in a complete resolution of seizures after 5 and after 10 days, respectively, without adverse effects and followed by a normalization of the EEG patterns.</p>

<p>Current neural network based algorithmic composition methods are very different compared to human brain's composition process, while the biological plausibility of composition and generative models are essential for the future of Artificial Intelligence. To explore this problem, this paper presents a spiking neural network based on the inspiration from brain structures and musical information processing mechanisms at multiple scales. Unlike previous methods, our model has three novel characteristics: (1) Inspired by brain structures, multiple brain regions with different cognitive functions, including musical memory and knowledge learning, are simulated and cooperated to generate stylistic melodies. A hierarchical neural network is constructed to formulate musical knowledge. (2) Biologically plausible neural model is employed to construct the network and synaptic connections are modulated using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. Besides, brain oscillation activities with different frequencies perform importantly during the learning and generating process. (3) Based on significant musical memory and knowledge learning, genre-based and composer-based melody composition can be achieved by different neural circuits, the experiments show that the model can compose melodies with different styles of composers or genres.</p>

<p>Human cortical and subcortical areas integrate emotion, memory, and cognition when interpreting various environmental stimuli for the elaboration of complex, evolved social behaviors. Pyramidal neurons occur in developed phylogenetic areas advancing along with the allocortex to represent 70–85% of the neocortical gray matter. Here, we illustrate and discuss morphological features of heterogeneous spiny pyramidal neurons emerging from specific amygdaloid nuclei, in CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions, and in neocortical layers II/III and V of the anterolateral temporal lobe in humans. Three-dimensional images of Golgi-impregnated neurons were obtained using an algorithm for the visualization of the cell body, dendritic length, branching pattern, and pleomorphic dendritic spines, which are specialized plastic postsynaptic units for most excitatory inputs. We demonstrate the emergence and development of human pyramidal neurons in the cortical and basomedial (but not the medial, MeA) nuclei of the amygdala with cells showing a triangular cell body shape, basal branched dendrites, and a short apical shaft with proximal ramifications as “pyramidal-like” neurons. Basomedial neurons also have a long and distally ramified apical dendrite not oriented to the pial surface. These neurons are at the beginning of the allocortex and the limbic lobe. “Pyramidal-like” to “classic” pyramidal neurons with laminar organization advance from the CA3 to the CA1 hippocampal regions. These cells have basal and apical dendrites with specific receptive synaptic domains and several spines. Neocortical pyramidal neurons in layers II/III and V display heterogeneous dendritic branching patterns adapted to the space available and the afferent inputs of each brain area. Dendritic spines vary in their distribution, density, shapes, and sizes (classified as stubby/wide, thin, mushroom-like, ramified, transitional forms, “atypical” or complex forms, such as thorny excrescences in the MeA and CA3 hippocampal region). Spines were found isolated or intermingled, with evident particularities (e.g., an extraordinary density in long, deep CA1 pyramidal neurons), and some showing a spinule. We describe spiny pyramidal neurons considerably improving the connectional and processing complexity of the brain circuits. On the other hand, these cells have some vulnerabilities, as found in neurodegenerative Alzheimer’s disease and in temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>

<p>Optogenetic stimulation of type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) promises an alternative to the electrical stimulation by current cochlear implants (CIs) for improved hearing restoration by future optical CIs (oCIs). Most of the efforts in using optogenetic stimulation in the cochlea so far used early postnatal injection of viral vectors carrying blue-light activated channelrhodopsins (ChRs) into the cochlea of mice. However, preparing clinical translation of the oCI requires (i) reliable and safe transduction of mature SGNs of further species and (ii) use of long-wavelength light to avoid phototoxicity. Here, we employed a fast variant of the red-light activated channelrhodopsin Chrimson (f-Chrimson) and different AAV variants to implement optogenetic SGN stimulation in Mongolian gerbils. We compared early postnatal (p8) and adult (&gt;8 weeks) AAV administration, employing different protocols for injection of AAV-PHP.B and AAV2/6 into the adult cochlea. Success of the optogenetic manipulation was analyzed by optically evoked auditory brainstem response (oABR) and immunohistochemistry of mid-modiolar cryosections of the cochlea. In order to most efficiently evaluate the immunohistochemical results a semi-automatic procedure to identify transduced cells in confocal images was developed. Our results indicate that the rate of SGN transduction is significantly lower for AAV administration into the adult cochlea compared to early postnatal injection. SGN transduction upon AAV administration into the adult cochlea was largely independent of the chosen viral vector and injection approach. The higher the rate of SGN transduction, the lower were oABR thresholds and the larger were oABR amplitudes. Our results highlight the need to optimize viral vectors and virus administration for efficient optogenetic manipulation of SGNs in the adult cochlea for successful clinical translation of SGN-targeting gene therapy and of the oCI.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in the adult population and it carries a dismal prognosis. Inefficient drug delivery across the blood brain barrier (BBB), an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and development of drug resistance are key barriers to successful glioma treatment. Since gliomas occur through sequential acquisition of genetic alterations, gene therapy, which enables to modification of the genetic make-up of target cells, appears to be a promising approach to overcome the obstacles encountered by current therapeutic strategies. Gene therapy is a rapidly evolving field with the ultimate goal of achieving specific delivery of therapeutic molecules using either viral or non-viral delivery vehicles. Gene therapy can also be used to enhance immune responses to tumor antigens, reprogram the TME aiming at blocking glioma-mediated immunosuppression and normalize angiogenesis. Nano-particles-mediated gene therapy is currently being developed to overcome the BBB for glioma treatment. Another approach to enhance the anti-glioma efficacy is the implementation of viro-immunotherapy using oncolytic viruses, which are immunogenic. Oncolytic viruses kill tumor cells due to cancer cell-specific viral replication, and can also initiate an anti-tumor immunity. However, concerns still remain related to off target effects, and therapeutic and transduction efficiency. In this review, we describe the rationale and strategies as well as advantages and disadvantages of current gene therapy approaches against gliomas in clinical and preclinical studies. This includes different delivery systems comprising of viral, and non-viral delivery platforms along with suicide/prodrug, oncolytic, cytokine, and tumor suppressor-mediated gene therapy approaches. In addition, advances in glioma treatment through BBB-disruptive gene therapy and anti-EGFRvIII/VEGFR gene therapy are also discussed. Finally, we discuss the results of gene therapy-mediated human clinical trials for gliomas. In summary, we highlight the progress, prospects and remaining challenges of gene therapies aiming at broadening our understanding and highlighting the therapeutic arsenal for GBM.</p>

<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability around the world and contributes greatly to the global burden of disease. Mounting evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis may be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD through the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Recent research suggests that epigenetic modifications might relate to depression. However, our knowledge of the role of epigenetics in host–microbe interactions remains limited. In the present study, we used a combination of affinity enrichment and high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify hippocampal acetylated proteins in germ-free and specific pathogen-free mice. In total, 986 lysine acetylation sites in 543 proteins were identified, of which 747 sites in 427 proteins were quantified. Motif analysis identified several conserved sequences surrounding the acetylation sites, including D<sup>∗</sup>Kac, DKac, KacY, KacD, and D<sup>∗∗</sup>Kac. Gene ontology annotations revealed that these differentially expressed acetylated proteins were involved in multiple biological functions and were mainly located in mitochondria. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle II (eukaryotic), both of which are exclusively localized to the mitochondria, were the primarily disturbed functions. Taken together, this study indicates that lysine acetylation alterations may play a pivotal role in mitochondrial dysfunction and may be a mechanism by which gut microbiota regulate brain function and behavioral phenotypes.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no definite molecular markers for diagnosis. Metal exposure may alter cellular proteins that contribute to PD. Exploring the cross-talk between metal and its binding proteins in PD could reveal a new strategy for PD diagnosis. We performed a meta-analysis from different PD tissue microarray datasets to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to the blood and brain. Among common DEGs, we extracted 280 metalloprotein-encoding genes to construct protein networks describing the regulation of metalloproteins in the PD blood and brain. From the metalloprotein network, we identified three important functional hubs. Further analysis shows 60S ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6), a novel intermediary molecule connecting the three hubs of the metalloproteins network. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that RPL6 was downregulated in PD peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. Simultaneously, trace element analysis revealed altered serum zinc and magnesium concentrations in PD samples. The Pearson’s correlation analysis shows that serum zinc and magnesium regulate the RPL6 gene expression in PBMC. Thus, metal-regulating RPL6 acts as an intermediary molecule connecting the three hubs that are functionally associated with PD. Overall our study explores the understanding of metal-mediated pathogenesis in PD, which provides a serum metal environment regulating the cellular gene expression that may light toward metal and gene expression-based biomarkers for PD diagnosis.</p>

<p>Functional constipation (FCon) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. A considerable portion of patients with FCon is associated with anxiety/depressive status (FCAD). Previous neuroimaging studies mainly focused on patients with FCon without distinguishing FCAD from FCon patients without anxiety/depressive status (FCNAD). Differences in brain functions between these two subtypes remain unclear. Thus, we employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and graph theory method to investigate differences in brain network connectivity and topology in 41 FCAD, 42 FCNAD, and 43 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). FCAD/FCNAD showed significantly lower normalized clustering coefficient and small-world-ness. Both groups showed altered nodal degree/efficiency mainly in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), precentral gyrus (PreCen), supplementary motor area (SMA), and thalamus. In the FCAD group, nodal degree in the SMA was negatively correlated with difficulty of defecation, and abdominal pain was positively correlated with nodal degree/efficiency in the rACC, which had a lower within-module nodal degree. The salience network (SN) exhibited higher functional connectivity (FC) with the sensorimotor network (SMN) in FCAD/FCNAD, and FC between these two networks was negatively correlated with anxiety ratings in FCAD group. Additionally, FC of anterior insula (aINS)–rACC was only correlated with constipation symptom (i.e., abdominal pain) in the FCNAD group. In the FCAD group, FCs of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex–rACC, PreCen–aINS showed correlations with both constipation symptom (i.e., difficulty of defecation) and depressive status. These findings indicate the differences in FC of the SN–SMN between FCAD and FCNAD and provide neuroimaging evidence based on brain function, which portrays important clues for improving new treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Advances in large-scale proteomics analysis have been very useful in understanding pathogenesis of diseases and elaborating therapeutic strategies. Proteomics has been employed to study Parkinson disease (PD); however, sparse studies reported proteome investigation after cell therapy approaches. In this study, we used liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and systems biology to identify differentially expressed proteins in a translational mouse model of PD after cell therapy. Proteins were extracted from five nigrostriatal-related brain regions of mice previously lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra. Protein expression was compared in non-grafted brain to 1 and 7 days after intranigral grafting of E12.5 embryonic ventral mesencephalon (VM). We found a total of 277 deregulated proteins after transplantation, which are enriched for lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and PD, thus confirming that our animal model is similar to human PD and that the presence of grafted cells modulates the expression of these proteins. Notably, seven proteins (Acta1, Atp6v1e1, Eci3, Lypla2, Pip4k2a, Sccpdh, and Sh3gl2) were commonly down-regulated after engraftment in all studied brain regions. These proteins are known to be involved in the formation of lipids and recycling of dopamine (DA) vesicle at the synapse. Moreover, intranigral transplantation of VM cells decreased the expression of proteins related to oxidative stress, especially in the nigrostriatal pathway containing the DA grafted neurons. In the same regions, an up-regulation of several proteins including α-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase was observed, whereas expression of tetraspanin 7 was shut down. Overall, these results suggest that intranigral transplantation of VM tissue in an animal model of PD may induce a decrease of oxidative stress in the nigrostriatal pathway and a restoration of the machinery of neurotransmitters, particularly DA release to promote DA transmission through a decrease of D2 DA receptors endocytosis. Identification of new mechanistic elements involved in the nigrostriatal reconstruction process, using translational animal models and systems biology, is a promising approach to enhance the repair of this pathway in PD patients undergoing cell therapy.</p>

<p>The quality and quantity of training data are crucial to the performance of a deep-learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. However, it is not practical to record EEG data over several long calibration sessions. A promising time- and cost-efficient solution is artificial data generation or data augmentation (DA). Here, we proposed a DA method for the motor imagery (MI) EEG signal called brain-area-recombination (BAR). For the BAR, each sample was first separated into two ones (named half-sample) by left/right brain channels, and the artificial samples were generated by recombining the half-samples. We then designed two schemas (intra- and adaptive-subject schema) corresponding to the single- and multi-subject scenarios. Extensive experiments using the classifier of EEGnet were conducted on two public datasets under various training set sizes. In both schemas, the BAR method can make the EEGnet have a better performance of classification (p &lt; 0.01). To make a comparative investigation, we selected two common DA methods (noise-added and flipping), and the BAR method beat them (p &lt; 0.05). Further, using the proposed BAR for augmentation, EEGnet achieved up to 8.3% improvement than a typical decoding algorithm CSP-SVM (p &lt; 0.01), note that both the models were trained on the augmented dataset. This study shows that BAR usage can significantly improve the classification ability of deep learning to MI-EEG signals. To a certain extent, it may promote the development of deep learning technology in the field of BCI.</p>

<p>Developmental Coordination Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder are unique neurodevelopmental disorders with overlaps in executive functions and motor control. The conditions co-occur in up to 50% of cases, raising questions of the pathological mechanisms of DCD versus ADHD. Few studies have examined these overlaps in adults with DCD and/or ADHD. Therefore, to provide insights about executive functions and motor control between adults with DCD, ADHD, both conditions (DCD + ADHD), or typically developed controls, this study used a stop-signal task and parallel EEG measurement. We assessed executive performance via go accuracy and go reaction time, as well as motor response inhibition via stop-signal reaction time. This was complemented with analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). Based on existing investigations of adults with DCD or ADHD, we expected (1) groups would not differ in behavioral performance on stop and go trials, but (2) differences in ERPs, particularly in components N200 (index of cognitive control) and P300 (index of attention and inhibition) would be evident. The sample included N = 50 adults with DCD (n = 12), ADHD (n = 9), DCD + ADHD (n = 7), and control participants (n = 22). We replicated that there were no between-group differences for behavioral-level executive performance and motor response inhibition. However, on a physiological level, ERP components N200 and P300 differed between groups, particularly during successful response inhibition. These ERPs reflect potential endophenotypic differences not evident in overt behavior of participants with ADHD and/or DCD. This suggests a disorder specific employment of inhibition or general executive functions in groups of adults with DCD, DCD + ADHD, ADHD, or control participants.</p>

<p>The lateralized ERP N2pc component has been shown to be an effective marker of attentional object selection when elicited in a visual search task, specifically reflecting the selection of a target item among distractors. Moreover, when targets are known in advance, the visual search process is guided by representations of target features held in working memory at the time of search, thus guiding attention to objects with target-matching features. Previous studies have shown that manipulating working memory availability via concurrent tasks or within task manipulations influences visual search performance and the N2pc. Other studies have indicated that visual (non-spatial) vs. spatial working memory manipulations have differential contributions to visual search. To investigate this the current study assesses participants' visual and spatial working memory ability independent of the visual search task to determine whether such individual differences in working memory affect task performance and the N2pc. Participants (n = 205) completed a visual search task to elicit the N2pc and separate visual working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SPWM) assessments. Greater SPWM, but not VWM, ability is correlated with and predicts higher visual search accuracy and greater N2pc amplitudes. Neither VWM nor SPWM was related to N2pc latency. These results provide additional support to prior behavioral and neural visual search findings that spatial WM availability, whether as an ability of the participant's processing system or based on task demands, plays an important role in efficient visual search.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a clinically effective tool for treating medically refractory Parkinson’s disease (PD), but its neural mechanisms remain debated. Previous work has demonstrated that STN DBS results in evoked potentials (EPs) in the primary motor cortex (M1), suggesting that modulation of cortical physiology may be involved in its therapeutic effects. Due to technical challenges presented by high-amplitude DBS artifacts, these EPs are often measured in response to low-frequency stimulation, which is generally ineffective at PD symptom management. This study aims to characterize STN-to-cortex EPs seen during clinically relevant high-frequency STN DBS for PD. Intraoperatively, we applied STN DBS to 6 PD patients while recording electrocorticography (ECoG) from an electrode strip over the ipsilateral central sulcus. Using recently published techniques, we removed large stimulation artifacts to enable quantification of STN-to-cortex EPs. Two cortical EPs were observed – one synchronized with DBS onset and persisting during ongoing stimulation, and one immediately following DBS offset, here termed the “start” and the “end” EPs respectively. The start EP is, to our knowledge, the first long-latency cortical EP reported during ongoing high-frequency DBS. The start and end EPs differ in magnitude (p &lt; 0.05) and latency (p &lt; 0.001), and the end, but not the start, EP magnitude has a significant relationship (p &lt; 0.001, adjusted for random effects of subject) to ongoing high gamma (80–150 Hz) power during the EP. These contrasts may suggest mechanistic or circuit differences in EP production during the two time periods. This represents a potential framework for relating DBS clinical efficacy to the effects of a variety of stimulation parameters on EPs.</p>

<p>Among many artificial neural networks, the research on Spike Neural Network (SNN), which mimics the energy-efficient signal system in the brain, is drawing much attention. Memristor is a promising candidate as a synaptic component for hardware implementation of SNN, but several non-ideal device properties are making it challengeable. In this work, we conducted an SNN simulation by adding a device model with a non-linear weight update to test the impact on SNN performance. We found that SNN has a strong tolerance for the device non-linearity and the network can keep the accuracy high if a device meets one of the two conditions: 1. symmetric LTP and LTD curves and 2. positive non-linearity factors for both LTP and LTD. The reason was analyzed in terms of the balance between network parameters as well as the variability of weight. The results are considered to be a piece of useful prior information for the future implementation of emerging device-based neuromorphic hardware.</p>

<p>Visual selection in primates is intricately linked to eye movements, which are generated by a network of cortical and subcortical neural circuits. When visual selection is performed covertly, without foveating eye movements toward the selected targets, a class of fixational eye movements, called microsaccades, is still involved. Microsaccades are small saccades that occur when maintaining precise gaze fixation on a stationary point, and they exhibit robust modulations in peripheral cueing paradigms used to investigate covert visual selection mechanisms. These modulations consist of changes in both microsaccade directions and frequencies after cue onsets. Over the past two decades, the properties and functional implications of these modulations have been heavily studied, revealing a potentially important role for microsaccades in mediating covert visual selection effects. However, the neural mechanisms underlying cueing effects on microsaccades are only beginning to be investigated. Here we review the available causal manipulation evidence for these effects’ cortical and subcortical substrates. In the superior colliculus (SC), activity representing peripheral visual cues strongly influences microsaccade direction, but not frequency, modulations. In the cortical frontal eye fields (FEF), activity only compensates for early reflexive effects of cues on microsaccades. Using evidence from behavior, theoretical modeling, and preliminary lesion data from the primary visual cortex and microstimulation data from the lower brainstem, we argue that the early reflexive microsaccade effects arise subcortically, downstream of the SC. Overall, studying cueing effects on microsaccades in primates represents an important opportunity to link perception, cognition, and action through unaddressed cortical-subcortical neural interactions. These interactions are also likely relevant in other sensory and motor modalities during other active behaviors.</p>

<p>Preservation of the excitability of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) may contribute to an improved speech perception after cochlear implantation. Thus, the application of exogenous neurotrophic factors such as the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to increase SGN survival in vitro and in vivo is a promising pharmacological approach in cochlear implant (CI) research. Due to the difficult pharmacokinetic profile of proteins such as BDNF, there is a quest for small molecules to mediate the survival of SGN or to increase the efficacy of BDNF. The C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum could be a potential new candidate for the protection and regeneration of SGN. Inhibition of the RhoA GTPase pathway which can be mediated by C3 is described as a promising strategy to enhance axonal regeneration and to exert pro-survival signals in neurons. Nanomolar concentrations of C3, its enzymatically inactive form C3<sup>E174Q</sup>, and a 26mer C-terminal peptide fragment covering amino acid 156–181 (C3<sup>156-181</sup>) potentiated the neuroprotective effect on SGN mediated by BDNF in vitro. The neuroprotective effect of C3/BDNF was reduced to the neuroprotective effect of BDNF alone after the treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K).The exoenzyme C3 (wild-type and enzyme-deficient) and the C3 peptide fragment C3<sup>154–181</sup> present novel biologically active compounds for the protection of the SGN. The exact underlying intracellular mechanisms that mediate the neuroprotective effect are not clarified yet, but the combination of BDNF (TrkB stimulation) and C3 exoenzyme (RhoA inhibition) can be used to protect SGN in vitro.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.599540">Expression of Repressor Element 1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) in Serotonin Neurons in the Adult Male Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)</a></h4>

<p>Repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe where serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurons are located. REST works as a transcription factor for the 5-HT receptor and tryptophan hydroxylase two-gene expression. We hypothesized that REST is co-expressed in 5-HT neurons, which, if demonstrated, would be useful to understand the mechanism of 5-HT dysfunction-related disorders such as negative emotions and depression. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the expression of the REST gene in the brain (forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain) of adult male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) using rt-PCR. Besides, using immunocytochemistry, co-localization of the REST gene was examined in 5-HT neurons and with neuronal-/glial-cell markers. We found a high expression of the REST gene in the midbrain region of the dorsal raphe, an area of 5-HT neurons. Double-label immunocytochemistry showed neuron-specific expression of REST co-localized in 5-HT neurons in the dorsal and ventral parts of the periventricular pretectal nucleus, paraventricular organ, and dorsal and medial raphe nucleus. Since midbrain 5-HT neurons express REST, we speculate that REST may control 5-HT neuronal activity related to negative emotions, including depression.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the growing population of elderly people, is still lacking minimally-invasive circulating biomarkers that could facilitate the diagnosis and the monitoring of disease progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as tissue-specific and/or circulating biomarkers of several age-related diseases, but evidence on AD is still not conclusive. Since a systemic pro-inflammatory status was associated with an increased risk of AD development and progression, we focused our investigation on a subset of miRNAs modulating the inflammatory process, namely inflamma-miRNAs. The expression of inflamma-miR-17-5p, -21-5p, -126-3p, and -146a-5p was analyzed in plasma samples from 116 patients with AD compared with 41 age-matched healthy control (HC) subjects. MiR-17-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-126-3p plasma levels were significantly increased in AD patients compared to HC. Importantly, a strong inverse relationship was observed between miR-21-5p and miR-126-3p, and the cognitive impairment, assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Notably, miR-126-3p was able to discriminate between mild and severe cognitive impairment. Overall, our results reinforce the hypothesis that circulating inflamma-miRNAs could be assessed as minimally invasive tools associated with the development and progression of cognitive impairment in AD.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by specific alterations of brain DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns. Age and sex, two major risk factors for AD, are also known to largely affect the epigenetic profiles in brain, but their contribution to AD-associated DNAm changes has been poorly investigated. In this study we considered publicly available DNAm datasets of four brain regions (temporal, frontal, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum) from healthy adult subjects and AD patients, and performed a meta-analysis to identify sex-, age-, and AD-associated epigenetic profiles. In one of these datasets it was also possible to distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) profiles. We showed that DNAm differences between males and females tend to be shared between the four brain regions, while aging differently affects cortical regions compared to cerebellum. We found that the proportion of sex-dependent probes whose methylation is modified also during aging is higher than expected, but that differences between males and females tend to be maintained, with only a few probes showing age-by-sex interaction. We did not find significant overlaps between AD- and sex-associated probes, nor disease-by-sex interaction effects. On the contrary, we found that AD-related epigenetic modifications are significantly enriched in probes whose DNAm varies with age and that there is a high concordance between the direction of changes (hyper or hypo-methylation) in aging and AD, supporting accelerated epigenetic aging in the disease. In summary, our results suggest that age-associated DNAm patterns concur to the epigenetic deregulation observed in AD, providing new insights on how advanced age enables neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical technique that regulates neuron activity by using internal pulse generators to electrodes in specific target areas of the brain. As a blind treatment, DBS is widely used in the field of mental and neurological diseases, although its mechanism of action is still unclear. In the past 10 years, DBS has shown a certain positive effect in animal models and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there are also different results that may be related to the stimulation parameters of DBS. Based on this, determining the optimal stimulation parameters for DBS in AD and understanding its mechanism of action are essential to promote the clinical application of DBS in AD. This review aims to explore the therapeutic effect of DBS in AD, and to analyze its stimulation parameters and potential mechanism of action. The keywords “Deep brain stimulation” and “Alzheimer's Disease” were used for systematic searches in the literature databases of Web of Science and PubMed (from 1900 to September 29, 2020). All human clinical studies and animal studies were reported in English, including individual case studies and long-term follow-up studies, were included. These studies described the therapeutic effects of DBS in AD. The results included 16 human clinical studies and 14 animal studies, of which 28 studies clearly demonstrated the positive effect of DBS in AD. We analyzed the current stimulation parameters of DBS in AD from stimulation target, stimulation frequency, stimulation start time, stimulation duration, unilateral/bilateral treatment and current intensity, etc., and we also discussed its potential mechanism of action from multiple aspects, including regulating related neural networks, promoting nerve oscillation, reducing β-amyloid and tau levels, reducing neuroinflammation, regulating the cholinergic system, inducing the synthesis of nerve growth factor.</p>

<p>The hypothalamus plays a central role in homeostasis and aging. The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) controls homeostasis of food intake and energy expenditure and retains adult neural stem cells (NSCs)/progenitor cells. Aging induces the loss of NSCs and the enhancement of inflammation, including the activation of glial cells in the ARC, but aging-associated alterations of the hypothalamic cells remain obscure. Here, we identified Sox2 and NeuN double-positive cells in a subpopulation of cells in the mouse ARC. These cells were reduced in number with aging, although NeuN-positive neuronal cells were unaltered in the total number. Diet-induced obesity mice fed with high-fat diet presented a similar hypothalamic alteration to aged mice. This study provides a new insight into aging-induced changes in the hypothalamus.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66835">tTARGIT AAVs mediate the sensitive and flexible manipulation of intersectional neuronal populations in mice</a></h4>

While Cre-dependent viral systems permit the manipulation of many neuron types, some cell populations cannot be targeted by a single DNA recombinase. Although the combined use of Flp and Cre recombinases can overcome this limitation, insufficient recombinase activity can reduce the efficacy of existing Cre+Flp-dependent viral systems. We developed a sensitive dual recombinase-activated viral approach: tTA-driven Recombinase-Guided Intersectional Targeting (tTARGIT) AAVs. tTARGIT AAVs utilize a Flp-dependent tetracycline transactivator (tTA) 'Driver' AAV and a tetracycline response element (TRE)-driven, Cre-dependent 'Payload' AAV to express the transgene of interest. We employed this system in <i>Slc17a6<sup>FlpO</sup>;Lepr<sup>Cre</sup></i> mice to manipulate LepRb neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH; LepRb<sup>VMH</sup> neurons) while omitting neighboring LepRb populations. We defined the circuitry of LepRb<sup>VMH</sup> neurons and roles for these cells in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Thus, the tTARGIT system mediates robust recombinase-sensitive transgene expression, permitting the precise manipulation of previously intractable neural populations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65845">Reformulation of an extant ATPase active site to mimic ancestral GTPase activity reveals a nucleotide base requirement for function</a></h4>

Hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates releases similar amounts of energy. However, ATP hydrolysis is typically used for energy-intensive reactions, whereas GTP hydrolysis typically functions as a switch. SpoIVA is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> sporulation. SpoIVA evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases, but the evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. We therefore reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> functioned properly as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP-bound intermediate that we report is required for polymerization. Further, incubation of SpoIVA<sup>GTPase</sup> with limiting ATP did not promote efficient polymerization. This approach revealed that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, can be critical in specific biological functions. We also present data suggesting that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation was the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA.

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are at high risk of severe COVID-19. We measured 436 circulating proteins in serial blood samples from hospitalised and non-hospitalised ESKD patients with COVID-19 (n=256 samples from 55 patients). Comparison to 51 non-infected patients revealed 221 differentially expressed proteins, with consistent results in a separate subcohort of 46 COVID-19 patients. 203 proteins were associated with clinical severity, including IL6, markers of monocyte recruitment (e.g. CCL2, CCL7), neutrophil activation (e.g. proteinase-3) and epithelial injury (e.g. KRT19). Machine learning identified predictors of severity including IL18BP, CTSD, GDF15, and KRT19. Survival analysis with joint models revealed 69 predictors of death. Longitudinal modelling with linear mixed models uncovered 32 proteins displaying different temporal profiles in severe versus non-severe disease, including integrins and adhesion molecules. These data implicate epithelial damage, innate immune activation, and leucocyte-endothelial interactions in the pathology of severe COVID-19 and provide a resource for identifying drug targets.

Regulation of RNA Polymerase II (Pol2) elongation in the promoter proximal region is an important and ubiquitous control point for gene expression in metazoans. We report that transcription of the adenovirus 5 E4 region is regulated during the release of paused Pol2 into productive elongation by recruitment of the super elongation complex (SEC), dependent on promoter H3K18/27 acetylation by CBP/p300. We also establish that this is a general transcriptional regulatory mechanism that applies to ~6% of expressed protein-coding genes in primary human airway epithelial cells. We observed that a homeostatic mechanism maintains promoter, but not enhancer H3K18/27ac in response to extensive inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyl transferase activity by the highly specific small molecule inhibitor A-485. Further, our results suggest a function for BRD4 association at enhancers in regulating paused Pol2 release at nearby promoters. Taken together, our results uncover processes regulating transcriptional elongation by promoter region histone H3 acetylation and homeostatic maintenance of promoter, but not enhancer, H3K18/27ac in response to inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyl transferase activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63258">Extra-cellular matrix in multicellular aggregates acts as a pressure sensor controlling cell proliferation and motility</a></h4>

Imposed deformations play an important role in morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis, both in normal and pathological conditions. To perceive mechanical perturbations of different types and magnitudes, tissues need appropriate detectors, with a compliance that matches the perturbation amplitude. By comparing results of selective osmotic compressions of CT26 cells within multicellular aggregates and global aggregate compressions, we show that global compressions have a strong impact on the aggregates growth and internal cell motility, while selective compressions of same magnitude have almost no effect. Both compressions alter the volume of individual cells in the same way over a shor-timescale, but, by draining the water out of the extracellular matrix, the global one imposes a residual compressive mechanical stress on the cells over a long-timescale, while the selective one does not. We conclude that the extracellular matrix is as a sensor that mechanically regulates cell proliferation and migration in a 3D environment.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62403">Decoding the physical principles of two-component biomolecular phase separation</a></h4>

Cells possess a multiplicity of non-membrane-bound compartments, which form via liquid-liquid phase separation. These condensates assemble and dissolve as needed to enable central cellular functions. One important class of condensates is those composed of two associating polymer species that form one-to-one specific bonds. What are the physical principles that underlie phase separation in such systems? To address this question, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how the phase boundaries depend on polymer valence, stoichiometry, and binding strength. We discovered a striking phenomenon – for sufficiently strong binding, phase separation is suppressed at rational polymer stoichiometries, which we termed the magic-ratio effect. We further developed an analytical dimer-gel theory that confirmed the magic-ratio effect and disentangled the individual roles of polymer properties in shaping the phase diagram. Our work provides new insights into the factors controlling the phase diagrams of biomolecular condensates, with implications for natural and synthetic systems.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62046">Single-molecule view of coordination in a multi-functional DNA polymerase</a></h4>

Replication and repair of genomic DNA requires the actions of multiple enzymatic functions that must be coordinated in order to ensure efficient and accurate product formation. Here, we have used single-molecule FRET microscopy to investigate the physical basis of functional coordination in DNA polymerase I (Pol I) from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, a key enzyme involved in lagging-strand replication and base excision repair. Pol I contains active sites for template-directed DNA polymerization and 5’ flap processing in separate domains. We show that a DNA substrate can spontaneously transfer between polymerase and 5’ nuclease domains during a single encounter with Pol I. Additionally, we show that the flexibly tethered 5’ nuclease domain adopts different positions within Pol I-DNA complexes, depending on the nature of the DNA substrate. Our results reveal the structural dynamics that underlie functional coordination in Pol I and are likely relevant to other multi-functional DNA polymerases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59540">A gradient of Wnt activity positions the neurosensory domains of the inner ear</a></h4>

The auditory and vestibular organs of the inner ear and the neurons that innervate them originate from Sox2-positive and Notch-active neurosensory domains specified at early stages of otic development. Sox2 is initially present throughout the otic placode and otocyst, then it becomes progressively restricted to a ventro-medial domain. Using gain and loss-of-function approaches in the chicken otocyst, we show that these early changes in Sox2 expression are regulated in a dose-dependent manner by Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Both high and very low levels of Wnt activity repress Sox2 and neurosensory competence. However, intermediate levels allow the maintenance of Sox2 expression and sensory organ formation. We propose that a dorso-ventral (high-to-low) gradient and wave of Wnt activity initiated at the dorsal rim of the otic placode progressively restricts Sox2 and Notch activity to the ventral half of the otocyst, thereby positioning the neurosensory competent domains in the inner ear.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57241">The dimeric Golgi protein Gorab binds to Sas6 as a monomer to mediate centriole duplication</a></h4>

The duplication and 9-fold symmetry of the Drosophila centriole requires that the cartwheel molecule, Sas6, physically associates with Gorab, a trans-Golgi component. How Gorab achieves these disparate associations is unclear. Here we use hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to define Gorab's interacting surfaces that mediate its sub-cellular localization. We identify a core stabilization sequence within Gorab's C-terminal coiled-coil domain that enables homodimerization, binding to Rab6, and thereby trans-Golgi localization. By contrast, part of the Gorab monomer's coiled-coil domain undergoes an anti-parallel interaction with a segment of the parallel coiled-coil dimer of Sas6. This stable hetero-trimeric complex can be visualized by electron microscopy. Mutation of a single leucine residue in Sas6's Gorab-binding domain generates a Sas6 variant with a 16-fold reduced binding affinity for Gorab that can not support centriole duplication. Thus Gorab dimers at the Golgi exist in equilibrium with Sas-6 associated monomers at the centriole to balance Gorab's dual role.

<p>by Simon Rogers, Virgilio L. Lew</p>

Human red blood cells (RBCs) have a circulatory lifespan of about four months. Under constant oxidative and mechanical stress, but devoid of organelles and deprived of biosynthetic capacity for protein renewal, RBCs undergo substantial homeostatic changes, progressive densification followed by late density reversal among others, changes assumed to have been harnessed by evolution to sustain the rheological competence of the RBCs for as long as possible. The unknown mechanisms by which this is achieved are the subject of this investigation. Each RBC traverses capillaries between 1000 and 2000 times per day, roughly one transit per minute. A dedicated Lifespan model of RBC homeostasis was developed as an extension of the RCM introduced in the previous paper to explore the cumulative patterns predicted for repetitive capillary transits over a standardized lifespan period of 120 days, using experimental data to constrain the range of acceptable model outcomes. Capillary transits were simulated by periods of elevated cell/medium volume ratios and by transient deformation-induced permeability changes attributed to PIEZO1 channel mediation as outlined in the previous paper. The first unexpected finding was that quantal density changes generated during single capillary transits cease accumulating after a few days and cannot account for the observed progressive densification of RBCs on their own, thus ruling out the quantal hypothesis. The second unexpected finding was that the documented patterns of RBC densification and late reversal could only be emulated by the implementation of a strict time-course of decay in the activities of the calcium and Na/K pumps, suggestive of a selective mechanism enabling the extended longevity of RBCs. The densification pattern over most of the circulatory lifespan was determined by calcium pump decay whereas late density reversal was shaped by the pattern of Na/K pump decay. A third finding was that both quantal changes and pump-decay regimes were necessary to account for the documented lifespan pattern, neither sufficient on their own. A fourth new finding revealed that RBCs exposed to levels of PIEZO1-medited calcium permeation above certain thresholds in the circulation could develop a pattern of early or late hyperdense collapse followed by delayed density reversal. When tested over much reduced lifespan periods the results reproduced the known circulatory fate of irreversible sickle cells, the cell subpopulation responsible for vaso-occlusion and for most of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease. Analysis of the results provided an insightful new understanding of the mechanisms driving the changes in RBC homeostasis during circulatory aging in health and disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t3t9xj5o4Hw" width="1" />

<p>by Joseph H. R. Hetmanski, Matthew C. Jones, Fatima Chunara, Jean-Marc Schwartz, Patrick T. Caswell</p>

Cell migration in 3D microenvironments is a complex process which depends on the coordinated activity of leading edge protrusive force and rear retraction in a push-pull mechanism. While the potentiation of protrusions has been widely studied, the precise signalling and mechanical events that lead to retraction of the cell rear are much less well understood, particularly in physiological 3D extra-cellular matrix (ECM). We previously discovered that rear retraction in fast moving cells is a highly dynamic process involving the precise spatiotemporal interplay of mechanosensing by caveolae and signalling through RhoA. To further interrogate the dynamics of rear retraction, we have adopted three distinct mathematical modelling approaches here based on (i) Boolean logic, (ii) deterministic kinetic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and (iii) stochastic simulations. The aims of this multi-faceted approach are twofold: firstly to derive new biological insight into cell rear dynamics via generation of testable hypotheses and predictions; and secondly to compare and contrast the distinct modelling approaches when used to describe the same, relatively under-studied system. Overall, our modelling approaches complement each other, suggesting that such a multi-faceted approach is more informative than methods based on a single modelling technique to interrogate biological systems. Whilst Boolean logic was not able to fully recapitulate the complexity of rear retraction signalling, an ODE model could make plausible population level predictions. Stochastic simulations added a further level of complexity by accurately mimicking previous experimental findings and acting as a single cell simulator. Our approach highlighted the unanticipated role for CDK1 in rear retraction, a prediction we confirmed experimentally. Moreover, our models led to a novel prediction regarding the potential existence of a ‘set point’ in local stiffness gradients that promotes polarisation and rapid rear retraction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NOaeEllHNyg" width="1" />

Pacemaking dysfunction (PD) may result in heart rhythm disorders, syncope or even death. Current treatment of PD using implanted electronic pacemaker has some limitations, such as finite battery life and the risk of repeated surgery. As such, the biological pacemaker has been proposed as a potential alternative to the electronic pacemaker for PD treatment. Experimentally and computationally, it has been shown that bio-engineered pacemaker cells can be generated from non-rhythmic ventricular myocytes (VMs) by knocking out genes related to the inward rectifier potassium channel current (I<sub>K1</sub>) or by overexpressing hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel genes responsible for the “funny” current (I<sub>f</sub>). However, it is unclear if a bio-engineered pacemaker based on the modification of I<sub>K1</sub>- and I<sub>f</sub>-related channels simultaneously would enhance the ability and stability of bio-engineered pacemaking action potentials. In this study, the possible mechanism (s) responsible for VMs to generate spontaneous pacemaking activity by regulating I<sub>K1</sub> and I<sub>f</sub> density were investigated by a computational approach. Our results showed that there was a reciprocal interaction between I<sub>K1</sub> and I<sub>f</sub> in ventricular pacemaker model. The effect of I<sub>K1</sub> depression on generating ventricular pacemaker was mono-phasic while that of I<sub>f</sub> augmentation was bi-phasic. A moderate increase of I<sub>f</sub> promoted pacemaking activity but excessive increase of I<sub>f</sub> resulted in a slowdown in the pacemaking rate and even an unstable pacemaking state. The dedicated interplay between I<sub>K1</sub> and I<sub>f</sub> in generating stable pacemaking and dysrhythmias was evaluated. Finally, a theoretical analysis in the I<sub>K1</sub>/I<sub>f</sub> parameter space for generating pacemaking action potentials in different states was provided. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides a wide theoretical insight into understandings for generating stable and robust pacemaker cells from non-pacemaking VMs by the interplay of I<sub>K1</sub> and I<sub>f</sub>, which may be helpful in designing engineered biological pacemakers for application purposes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/siZGyq05YEc" width="1" />

Bacterial opportunistic human pathogens frequently exhibit intrinsic antibiotic tolerance and resistance, resulting in infections that can be nearly impossible to eradicate. We asked whether this recalcitrance could be driven by these organisms’ evolutionary history as environmental microbes that engage in chemical warfare. Using <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> as a model, we demonstrate that the self-produced antibiotic pyocyanin (PYO) activates defenses that confer collateral tolerance specifically to structurally similar synthetic clinical antibiotics. Non-PYO-producing opportunistic pathogens, such as members of the <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex, likewise display elevated antibiotic tolerance when cocultured with PYO-producing strains. Furthermore, by widening the population bottleneck that occurs during antibiotic selection and promoting the establishment of a more diverse range of mutant lineages, PYO increases apparent rates of mutation to antibiotic resistance to a degree that can rival clinically relevant hypermutator strains. Together, these results reveal an overlooked mechanism by which opportunistic pathogens that produce natural toxins can dramatically modulate the efficacy of clinical antibiotics and the evolution of antibiotic resistance, both for themselves and other members of clinically relevant polymicrobial communities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sZfpVaR26SM" width="1" />

Daily rhythms are disrupted in patients with mood disorders. The lateral habenula (LHb) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contribute to circadian timekeeping and regulate mood. Thus, pathophysiology in these nuclei may be responsible for aberrations in daily rhythms during mood disorders. Using the 15-day chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm and in vitro slice electrophysiology, we measured the effects of stress on diurnal rhythms in firing of LHb cells projecting to the DRN (cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup>) and unlabeled DRN cells. We also performed optogenetic experiments to investigate if increased firing in cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup> during exposure to a weak 7-day social defeat stress (SDS) paradigm induces stress-susceptibility. Last, we investigated whether exposure to CSDS affected the ability of mice to photoentrain to a new light–dark (LD) cycle. The cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup> and unlabeled DRN cells of stress-susceptible mice express greater blunted diurnal firing compared to stress-näive (control) and stress-resilient mice. Daytime optogenetic activation of cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup> during SDS induces stress-susceptibility which shows the direct correlation between increased activity in this circuit and putative mood disorders. Finally, we found that stress-susceptible mice are slower, while stress-resilient mice are faster, at photoentraining to a new LD cycle. Our findings suggest that exposure to strong stressors induces blunted daily rhythms in firing in cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup>, DRN cells and decreases the initial rate of photoentrainment in susceptible-mice. In contrast, resilient-mice may undergo homeostatic adaptations that maintain daily rhythms in firing in cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup> and also show rapid photoentrainment to a new LD cycle.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/th3sChYCH5s" width="1" />

The diabetic retinopathy in the diurnal rodent Psammomys obesus is manifested by a functional and structural dysfunction. The functional alteration detected by the decrease in the amplitude of the ERG components over time following the diabetic induction. Whereas the structural dysfunction is evinced by the disruption of retinal architecture and the appearance of exudates at an advanced stage of the disease progression as well as the decrease of the retinal thinness.







Abstract
To investigate the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a new diurnal animal model, we monitored clinically the DR in Psammomys obesus (P. obesus) during 7 months using electroretinography (ERG) and imaging techniques. After the onset of DR, all ERG components decreased progressively. In scotopic conditions, by 3‐months of disease progression, the diabetic P. obesus displayed a significant decrease in amplitude of b‐max, b‐wave responses, and mixed b‐waves. While mixed a‐wave decreased between 4 and 7 months. Significant differences of OP2 appeared following 1 month of disease. In photopic conditions, we noticed a decrease in the a‐wave at 2 months, while it took more than 5 months in b‐wave amplitude. The photopic negative response (PhNR) and the i‐wave amplitudes decreased following 4 and 5 months. OP1 and OP2 were the first to be altered and a significant decrease in the amplitude started after 3 months. Finally, 30 Hz‐flicker and photopic S‐cone were impaired after 2 and 3 months, respectively. The assessment of the eye fundus of the retina revealed an abnormal vascular architecture appeared at Months 6 and 7. In addition, we noticed exudates in the superior periphery of the retina at the same stage. The retina thickness showed a significant reduction at Month 7. Our results indicate that the clinical correlates of human DR are present in diabetic P. obesus. The depressed of ERGs, disruption of retinal architecture, and the appearance of exudates may reflect vascular and neuronal damage throughout the retina as are seen in the advanced stages of human DR.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Assessment of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) could provide valuable insights into self-perceived health status. Although they are considered additional endpoints in future clinical trials, determinants and interactions of different PROMs in early disease stages remain largely unknown. The aims of the present study were to evaluate health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and physical activity in mildly to moderately affected SCA3 patients and to examine interrelations between these PROMs and objective disease severity indices. Twenty SCA3 patients and twenty healthy controls of comparable age and sex completed the EQ-5D-5L, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Profile of Mood States, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Disease severity was quantified by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS). Mildly to moderately affected SCA3 patients reported lower quality of life (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.049), more depressive symptoms (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.028), and higher levels of fatigue (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.001) than healthy controls. The amount of physical activity did not differ between both groups. Linear regression analyses revealed that quality of life was primarily determined by fatigue and not by ataxia severity, while physical activity was independently associated with SARA score and INAS count but not fatigue. Depressive symptoms were related to disease duration and fatigue but not to markers of motor disease progression. Taken together, decreased quality of life, increased levels of fatigue, and a higher number of depressive symptoms do not merely reflect motor impairment in early-to-middle-stage SCA3 patients. The observed discordance between patient-reported and clinician-based outcomes indicates that these measures genuinely evaluate distinct aspects of disease and emphasizes their complementariness in therapeutic trials. By contrast, the volume of self-reported physical activity is not associated with fatigue, reflects both ataxia severity and extracerebellar involvement, and could therefore represent a useful marker of motor impairment in a home setting.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A total of 28 studies describing the development of 34 models and the external validation of 19 models were included. The outcomes concerned were ALS progression (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 12; 35%), change in weight (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 1; 3%), respiratory insufficiency (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 2; 6%), and survival (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 19; 56%). Among the models predicting ALS progression or survival, the most frequently used predictors were age, ALS Functional Rating Scale/ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, site of onset, and disease duration. The modelling method adopted most was machine learning (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 16; 47%). Most of the models (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 25; 74%) were not presented. Discrimination and calibration were assessed in 12 (35%) and 2 (6%) models, respectively. Only one model by Westeneng et al. (Lancet Neurol 17:423–433, 2018) was assessed with overall low risk of bias and it performed well in both discrimination and calibration, suggesting a relatively reliable model for practice.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and healthy adults demonstrate similar levels of visuomotor adaptation provided that the distortion is small or introduced gradually, and hence, implicit processes are engaged. Recently, implicit processes underlying visuomotor adaptation in healthy individuals have been proposed to include proprioceptive recalibration (i.e., shifts in one’s proprioceptive sense of felt hand position to match the visual estimate of their hand experienced during reaches with altered visual feedback of the hand). In the current study, we asked if proprioceptive recalibration is preserved in PD patients. PD patients tested during their “off” and “on” medication states and age-matched healthy controls reached to visual targets, while visual feedback of their unseen hand was gradually rotated 30° clockwise or translated 4 cm rightwards of their actual hand trajectory. As expected, PD patients and controls produced significant reach aftereffects, indicating visuomotor adaptation after reaching with the gradually introduced visuomotor distortions. More importantly, following visuomotor adaptation, both patients and controls showed recalibration in hand position estimates, and the magnitude of this recalibration was comparable between PD patients and controls. No differences for any measures assessed were observed across medication status (i.e., PD off vs PD on). Results reveal that patients are able to adjust their sensorimotor mappings and recalibrate proprioception following adaptation to a gradually introduced visuomotor distortion, and that dopaminergic intervention does not affect this proprioceptive recalibration. These results suggest that proprioceptive recalibration does not involve striatal dopaminergic pathways and may contribute to the preserved visuomotor adaptation that arises implicitly in PD patients.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Robotic devices can be engaged actively or passively to unload arm weight or impose additional loading. The conditions of variable loading and unloading offer an opportunity to investigate motor performance of the arm affected by a stroke. The objective of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of the proximal arm impairment and passive weight compensation on shoulder flexion performance in the sagittal plane after stroke. Twenty-eight participants (age 57 ± 10 years, 21/28 ≤ 6 weeks post-stroke) played a shoulder flexion game under five standardized weight compensation configurations provided by the Armeo<sup class="a-plus-plus">®</sup>Spring exoskeleton. Percent of targets acquired and root mean square error were calculated to derive three behavioral and three kinematic outcomes: total score/overall error (loading/unloading conditions and five configurations combined), loading and unloading score/error (five configurations combined), and weight compensation configuration score/error for each setting separately. The total score was positively related and the overall error was negatively related to proximal arm impairment (Fugl–Meyer upper extremity movement subscale, maximum 30, FM30). The unloading score (80 ± 27%) and error (5 ± 4°) were significantly better than the loading score (45 ± 38%, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01) and error (14± 9°, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01) with improvements most pronounced in the mid-range of FM30 (4–15 points). The configuration scores/error gradually improved with each increment in unloading for the mid-range FM30 participants, while only error improved in those with low FM30. In conclusion, shoulder flexion performance depends on proximal arm impairment, but it is also influenced by the degree of unloading/loading provided, particularly among individuals with moderate paresis after stroke.</p>

<p>This case-control study is aimed to investigate the correlation of altered functional connectivity (FC) in cerebellum with cognitive impairment in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The morphometric and resting-state FC MRI analysis including 46 participants with AD, 32 with aMCI and 42 age-matched normal controls (NCs) were conducted. We compared the cerebellar gray matter volume and cerebellar FC with cerebral cortical regions among three groups. To investigate the relationship of cerebellar FC with cognition, we measure the correlation of significant altered FC and individual cognitive domain. No significant morphometric differences of cerebellum was observed across three groups. The patients with AD had weaker cerebral cortical FCs in bilateral Crus I and left VIIb compared to NCs, and in bilateral Crus I compared to patients with aMCI. For patients with aMCI, the weaker FC were found between right Crus I, left VIIb and cerebral cortical regions compared to NCs. The strength of left cerebellar FC positively correlated with specific cognitive subdomains, including memory, executive function, visuospatial function, and global cognition in AD and aMCI. These findings demonstrated the alteration of cerebellar FC with cerebral cortical regions, and the correlation of cerebellar FC and cognitive impairment in AD and aMCI.</p>

<p>L-DOPA is the criterion standard of treatment for Parkinson disease. Although it alleviates some of the Parkinsonian symptoms, long-term treatment induces L-DOPA–induced dyskinesia (LID). Several theoretical models including the firing rate model, the firing pattern model, and the ensemble model are proposed to explain the mechanisms of LID. The “firing rate model” proposes that decreasing the mean firing rates of the output nuclei of basal ganglia (BG) including the globus pallidus internal segment and substantia nigra reticulata, along the BG pathways, induces dyskinesia. The “firing pattern model” claimed that abnormal firing pattern of a single unit activity and local field potentials may disturb the information processing in the BG, resulting in dyskinesia. The “ensemble model” described that dyskinesia symptoms might represent a distributed impairment involving many brain regions, but the number of activated neurons in the striatum correlated most strongly with dyskinesia severity. Extensive evidence for circuit mechanisms in driving LID symptoms has also been presented. LID is a multisystem disease that affects wide areas of the brain. Brain regions including the striatum, the pallidal–subthalamic network, the motor cortex, the thalamus, and the cerebellum are all involved in the pathophysiology of LID. In addition, although both amantadine and deep brain stimulation help reduce LID, these approaches have complications that limit their wide use, and a novel antidyskinetic drug is strongly needed; these require us to understand the circuit mechanism of LID more deeply.</p>

<p>The practice of mathematical word problem is ubiquitous and thought to impact academic achievement. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigate how lexical consistency of word problem description is modulated in adults' brain responses during word problem solution. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging methods, we examined compare word problems that included relational statements, such as “A dumpling costs 9 dollars. A wonton is 2 dollars less than a dumpling. How much does a wonton cost?” and manipulated lexical consistency (consistent: the relational term consistent with the operation to be performed, e.g., more—addition/inconsistent: e.g., less—addition) and problem operation (addition/subtraction). We found a consistency by operation interaction in the widespread fronto-insular-parietal activations, including the anterior insula, dorsoanterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus, such that inconsistent problems engaged stronger activations than consistent problems for addition, whereas the consistency effect was inverse for subtraction. Critically, these results were more salient in the less successful problem solvers than their more successful peers. Our study is the first to demonstrate that lexical consistency effects on arithmetic neural networks are modulated during reading word problem that required distinct arithmetic operations. More broadly, our study has strong potentials to add linkage between neuroscience and education by remediating deficits and enhance instruction design in the school curriculum.</p>

<p>Stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) is a method that uses stereotactically implanted depth electrodes for extra-operative mapping of epileptogenic and functional networks. sEEG derived functional mapping is achieved using electrical cortical stimulations (ECS) that are currently the gold standard for delineating eloquent cortex. As this stands true especially for primary cortices (e.g., visual, sensitive, motor, etc.), ECS applied to higher order brain areas determine more subtle behavioral responses. While anterior and posterior language areas in the dorsal language stream seem to share characteristics with primary cortices, basal temporal language area (BTLA) in the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) behaves as a highly associative cortex. After a short introduction and considerations about methodological aspects of ECS using sEEG, we review the sEEG language mapping literature in this perspective. We first establish the validity of this technique to map indispensable language cortices in the dorsal language stream. Second, we highlight the contrast between the growing empirical ECS experience and the lack of understanding regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying ECS behavioral effects, especially concerning the dispensable language cortex in the VTC. Evidences for considering network architecture as determinant for ECS behavioral response complexities are discussed. Further, we address the importance of designing new research in network organization of language as this could enhance ECS ability to map interindividual variability, pathology driven reorganization, and ultimately identify network resilience markers in order to better predict post-operative language deficit. Finally, based on a whole body of available studies, we believe there is strong evidence to consider sEEG as a valid, safe and reliable method for defining eloquent language cortices although there have been no proper comparisons between surgical resections with or without extra-operative or intra-operative language mapping.</p>

<p>Mental imagery of movement is a potentially valuable rehabilitation task, but its therapeutic efficacy may depend on the specific cognitive strategy employed. Individuals use two main strategies to perform the hand mental rotation task (HMRT), which involves determining whether a visual image depicts a left or right hand. One is the motor imagery (MI) strategy, which involves mentally simulating one’s own hand movements. In this case, task performance as measured by response time (RT) is subject to a medial–lateral effect wherein the RT is reduced when the fingertips are directed medially, presumably as the actual motion would be easier. The other strategy is to employ visual imagery (VI), which involves mentally rotating the picture and is not subject to this medial–lateral effect. The rehabilitative benefits of the HMRT are thought to depend on the MI strategy (mental practice), so it is essential to examine the effects of individual factors such as age, image perspective (e.g., palm or back of the hand), and innate ability (as indicated by baseline RT) on the strategy adopted. When presented with pictures of the palm, all subjects in the current study used the MI strategy, regardless of age and ability. In contrast, when subjects were presented with pictures of the back of the hand, the VI strategy predominated among the young age group regardless of performance, while the strategy used by middle-age and elderly groups depended on performance ability. In the middle-age and elderly groups, the VI approach predominated in those with high performance skill, whereas the MI strategy predominated among those with low performance skill. Thus, higher-skill middle-aged and elderly individuals may not necessarily form a motion image during the HMRT, potentially limiting rehabilitation efficacy.</p>

<p>The increasingly popular application of AI runs the risk of amplifying social bias, such as classifying non-white faces as animals. Recent research has largely attributed this bias to the training data implemented. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood; therefore, strategies to rectify the bias are unresolved. Here, we examined a typical deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), VGG-Face, which was trained with a face dataset consisting of more white faces than black and Asian faces. The transfer learning result showed significantly better performance in identifying white faces, similar to the well-known social bias in humans, the other-race effect (ORE). To test whether the effect resulted from the imbalance of face images, we retrained the VGG-Face with a dataset containing more Asian faces, and found a reverse ORE that the newly-trained VGG-Face preferred Asian faces over white faces in identification accuracy. Additionally, when the number of Asian faces and white faces were matched in the dataset, the DCNN did not show any bias. To further examine how imbalanced image input led to the ORE, we performed a representational similarity analysis on VGG-Face's activation. We found that when the dataset contained more white faces, the representation of white faces was more distinct, indexed by smaller in-group similarity and larger representational Euclidean distance. That is, white faces were scattered more sparsely in the representational face space of the VGG-Face than the other faces. Importantly, the distinctiveness of faces was positively correlated with identification accuracy, which explained the ORE observed in the VGG-Face. In summary, our study revealed the mechanism underlying the ORE in DCNNs, which provides a novel approach to studying AI ethics. In addition, the face multidimensional representation theory discovered in humans was also applicable to DCNNs, advocating for future studies to apply more cognitive theories to understand DCNNs' behavior.</p>

<p>Aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) is the major component of Lewy bodies and neurites in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related α-synucleinopathies. Some α-syn mutations (e.g., A53T) in familial PD recapitulate the α-syn pathology in transgenic mice, which supports the importance of pathologic α-syn in driving the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) is a receptor of α-syn fibrils facilitating pathologic α-syn spread; however, the role of Lag3 in mediating the pathogenesis in α-syn transgenic mice is not clear. Here, we report that depletion of Lag3 in human α-syn A53T transgenic (hA53T) mice significantly reduces the level of detergent-insoluble α-syn aggregates and phosphorylated ser129 α-syn, and inhibits activation of microglia and astrocytes. The absence of Lag3 significantly delays disease progression and reduces the behavioral deficits in hA53T transgenic mice leading to prolonged survival. Taken together, these results show that Lag3 contributes to the pathogenesis in the α-syn A53T transgenic mouse model.</p>

<p>Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are main players in the brain to ensure ion and neurotransmitter homeostasis, metabolic supply, and fast action potential propagation in axons. These functions are fostered by the formation of large syncytia in which mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are directly coupled. Panglial networks constitute on connexin-based gap junctions in the membranes of neighboring cells that allow the passage of ions, metabolites, and currents. However, these networks are not uniform but exhibit a brain region-dependent heterogeneous connectivity influencing electrical communication and intercellular ion spread. Here, we describe different approaches to analyze gap junctional communication in acute tissue slices that can be implemented easily in most electrophysiology and imaging laboratories. These approaches include paired recordings, determination of syncytial isopotentiality, tracer coupling followed by analysis of network topography, and wide field imaging of ion sensitive dyes. These approaches are capable to reveal cellular heterogeneity causing electrical isolation of functional circuits, reduced ion-transfer between different cell types, and anisotropy of tracer coupling. With a selective or combinatory use of these methods, the results will shed light on cellular properties of glial cells and their contribution to neuronal function.</p>

The gait features of all patients were evaluated and classified as one of the following: freezing of gait, wide-based gait, short-stepped gait, shuffling gait, instability, gait festination, difficulty in changing direction, and balance disorder in standing up. All gait features of 68 healthy elderlies were treated as normal. Trunk acceleration was recorded automatically by a smartphone placed on the umbilicus during a 15-foot walking test. Two novel indices were created. The first index was a trunk acceleration index, which was defined as (forward acceleration fluctuation) + (vertical acceleration fluctuation) – (lateral acceleration fluctuation) based on the multivariate logistics regression model, and the second index was created by multiplying the forward acceleration with the vertical acceleration. Additionally, 95% confidence ellipsoid volume of the three-dimensional accelerations was assessed.</p><p>Results: Forward and vertical acceleration fluctuations were significantly associated with the probability of an iNPH-specific pathological gait. The trunk acceleration index demonstrated the strongest association with the probability of an iNPH-specific pathological gait. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for detecting 100% probability of an iNPH-specific pathological gait were 86.9% for forward acceleration fluctuation, 88.0% for vertical acceleration fluctuation, 82.8% for lateral acceleration fluctuation, 89.0% for trunk acceleration index, 88.8% for forward × vertical acceleration fluctuation, and 87.8% for 95% confidence ellipsoid volume of the three-dimensional accelerations.</p><p>Conclusions: The probability of a pathological gait specific to iNPH is high at the trunk acceleration fluctuation, reduced in the forward and vertical directions, and increased in the lateral direction.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairments, which has no effective therapy. Stem cell transplantation shows great potential in the therapy of various disease. However, the application of stem cell therapy in neurological disorders, especially the ones with a long-term disease course such as AD, is limited by the delivery approach due to the presence of the brain blood barrier. So far, the most commonly used delivery approach in the therapy of neurological disorders with stem cells in preclinical and clinical studies are intracranial injection and intrathecal injection, both of which are invasive. In the present study, we use repetitive intranasal delivery of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) to the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic mice to investigate the effect of hNSCs on the pathology of AD. The results indicate that the intranasally transplanted hNSCs survive and exhibit extensive migration and higher neuronal differentiation, with a relatively limited glial differentiation. A proportion of intranasally transplanted hNSCs differentiate to cholinergic neurons, which rescue cholinergic dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, intranasal transplantation of hNSCs attenuates β-amyloid accumulation by upregulating the expression of β-amyloid degrading enzymes, insulin-degrading enzymes, and neprilysin. Moreover, intranasal transplantation of hNSCs ameliorates other AD-like pathology including neuroinflammation, cholinergic dysfunction, and pericytic and synaptic loss, while enhancing adult hippocampal neurogenesis, eventually rescuing the cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Thus, our findings highlight that intranasal transplantation of hNSCs benefits cognition through multiple mechanisms, and exhibit the great potential of intranasal administration of stem cells as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for AD.</p>

<p>A patch-clamp recording in slices generated from the brain or the spinal cord has facilitated the exploration of neuronal circuits and the molecular mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. However, the rodents that are used to generate the spinal cord slices in previous studies involving a patch-clamp recording have been limited to those in the juvenile or adolescent stage. Here, we applied an N-methyl-D-glucamine HCl (NMDG-HCl) solution that enabled the patch-clamp recordings to be performed on the superficial dorsal horn neurons in the slices derived from middle-aged rats. The success rate of stable recordings from substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons was 34.6% (90/260). When stimulated with long current pulses, 43.3% (39/90) of the neurons presented a tonic-firing pattern, which was considered to represent γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) signals. Presumptive glutamatergic neurons presented 38.9% (35/90) delayed and 8.3% (7/90) single-spike patterns. The intrinsic membrane properties of both the neuron types were similar but delayed (glutamatergic) neurons appeared to be more excitable as indicated by the decreased latency and rheobase values of the action potential compared with those of tonic (GABAergic) neurons. Furthermore, the glutamatergic neurons were integrated, which receive more excitatory synaptic transmission. We demonstrated that the NMDG-HCl cutting solution could be used to prepare the spinal cord slices of middle-aged rodents for the patch-clamp recording. In combination with other techniques, this preparation method might permit the further study of the functions of the spinal cord in the pathological processes that occur in aging-associated diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65703">eIF2B conformation and assembly state regulates the integrated stress response</a></h4>

The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to various stress conditions. Phosphorylated eIF2 (eIF2-P) inhibits eIF2's nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, a two-fold symmetric heterodecamer assembled from subcomplexes. Here, we monitor and manipulate eIF2B assembly <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo. </i>In the absence of eIF2B's α-subunit, the ISR is induced because unassembled eIF2B tetramer subcomplexes accumulate in cells. Upon addition of the small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB, eIF2B tetramers assemble into active octamers. Surprisingly, ISRIB inhibits the ISR even in the context of fully assembled eIF2B decamers, revealing allosteric communication between the physically distant eIF2, eIF2-P, and ISRIB binding sites. Cryo-EM structures suggest a rocking motion in eIF2B that couples these binding sites. eIF2-P binding converts eIF2B decamers into 'conjoined tetramers' with diminished substrate binding and enzymatic activity. Canonical eIF2-P-driven ISR activation thus arises due to this change in eIF2B's conformational state.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65202">An optimized CRISPR/Cas9 approach for precise genome editing in neurons</a></h4>

The efficient knock-in of large DNA fragments to label endogenous proteins remains especially challenging in non-dividing cells such as neurons. We developed <i>T</i>argeted <i>K</i>nock-<i>I</i>n with <i>T</i>wo (TKIT) guides as a novel CRISPR/Cas9 based approach for efficient, and precise, genomic knock-in. Through targeting non-coding regions TKIT is resistant to INDEL mutations. We demonstrate TKIT labeling of endogenous synaptic proteins with various tags, with efficiencies up to 42% in mouse primary cultured neurons. Utilizing in utero electroporation or viral injections in mice TKIT can label AMPAR subunits with Super Ecliptic pHluorin, enabling visualization of endogenous AMPARs in vivo using two-photon microscopy. We further use TKIT to assess the mobility of endogenous AMPARs using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Finally, we show that TKIT can be used to tag AMPARs in rat neurons, demonstrating precise genome editing in another model organism and highlighting the broad potential of TKIT as a method to visualize endogenous proteins.

TDP-43 is extensively studied in neurons in physiological and pathological contexts. However, emerging evidence indicates that glial cells are also reliant on TDP-43 function. We demonstrate that deletion of TDP-43 in Schwann cells results in a dramatic delay in peripheral nerve conduction causing significant motor deficits in mice, which is directly attributed to the absence of paranodal axoglial junctions. By contrast, paranodes in the central nervous system are unaltered in oligodendrocytes lacking TDP-43. Mechanistically, TDP-43 binds directly to <i>Neurofascin</i> mRNA, encoding the cell adhesion molecule essential for paranode assembly and maintenance. Loss of TDP-43 triggers the retention of a previously unidentified cryptic exon, which targets <i>Neurofascin</i> mRNA for nonsense-mediated decay. Thus, TDP-43 is required for neurofascin expression, proper assembly and maintenance of paranodes, and rapid saltatory conduction. Our findings provide a framework and mechanism for how Schwann cell-autonomous dysfunction in nerve conduction is directly caused by TDP-43 loss-of-function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63721">Multiple decisions about one object involve parallel sensory acquisition but time-multiplexed evidence incorporation</a></h4>

The brain is capable of processing several streams of information that bear on different aspects of the same problem. Here we address the problem of making two decisions about one object, by studying difficult perceptual decisions about the color and motion of a dynamic random dot display. We find that the accuracy of one decision is unaffected by the difficulty of the other decision. However, the response times reveal that the two decisions do not form simultaneously. We show that both stimulus dimensions are acquired in parallel for the initial ∼0.1 s but are then incorporated serially in time-multiplexed bouts. Thus there is a bottleneck that precludes updating more than one decision at a time, and a buffer that stores samples of evidence while access to the decision is blocked. We suggest that this bottleneck is responsible for the long timescales of many cognitive operations framed as decisions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63166">Tonic firing mode of midbrain dopamine neurons continuously tracks reward values changing moment-by-moment</a></h4>

Animal behavior is regulated based on the values of future rewards. The phasic activity of midbrain dopamine neurons signals these values. Because reward values often change over time, even on a subsecond-by-subsecond basis, appropriate behavioral regulation requires continuous value monitoring. However, the phasic dopamine activity, which is sporadic and has a short duration, likely fails continuous monitoring. Here, we demonstrate a tonic firing mode of dopamine neurons that effectively tracks changing reward values. We recorded dopamine neuron activity in monkeys during a Pavlovian procedure in which the value of a cued reward gradually increased or decreased. Dopamine neurons tonically increased and decreased their activity as the reward value changed. This tonic activity was evoked more strongly by non-burst spikes than burst spikes producing a conventional phasic activity. Our findings suggest that dopamine neurons change their firing mode to effectively signal reward values in a given situation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60326">Antagonistic roles for Ataxin-2 structured and disordered domains in RNP condensation</a></h4>

Ataxin-2 (Atx2) is a translational control molecule mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. While intrinsically disordered domains (IDRs) of Atx2 facilitate mRNP condensation into granules, how IDRs work with structured domains to enable positive and negative regulation of target mRNAs remains unclear. Using the Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins Identified by Editing technology, we identified an extensive data set of Atx2-target mRNAs in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain and S2 cells. Atx2 interactions with AU-rich elements in 3′UTRs appear to modulate stability/turnover of a large fraction of these target mRNAs. Further genomic and cell biological analyses of Atx2 domain deletions demonstrate that Atx2 (1) interacts closely with target mRNAs within mRNP granules, (2) contains distinct protein domains that drive or oppose RNP-granule assembly, and (3) has additional essential roles outside of mRNP granules. These findings increase the understanding of neuronal translational control mechanisms and inform strategies for Atx2-based interventions under development for neurodegenerative disease.

Transcriptional bursts render substantial biological noise in cellular transcriptomes. Here, we investigated the theoretical extent of allelic expression resulting from transcriptional bursting and how it compared to the amount biallelic, monoallelic and allele-biased expression observed in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We found that transcriptional bursting can explain the allelic expression patterns observed in single cells, including the frequent observations of autosomal monoallelic gene expression. Importantly, we identified that the burst frequency largely determined the fraction of cells with monoallelic expression, whereas the burst size had little effect on monoallelic observations. The high consistency between the bursting model predictions and scRNA-seq observations made it possible to assess the heterogeneity of a group of cells as their deviation in allelic observations from the expected. Finally, both burst frequency and size contributed to allelic imbalance observations and reinforced that studies of allelic imbalance can be confounded from the inherent noise in transcriptional bursting. Altogether, we demonstrate that allele-level transcriptional bursting renders widespread, although predictable, amounts of monoallelic and biallelic expression in single cells and cell populations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iXalhcWW9Us" width="1" />

<p>by Pieter J. K. Libin, Lander Willem, Timothy Verstraeten, Andrea Torneri, Joris Vanderlocht, Niel Hens</p>

Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. The initial control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand <i>pool isolation</i>, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand <i>individual isolation</i>, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the <i>STRIDE</i> individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3CVq8BNjM08" width="1" />

Allowing for invisible name changes is a matter of dignity for trans researchers. This would prevent their own publication record from outing them without their consent. A single, centralized name change request through ORCID iD would alleviate the burden of changing each publication individually.

Academic journals allowing for invisible name changes is a matter of fundamental respect and dignity for trans researchers, but there are currently no acceptable choices when dealing with name changes in a publishing record. This Perspective article proposes a centralized name change solution through ORCID iD to relieve the burden on trans researchers to contact every journal they have previously published with.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vblJ7m3GTwk" width="1" />

The issues facing academic mothers have been discussed for decades. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is further exposing these inequalities as womxn scientists who are parenting while also engaging in a combination of academic related duties are falling behind. These inequities can be solved by investing strategically in solutions. Here we describe strategies that would ensure a more equitable academy for working mothers now and in the future. While the data are clear that mothers are being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, many groups could benefit from these strategies. Rather than rebuilding what we once knew, let us be the architects of a new world.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7PDwqbuv4q4" width="1" />

Abstract
Theoretical accounts of moral decision making imply distinct ways in which episodic memory processes may contribute to judgments about moral dilemmas that entail high conflict between a harmful action and a greater good resulting from such action. Yet, studies examining the status of moral judgment in amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions have yielded inconsistent results. To examine whether and how episodic processes contribute to high conflict moral decisions, amnesic patients with MTL damage and control participants were asked to judge the moral acceptability of a harmful action across two conditions that differed in the framing of the moral question. We predicted that personal (but not abstract) framing would engage episodic processes involved in mental simulation, yielding a selective impairment in MTL patients in the personal framing condition. This prediction was not confirmed as neither patients nor controls were influenced by the framing of the moral question. With the exception of a patient whose lesion extended into the amygdala bilaterally, patients were less willing than controls to endorse the utilitarian option, rejecting the harmful action despite its beneficial outcome. They also rated actions as emotionally more intense than did controls. These findings suggest that episodic processes involved in mental simulation are necessary to prospectively evaluate action‐outcome contingencies.

Here we review the literature to shed light on the possibility that high oxygen levels and/or lung injury, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, can lead to neurodevelopmental impairment. The literature is especially convincing that these factors affect the neurodevelopment of extremely preterm or very low birth weight infants. 

Abstract
Developmental brain injury describes a spectrum of neurological pathologies resulting from either antenatal or perinatal injury. This includes both cognitive and motor defects that affect patients for their entire lives. Developmental brain injury can be caused by a spectrum of conditions including stroke, perinatal hypoxia‐ischemia, and intracranial hemorrhage. Additional risk factors have been identified including very low birth weight, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen (O2) supplementation. In fact, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, an inflammatory disease associated with disrupted lung development, have been shown to have decreased cerebral white matter and decreased intracranial volumes. Thus, there appears to be a developmental link between the lung, O2, and the brain that leads to proper myelination. Here, we will discuss what is currently known about the link between O2 and myelination and how scientists are exploring mechanisms through which supplemental O2 and/or lung injury can affect brain development. Consideration of a link between the diseased lung and developing brain will allow clinicians to fine tune their approaches in managing preterm lung disease in order to optimize brain health.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25105?af=R">Astrocyte regional heterogeneity revealed through machine learning‐based glial neuroanatomical assays</a></h4>

Traditional image analysis techniques fail to determine the morphological changes astrocytes undergo following inflammation. Developing an automated segmentation workflow allowed us to extract morphological data of GFAP or ALDH1L1 positive objects. Using principal component analysis and random forests, we were able to determine the features most important for identifying whether an astrocyte was baseline or reactive. To further determine the changes, different segmented cellular astrocyte components underwent (i.e., the body or process), we performed k‐means clustering. Multiple, well‐validated machine learning approaches allowed us to determine astrocytes undergo a region‐specific heterogenous morphological change following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).







Abstract
Evaluation of reactive astrogliosis by neuroanatomical assays represents a common experimental outcome for neuroanatomists. The literature demonstrates several conflicting results as to the accuracy of such measures. We posited that the diverging results within the neuroanatomy literature were due to suboptimal analytical workflows in addition to astrocyte regional heterogeneity. We therefore generated an automated segmentation workflow to extract features of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, member L1 (ALDH1L1) labeled astrocytes with and without neuroinflammation. We achieved this by capturing multiplexed immunofluorescent confocal images of mouse brains treated with either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by implementation of our workflows. Using classical image analysis techniques focused on pixel intensity only, we were unable to identify differences between vehicle‐treated and LPS‐treated animals. However, when utilizing machine learning–based algorithms, we were able to (1) accurately predict which objects were derived from GFAP or ALDH1L1‐stained images indicating that GFAP and ALDH1L1 highlight distinct morphological aspects of astrocytes, (2) we could predict which neuroanatomical region the segmented GFAP or ALDH1L1 object had been derived from, indicating that morphological features of astrocytes change as a function of neuroanatomical location. (3) We discovered a statistically significant, albeit not highly accurate, prediction of which objects had come from LPS versus vehicle‐treated animals, indicating that although features exist capable of distinguishing LPS‐treated versus vehicle‐treated GFAP and ALDH1L1‐segmented objects, that significant overlap between morphologies exists. We further determined that for most classification scenarios, nonlinear models were required for improved treatment class designations. We propose that unbiased automated image analysis techniques coupled with well‐validated machine learning tools represent highly useful models capable of providing insights into neuroanatomical assays.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Toll-like receptors (TLRs) belong to a pattern recognition receptor class which is an integral part of innate immunity. During Parkinson’s disease (PD), activation of the immune response is a well-established feature in both, the periphery and the brain. The role of TLR is considered to be a salient part of the established framework during inflammation and neurodegenerative disease such as PD. The link between inflammation-mediated TLR expression and the molecular hallmark of PD pathogenesis is well established. Various evidence in support of the review has proved the presence of α-synuclein-positive inclusions, inciting the activated microglia to promote the expression of microglial and neuronal TLRs. Thus, the long-established inflammatory environment is considered as the pivotal element in the progression of the PD pathology. This review aims to delineate the importance of TLRs (TLR2/4) and their altered signaling in the pathogenesis of PD via cascade of proinflammatory pathways and the new therapeutic propositions to modulate the TLR expression. The microglia-mediated inflammatory pathway and aggregated α-synuclein potentiates multiple mechanisms through which inflammation contributes to progression of neurodegeneration in PD via upregulation of TLR2 and TLR4. TLR targeting is a site of interest to facilitate effective treatment for PD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Vanishing white matter disease (VWM) is a rare autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by a mutation in any of the five gene encoding subunits of the translation initiation factors eIF2B1 to eIF2B5. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a 7-year-old boy with prenatal symptoms, including intrauterine-growth retardation, decreased movements, and oligohydramnios as well as mild intellectual disability, optic atrophy, macrocephaly, mild ataxia, and white matter lesions after birth. Analysis of WES data revealed a homozygous missense variant, c.C590T (p.Thr197Met) in the <em class="a-plus-plus">EIF2B3</em> gene (NM_0203650). The candidate variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and found to co-segregate with disease in family members. Pathogenicity analysis, 3D protein modeling, and stability assessment showed the deleterious effects of this nucleotide change. Previous studies suggest a direct relationship between the onset of symptoms and the progression rate and severity of the disease. All described cases of <em class="a-plus-plus">EIF2B</em> deficiency with antenatal-onset led prenatal death; if they were born, they experienced clinical exacerbation, seizure, severe encephalopathy, and consequent infantile death (&lt; 1 year). The patient of this study had never had seizure, which could be a potential explanation for the observed mild clinical picture, chronic state, and long-term survival until the age of seven. This study reported the first VWM due to <em class="a-plus-plus">EIF2B</em> gene deficiency with antenatal-onset but mild symptoms and long-term survival. The result of this study showed that stressor factors, particularly seizure, could have a substantial role in poor prognosis and early neonatal death.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration and immune cell infiltration are two features of Alzheimer disease (AD). This study aimed to identify potential peripheral biomarkers that interact with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and infiltrating immune cells in AD. Blood and CSF data were downloaded from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD and assessed infiltrating immune cells using the Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) algorithm. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) and immune-related genes were identified from medical databases, and common genes were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI). Potential biomarkers reflecting the clinical features of AD were screened using Pearson correlations and logistic regression analysis. We identified 210 DEGs in the AD group. ImmuCellAI indicated that blood samples from patients with AD had a higher abundance of exhausted T (Tex; 0.196 vs. 0.132) and induced regulatory T (iTreg; 0.180 vs. 0.137) cells than controls. Thirty-two genes overlapped between the BBB and immune-related genes, and 27 genes in the PPI network were associated with eight pathways, including the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway (hsa04060) and the chemokine signaling pathway (hsa04062). Pearson correlations showed that five genes were associated with the CSF biomarkers, Aβ, total, and phosphorylated tau. Logistics analysis showed that the B cell-associated genes, <em class="a-plus-plus">CXCL12</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">TNFRSF13C</em>, were independent risk factors for AD diagnosis. Peripheral <em class="a-plus-plus">CXCL12</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">TNFRSF13C</em> genes that correlated with immune cell infiltration in AD might serve as easily accessible biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.</p>

<p>Understanding how the structural connectivity and spatial geometry of a network constrains the dynamics it is able to support is an active and open area of research. We simulated the plausible dynamics resulting from the known C. elegans connectome using a recent model and theoretical analysis that computes the dynamics of neurobiological networks by focusing on how local interactions among connected neurons give rise to the global dynamics in an emergent way. We studied the dynamics which resulted from stimulating a chemosensory neuron (ASEL) in a known feeding circuit, both in isolation and embedded in the full connectome. We show that contralateral motorneuron activations in ventral (VB) and dorsal (DB) classes of motorneurons emerged from the simulations, which are qualitatively similar to rhythmic motorneuron firing pattern associated with locomotion of the worm. One interpretation of these results is that there is an inherent—and we propose—purposeful structural wiring to the C. elegans connectome that has evolved to serve specific behavioral functions. To study network signaling pathways responsible for the dynamics we developed an analytic framework that constructs Temporal Sequences (TSeq), time-ordered walks of signals on graphs. We found that only 5% of TSeq are preserved between the isolated feeding network relative to its embedded counterpart. The remaining 95% of signaling pathways computed in the isolated network are not present in the embedded network. This suggests a cautionary note for computational studies of isolated neurobiological circuits and networks.</p>

<p>The endogenous amide N-Oleoylglycine (OlGly) and its analog N-Oleoylalanine (OlAla), have been shown to interfere with the affective and somatic responses to acute naloxone-precipitated MWD in male rats. Here we evaluated the potential of a single dose (5 mg/kg, ip) which alleviates withdrawal of these endogenous fatty acid amides to modify tolerance to anti-nociception, hyperthermia, and suppression of locomotion produced by morphine in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Although rats did develop tolerance to the hypolocomotor and analgesic effects of morphine, they did not develop tolerance to the hyperthermic effects of this substance. Administration of neither OlGly nor OlAla interfered with the establishment of morphine tolerance, nor did they modify behavioral responses elicited by morphine on any trial. These results suggest that the effects of OlGly and OlAla on opiate dependence may be limited to naloxone-precipitated withdrawal effects.</p>

<p>Neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules essential for synaptic function that are expressed in thousands of alternatively spliced isoforms. Recent studies suggested that alternative splicing at splice site 4 (SS4) of Nrxn1 is tightly regulated by an activity-dependent mechanism. Given that Nrxn1 alternative splicing at SS4 controls NMDA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses, activity-dependent SS4 alternative splicing would suggest a new synaptic plasticity mechanism. However, conflicting results confound the assessment of neurexin alternative splicing, prompting us to re-evaluate this issue. We find that in cortical cultures, membrane depolarization by elevated extracellular K<sup>+</sup>-concentrations produced an apparent shift in Nrxn1-SS4 alternative splicing by inducing neuronal but not astroglial cell death, resulting in persistent astroglial Nrxn1-SS4+ expression and decreased neuronal Nrxn1-SS4– expression. in vivo, systemic kainate-induced activation of neurons in the hippocampus produced no changes in Nrxn1-SS4 alternative splicing. Moreover, focal kainate injections into the mouse cerebellum induced small changes in Nrxn1-SS4 alternative splicing that, however, were associated with large decreases in Nrxn1 expression and widespread DNA damage. Our results suggest that although Nrxn1-SS4 alternative splicing may represent a mechanism of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, common procedures for testing this hypothesis are prone to artifacts, and more sophisticated approaches will be necessary to test this important question.</p>

<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is typically collected with gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequences, which are particularly prone to the susceptibility artifact as a result of B<sub>0</sub> field inhomogeneity. The component derived from in-plane spin dephasing induces pixel intensity variations and, more critically, geometric distortions. Despite the physical mechanisms underlying the susceptibility artifact being well established, a systematic investigation on the impact of the associated geometric distortions, and the direct comparison of different approaches to tackle them, on fMRI data analyses is missing. Here, we compared two different distortion correction approaches, by acquiring additional: (1) EPI data with reversed phase encoding direction (TOPUP), and (2) standard (and undistorted) GE data at two different echo times (GRE). We first characterized the geometric distortions and the correction approaches based on the estimated ΔB<sub>0</sub> field offset and voxel shift maps, and then conducted three types of analyses on the distorted and corrected fMRI data: (1) registration into structural data, (2) identification of resting-state networks (RSNs), and (3) mapping of task-related brain regions of interest. GRE estimated the largest voxel shifts and more positively impacted the quality of the analyses, in terms of the (significantly lower) cost function of the registration, the (higher) spatial overlap between the RSNs and appropriate templates, and the (significantly higher) sensitivity of the task-related mapping based on the Z-score values of the associated activation maps, although also evident when considering TOPUP. fMRI data should thus be corrected for geometric distortions, with the choice of the approach having a modest, albeit positive, impact on the fMRI analyses.</p>

<p>Most magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) based source estimation techniques derive their estimates sample wise, independently across time. However, neuronal assemblies are intricately interconnected, constraining the temporal evolution of neural activity that is detected by MEG and EEG; the observed neural currents must thus be highly context dependent. Here, we use a network of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells where the input is a sequence of past source estimates and the output is a prediction of the following estimate. This prediction is then used to correct the estimate. In this study, we applied this technique on noise-normalized minimum norm estimates (MNE). Because the correction is found by using past activity (context), we call this implementation Contextual MNE (CMNE), although this technique can be used in conjunction with any source estimation method. We test CMNE on simulated epileptiform activity and recorded auditory steady state response (ASSR) data, showing that the CMNE estimates exhibit a higher degree of spatial fidelity than the unfiltered estimates in the tested cases.</p>

<p>Single-pulse and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are used in clinical practice for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, rTMS-based therapies that lead to a significant and sustained reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms remain scarce. While it is generally accepted that the stimulation frequency plays a crucial role in producing the therapeutic effects of rTMS, less attention has been dedicated to determining the role of the electric field strength. Conventional threshold-based intensity selection approaches, such as the resting motor threshold, produce variable stimulation intensities and electric fields across participants and cortical regions. Insufficient standardization of electric field strength may contribute to the variability of rTMS effects and thus therapeutic success. Computational approaches that can prospectively optimize the electric field and standardize it across patients and cortical targets may overcome some of these limitations. Here, we discuss these approaches and propose that electric field standardization will be instrumental for translational science frameworks (e.g., multiscale modeling and basic science approaches) aimed at deciphering the subcellular, cellular, and network mechanisms of rTMS. Advances in understanding these mechanisms will be important for optimizing rTMS-based therapies in psychiatry.</p>

<p>Electrical activity has a key role in shaping neuronal circuits during development. In most sensory modalities, early in development, internally generated spontaneous activity sculpts the initial layout of neuronal wiring. With the maturation of the sense organs, the system relies more on sensory-evoked electrical activity. Stimuli-driven neuronal discharge is required for the transformation of immature circuits in the specific patterns of neuronal connectivity that subserve normal brain function. The olfactory system (OS) differs from this organizational plan. Despite the important role of odorant receptors (ORs) in shaping olfactory topography, odor-evoked activity does not have a prominent role in refining neuronal wiring. On the contrary, afferent spontaneous discharge is required to achieve and maintain the specific diagram of connectivity that defines the topography of the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we provide an overview of the development of olfactory topography, with a focus on the role of afferent spontaneous discharge in the formation and maintenance of the specific synaptic contacts that result in the topographic organization of the OB.</p>

<p>Dark cone photoreceptors, defined as those with diminished or absent reflectivity when observed with adaptive optics (AO) ophthalmoscopy, are increasingly reported in retinal disorders. However, their structural and functional impact remain unclear. Here, we report a 3-year longitudinal study on a patient with oligocone trichromacy (OT) who presented with persistent, widespread dark cones within and near the macula. Diminished electroretinogram (ERG) cone but normal ERG rod responses together with normal color vision confirmed the OT diagnosis. In addition, the patient had normal to near normal visual acuity and retinal sensitivity. Occasional dark gaps in the photoreceptor layer were observed on optical coherence tomography, in agreement with reflectance AO scanning light ophthalmoscopy, which revealed that over 50% of the cones in the fovea were dark, increasing to 74% at 10° eccentricity. In addition, the cone density was 78% lower than normal histologic value at the fovea, and 20–40% lower at eccentricities of 5–15°. Interestingly, color vision testing was near normal at locations where cones were predominantly dark. These findings illustrate how a retina with predominant dark cones that persist over at least 3 years can support near normal central retinal function. Furthermore, this study adds to the growing evidence that cones can continue to survive under non-ideal conditions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65958">Bulk flow of cerebrospinal fluid observed in periarterial spaces is not an artifact of injection</a></h4>

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flowing through periarterial spaces is integral to the brain's mechanism for clearing metabolic waste products. Experiments that track tracer particles injected into the cisterna magna of mouse brains have shown evidence of pulsatile CSF flow in perivascular spaces surrounding pial arteries, with a bulk flow in the same direction as blood flow. However, the driving mechanism remains elusive. Several studies have suggested that the bulk flow might be an artifact, driven by the injection itself. Here, we address this hypothesis with new <i>in vivo</i> experiments where tracer particles are injected into the cisterna magna using a dual-syringe system, with simultaneous injection and withdrawal of equal amounts of fluid. This method produces no net increase in CSF volume and no significant increase in intracranial pressure. Yet, particle-tracking reveals flows that are consistent in all respects with the flows observed in earlier experiments with single-syringe injection.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65169">A polarity pathway for exocyst-dependent intracellular tube extension</a></h4>

Lumen extension in intracellular tubes can occur when vesicles fuse with an invading apical membrane. Within the <i>C. elegans</i> excretory cell, which forms an intracellular tube, the exocyst vesicle-tethering complex is enriched at the lumenal membrane and is required for its outgrowth, suggesting that exocyst-targeted vesicles extend the lumen. Here, we identify a pathway that promotes intracellular tube extension by enriching the exocyst at the lumenal membrane. We show that PAR-6 and PKC-3/aPKC concentrate at the lumenal membrane and promote lumen extension. Using acute protein depletion, we find that PAR-6 is required for exocyst membrane recruitment, whereas PAR-3, which can recruit the exocyst in mammals, appears dispensable for exocyst localization and lumen extension. Finally, we show that CDC-42 and RhoGEF EXC-5/FGD regulate lumen extension by recruiting PAR-6 and PKC-3 to the lumenal membrane. Our findings reveal a pathway that connects CDC-42, PAR proteins, and the exocyst to extend intracellular tubes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65166">SABRE populates ER domains essential for cell plate maturation and cell expansion influencing cell and tissue patterning</a></h4>

SABRE, which is found throughout eukaryotes and was originally identified in plants, mediates cell expansion, division plane orientation and planar polarity in plants. How and where SABRE mediates these processes remain open questions. We deleted <i>SABRE</i> in <i>Physcomitrium patens</i>, an excellent model for cell biology. <i>SABRE</i> null mutants were stunted, similar to phenotypes in seed plants. Additionally, polarized growing cells were delayed in cytokinesis, sometimes resulting in catastrophic failures. A functional SABRE fluorescent fusion protein localized to dynamic puncta on regions of the ER during interphase and at the cell plate during cell division. Without <i>SABRE</i>, cells accumulated ER aggregates and the ER abnormally buckled along the developing cell plate. Notably, callose deposition was delayed in <i>Δsabre</i>, and in cells that failed to divide, abnormal callose accumulations formed at the cell plate. Our findings revealed a surprising and fundamental role for the ER in cell plate maturation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64351">Drp1 is required for AgRP neuronal activity and feeding</a></h4>

The hypothalamic orexigenic Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are crucial for the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis. Here, we show that fasting-induced AgRP neuronal activation is associated with dynamin-related peptide 1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fatty acid utilization in AgRP neurons. In line with this, mice lacking <i>Dnm1l</i> in adult AgRP neurons (Drp1 cKO) show decreased fasting- or ghrelin-induced AgRP neuronal activity and feeding and exhibited a significant decrease in body weight, fat mass, and feeding accompanied by a significant increase in energy expenditure. In support of the role for mitochondrial fission and fatty acids oxidation, Drp1 cKO mice showed attenuated palmitic acid-induced mitochondrial respiration. Altogether, our data revealed that mitochondrial dynamics and fatty acids oxidation in hypothalamic AgRP neurons is a critical mechanism for AgRP neuronal function and body-weight regulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64278">Visuomotor learning from postdictive motor error</a></h4>

Sensorimotor learning adapts motor output to maintain movement accuracy. For saccadic eye movements, learning also alters space perception, suggesting a dissociation between the performed saccade and its internal representation derived from corollary discharge (CD). This is critical since learning is commonly believed to be driven by CD-based visual prediction error. We estimate the internal saccade representation through pre- and trans-saccadic target localization, showing that it decouples from the actual saccade during learning. We present a model that explains motor and perceptual changes by collective plasticity of spatial target percept, motor command, and a forward dynamics model that transforms CD from motor into visuospatial coordinates. We show that learning does not follow visual prediction error but instead a postdictive update of space after saccade landing. We conclude that trans-saccadic space perception guides motor learning via CD-based postdiction of motor error under the assumption of a stable world.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63775">Mapping the functional landscape of the receptor binding domain of T7 bacteriophage by deep mutational scanning</a></h4>

The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein (RBP). Despite its fundamental role in governing phage activity and host range, molecular rules of RBP function remain a mystery. Here, we systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP (1660 variants) by developing a high-throughput, locus-specific, phage engineering method. This rich dataset allowed us to cross compare functional profiles across hosts to precisely identify regions of functional importance, many which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties of mutations, revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts. We discovered gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts. To demonstrate therapeutic utility, we engineered highly active T7 variants against urinary tract pathogen. Our approach presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems.

In normal rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) overlap with callosal patches in V1. ODCs (a) and callosal patches (c) are present by postnatal day 10 (P10).

ABSTRACT
In Long Evans rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in V1 overlap with patches of callosal connections. Using anatomical tracers, we found that ODCs and callosal patches are present at postnatal day 10 (P10), several days before eye opening, and about 10 days before the activation of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (~P20). In rats monocularly enucleated at P10 and perfused ~P20, ODCs ipsilateral to the remaining eye desegregated, indicating that rat ODCs are highly susceptible to monocular enucleation during a precritical period. Monocular enucleation during the critical period exerted significant, although smaller, effects. Monocular eye lid suture during the critical period led to a significant expansion of the ipsilateral projection from the non‐deprived eye, whereas the contralateral projection invaded into, and intermixed with, ipsilateral ODCs innervated by the deprived eye. We propose that this intermixing allows callosal connections to contribute to the effects of monocular deprivation assessed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the non deprived eye. The ipsilateral and contralateral projections from the deprived eye did not undergo significant shrinkage.
In contrast, we found that callosal patches are less susceptible to imbalance of eye input. In rats monocularly enucleated during either the precritical or critical periods, callosal patches were maintained in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye, but desegregated in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the enucleated orbit. Callosal patches were maintained in rats binocularly enucleated at P10 or later. Similarly, monocular deprivation during the critical period had no significant effect on callosal patches in either hemisphere.

<p>by Zhaoqian Su, Kalyani Dhusia, Yinghao Wu</p>

The activation and differentiation of T-cells are mainly directly by their co-regulatory receptors. T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and programed cell death-1 (PD-1) are two of the most important co-regulatory receptors. Binding of PD-1 and CTLA-4 with their corresponding ligands programed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and B7 on the antigen presenting cells (APC) activates two central co-inhibitory signaling pathways to suppress T cell functions. Interestingly, recent experiments have identified a new <i>cis</i>-interaction between PD-L1 and B7, suggesting that a crosstalk exists between two co-inhibitory receptors and the two pairs of ligand-receptor complexes can undergo dynamic oligomerization. Inspired by these experimental evidences, we developed a coarse-grained model to characterize the assembling of an immune complex consisting of CLTA-4, B7, PD-L1 and PD-1. These four proteins and their interactions form a small network motif. The temporal dynamics and spatial pattern formation of this network was simulated by a diffusion-reaction algorithm. Our simulation method incorporates the membrane confinement of cell surface proteins and geometric arrangement of different binding interfaces between these proteins. A wide range of binding constants was tested for the interactions involved in the network. Interestingly, we show that the CTLA-4/B7 ligand-receptor complexes can first form linear oligomers, while these oligomers further align together into two-dimensional clusters. Similar phenomenon has also been observed in other systems of cell surface proteins. Our test results further indicate that both co-inhibitory signaling pathways activated by B7 and PD-L1 can be down-regulated by the new <i>cis</i>-interaction between these two ligands, consistent with previous experimental evidences. Finally, the simulations also suggest that the dynamic and the spatial properties of the immune complex assembly are highly determined by the energetics of molecular interactions in the network. Our study, therefore, brings new insights to the co-regulatory mechanisms of T cell activation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R4hDckY4L1s" width="1" />

<p>by Ayuna Barlukova, Igor M. Rouzine</p>

An intriguing fact long defying explanation is the observation of a universal exponential distribution of beneficial mutations in fitness effect for different microorganisms. To explain this effect, we use a population model including mutation, directional selection, linkage, and genetic drift. The multiple-mutation regime of adaptation at large population sizes (traveling wave regime) is considered. We demonstrate analytically and by simulation that, regardless of the inherent distribution of mutation fitness effect across genomic sites, an exponential distribution of fitness effects emerges in the long term. This result follows from the exponential statistics of the frequency of the less-fit alleles, <i>f</i>, that we predict to evolve, in the long term, for both polymorphic and monomorphic sites. We map the logarithmic slope of the distribution onto the previously derived fixation probability and demonstrate that it increases linearly in time. Our results demonstrate a striking difference between the distribution of fitness effects observed experimentally for naturally occurring mutations, and the "inherent" distribution obtained in a directed-mutagenesis experiment, which can have any shape depending on the organism. Based on these results, we develop a new method to measure the fitness effect of mutations for each variable residue using DNA sequences sampled from adapting populations. This new method is not sensitive to linkage effects and does not require the one-site model assumptions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cpkmKbCoxiA" width="1" />

Abnormal coagulation and an increased risk of thrombosis are features of severe COVID-19, with parallels proposed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a life-threating condition associated with hyperinflammation. The presence of HLH was described in severely ill patients during the H1N1 influenza epidemic, presenting with pulmonary vascular thrombosis. We tested the hypothesis that genes causing primary HLH regulate pathways linking pulmonary thromboembolism to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using novel network-informed computational algorithms. This approach led to the identification of Neutrophils Extracellular Traps (NETs) as plausible mediators of vascular thrombosis in severe COVID-19 in children and adults. Taken together, the network-informed analysis led us to propose the following model: the release of NETs in response to inflammatory signals acting in concert with SARS-CoV-2 damage the endothelium and direct platelet-activation promoting abnormal coagulation leading to serious complications of COVID-19. The underlying hypothesis is that genetic and/or environmental conditions that favor the release of NETs may predispose individuals to thrombotic complications of COVID-19 due to an increase risk of abnormal coagulation. This would be a common pathogenic mechanism in conditions including autoimmune/infectious diseases, hematologic and metabolic disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UcvR93KNSVY" width="1" />

<p>by Koichiro Uriu, Hajime Tei</p>

Multiple feedback loops are often found in gene regulations for various cellular functions. In mammalian circadian clocks, oscillations of <i>Period1</i> (<i>Per1</i>) and <i>Period2</i> (<i>Per2</i>) expression are caused by interacting negative feedback loops (NFLs) whose protein products with similar molecular functions repress each other. However, <i>Per1</i> expression peaks earlier than <i>Per2</i> in the pacemaker tissue, raising the question of whether the peak time difference reflects their different dynamical functions. Here, we address this question by analyzing phase responses of the circadian clock caused by light-induced transcription of both <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i> mRNAs. Through mathematical analyses of dual NFLs, we show that phase advance is mainly driven by light inputs to the repressor with an earlier expression peak as <i>Per1</i>, whereas phase delay is driven by the other repressor with a later peak as <i>Per2</i>. Due to the complementary contributions to phase responses, the ratio of light-induced transcription rates between <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i> determines the magnitude and direction of phase shifts at each time of day. Specifically, stronger <i>Per1</i> light induction than <i>Per2</i> results in a phase response curve (PRC) with a larger phase advance zone than delay zone as observed in rats and hamsters, whereas stronger <i>Per2</i> induction causes a larger delay zone as observed in mice. Furthermore, the ratio of light-induced transcription rates required for entrainment is determined by the relation between the circadian and light-dark periods. Namely, if the autonomous period of a circadian clock is longer than the light-dark period, a larger light-induced transcription rate of <i>Per1</i> than <i>Per2</i> is required for entrainment, and vice versa. In short, the time difference between <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i> expression peaks can differentiate their dynamical functions. The resultant complementary contributions to phase responses can determine entrainability of the circadian clock to the light-dark cycle.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2zd9PlLEkvA" width="1" />

<p>by Annika Hagemann, Jens Wilting, Bita Samimizad, Florian Mormann, Viola Priesemann</p>

Epileptic seizures are characterized by abnormal and excessive neural activity, where cortical network dynamics seem to become unstable. However, most of the time, during seizure-free periods, cortex of epilepsy patients shows perfectly stable dynamics. This raises the question of how recurring instability can arise in the light of this stable default state. In this work, we examine two potential scenarios of seizure generation: (i) epileptic cortical areas might generally operate closer to instability, which would make epilepsy patients generally more susceptible to seizures, or (ii) epileptic cortical areas might drift systematically towards instability before seizure onset. We analyzed single-unit spike recordings from both the epileptogenic (focal) and the nonfocal cortical hemispheres of 20 epilepsy patients. We quantified the distance to instability in the framework of criticality, using a novel estimator, which enables an unbiased inference from a small set of recorded neurons. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for either scenario: Neither did focal areas generally operate closer to instability, nor were seizures preceded by a drift towards instability. In fact, our results from both pre-seizure and seizure-free intervals suggest that despite epilepsy, human cortex operates in the stable, slightly subcritical regime, just like cortex of other healthy mammalians.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BcP07U0hkow" width="1" />

<p>by Vedant Sachdeva, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Stephanie E. Palmer</p>

Responding to stimuli requires that organisms encode information about the external world. Not all parts of the input are important for behavior, and resource limitations demand that signals be compressed. Prediction of the future input is widely beneficial in many biological systems. We compute the trade-offs between representing the past faithfully and predicting the future using the information bottleneck approach, for input dynamics with different levels of complexity. For motion prediction, we show that, depending on the parameters in the input dynamics, velocity or position information is more useful for accurate prediction. We show which motion representations are easiest to re-use for accurate prediction in other motion contexts, and identify and quantify those with the highest transferability. For non-Markovian dynamics, we explore the role of long-term memory in shaping the internal representation. Lastly, we show that prediction in evolutionary population dynamics is linked to clustering allele frequencies into non-overlapping memories.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2N04EaO3NnY" width="1" />

<p>by Akira Nagamori, Christopher M. Laine, Gerald E. Loeb, Francisco J. Valero-Cuevas</p>

Variability in muscle force is a hallmark of healthy and pathological human behavior. Predominant theories of sensorimotor control assume ‘motor noise’ leads to force variability and its ‘signal dependence’ (variability in muscle force whose amplitude increases with intensity of neural drive). Here, we demonstrate that the two proposed mechanisms for motor noise (i.e. the stochastic nature of motor unit discharge and unfused tetanic contraction) cannot account for the majority of force variability nor for its signal dependence. We do so by considering three previously underappreciated but physiologically important features of a population of motor units: 1) fusion of motor unit twitches, 2) coupling among motoneuron discharge rate, cross-bridge dynamics, and muscle mechanics, and 3) a series-elastic element to account for the aponeurosis and tendon. These results argue strongly against the idea that force variability and the resulting kinematic variability are generated primarily by ‘motor noise.’ Rather, they underscore the importance of variability arising from properties of control strategies embodied through distributed sensorimotor systems. As such, our study provides a critical path toward developing theories and models of sensorimotor control that provide a physiologically valid and clinically useful understanding of healthy and pathologic force variability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1FAg7Z2QAFE" width="1" />

Acrylic acid is a value-added chemical used in industry to produce diapers, coatings, paints, and adhesives, among many others. Due to its economic importance, there is currently a need for new and sustainable ways to synthesise it. Recently, the focus has been laid in the use of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to express the full bio-based pathway using 3-hydroxypropionate as an intermediary through three distinct pathways (glycerol, malonyl-CoA, and <i>β</i>-alanine). Hence, the goals of this work were to use COPASI software to assess which of the three pathways has a higher potential for industrial-scale production, from either glucose or glycerol, and identify potential targets to improve the biosynthetic pathways yields. When compared to the available literature, the models developed during this work successfully predict the production of 3-hydroxypropionate, using glycerol as carbon source in the glycerol pathway, and using glucose as a carbon source in the malonyl-CoA and <i>β</i>-alanine pathways. Finally, this work allowed to identify four potential over-expression targets (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pD), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccC), aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), and aspartate carboxylase (AspC)) that should, theoretically, result in higher AA yields.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmWdsZN2yZg" width="1" />

<p>by Wen-Ting Chu, Jin Wang</p>

Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of some IDPs/IDRs can lead to the formation of the membraneless organelles <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, which are essential for many biological processes in the cell. Here we select three different IDR segments of chaperon Swc5 and develop a polymeric slab model at the residue-level. By performing the molecular dynamics simulations, LLPS can be observed at low temperatures even without charge interactions and disappear at high temperatures. Both the sequence length and the charge pattern of the Swc5 segments can influence the critical temperature of LLPS. The results suggest that the effects of the electrostatic interactions on the LLPS behaviors can change significantly with the ratios and distributions of the charged residues, especially the sequence charge decoration (SCD) values. In addition, three different forms of swc conformation can be distinguished on the phase diagram, which is different from the conventional behavior of the free IDP/IDR. Both the packed form (the condensed-phase) and the dispersed form (the dilute-phase) of swc chains are found to be coexisted when LLPS occurs. They change to the fully-spread form at high temperatures. These findings will be helpful for the investigation of the IDP/IDR ensemble behaviors as well as the fundamental mechanism of the LLPS process in bio-systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/92-5cYIt15s" width="1" />

<p>by AJ Harris, Aaron David Goldman</p>

In this study, we used a computational approach to investigate the early evolutionary history of a system of proteins that, together, embed and translocate other proteins across cell membranes. Cell membranes comprise the basis for cellularity, which is an ancient, fundamental organizing principle shared by all organisms and a key innovation in the evolution of life on Earth. Two related requirements for cellularity are that organisms are able to both embed proteins into membranes and translocate proteins across membranes. One system that accomplishes these tasks is the signal recognition particle (SRP) system, in which the core protein components are the paralogs, FtsY and Ffh. Complementary to the SRP system is the Sec translocation channel, in which the primary channel-forming protein is SecY. We performed phylogenetic analyses that strongly supported prior inferences that FtsY, Ffh, and SecY were all present by the time of the last universal common ancestor of life, the LUCA, and that the ancestor of FtsY and Ffh existed before the LUCA. Further, we combined ancestral sequence reconstruction and protein structure and function prediction to show that the LUCA had an SRP system and Sec translocation channel that were similar to those of extant organisms. We also show that the ancestor of Ffh and FtsY that predated the LUCA was more similar to FtsY than Ffh but could still have comprised a rudimentary protein translocation system on its own. Duplication of the ancestor of FtsY and Ffh facilitated the specialization of FtsY as a membrane bound receptor and Ffh as a cytoplasmic protein that could bind nascent proteins with specific membrane-targeting signal sequences. Finally, we analyzed amino acid frequencies in our ancestral sequence reconstructions to infer that the ancestral Ffh/FtsY protein likely arose prior to or just after the completion of the canonical genetic code. Taken together, our results offer a window into the very early evolutionary history of cellularity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jIzf6-2FzL0" width="1" />

<p>by Zixuan Cang, Yangyang Wang, Qixuan Wang, Ken W. Y. Cho, William Holmes, Qing Nie</p>

During early mammalian embryo development, a small number of cells make robust fate decisions at particular spatial locations in a tight time window to form inner cell mass (ICM), and later epiblast (Epi) and primitive endoderm (PE). While recent single-cell transcriptomics data allows scrutinization of heterogeneity of individual cells, consistent spatial and temporal mechanisms the early embryo utilize to robustly form the Epi/PE layers from ICM remain elusive. Here we build a multiscale three-dimensional model for mammalian embryo to recapitulate the observed patterning process from zygote to late blastocyst. By integrating the spatiotemporal information reconstructed from multiple single-cell transcriptomic datasets, the data-informed modeling analysis suggests two major processes critical to the formation of Epi/PE layers: a selective cell-cell adhesion mechanism (via EphA4/EphrinB2) for fate-location coordination and a temporal attenuation mechanism of cell signaling (via Fgf). Spatial imaging data and distinct subsets of single-cell gene expression data are then used to validate the predictions. Together, our study provides a multiscale framework that incorporates single-cell gene expression datasets to analyze gene regulations, cell-cell communications, and physical interactions among cells in complex geometries at single-cell resolution, with direct application to late-stage development of embryogenesis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/--FEM5x0ebY" width="1" />

Modern spatial transcriptomics methods can target thousands of different types of RNA transcripts in a single slice of tissue. Many biological applications demand a high spatial density of transcripts relative to the imaging resolution, leading to partial mixing of transcript rolonies in many voxels; unfortunately, current analysis methods do not perform robustly in this highly-mixed setting. Here we develop a new analysis approach, <i>BARcode DEmixing through Non-negative Spatial Regression</i> (BarDensr): we start with a generative model of the physical process that leads to the observed image data and then apply sparse convex optimization methods to estimate the underlying (demixed) rolony densities. We apply BarDensr to simulated and real data and find that it achieves state of the art signal recovery, particularly in densely-labeled regions or data with low spatial resolution. Finally, BarDensr is fast and parallelizable. We provide open-source code as well as an implementation for the ‘NeuroCAAS’ cloud platform.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hdDPdmMv6_Q" width="1" />

<p>by Brian Coventry, David Baker</p>

In aqueous solution, polar groups make hydrogen bonds with water, and hence burial of such groups in the interior of a protein is unfavorable unless the loss of hydrogen bonds with water is compensated by formation of new ones with other protein groups. For this reason, buried “unsatisfied” polar groups making no hydrogen bonds are very rare in proteins. Efficiently representing the energetic cost of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds with a pairwise-decomposable energy term during protein design is challenging since whether or not a group is satisfied depends on all of its neighbors. Here we describe a method for assigning a pairwise-decomposable energy to sidechain rotamers such that following combinatorial sidechain packing, buried unsaturated polar atoms are penalized. The penalty can be any quadratic function of the number of unsatisfied polar groups, and can be computed very rapidly. We show that inclusion of this term in Rosetta sidechain packing calculations substantially reduces the number of buried unsatisfied polar groups.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hMfSol7UySQ" width="1" />

<p>by Susan M. Reverby</p>

As the vaccines against COVID are slowly becoming available, we need to consider the paradox of why so many people of color are dying from the disease yet cannot get the vaccinations. Concerns focus on vaccine refusal but lack of access is the bigger problem.

As the vaccines against COVID are slowly becoming available, we need to consider the paradox of why so many people of color are dying from the disease yet cannot get the vaccinations. Focus of concern ought to shift from vaccine refusal to lack of access.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/w-Ftb4R-PNI" width="1" />

<p>by Anand Sripada, Kapil Sirohi, Lidia Michalec, Lei Guo, Jerome T. McKay, Sangya Yadav, Mukesh Verma, James Good, Donald Rollins, Magdalena M. Gorska, Rafeul Alam</p>

The function of Sprouty2 (Spry2) in T cells is unknown. Using 2 different (inducible and T cell–targeted) knockout mouse strains, we found that Spry2 positively regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling by modulating the activity of LCK. Spry2<sup>−/−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were unable to activate LCK, proliferate, differentiate into T helper cells, or produce cytokines. Spry2 deficiency abrogated type 2 inflammation and airway hyperreactivity in a murine model of asthma. Spry2 expression was higher in blood and airway CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from patients with asthma, and Spry2 knockdown impaired human T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Spry2 deficiency up-regulated the lipid raft protein caveolin-1, enhanced its interaction with CSK, and increased CSK interaction with LCK, culminating in augmented inhibitory phosphorylation of LCK. Knockdown of CSK or dislodgment of caveolin-1–bound CSK restored ERK1/2 activation in Spry2<sup>−/−</sup> T cells, suggesting an essential role for Spry2 in LCK activation and T cell function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ILHn1108vAo" width="1" />

Retrograde tracers were utilized to examine projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), a critical component of the head direction cell circuitry, and the abducens nucleus, an oculomotor structure. We found that the medial vestibular nucleus contains individual neurons that project to both the DTN and abducens nucleus. In contrast, neurons in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi project to either the DTN or abducens nucleus, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. Additionally, we describe interhemispheric connections between the left and right DTN, and projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN.







Abstract
Specialized circuitry in the brain processes spatial information to provide a sense of direction used for navigation. The dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) is a core component of this circuitry and utilizes vestibular inputs to generate neural activity encoding the animal's directional heading. Projections arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH) and the medial vestibular nucleus (MVe) are thought to transmit critical vestibular signals to the DTN and other brain areas, including the abducens nucleus (ABN), a component of eye movement circuitry. Here, we utilized a dual retrograde tracer approach in rats to investigate whether overlapping or distinct populations of neurons project from the NPH or MVe to the DTN and ABN. We report that individual MVe neurons project to both the DTN and ABN. In contrast, we observed individual NPH neurons that project to either the DTN or ABN, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. We also examined labeling patterns in other structures located in the brainstem and posterior cortex and observed (1) complex patterns of interhemispheric connectivity between the left and right DTN, (2) projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN, (3) projections from the lateral superior olive to the ABN, and (4) a unique population of cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Collectively, our experiments provide valuable new information that extends our understanding of the anatomical organization of the brain's spatial processing circuitry.

Abstract
Ground state depletion followed by individual molecule return microscopy (GSDIM) has been used in the past to study the nanoscale distribution of protein co‐localization in living cells. We now demonstrate the successful application of GSDIM to archival human brain tissue sections including from Alzheimer's disease cases as well as experimental tissue samples from mouse and zebrafish larvae. Presynaptic terminals and microglia and their cell processes were visualized at a resolution beyond diffraction‐limited light microscopy, allowing clearer insights into their interactions in situ. The procedure described here offers time and cost savings compared to electron microscopy and opens the spectrum of molecular imaging using antibodies and super‐resolution microscopy to the analysis of routine formalin‐fixed paraffin sections of archival human brain. The investigation of microglia–synapse interactions in dementia will be of special interest in this context.

Introduction<p>Serotonin is involved in a variety of physiological functions and brain disorders. In this context, efforts have been made to investigate the in vivo fluctuations of this neurotransmitter using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging paradigms. Since serotonin is a full agonist, it binds preferentially to G-protein coupled receptors. In contrast, antagonist PET ligands additionally interact with uncoupled receptors. This could explain the lack of sensitivity to serotonin fluctuations of current 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> radiopharmaceuticals which are mainly antagonists and suggests that agonist radiotracers would be more appropriate to measure changes in neurotransmitter release. The present study evaluated the sensitivity to endogenous serotonin release of a recently developed, selective 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor PET radiopharmaceutical, the agonist [<sup>18</sup>F]F13640 (a.k.a. befiradol or NLX-112).</p>Materials and Methods<p>Four cats each underwent three PET scans with [<sup>18</sup>F]F13640, i.e., a control PET scan of 90 min, a PET scan preceded 30 min before by an intravenous injection 1 mg/kg of d-fenfluramine, a serotonin releaser (blocking challenge), and a PET scan comprising the intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of d-fenfluramine 30 min after the radiotracer injection (displacement challenge). Data were analyzed with regions of interest and voxel-based approaches. A lp-ntPET model approach was implemented to determine the dynamic of serotonin release during the challenge study.</p>Results<p>D-fenfluramine pretreatment elicited a massive inhibition of [<sup>18</sup>F]F13640 labeling in regions known to express 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, e.g., raphe nuclei, hippocampus, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate putamen, occipital, frontal and parietal cortices, and gray matter of cerebellum. Administration of d-fenfluramine during PET acquisition indicates changes in occupancy from 10% (thalamus) to 31% (gray matter of cerebellum) even though the dissociation rate of [<sup>18</sup>F]F13640 over the 90 min acquisition time was modest. The lp-ntPET simulation succeeded in differentiating the control and challenge conditions.</p>Conclusion<p>The present findings demonstrate that labeling of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors with [<sup>18</sup>F]F13640 is sensitive to serotonin concentration fluctuations in vivo. Although the data underline the need to perform longer PET scan to ensure accurate measure of displacement, they support clinical development of [<sup>18</sup>F]F13640 as a tool to explore experimental paradigms involving physiological or pathological (neurological or neuropsychiatric pathologies) fluctuations of extracellular serotonin.</p>

<p>Maternal opioid use during pregnancy is a growing national problem and can lead to newborns developing neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) soon after birth. Recent data demonstrates that nearly every 15 min a baby is born in the United States suffering from NOWS. The primary treatment for NOWS is opioid replacement therapy, commonly oral morphine, which has neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. There is an urgent need for non-opioid treatments for NOWS. Transcutaneous auricular neurostimulation (tAN), a novel and non-invasive form of electrostimulation, may serve as a promising alternative to morphine. tAN is delivered via a multichannel earpiece electrode worn on and around the left ear, targeting two cranial nerves—the vagus and trigeminal nerves. Prior research suggests that auricular neurostimulation exerts an anxiolytic effect on the body by releasing endogenous opioids and reduces withdrawal symptoms in adults actively withdrawing from opioids. In this first-in-human prospective, open-label trial, we investigated tAN as an adjuvant to morphine therapy in eight infants &gt;33 weeks gestational age suffering from NOWS and receiving oral morphine treatment. Infants received tAN for 30 min 1 h before receiving a morphine dose. tAN was delivered at 0.1 mA below perception intensity at two different nerve targets on the ear: Region 1, the auricular branch of the vagus nerve; and Region 2, the auriculotemporal nerve. tAN was delivered up to four times daily for a maximum of 12 days. The primary outcome measures were safety [heart rate monitoring, Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), and skin irritation] and morphine length of treatment (LOT). tAN was well-tolerated and resulted in no unanticipated adverse events. Comparing to the national average of 23 days, the average oral morphine LOT was 13.3 days (median 9 days) and the average LOT after tAN initiation was 7 days (median 6 days). These preliminary data suggest that tAN is safe and may serve as a promising alternative adjuvant for treating NOWS and reducing the amount of time an infant receives oral morphine.</p>

<p>Learning to drive is a significant event for the transition to adulthood and delay or avoidance may have social, practical, and psychological implications. For those with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD/Dyspraxia), driving presents a considerable challenge, and the literature shows that there are differences in driving ability between individuals with and without DCD. The aim of the current research is to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the driving experiences of individuals with DCD. Nineteen participants with DCD (10 drivers and 9 non-drivers) and 36 controls (17 drivers and 19 non-drivers) aged 18–57 years took part in this study. Participants completed standardized tests, questionnaires and a driving simulation task designed to measure speed, road positioning, and rate of change of steering in three conditions with increasing perceptual complexity. Results indicate that behaviors for all participants changed as the perceptual demands of the task increased. However, drivers with DCD were more affected than all other groups, driving more slowly, and driving further to the right. These findings illustrate how the impact of both internal and external constraints negatively affect the success of the driving task for individuals with DCD compared to their TD peers.</p>

<p>Working memory is a limited capacity memory system that involves the short-term storage and processing of information. Neuroscientific studies of working memory have mostly focused on the essential roles of neural oscillations during item encoding from single sensory modalities (e.g., visual and auditory). However, the characteristics of neural oscillations during multisensory encoding in working memory are rarely studied. Our study investigated the oscillation characteristics of neural signals in scalp electrodes and mapped functional brain connectivity while participants encoded complex audiovisual objects in a working memory task. Experimental results showed that theta oscillations (4–8 Hz) were prominent and topographically distributed across multiple cortical regions, including prefrontal (e.g., superior frontal gyrus), parietal (e.g., precuneus), temporal (e.g., inferior temporal gyrus), and occipital (e.g., cuneus) cortices. Furthermore, neural connectivity at the theta oscillation frequency was significant in these cortical regions during audiovisual object encoding compared with single modality object encoding. These results suggest that local oscillations and interregional connectivity via theta activity play an important role during audiovisual object encoding and may contribute to the formation of working memory traces from multisensory items.</p>

<p>It was meaningful to predict the customers' decision-making behavior in the field of market. However, due to individual differences and complex, non-linear natures of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, it was hard to classify the EEG signals and to predict customers' decisions by using traditional classification methods. To solve the aforementioned problems, a recurrent t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) neural network was proposed in current study to classify the EEG signals in the designed brand extension paradigm and to predict the participants' decisions (whether to accept the brand extension or not). The recurrent t-SNE neural network contained two steps. In the first step, t-SNE algorithm was performed to extract features from EEG signals. Second, a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, fully connected layer, and SoftMax layer was established to train the features, classify the EEG signals, as well as predict the cognitive performance. The proposed network could give a good prediction with accuracy around 87%. Its superior in prediction accuracy as compared to a recurrent principal component analysis (PCA) network, a recurrent independent component correlation algorithm [independent component analysis (ICA)] network, a t-SNE support vector machine (SVM) network, a t-SNE back propagation (BP) neural network, a deep LSTM neural network, and a convolutional neural network were also demonstrated. Moreover, the performance of the proposed network with different activated channels were also investigated and compared. The results showed that the proposed network could make a relatively good prediction with only 16 channels. The proposed network would become a potentially useful tool to help a company in making marketing decisions and to help uncover the neural mechanisms behind individuals' decision-making behavior with low cost and high efficiency.</p>

<p>Objective: Tangent Space Mapping (TSM) using the geometric structure of the covariance matrices is an effective method to recognize multiclass motor imagery (MI). Compared with the traditional CSP method, the Riemann geometric method based on TSM takes into account the nonlinear information contained in the covariance matrix, and can extract more abundant and effective features. Moreover, the method is an unsupervised operation, which can reduce the time of feature extraction. However, EEG features induced by MI mental activities of different subjects are not the same, so selection of subject-specific discriminative EEG frequency components play a vital role in the recognition of multiclass MI. In order to solve the problem, a discriminative and multi-scale filter bank tangent space mapping (DMFBTSM) algorithm is proposed in this article to design the subject-specific Filter Bank (FB) so as to effectively recognize multiclass MI tasks.</p><p>Methods: On the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset, first, a non-parametric method of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) based on the sum of squared distances is used to select discriminative frequency bands for a subject; next, a multi-scale FB is generated according to the range of these frequency bands, and then decompose multi-channel EEG of the subject into multiple sub-bands combined with several time windows. Then TSM algorithm is used to estimate Riemannian tangent space features in each sub-band and finally a liner Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used for classification.</p><p>Main Results: The analysis results show that the proposed discriminative FB enhances the multi-scale TSM algorithm, improves the classification accuracy and reduces the execution time during training and testing. On the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset, the average session to session classification accuracy of nine subjects reached 77.33 ± 12.3%. When the training time and the test time are similar, the average classification accuracy is 2.56% higher than the latest TSM method based on multi-scale filter bank analysis technology. When the classification accuracy is similar, the training speed is increased by more than three times, and the test speed is increased two times more. Compared with Supervised Fisher Geodesic Minimum Distance to the Mean (Supervised FGMDRM), another new variant based on Riemann geometry classifier, the average accuracy is 3.36% higher, we also compared with the latest Deep Learning method, and the average accuracy of 10-fold cross validation improved by 2.58%.</p><p>Conclusion: Research shows that the proposed DMFBTSM algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of MI tasks.</p><p>Significance: Compared with the MFBTSM algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this article is expected to select frequency bands with good separability for specific subject to improve the classification accuracy of multiclass MI tasks and reduce the feature dimension to reduce training time and testing time.</p>

<p>Directed acyclic graphs or Bayesian networks that are popular in many AI-related sectors for probabilistic inference and causal reasoning can be mapped to probabilistic circuits built out of probabilistic bits (p-bits), analogous to binary stochastic neurons of stochastic artificial neural networks. In order to satisfy standard statistical results, individual p-bits not only need to be updated sequentially but also in order from the parent to the child nodes, necessitating the use of sequencers in software implementations. In this article, we first use SPICE simulations to show that an autonomous hardware Bayesian network can operate correctly without any clocks or sequencers, but only if the individual p-bits are appropriately designed. We then present a simple behavioral model of the autonomous hardware illustrating the essential characteristics needed for correct sequencer-free operation. This model is also benchmarked against SPICE simulations and can be used to simulate large-scale networks. Our results could be useful in the design of hardware accelerators that use energy-efficient building blocks suited for low-level implementations of Bayesian networks. The autonomous massively parallel operation of our proposed stochastic hardware has biological relevance since neural dynamics in brain is also stochastic and autonomous by nature.</p>

<p>Estrogens and estrogen-like molecules can modify the biology of several cell types. Estrogen receptors alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ) belong to the so-called classical family of estrogen receptors, while the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER-1) represents a non-classical estrogen receptor mainly located in the plasma membrane. As estrogen receptors are ubiquitously distributed, they can modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in several tissues and organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). Estrogens can exert neuroprotective roles by acting as anti-oxidants, promoting DNA repair, inducing the expression of growth factors, and modulating cerebral blood flow. Additionally, estrogen-dependent signaling pathways are involved in regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), thus influencing neurogenic processes. Since several estrogen-based therapies are used nowadays and estrogen-like molecules, including phytoestrogens and xenoestrogens, are omnipresent in our environment, estrogen-dependent changes in cell biology and tissue homeostasis have gained attention in human health and disease. This article provides a comprehensive literature review on the current knowledge of estrogen and estrogen-like molecules and their impact on cell survival and neurodegeneration, as well as their role in NSPCs proliferation/differentiation balance and neurogenesis.</p>

<p>Mitochondria are organelles responsible for bioenergetic metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and signal transmission essential for neurons due to their high energy consumption. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that mitochondria play a key role in axon degeneration and regeneration under physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs at an early stage of axon degeneration and involves oxidative stress, energy deficiency, imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics, defects in mitochondrial transport, and mitophagy dysregulation. The restoration of these defective mitochondria by enhancing mitochondrial transport, clearance of reactive oxidative species (ROS), and improving bioenergetic can greatly contribute to axon regeneration. In this paper, we focus on the biological behavior of axonal mitochondria in aging, injury (e.g., traumatic brain and spinal cord injury), and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, AD; Parkinson's disease, PD; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS) and consider the role of mitochondria in axon regeneration. We also compare the behavior of mitochondria in different diseases and outline novel therapeutic strategies for addressing abnormal mitochondrial biological behavior to promote axonal regeneration in neurological diseases and injuries.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, results from the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. This disease is characterized by cardinal non-motor and motor symptoms. Several studies have demonstrated that neuropeptides, such as ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, substance P, and neurotensin, are related to the onset of PD. This review mainly describes the changes in these neuropeptides and their receptors in the substantia nigra-striatum system as well as the other PD-related brain regions. Based on several in vitro and in vivo studies, most neuropeptides play a significant neuroprotective role in PD by preventing caspase-3 activation, decreasing mitochondrial-related oxidative stress, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, inhibiting microglial activation, and anti-autophagic activity. Thus, neuropeptides may provide a new strategy for PD therapy.</p>

<p>White matter lesions (WMLs) are a type of cerebrovascular disorder accompanied by demyelination and cognitive decline. Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (D1-NBP) is a neuroprotective drug used for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, although the function of DI-NBP on WML is still not clear. This study aims to investigate whether DI-NBP affects cognitive function and ameliorates demyelination in a model of WML. The bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model and in vitro brain slice cultures with low glucose and low oxygen (LGLO) treatment were adopted. The Dl-NBP was administered intragastrically for 28 days after BCAS or added at a dose of 50 μm for 48 h after LGLO. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated by an eight-arm radial maze. Demyelination was detected using a TEM. Mitochondrial dynamics were assessed by time-lapse imaging in the cultured brain slices. The function of the synapse was evaluated by the patch clamp technique. In BCAS mice, obvious demyelination and cognitive decline were observed, while both were significantly relieved by a high-dose D1-NBP treatment (100 mg/kg). Along with demyelination, mitochondrial accumulation in the axons was significantly increased in the BCAS mice model, but with the treatment of a high-dose D1-NBP, mitochondrial accumulation was mitigated, and the anterograde/retrograde transport of mitochondria was increased. Following the improved anterograde/retrograde transport of mitochondria, the synapse activity was significantly upregulated while the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was remarkably decreased in the cultured brain slices. In addition, we identified syntaphilin (SNPH) as the downstream target of D1-NBP. The overexpression of SNPH mediated the effects of D1-NBP in mitigating axonal mitochondrial accumulation. In conclusion, the D1-NBP treatment significantly relieved demyelination and improved spatial learning and memory in the WML model by promoting mitochondrial dynamics. These neuroprotective effects of D1-NBP were mediated by inhibiting the mitochondrial arching protein, SNPH, which provided a potential therapeutic target for WML.</p>

<p>Background: Although exercise is known to have a neuroprotective effect in aging, the mediators underlying the exercise-cognition association remain poorly understood. In this paper we aimed to study the molecular, brain, and behavioral changes related to physical activity and their potential role as mediators.</p><p>Methods: We obtained demographic, physical activity outcomes [sportive physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)], plasma biomarkers (TNF-α, ICAM-1, HGF, SDF1-α, and BDNF), structural-MRI (brain volume areas), psychological and sleep health (mood, depressive and distress symptoms, and sleep quality), and multi-domain cognitive data from 115 adults aged 50–70 years. We conducted linear regression models and mediation analyses stratifying results by sex in a final sample of 104 individuals [65 women (age = 56.75 ± 4.96) and 39 men (age = 58.59 ± 5.86)].</p><p>Results: Women engaging in greater amounts of exercising showed lower TNF-α levels and greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe volumes. Men engaging in greater amounts of exercise showed greater temporal lobe volumes. CRF levels were not related to any of the analyzed outcomes in women but in men higher CRF was associated with lower TNF-α, HGF and ventricle volumes, greater volume of temporal and parietal lobes and fewer depressive symptoms and better mood. In men, reduced TNF-α and HGF levels mediated brain and cognitive CRF-related benefits.</p><p>Conclusion: Our results show that exercise is a promising approach for influencing inflammation and brain volume and also contributes to ongoing discussions about the physiological mediators for the association between CRF and cognition in men.</p>

Objective
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an unpredictable and devastating comorbidity of epilepsy that is believed to be due to cardiorespiratory failure immediately after generalized convulsive seizures.


Methods
We performed cardiorespiratory monitoring of seizure‐induced death in mice carrying either a p.Arg1872Trp or p.Asn1768Asp mutation in a single Scn8a allele—mutations identified from patients who died from SUDEP—and of seizure‐induced death in pentylenetetrazole‐treated wild‐type mice.


Results
The primary cause of seizure‐induced death for all mice was apnea, as (1) apnea began during a seizure and continued for tens of minutes until terminal asystole, and (2) death was prevented by mechanical ventilation. Fatal seizures always included a tonic phase that was coincident with apnea. This tonic phase apnea was not sufficient to produce death, as it also occurred during many nonfatal seizures; however, all seizures that were fatal had tonic phase apnea. We also made the novel observation that continuous tonic diaphragm contraction occurred during tonic phase apnea, which likely contributes to apnea by preventing exhalation, and this was only fatal when breathing did not resume after the tonic phase ended. Finally, recorded seizures from a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy with a previously undocumented SCN8A likely pathogenic variant (p.Leu257Val) revealed similarities to those of the mice, namely, an extended tonic phase that was accompanied by apnea.


Interpretation
We conclude that apnea coincident with the tonic phase of a seizure, and subsequent failure to resume breathing, are the determining events that cause seizure‐induced death in Scn8a mutant mice. ANN NEUROL 2021

Objective
The objective of this study was to identify genetic variants on the X‐chromosome associated with Parkinson disease (PD) risk.


Methods
We performed an X‐chromosome–wide association study (XWAS) of PD risk by meta‐analyzing results from sex‐stratified analyses. To avoid spurious associations, we designed a specific harmonization pipeline for the X‐chromosome and focused on a European ancestry sample. We included 11,142 cases, 280,164 controls, and 5,379 proxy cases, based on parental history of PD. Additionally, we tested the association of significant variants with (1) PD risk in an independent replication with 1,561 cases and 2,465 controls and (2) putamen volume in 33,360 individuals from the UK Biobank.


Results
In the discovery meta‐analysis, we identified rs7066890 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06–1.14, p = 2.2 × 10−9), intron of GPM6B, and rs28602900 (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.07–1.14, p = 1.6 × 10−8) in a high gene density region including RPL10, ATP6A1, FAM50A, and PLXNA3. The rs28602900 association with PD was replicated (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03–1.30, p = 0.016) and shown to colocalize with a significant expression quantitative locus (eQTL) regulating RPL10 expression in the putamen and other brain tissues in the Genotype‐Tissue Expression Project. Additionally, the rs28602900 locus was found to be associated with reduced brain putamen volume. No results reached genome‐wide significance in the sex‐stratified analyses.


Interpretation
We report the first XWAS of PD and identify 2 genome‐wide significant loci. The rs28602900 association was replicated in an independent PD dataset and showed concordant effects in its association with putamen volume. Critically, rs26802900 is a significant eQTL of RPL10. These results support a role for ribosomal proteins in PD pathogenesis and show that the X‐chromosome contributes to PD genetic risk. ANN NEUROL 2021

Abstract
A fundamental skill of an intelligent mind is that of being able to rapidly discover the structural organization underlying the relations across the objects or the events in the world. Humans, thanks to language, master this skill. For example, a child learning that dolphins and cats can also be referred to as mammals, not only will infer the presence of a hierarchical organization for which dolphins and cats are subordinate exemplars of the category mammals, but will also derive that dolphins are, at least at one conceptual level, more similar to cats than to sharks, despite their indisputable higher perceptual similarity to the latter. The hippocampal‐entorhinal system, classically known for its involvement in relational and inferential memory, is a likely candidate to construct and hold these complex relational structures between concepts. To test this hypothesis, we trained healthy human adults to organize a novel audio‐visual object space into categories labeled with novel words. Crucially, a hierarchical taxonomy existed between the object categories, and participants discovered it via inference during a simple associative object‐to‐word training. Using functional MRI after learning, and a combination of ROI‐based multivariate analyses, we found that both the mid‐anterior hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex represented the inferred hierarchical structure between words: subordinate‐level words were represented more similarly to their related superordinate than to unrelated ones. This was paired, in the entorhinal cortex, by an additional signature of internalized structural representation of nested hierarchy: words referring to subordinate concepts belonging to the same superordinate category were represented more similarly compared with those not belonging to the same superordinate level: interestingly, this similarity was never directly taught to subjects nor it was made explicit during the task, but only indirectly derived through a logical inferential process and, crucially, contrasted the evidence coming from the definitional perceptual properties of the concepts. None of these results were observed before learning, when the same words were not yet semantically organized. A whole‐brain searchlight revealed that the effect in the entorhinal cortex extends to a wider network of areas, encompassing the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, partially overlapping with the semantic network.

GNX‐4728, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, does not protect against hypoxia‐ischemia induced neuronal necrosis in piglet putamen (indicated by bolt strike zone). Acute depletion of mitochondrial SOD2 and developmental differences in mitochondrial proteins, such as CypD, may limit the efficacy of mitochondrial‐targeted drugs for neonatal brain injury.

Abstract
Neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes significant morbidity despite treatment with therapeutic hypothermia. Mitochondrial dysfunction may drive the mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death, thereby making mitochondria prime targets for neuroprotection. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is one such target within mitochondria. In adult animal models, mPTP inhibition is neuroprotective. However, evidence for mPTP inhibition in neonatal models of neurologic disease is less certain. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of the mPTP small molecule inhibitor GNX‐4728 and examined the developmental presence of brain mPTP proteins for drug targeting in a neonatal piglet model of hypoxic‐ischemic brain injury. Male neonatal piglets were randomized to hypoxia‐ischemia (HI) or sham procedure with GNX‐4728 (15 mg/kg, IV) or vehicle (saline/cyclodextrin/DMSO, IV). GNX‐4728 was administered as a single dose within 5 min after resuscitation from bradycardic arrest. Normal, ischemic, and injured neurons were counted in putamen and somatosensory cortex using hematoxylin and eosin staining. In separate neonatal and juvenile pigs, western blots of putamen mitochondrial‐enriched fractions were used to evaluate mitochondrial integrity and the presence of mPTP proteins. We found that a single dose of GNX‐4728 did not protect putamen and cortical neurons from cell death after HI. However, loss of mitochondrial matrix integrity occurred within 6h after HI, and while mPTP components are present in the neonatal brain their levels were significantly different compared to that of a mature juvenile brain. Thus, the neonatal brain mPTP may not be a good target for current neurotherapeutic drugs that are developed based on adult mitochondria.

Abstract
Opioids are potent analgesics used to manage pain in both young and old, but the increased use in the pregnant population has significant individual and societal implications. Infants dependent on opioids, either through maternal or iatrogenic exposure, undergo neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), where they may experience withdrawal symptoms ranging from mild to severe. We present a detailed and original review of NOWS caused by maternal opioid exposure (mNOWS) and iatrogenic opioid intake (iNOWS). While these two entities have been assessed entirely separately, recognition and treatment of the clinical manifestations of NOWS overlap. Neonatal risk factors such as age, genetic predisposition, drug type, and clinical factors like type of opioid, cumulative dose of opioid exposure, and disease status affect the incidence of both mNOWS and iNOWS, as well as their severity. Recognition of withdrawal is dependent on clinical assessment of symptoms, and the use of clinical assessment tools designed to determine the need for pharmacotherapy. Treatment of NOWS relies on a combination of non‐pharmacological therapies and pharmacological options. Long‐term consequences of opioids and NOWS continue to generate controversy, with some evidence of anatomic brain changes, but conflicting animal and human clinical evidence of significant cognitive or behavioral impacts on school‐age children. We highlight the current knowledge on clinically relevant recognition, treatment, and consequences of NOWS, and identify new advances in clinical management of the neonate. This review brings a unique clinical perspective and critically analyzes gaps between the clinical problem and our preclinical understanding of NOWS.

<p>by Catalina Rivera, David Hofmann, Ilya Nemenman</p>

Biochemical processes in cells are governed by complex networks of many chemical species interacting stochastically in diverse ways and on different time scales. Constructing microscopically accurate models of such networks is often infeasible. Instead, here we propose a systematic framework for building <i>phenomenological</i> models of such networks from experimental data, focusing on accurately approximating the time it takes to complete the process, the First Passage (FP) time. Our phenomenological models are mixtures of Gamma distributions, which have a natural biophysical interpretation. The complexity of the models is adapted automatically to account for the amount of available data and its temporal resolution. The framework can be used for predicting behavior of FP systems under varying external conditions. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we build models for the distribution of inter-spike intervals of a morphologically complex neuron, a Purkinje cell, from experimental and simulated data. We demonstrate that the developed models can not only fit the data, but also make nontrivial predictions. We demonstrate that our coarse-grained models provide constraints on more mechanistically accurate models of the involved phenomena.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AJj-_t4aBqM" width="1" />

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTC) CRISPR locus diversity has long been studied solely investigating the presence/absence of a known set of spacers. Unveiling the genetic mechanisms of its evolution requires a more exhaustive reconstruction in a large amount of representative strains.
In this article, we point out and resolve, with a new pipeline, the problem of CRISPR reconstruction based directly on short read sequences in <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>. We first show that the process we set up, that we coin as “CRISPRbuilder-TB” (https://github.com/cguyeux/CRISPRbuilder-TB), allows an efficient reconstruction of simulated or real CRISPRs, even when including complex evolutionary steps like the insertions of mobile elements. Compared to more generalist tools, the whole process is much more precise and robust, and requires only minimal manual investigation. Second, we show that more than 1/3 of the currently complete genomes available for this complex in the public databases contain largely erroneous CRISPR loci. Third, we highlight how both the classical experimental <i>in vitro</i> approach and the basic <i>in silico</i> spoligotyping provided by existing analytic tools miss a whole diversity of this locus in MTC, by not capturing duplications, spacer and direct repeats variants, and IS<i>6110</i> insertion locations. This description is extended in a second article that describes MTC-CRISPR diversity and suggests general rules for its evolution. This work opens perspectives for an in-depth exploration of <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> CRISPR loci diversity and of mechanisms involved in its evolution and its functionality, as well as its adaptation to other CRISPR locus-harboring bacterial species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sMB0wMI08DA" width="1" />

<p>by Guy Avraham, J. Ryan Morehead, Hyosub E. Kim, Richard B. Ivry</p>

The motor system demonstrates an exquisite ability to adapt to
changes in the environment and to quickly reset when these changes prove transient. If similar environmental changes are encountered in the future, learning may be faster, a phenomenon known as savings. In studies of sensorimotor learning, a central component of savings is attributed to the explicit recall of the task structure and appropriate compensatory strategies. Whether implicit adaptation also contributes to savings remains subject to debate. We tackled this question by measuring, in parallel, explicit and implicit adaptive responses in a visuomotor rotation task, employing a protocol that typically elicits savings. While the initial rate of learning was faster in the second exposure to the perturbation, an analysis decomposing the 2 processes showed the benefit to be solely associated with explicit re-aiming. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease after relearning in aftereffect magnitudes during no-feedback trials, a direct measure of implicit adaptation. In a second experiment, we isolated implicit adaptation using clamped visual feedback, a method known to eliminate the contribution of explicit learning processes. Consistent with the results of the first experiment, participants exhibited a marked reduction in the adaptation function, as well as an attenuated aftereffect when relearning from the clamped feedback. Motivated by these results, we reanalyzed data from prior studies and observed a consistent, yet unappreciated pattern of attenuation of implicit adaptation during relearning. These results indicate that explicit and implicit sensorimotor processes exhibit opposite effects upon relearning: Explicit learning shows savings, while implicit adaptation becomes attenuated<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bHjbYsBzork" width="1" />

Objective
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and neurological deficits in children and young adults, however no pharmacological intervention is available to treat these patients. Although more than 95% of bAVMs are sporadic without family history, the pathogenesis of sporadic bAVMs is largely unknown, which may account for the lack of therapeutic options. KRAS mutations are frequently observed in cancer, and a recent unprecedented finding of these mutations in sporadic human bAVMs offers a new direction in the research. Using a novel adeno‐associated virus targeting brain endothelium (AAV‐BR1), the current study tested if endothelial KRASG12V mutation induces sporadic bAVMs in mice.


Methods
Five‐week‐old mice were systemically injected with either AAV‐BR1‐GFP or ‐KRASG12V. At 8 weeks after the AAV injection, bAVM formation and characteristics were addressed by histological and molecular analyses. The effect of MEK/ERK inhibition on KRASG12V‐induced bAVMs was determined by treatment of trametinib, an FDA‐approved MEK/ERK inhibitor.


Results
The viral‐mediated KRASG12V overexpression induced bAVMs which were composed of a tangled nidus mirroring the distinctive morphology of human bAVMs. The bAVMs were accompanied by focal angiogenesis, intracerebral hemorrhages, altered vascular constituents, neuroinflammation, and impaired sensory/cognitive/motor functions. Finally, we confirmed that bAVM growth was inhibited by trametinib treatment.


Interpretation
Our innovative approach using AAV‐BR1 confirms that KRAS mutations promote bAVM development via the MEK/ERK pathway, and provides a preclinical mouse model of bAVMs which will be useful to develop a therapeutic strategy for bAVM patients.

Objective
The present work was undertaken to study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between amyloid‐beta (Aβ) aggregation as measured by the Aβ1–42/1–40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (beta‐secretase 1, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–38) and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 0.73–0.86, all p &lt; 0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 0.50–0.64, all p &lt; 0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1–38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1–42/1–40 ratios, and t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their cotwins (r range = −0.28 to 0.58, all p &lt; .007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 0.49–0.61, all p &lt; 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes. ANN NEUROL 2021

Abstract
Stroke‐related damage to the crossed lateral corticospinal tract causes motor deficits in the contralateral (paretic) limb. To restore functional movement in the paretic limb, the nervous system may increase its reliance on ipsilaterally descending motor pathways, including the uncrossed lateral corticospinal tract, the reticulospinal tract, the rubrospinal tract, and the vestibulospinal tract. Our knowledge about the role of these pathways for upper limb motor recovery is incomplete, and even less is known about the role of these pathways for lower limb motor recovery. Understanding the role of ipsilateral motor pathways to paretic lower limb movement and recovery after stroke may help improve our rehabilitative efforts and provide alternate solutions to address stroke‐related impairments. These advances are important because walking and mobility impairments are major contributors to long‐term disability after stroke, and improving walking is a high priority for individuals with stroke. This perspective highlights evidence regarding the contributions of ipsilateral motor pathways from the contralesional hemisphere and spinal interneuronal pathways for paretic lower limb movement and recovery. This perspective also identifies opportunities for future research to expand our knowledge about ipsilateral motor pathways and provides insights into how this information may be used to guide rehabilitation.

A domain for combined forelimb and hindlimb movements in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos was identified. This domain had dense intrinsic connections within PPC and reciprocal connections with frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas of the ipsilateral cortex. It also had connections with the homotopic region of the contralateral cortex.







Abstract
Previous studies in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnetti) have demonstrated that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into several functionally distinct domains, each of which mediates a specific type of complex movements (e.g., reaching, grasping, hand‐to‐mouth) and has a different pattern of cortical connections. Here we identified a medially located domain in PPC where combined forelimb and hindlimb movements, as if climbing or running, were evoked by long‐train intracortical microstimulation. We injected anatomical tracers in this climbing/running domain of PPC to reveal its cortical connections. Our results showed the PPC climbing domain had dense intrinsic connections within rostral PPC and reciprocal connections with forelimb and hindlimb region in primary motor cortex (M1) of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Fewer connections were with dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), and cingulate motor (CMA) areas, as well as somatosensory cortex including areas 3a, 3b, and 1–2, secondary somatosensory (S2), parietal ventral (PV), and retroinsular (Ri) areas. The rostral portion of the climbing domain had more connections with primary somatosensory cortex than the caudal portion. Cortical projections were found in functionally matched domains in M1 and premotor cortex (PMC). Similar patterns of connections with fewer labeled neurons and terminals were seen in the contralateral hemisphere. These connection patterns are consistent with the proposed role of the climbing/running domain as part of a parietal‐frontal network for combined use of the limbs in locomotion as in climbing and running. The cortical connections identify this action‐specific domain in PPC as a more somatosensory driven domain.

<p>Cue-evoked persistent activity is neural activity that persists beyond stimulation of a sensory cue and has been described in many regions of the brain, including primary sensory areas. Nonetheless, the functional role that persistent activity plays in primary sensory areas is enigmatic. However, one form of persistent activity in a primary sensory area is the representation of time between a visual stimulus and a water reward. This “reward timing activity”—observed within the primary visual cortex—has been implicated in informing the timing of visually cued, reward-seeking actions. Although rewarding outcomes are sufficient to engender interval timing activity within V1, it is unclear to what extent cue-evoked persistent activity exists outside of reward conditioning, and whether temporal relationships to other outcomes (such as behaviorally neutral or aversive outcomes) are able to engender timing activity. Here we describe the existence of cue-evoked persistent activity in mouse V1 following three conditioning strategies: pseudo-conditioning (where unpaired, monocular visual stimuli are repeatedly presented to an animal), neutral conditioning (where monocular visual stimuli are paired with a binocular visual stimulus, at a delay), and aversive conditioning (where monocular visual stimuli are paired with a tail shock, at a delay). We find that these conditioning strategies exhibit persistent activity that takes one of three forms, a sustained increase of activity; a sustained decrease of activity; or a delayed, transient peak of activity, as previously observed following conditioning with delayed reward. However, these conditioning strategies do not result in visually cued interval timing activity, as observed following appetitive conditioning. Moreover, we find that neutral conditioning increases the magnitude of cue-evoked responses whereas aversive conditioning strongly diminished both the response magnitude and the prevalence of cue-evoked persistent activity. These results demonstrate that cue-evoked persistent activity within V1 can exist outside of conditioning visual stimuli with delayed outcomes and that this persistent activity can be uniquely modulated across different conditioning strategies using unconditioned stimuli of varying behavioral relevance. Together, these data extend our understanding of cue-evoked persistent activity within a primary sensory cortical network and its ability to be modulated by salient outcomes.</p>

<p>In our daily lives, we continuously evaluate feedback information, update our knowledge, and adapt our behavior in order to reach desired goals. This ability to learn from feedback information, however, declines with age. Previous research has indicated that certain higher-level learning processes, such as feedback evaluation, integration of feedback information, and updating of knowledge, seem to be affected by age, and recent studies have shown how the adaption of choice behavior following feedback can differ with age. The neural mechanisms underlying this age-related change in choice behavior during learning, however, remain unclear. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the relation between learning-related neural processes and choice behavior during feedback learning in two age groups. Behavioral and fMRI data were collected, while a group of young (age 18–30) and older (age 60–75) adults performed a probabilistic learning task consisting of 10 blocks of 20 trials each. On each trial, the participants chose between a house and a face, after which they received visual feedback (loss vs. gain). In each block, either the house or the face image had a higher probability of yielding a reward (62.5 vs. 37.5%). Participants were instructed to try to maximize their gains. Our results showed that less successful learning in older adults, as indicated by a lower learning rate, corresponded with a higher tendency to switch to the other stimulus option, and with a reduced adaptation of this switch choice behavior following positive feedback. At the neural level, activation following positive and negative feedback was found to be less distinctive in the older adults, due to a smaller feedback-evaluation response to positive feedback in this group. Furthermore, whereas young adults displayed increased levels of knowledge updating prior to adapting choice behavior, we did not find this effect in older adults. Together, our results suggest that diminished learning performance with age corresponds with diminished evaluation of positive feedback and reduced knowledge updating related to changes in choice behavior, indicating how such differences in feedback processing at the trial level in older adults might lead to reduced learning performance across trials.</p>

<p>The resting-state human electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum is dominated by alpha (8–12 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations, and also includes non-oscillatory broadband activity inversely related to frequency (1/f activity). Gratton proposed that alpha and theta oscillations are both related to cognitive control function, though in a complementary manner. Alpha activity is hypothesized to facilitate the maintenance of representations, such as task sets in preparation for expected task conditions. In contrast, theta activity would facilitate changes in representations, such as the updating of task sets in response to unpredicted task demands. Therefore, theta should be related to reactive control (which may prompt changes in task representations), while alpha may be more relevant to proactive control (which implies the maintenance of current task representations). Less is known about the possible relationship between 1/f activity and cognitive control, which was analyzed here in an exploratory fashion. To investigate these hypothesized relationships, we recorded eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state EEG from younger and older adults and subsequently tested their performance on a cued flanker task, expected to elicit both proactive and reactive control processes. Results showed that alpha power and 1/f offset were smaller in older than younger adults, whereas theta power did not show age-related reductions. Resting alpha power and 1/f offset were associated with proactive control processes, whereas theta power was related to reactive control as measured by the cued flanker task. All associations were present over and above the effect of age, suggesting that these resting-state EEG correlates could be indicative of trait-like individual differences in cognitive control performance, which may be already evident in younger adults, and are still similarly present in healthy older adults.</p>

<p>Microsaccades, small saccadic eye movements occurring during fixation, have been suggested to be modulated by various sensory, cognitive, and affective processes relating to arousal. Although the modulation of fatigue-related arousal on microsaccade behavior has previously been characterized, the influence of other aspects of arousal, such as emotional arousal, is less understood. Moreover, microsaccades are modulated by cognitive processes (e.g., voluntary saccade preparation) that could also be linked to arousal. To investigate the influence of emotional arousal, saccade preparation, and global luminance levels on microsaccade behavior, emotional auditory stimuli were presented prior to the onset of a fixation cue whose color indicated to look either at the peripheral stimulus (pro-saccade) or in the opposite direction of the stimulus (anti-saccade). Microsaccade behavior was found to be significantly modulated by saccade preparation and global luminance level, but not emotional arousal. In the pro- and anti-saccade task, microsaccade rate was lower during anti-saccade preparation as compared to pro-saccade preparation, though microsaccade dynamics were comparable during both trial types. Our results reveal a differential role of arousal linked to emotion, fatigue, saccade preparation, and global luminance level on microsaccade behavior.</p>

<p>Dopamine (DA) modulates the activity of nuclei within the ascending and descending auditory pathway. Previous studies have identified neurons and fibers in the inferior colliculus (IC) which are positively labeled for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine. However, the origins of the tyrosine hydroxylase positive projections to the inferior colliculus have not been fully explored. The lateral lemniscus (LL) provides a robust inhibitory projection to the inferior colliculus and plays a role in the temporal processing of sound. In the present study, immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase was examined in animals with and without 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. Lesioning, with 6-OHDA placed in the inferior colliculus, led to a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immuno-positive labeling in the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus. Immunolabeling for dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), enzymes responsible for the synthesis of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), respectively, were evaluated. Very little immunoreactivity for DBH and no immunoreactivity for PNMT was found within the cell bodies of the dorsal, intermediate, or ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. The results indicate that catecholaminergic neurons of the lateral lemniscus are likely dopaminergic and not noradrenergic or adrenergic. Next, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used to confirm that dopamine is present in the inferior colliculus and nuclei that send projections to the inferior colliculus, including the cochlear nucleus (CN), superior olivary complex (SOC), lateral lemniscus, and auditory cortex (AC). Finally, fluorogold, a retrograde tracer, was injected into the inferior colliculus of adult rats. Each subdivision of the lateral lemniscus contained fluorogold within the somata, with the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus showing the most robust projections to the inferior colliculus. Fluorogold-tyrosine hydroxylase colocalization within the lateral lemniscus was assessed. The dorsal and intermediate nuclei neurons exhibiting similar degrees of colocalization, while neurons of the ventral nucleus had significantly fewer colocalized fluorogold-tyrosine hydroxylase labeled neurons. These results suggest that several auditory nuclei that project to the inferior colliculus contain dopamine, dopaminergic neurons in the lateral lemniscus project to the inferior colliculus and that dopaminergic neurotransmission is poised to play a pivotal role in the function of the inferior colliculus.</p>

<p>Neuronal firing and neuron-to-neuron synaptic wiring are currently widely described as orchestrated by astrocytes—elaborately ramified glial cells tiling the cortical and hippocampal space into non-overlapping domains, each covering hundreds of individual dendrites and hundreds thousands synapses. A key component to astrocytic signaling is the dynamics of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> which displays multiscale spatiotemporal patterns from short confined elemental Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (puffs) to Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves expanding through many cells. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of astrocyte morphology, coupling local synaptic activity to astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in perisynaptic astrocytic processes and morphology-defined mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in a distributed model. To this end, we build simplified realistic data-driven spatial network templates and compile model equations as defined by local cell morphology. The input to the model is spatially uncorrelated stochastic synaptic activity. The proposed modeling approach is validated by statistics of simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at a single cell level. In multicellular templates we observe regular sequences of cell entrainment in Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, as a result of interplay between stochastic input and morphology variability between individual astrocytes. Our approach adds spatial dimension to the existing astrocyte models by employment of realistic morphology while retaining enough flexibility and scalability to be embedded in multiscale heterocellular models of neural tissue. We conclude that the proposed approach provides a useful description of neuron-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activity in the astrocyte syncytium.</p>

<p>Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are a distressful condition. We aimed to investigate the BPSD distribution in subjects with cognitive impairment, and the potential correlations between BPSD and neurodegeneration in terms of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and brain atrophy.</p><p>Methods: One-hundred patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (Alzheimer’s disease, AD; Lewy-body disease, LBD; frontotemporal dementia, FTD; vascular dementia, VD) underwent a complete diagnostic workup, including 3T-MRI and/or CT and CSF. Cortical atrophy was assessed with medial temporal atrophy (MTA), posterior atrophy (PA), and global cortical atrophy-frontal lobe (GCA-F) scales. BPSD were rated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and BPSD clusters were defined according to the European Alzheimer Disease Consortium.</p><p>Results: Delusions, hallucinations, and psychosis cluster were differently distributed among the diagnostic groups (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.001, and p &lt; 0.05), with LBD patients showing higher scores for hallucinations (vs. MCI, p &lt; 0.001, and AD, p &lt; 0.05) and psychosis cluster (vs. MCI, p &lt; 0.05). In primary dementias, we found a negative correlation between NPI total score and tau levels (p = 0.08), confirmed by beta regression (p &lt; 0.01), while a positive non-significant relationship was observed in MCI. Higher GCA-F scores were associated with delusions and apathy (p &lt; 0.05, on both hemispheres) and hallucinations (left: p &lt; 0.01, right: p &lt; 0.05). GCA-F scores were positively correlated with psychosis cluster (right: p &lt; 0.05), and agitation/aggression (left: p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, nighttime disturbances were positively correlated with both GCA-F and MTA scores (left: p &lt; 0.01; right: p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Our results suggest that psychotic symptoms are significantly more represented in LBD patients and that CSF tau and frontal atrophy are associated with the occurrence and severity of BPSD in clinical practice. Longitudinal studies are however required to ascertain their actual predictive value.</p>

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are a small population of undifferentiated cells that have the capacity for self-renewal and differentiate into all blood cell lineages. These cells are the most useful cells for clinical transplantations and for regenerative medicine. So far, it has not been possible to expand adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without losing their self-renewal properties. CD74 is a cell surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and its mRNA is known to be expressed in HSCs. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking CD74 exhibit an accumulation of HSCs in the bone marrow (BM) due to their increased potential to repopulate and compete for BM niches. Our results suggest that CD74 regulates the maintenance of the HSCs and CD18 expression. Its absence leads to induced survival of these cells and accumulation of quiescent and proliferating cells. Furthermore, in in vitro experiments, blocking of CD74 elevated the numbers of HSPCs. Thus, we suggest that blocking CD74 could lead to improved clinical insight into BM transplant protocols, enabling improved engraftment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vmo-KLRPzv8" width="1" />

Objective
Understanding how different parts of the immune system contribute to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease is a burning challenge with important therapeutic implications. We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types.


Methods
We used summary statistics from the most recent meta‐analysis of genomewide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types, as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease‐associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus.


Results
We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these 2 cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3.


Interpretation
Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor, and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021

Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body spectrum diseases (LBDs) are associated with a specific risk for clinical depression. In the present clinicopathological study with 73 patients with LBD, we observed that the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neuron density was markedly lower in patients who had comorbid depression antemortem than in nondepressed patients (1.52 vs 2.32 n/mm2, p = 0.004). There were no differences in cognition, motor disease severity, antiparkinsonian medications, or disease duration between groups. The results implicate the substantia nigra as an important psychomotor modulatory area of mood in patients with Lewy body disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021

<p>The extensive dendritic arbor of neurons is thought to be actively involved in the processing of information. Dendrites contain a rich diversity of ligand- and voltage-activated ion channels as well as metabotropic receptors. In addition, they are capable of releasing calcium from intracellular stores. Under specific conditions, large neurons produce calcium spikes that are locally restricted to a dendritic section. To investigate calcium signaling in dendrites, we introduce TubuTag, a genetically encoded ratiometric calcium sensor anchored to the cytoskeleton. TubuTag integrates cytoplasmic calcium signals by irreversible photoconversion from green to red fluorescence when illuminated with violet light. We used a custom two-photon microscope with a large field of view to image pyramidal neurons in CA1 at subcellular resolution. Photoconversion was strongest in the most distal parts of the apical dendrite, suggesting a gradient in the amplitude of dendritic calcium signals. As the read-out of fluorescence can be performed several hours after photoconversion, TubuTag will help investigating dendritic signal integration and calcium homeostasis in large populations of neurons.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the world’s second most common neurodegenerative disease that is associated with age. With the aging of the population, patients with PD are increasing in number year by year. Most such patients lose their ability to self-care with disease progression, which brings an incalculable burden to individual families and society. The pathogenesis of PD is complex, and its clinical manifestations are diverse. Therefore, it is of great significance to screen for circulating biomarkers associated with PD to reveal its pathogenesis and develop objective diagnostic methods so as to prevent, control, and treat the disease. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered to be effective biomarkers for various diseases due to their stability, and resistance to RNAase digestion and extreme conditions in circulating fluids. Here, we review recent advances in the detection of abnormally expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in PD circulating fluids, and discuss the function and molecular mechanisms of plasma or serum miR-124, miR-132, miR-29, miR-221, miR-7, miR-433, and miR-153 in the regulation and progression of PD. Additionally, application of the differential expression of lncRNAs in circulating fluid in the pathological progression and diagnosis of PD is also reviewed. In short, the determination of abnormally expressed circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs will be valuable for the future diagnosis and treatment of PD.</p>

<p>Since their introduction in the 1840s, one of the largest mysteries of modern anesthesia are how general anesthetics create the state of reversible loss of consciousness. Increasing researchers have shown that neural pathways that regulate endogenous sleep–wake systems are also involved in general anesthesia. Recently, the Lateral Habenula (LHb) was considered as a hot spot for both natural sleep–wake and propofol-induced sedation; however, the role of the LHb and related pathways in the isoflurane-induced unconsciousness has yet to be identified. Here, using real-time calcium fiber photometry recordings in vivo, we found that isoflurane reversibly increased the activity of LHb glutamatergic neurons. Then, we selectively ablated LHb glutamatergic neurons in Vglut2-cre mice, which caused a longer induction time and less recovery time along with a decrease in delta-band power in mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Furthermore, using a chemogenetic approach to specifically activate LHb glutamatergic neurons shortened the induction time and prolonged the recovery time in mice under isoflurane anesthesia with an increase in delta-band power. In contrast, chemogenetic inhibition of LHb glutamatergic neurons was very similar to the effects of selective lesions of LHb glutamatergic neurons. Finally, optogenetic activation of LHb glutamatergic neurons or the synaptic terminals of LHb glutamatergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) produced a hypnosis-promoting effect in isoflurane anesthesia with an increase in slow wave activity. Our results suggest that LHb glutamatergic neurons and pathway are vital in modulating isoflurane anesthesia.</p>

<p>Complement, a feature of the innate immune system that targets pathogens for phagocytic clearance and promotes inflammation, is tightly regulated to prevent damage to host tissue. This regulation is paramount in the central nervous system (CNS) since complement proteins degrade neuronal synapses during development, homeostasis, and neurodegeneration. We propose that dysregulated complement, particularly C1 or C3b, may errantly target synapses for immune-mediated clearance, therefore highlighting regulatory failure as a major potential mediator of neurological disease. First, we explore the mechanics of molecular neuroimmune relationships for the regulatory proteins: Complement Receptor 1, C1-Inhibitor, Factor H, and the CUB-sushi multiple domain family. We propose that biophysical and chemical principles offer clues for understanding mechanisms of dysregulation. Second, we describe anticipated effects to CNS disease processes (particularly Alzheimer's Disease) and nest our ideas within existing basic science, clinical, and epidemiological findings. Finally, we illustrate how the concepts presented within this manuscript provoke new ways of approaching age-old neurodegenerative processes. Every component of this model is testable by straightforward experimentation and highlights the untapped potential of complement dysregulation as a driver of CNS disease. This includes a putative role for complement-based neurotherapeutic agents and companion biomarkers.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.636454">Rationalizing the Role of Monosodium Glutamate in the Protein Aggregation Through Biophysical Approaches: Potential Impact on Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the world’s most extensively used food additive and is generally recognized as safe according to the FDA. However, it is well reported that MSG is associated with a number of neurological diseases, and in turn, neurological diseases are associated with protein aggregation. This study rationalized the role of MSG in protein aggregation using different biophysical techniques such as absorption, far-UV CD, DLS, and ITC. Kinetic measurements revealed that MSG causes significant enhancement of aggregation of BSA through a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. Also, CTAB-BSA aggregation is enhanced by MSG significantly. MSG-induced BSA aggregation also exhibits the formation of irreversible aggregates, temperature dependence, non-Arrhenius behavior, and enhancement of hydrodynamic diameter. From the isothermal titration calorimetry measurement, the significant endothermic heat of the interaction of BSA-MSG indicates that protein aggregation may be due to the coupling of MSG with the protein. The determined enthalpy change (ΔH) is largely positive, also suggesting an endothermic nature, whereas entropy change (ΔS) is positive and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is largely negative, suggesting the spontaneous nature of the interaction. Furthermore, even a low concentration of MSG is involved in the unfolding of the secondary structure of protein with the disappearance of original peaks and the formation of a unique peak in the far-UV CD, which is an attention-grabbing observation. This is the first investigation which links the dietary MSG with protein aggregation and thus will be very instrumental in understanding the mechanism of various MSG-related human physiological as well as neurological diseases.</p>

<p>Remyelination is a naturally occurring response to demyelination and has a central role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Recently we demonstrated that a novel MRI technique entitled Relaxation Along a Fictitious Field (RAFF) in the rotating frame of rank n (RAFFn) achieved exceptional sensitivity in detecting the demyelination processes induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in rat brain. In the present work, our aim was to test whether RAFF4, along with magnetization transfer (MT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), would be capable of detecting the changes in the myelin content and microstructure caused by modifications of myelin sheets around axons or by gliosis during the remyelination phase after LPC-induced demyelination in the corpus callosum of rats. We collected MRI data with RAFF4, MT and DTI at 3 days after injection (demyelination stage) and at 38 days after injection (remyelination stage) of LPC (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 9). Cell density and myelin content were assessed by histology. All MRI metrics detected differences between LPC-injected and control groups of animals in the demyelination stage, on day 3. In the remyelination phase (day 38), RAFF4, MT parameters, fractional anisotropy, and axial diffusivity detected signs of a partial recovery consistent with the remyelination evident in histology. Radial diffusivity had undergone a further increase from day 3 to 38 and mean diffusivity revealed a complete recovery correlating with the histological assessment of cell density attributed to gliosis. The combination of RAFF4, MT and DTI has the potential to differentiate between normal, demyelinated and remyelinated axons and gliosis and thus it may be able to provide a more detailed assessment of white matter pathologies in several neurological diseases.</p>

<p>Successful surgical treatment of patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy remains challenging, especially in cases for which it is difficult to define the area of cortex from which seizures originate, the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Various diagnostic methods are needed to select surgical candidates and determine the extent of resection. Interictal magnetoencephalography (MEG) with source imaging has proven to be useful for presurgical evaluation, but the use of ictal MEG data remains limited. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether pre-ictal variations of spectral properties of neural activity from ictal MEG recordings are predictive of SOZ location.We performed a 4 h overnight MEG recording in an 8-year-old child with drug-resistant focal epilepsy of suspected right fronto-temporal origin and captured one ~45-s seizure. The patient underwent a right temporal resection from the anterior temporal neocortex and amygdala to the mid-posterior temporal neocortex, sparing the hippocampus proper. She remains seizure-free 21 months postoperatively. The histopathological assessment confirmed frank focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIa in the MEG-defined SOZ, which was based on source imaging of averaged ictal spikes at seizure onset. We investigated temporal changes (inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal periods) together with spatial differences (SOZ vs. control regions) in spectral parameters of background brain activity, namely the aperiodic broadband offset and slope, and assessed how they confounded the interpretation of apparent variations of signal power in typical electrophysiological bands. Our data show that the SOZ was associated with a higher aperiodic offset and exponent during the seizure compared to control regions. Both parameters increased in all regions from 2 min before the seizure onwards. Regions anatomically closer to the SOZ also expressed higher values compared to contralateral regions, potentially indicating ictal spread. We also show that narrow-band power changes were caused by these fluctuations in the aperiodic component of ongoing brain activity. Our results indicate that the broadband aperiodic component of ongoing brain activity cannot be reduced to background noise of no physiological interest, and rather may be indicative of the neuropathophysiology of the SOZ. We believe these findings will inspire future studies of ictal MEG cases and confirm their significance.</p>

<p>Prior work shows that the possibility of action to an object (visual affordance) facilitates attentional deployment. We sought to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this modulation of attention by examining ERPs to target objects that were either congruently or incongruently gripped for their use in the presence of a congruently or incongruently gripped distractor. Participants responded to the presence or absence of a target object matching a preceding action word with a distractor object presented in the opposite location. Participants were faster in responding to congruently gripped targets compared to incongruently gripped targets. There was a reduced N2pc potential when the target was congruently gripped, and the distractor was incongruently gripped compared to the conditions where targets were incongruently gripped or when the distractor, as well as target, was congruently gripped. The N2pc results indicate that target selection is easier when action information is congruent with an object’s use.</p>

<p>Vision is known to improve human postural responses to external perturbations. This study investigates the role of vision for the responses to continuous pseudorandom support surface translations in the body sagittal plane in three visual conditions: with the eyes closed (EC), in stroboscopic illumination (EO/SI; only visual position information) and with eyes open in continuous illumination (EO/CI; position and velocity information) with the room as static visual scene (or the interior of a moving cabin, in some of the trials). In the frequency spectrum of the translation stimulus we distinguished on the basis of the response patterns between a low-frequency, mid-frequency, and high-frequency range (LFR: 0.0165-0.14 Hz; MFR: 0.15–0.57 Hz; HFR: 0.58–2.46 Hz). With EC, subjects’ mean sway response gain was very low in the LFR. On average it increased with EO/SI (although not to a significant degree p = 0.078) and more so with EO/CI (p &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup>). In contrast, the average gain in the MFR decreased from EC to EO/SI (although not to a significant degree, p = 0.548) and further to EO/CI (p = 0.0002). In the HFR, all three visual conditions produced, similarly, high gain levels. A single inverted pendulum (SIP) model controlling center of mass (COM) balancing about the ankle joints formally described the EC response as being strongly shaped by a resonance phenomenon arising primarily from the control’s proprioceptive feedback loop. The effect of adding visual information in these simulations lies in a reduction of the resonance, similar as in the experiments. Extending the model to a double inverted pendulum (DIP) suggested in addition a biomechanical damping effective from trunk sway in the hip joints on the resonance.</p>

<p>Reinforcement learning is a paradigm that can account for how organisms learn to adapt their behavior in complex environments with sparse rewards. To partition an environment into discrete states, implementations in spiking neuronal networks typically rely on input architectures involving place cells or receptive fields specified ad hoc by the researcher. This is problematic as a model for how an organism can learn appropriate behavioral sequences in unknown environments, as it fails to account for the unsupervised and self-organized nature of the required representations. Additionally, this approach presupposes knowledge on the part of the researcher on how the environment should be partitioned and represented and scales poorly with the size or complexity of the environment. To address these issues and gain insights into how the brain generates its own task-relevant mappings, we propose a learning architecture that combines unsupervised learning on the input projections with biologically motivated clustered connectivity within the representation layer. This combination allows input features to be mapped to clusters; thus the network self-organizes to produce clearly distinguishable activity patterns that can serve as the basis for reinforcement learning on the output projections. On the basis of the MNIST and Mountain Car tasks, we show that our proposed model performs better than either a comparable unclustered network or a clustered network with static input projections. We conclude that the combination of unsupervised learning and clustered connectivity provides a generic representational substrate suitable for further computation.</p>

<p>This review focuses on the neuronal and circuit mechanisms involved in the generation of the theta (θ) rhythm and of its participation in behavior. Data have accumulated indicating that θ arises from interactions between medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS-DbB) and intra-hippocampal circuits. The intrinsic properties of MS-DbB and hippocampal neurons have also been shown to play a key role in θ generation. A growing number of studies suggest that θ may represent a timing mechanism to temporally organize movement sequences, memory encoding, or planned trajectories for spatial navigation. To accomplish those functions, θ and gamma (γ) oscillations interact during the awake state and REM sleep, which are considered to be critical for learning and memory processes. Further, we discuss that the loss of this interaction is at the base of various neurophatological conditions.</p>

<p>A presynaptic protein closely related to Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein (α-Syn), has been studied extensively regarding its pathogenic mechanisms. As a physiological protein in presynapses, however, α-Syn's physiological function remains unclear. Its location in nerve terminals and effects on membrane fusion also imply its functional role in synaptic transmission, including its possible interaction with high-curvature membranes via its N-terminus and amorphous C-terminus. PD-related mutants that disrupt the membrane interaction (e.g., A30P and G51D) additionally suggest a relationship between α-Syn's pathogenic mechanisms and physiological roles through the membrane binding. Here, we summarize recent research on how α-Syn and its variants interact with membranes and influence synaptic transmission. We list several membrane-related connections between the protein's physiological function and the pathological mechanisms that stand to expand current understandings of α-Syn.</p>

<p>Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) with neurological involvement are inherited genetic diseases of the metabolism characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and the accumulation of undegraded substrates altering glial and neuronal function. Often, patients with neurological manifestations present with damage to the gray and white matter and irreversible neuronal decline. The use of animal models of LSDs has greatly facilitated studying and identifying potential mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction, including alterations in availability and function of synaptic proteins, modifications of membrane structure, deficits in docking, exocytosis, recycling of synaptic vesicles, and inflammation-mediated remodeling of synapses. Although some extrapolations from findings in adult-onset conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease have been reported, the pathogenetic mechanisms underpinning cognitive deficits in LSDs are still largely unclear. Without being fully inclusive, the goal of this mini-review is to present a discussion on possible mechanisms leading to synaptic dysfunction in LSDs.</p>

<p>Manual ELISA assays are the most commonly used methods for quantification of biomarkers; however, they often show inter- and intra-laboratory variability that limits their wide use. Here, we compared the Innotest ELISA method with two fully automated platforms (Lumipulse and Elecsys) to determine whether these new methods can provide effective substitutes for ELISA assays. We included 149 patients with AD (n = 34), MCI (n = 94) and non-AD dementias (n = 21). Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau were quantified using the ELISA method (Innotest, Fujirebio Europe), CLEIA method on a Lumipulse G600II (Fujirebio Diagnostics), and ECLIA method on a Cobas e 601 (Roche Diagnostics) instrument. We found a high correlation between the three methods, although there were systematic differences between biomarker values measured by each method. Both Lumipulse and Elecsys methods were highly concordant with clinical diagnoses, and the combination of Lumipulse Aβ42 and P-tau had the highest discriminating power (AUC 0.915, 95% CI 0.822–1.000). We also assessed the agreement of AT(N) classification for each method with AD diagnosis. Although differences were not significant, the use of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio instead of Aβ42 alone in AT(N) classification enhanced the diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.798, 95% CI 0.649–0.947 vs. AUC 0.778, 95% CI 0.617–0.939). We determined the cut-offs for the Lumipulse and Elecsys assays based on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio ± status as a marker of amyloid pathology, and these cut-offs were consistent with those recommended by manufacturers, which had been determined based on visual amyloid PET imaging or diagnostic accuracy. Finally, the biomarker ratios (P-tau/Aβ42 and T-tau/Aβ42) were more consistent with the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio for both Lumipulse and Elecsys methods, and Elecsys P-tau/Aβ42 had the highest consistency with amyloid pathology (AUC 0.994, 95% CI 0.986–1.000 and OPA 96.4%) at the ≥0.024 cut-off. The Lumipulse and Elecsys cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD assays showed high analytical and clinical performances. As both automated platforms were standardized for reference samples, their use is recommended for the measurement of CSF AD biomarkers compared with unstandardized manual methods, such as Innotest ELISA, that have demonstrated a high inter and intra-laboratory variability.</p>

Mutations in mitochondrial replicative polymerase PolγA lead to progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). While PolγA is the known central player in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, it is unknown whether a regulatory process exists on the mitochondrial outer membrane which controlled its entry into the mitochondria. We now demonstrate that PolγA is ubiquitylated by mitochondrial E3 ligase, MITOL (or MARCH5, RNF153). Ubiquitylation in wild-type (WT) PolγA occurs at Lysine 1060 residue via K6 linkage. Ubiquitylation of PolγA negatively regulates its binding to Tom20 and thereby its mitochondrial entry. While screening different PEO patients for mitochondrial entry, we found that a subset of the PolγA mutants is hyperubiquitylated by MITOL and interact less with Tom20. These PolγA variants cannot enter into mitochondria, instead becomes enriched in the insoluble fraction and undergo enhanced degradation. Hence, mtDNA replication, as observed via BrdU incorporation into the mtDNA, was compromised in these PEO mutants. However, by manipulating their ubiquitylation status by 2 independent techniques, these PEO mutants were reactivated, which allowed the incorporation of BrdU into mtDNA. Thus, regulated entry of non-ubiquitylated PolγA may have beneficial consequences for certain PEO patients.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Q1lc4OzFC2E" width="1" />

<p>by Myriam Zecca, Gary Struhl</p>

Development of the <i>Drosophila</i> wing—a paradigm of organ development—is governed by 2 morphogens, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg, a Wnt). Both proteins are produced by defined subpopulations of cells and spread outwards, forming gradients that control gene expression and cell pattern as a function of concentration. They also control growth, but how is unknown. Most studies have focused on Dpp and yielded disparate models in which cells throughout the wing grow at similar rates in response to the grade or temporal change in Dpp concentration or to the different amounts of Dpp “equalized” by molecular or mechanical feedbacks. In contrast, a model for Wg posits that growth is governed by a progressive expansion in morphogen range, via a mechanism in which a minimum threshold of Wg sustains the growth of cells within the wing and recruits surrounding “pre-wing” cells to grow and enter the wing. This mechanism depends on the capacity of Wg to fuel the autoregulation of <i>vestigial</i> (<i>vg</i>)—the selector gene that specifies the wing state—both to sustain <i>vg</i> expression in wing cells and by a feed-forward (FF) circuit of Fat (Ft)/Dachsous (Ds) protocadherin signaling to induce <i>vg</i> expression in neighboring pre-wing cells. Here, we have subjected Dpp to the same experimental tests used to elucidate the Wg model and find that it behaves indistinguishably. Hence, we posit that both morphogens act together, via a common mechanism, to control wing growth as a function of morphogen range.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VxPNZ5hhW64" width="1" />

Open Practical Laboratories in Neurosciences are outreach activities aimed towards middle schoo students in the Brazilian Amazon, discussing neuroscience topics. The outreach led to immediate benefits on attitudes towards science and scientists, which led to better understanding of the neurosciences.

Abstract
The Open Practical Laboratory in the Neurosciences is an outreach program that seeks to improve the knowledge of the neurosciences by elementary school students and to promote better attitudes in relation to neuroscience, science in general, and scientists. It consists in practical and demonstration activities on the theme of the neurosciences. This outreach strategy was applied in four public schools in a municipality in Southeastern Pará, Brazil characterized by low performance in educational reviews in Brazil. Students from both sexes from 9th grade (last grade before high school) were enrolled in the program. The outreach program improved students’ knowledge about the neurosciences, and promoted better attitudes in relation to science and scientists, in comparison to students who did not go through the activities. Results suggest that scientific outreach strategies can produce results beyond immediate increases in knowledge, promoting better attitudes in relation to science.

<p>This review summarizes our current knowledge of human disease-relevant genetic variants within the family of voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channelopathies cover a wide spectrum of diseases including epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, developmental delay, cerebellar ataxias and degeneration, severe cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, eye disease and endocrine disorders such as congential hyperinsulinism and hyperaldosteronism. A special focus will be on the rapidly increasing number of de novo missense mutations identified in the pore-forming α1-subunits with next generation sequencing studies of well-defined patient cohorts. In contrast to likely gene disrupting mutations these can not only cause a channel loss-of-function but can also induce typical functional changes permitting enhanced channel activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Such gain-of-function mutations could represent therapeutic targets for mutation-specific therapy of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channelopathies with existing or novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel inhibitors. Moreover, many pathogenic mutations affect positive charges in the voltage sensors with the potential to form gating-pore currents through voltage sensors. If confirmed in functional studies, specific blockers of gating-pore currents could also be of therapeutic interest.</p>
