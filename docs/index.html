	<p>Background: Misophonia is a chronic condition in which the exposure to specific sounds increases the arousal and recurrence of specific intense negative emotions. We hypothesized that misophonia may be strongly related to maladaptive interpersonal schemas that create difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Subjects with maladaptive interpersonal schemas think that other people try to subjugate, criticize, dominate, exploit, deceive, disregard, and humiliate them. Furthermore, these patients typically endorse a representation of self as mistreated, constricted, harmed, damaged, humiliated, impotent, inadequate, or fragile. Methods: We describe the course of a treatment of Metacognitive Interpersonal Therapy (MIT) in a young man presenting misophonia and co-occurrent obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), with narcissistic traits and normal hearing. We collected qualitative and quantitative data at the beginning of the intervention and at 2 years follow-up. Results: The therapy aimed at increasing awareness of maladaptive interpersonal schemas and promoting a healthy self. The results reported a significant decrease in misophonia; behavioural experiments were used to increase the quality of social relationships and tolerance to the trigger sounds. Conclusions: MIT can be an effective therapy for the treatment of misophonia.</p>

	<p>This select overview examines the important intersection of adult domestic violence, including intimate partner violence and elder abuse, with brain injury. Despite the high prevalence of domestic violence amongst brain injury patients, there is a notable gap in screening and management training for providers. To provide optimal patient care, brain injury medicine clinicians must screen, recognize, and treat patients who have experienced domestic violence. This select overview highlights barriers to screening, validated screening tools from other medical disciplines, and management considerations for the brain injury clinician. A suggested protocol for domestic violence screening and management, as well as recommended resources for providers and patients, is summarized.</p>

	<p>Our goal was to evaluate persisting deficits in gait and executive functioning in asymptomatic athletes with a history of concussion using a novel approach combining a dual-task paradigm and post-exercise exertion. Thirty-eight athletes aged 17 to 25 years old participated in the study, including 18 with a history of concussion. The dual-task paradigm required walking continuously at a predetermined self-paced target speed of 6.5 km/h while executing a complex switch task. Athletes completed two conditions, each on separate days: (1) dual task alone and (2) dual task following 20 min of running on a non-motorized treadmill. The statistical analyses revealed a significant reduction in gait speed exclusively for athletes with a history of concussion and only following the post-exercise condition (p = 0.008). These findings suggest that although asymptomatic concussed athletes maintain a cognitive performance comparable to non-concussed athletes, this appears to be achieved at the expense of gait speed. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating gait assessments and post-exercise exertion into concussion evaluation protocols in both research and clinical settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0093-24.2024?rss=1">Chronic Social Defeat Stress Increases Brain Permeability to Ghrelin in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ghrelin is a stomach-derived hormone that increases feeding and is elevated in response to chronic psychosocial stressors. The effects of ghrelin on feeding are mediated by the binding of ghrelin to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), a receptor located in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic regions important for regulating food intake and metabolic rate. The ability of ghrelin to enter the brain, however, seems to be restricted to circumventricular organs like the median eminence and the brainstem area postrema, whereas ghrelin does not readily enter other GHSR-expressing regions like the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Interestingly, social stressors result in increased blood&ndash;brain barrier permeability, and this could therefore facilitate the entry of ghrelin into the brain. To investigate this, we exposed mice to social defeat stress for 21&nbsp;d and then peripherally injected a Cy5-labelled biologically active ghrelin analog. The results demonstrate that chronically stressed mice exhibit higher Cy5-ghrelin fluorescence in several hypothalamic regions in addition to the ARC, including the hippocampus and midbrain. Furthermore, Cy5-ghrelin injections resulted in increased FOS expression in regions associated with the reward system in chronically stressed mice. Further histologic analyses identified a reduction in the branching of hypothalamic astrocytes in the ARC-median eminence junction, suggesting increased blood&ndash;brain barrier permeability. These data support the hypothesis that during metabolically challenging conditions like chronic stress, ghrelin may be more able to cross the blood&ndash;brain barrier and diffuse throughout the brain to target GHSR-expressing brain regions away from circumventricular organs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0542-23.2024?rss=1">Acetylcholine Neurons Become Cholinergic during Three Time Windows in the Developing Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acetylcholine (ACh) neurons in the central nervous system are required for the coordination of neural network activity during higher brain functions, such as attention, learning, and memory, as well as locomotion. Disturbed cholinergic signaling has been described in many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, cotransmission of other signaling molecules, such as glutamate and GABA, with ACh has been associated with essential roles in brain function or disease. However, it is unknown when ACh neurons become cholinergic during development. Thus, understanding the timeline of how the cholinergic system develops and becomes active in the healthy brain is a crucial part of understanding brain development. To study this, we used transgenic mice to selectively label ACh neurons with tdTomato. We imaged serial sectioned brains and generated whole-brain reconstructions at different time points during pre- and postnatal development. We found three crucial time windows&mdash;two in the prenatal and one in the postnatal brain&mdash;during which most ACh neuron populations become cholinergic in the brain. We also found that cholinergic gene expression is initiated in cortical ACh interneurons, while the cerebral cortex is innervated by cholinergic projection neurons from the basal forebrain. Taken together, we show that ACh neuron populations are present and become cholinergic before postnatal day 12, which is the onset of major sensory processes, such as hearing and vision. We conclude that the birth of ACh neurons and initiation of cholinergic gene expression are temporally separated during development but highly coordinated by brain anatomical structure.</p>

                The finite-volume theory has shown to be numerically efficient and stable for topology optimization of continuum elastic structures. The significant features of this numerical technique are the local satisfaction of equilibrium equations and the employment of compatibility conditions along edges in a surface-averaged sense. These are essential properties to adequately mitigate some numerical instabilities in the gradient version of topology optimization algorithms, such as checkerboard, mesh dependence, and local minima issues. Several computational tools have been proposed for topology optimization employing analysis domains discretized with essential features for finite-element approaches. However, this is the first contribution to offer a platform to generate optimized topologies by employing a Matlab code based on the finite-volume theory for compliance minimization problems. The Top2DFVT provides a platform to perform 2D topology optimization of structures in Matlab, from domain initialization for structured meshes to data post-processing. This contribution represents a significant advancement over earlier publications on topology optimization based on the finite-volume theory, which needed more efficient computational tools. Moreover, the Top2DFVT algorithm incorporates SIMP and RAMP material interpolation schemes alongside sensitivity and density filtering techniques, culminating in a notably enhanced optimization tool. The application of this algorithm to various illustrative cases confirms its efficacy and underscores its potential for advancing the field of structural optimization.

                Background: Contributing factors for improved survival of human adipocytes mesenchymal stem cells (h-AMSCs) cultured through hypoxia preconditioning, in example apoptosis inhibition involving BCL2 and HSP27 expression, trigger signal expression (VEGF), SCF expression, OCT-4 expression, and CD44+ expression. The objective if this study was to explain the mechanism and role of hypoxic preconditioning and the optimal duration of hypoxic preconditioning exposure to improve survival of h-AMSCs. Methods: An experimental laboratory explorative study (in vitro) with hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs cultures. This research was conducted through four stages. First, isolation of h-AMSCs culture from adipose tissue of patients. Second, the characterization of h-AMSCs from adipose tissue by phenotype (flowcytometry) through CD44+, CD90+ and CD45-expression before being pre-conditioned for hypoxic treatment. Third, the hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs culture (in vitro) was performed with an oxygen concentration of 1% for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Fourth, observation of survival from h-AMSCs culture was tested on the role of CD44+, VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, HSP27 with Flowcytometry and apoptotic inhibition by Tunnel Assay method. Results: The result of regression test showed that time difference had an effect on VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=-0.482) and hypoxia condition also influenced VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=0.774). The result of path analysis showed that SCF had effect on OCT-4 expression (p<0.001; β=0.985). The regression test results showed that time effects on HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.398) and hypoxia precondition also affects HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.847). Pathway analysis showed that BCL2 expression inhibited apoptosis (p=0.030; β=-0.442) and HSP27 expression also inhibited apoptosis (p<0,001;β=-0.487). Conclusion: Hypoxic preconditioning of h-AMSC culture has proven to increase the expression of VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, and BCL2 and HSP27. This study demonstrated and explained the existence of a new mechanism of increased h-AMSC survival in cultures with hypoxic preconditioning (O2 1%) via VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, and HSP 27.

                <p>by Beatriz Álvarez-Rodríguez, Sebastian Velandia-Álvarez, Christina Toft, Ron Geller</p>

RNA viruses have notoriously high mutation rates due to error-prone replication by their RNA polymerase. However, natural selection concentrates variability in a few key viral proteins. To test whether this stems from different mutation tolerance profiles among viral proteins, we measured the effect of >40,000 non-synonymous mutations across the full proteome of coxsackievirus B3 as well as >97% of all possible codon deletions in the nonstructural proteins. We find significant variation in mutational tolerance within and between individual viral proteins, which correlated with both general and protein-specific structural and functional attributes. Furthermore, mutational fitness effects remained stable across cell lines, suggesting selection pressures are mostly conserved across environments. In addition to providing a rich dataset for understanding virus biology and evolution, our results illustrate that incorporation of mutational tolerance data into druggable pocket discovery can aid in selecting targets with high barriers to drug resistance.

The ecology of forest ecosystems depends on the composition of trees. Capturing fine-grained information on individual trees at broad scales provides a unique perspective on forest ecosystems, forest restoration, and responses to disturbance. Individual tree data at wide extents promises to increase the scale of forest analysis, biogeographic research, and ecosystem monitoring without losing details on individual species composition and abundance. Computer vision using deep neural networks can convert raw sensor data into predictions of individual canopy tree species through labeled data collected by field researchers. Using over 40,000 individual tree stems as training data, we create landscape-level species predictions for over 100 million individual trees across 24 sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Using hierarchical multi-temporal models fine-tuned for each geographic area, we produce open-source data available as 1 km<sup>2</sup> shapefiles with individual tree species prediction, as well as crown location, crown area, and height of 81 canopy tree species. Site-specific models had an average performance of 79% accuracy covering an average of 6 species per site, ranging from 3 to 15 species per site. All predictions are openly archived and have been uploaded to Google Earth Engine to benefit the ecology community and overlay with other remote sensing assets. We outline the potential utility and limitations of these data in ecology and computer vision research, as well as strategies for improving predictions using targeted data sampling.

                <p>by Tsan-Ting Hsu, Tzyy-Nan Huang, Chien-Yao Wang, Yi-Ping Hsueh</p>

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are considered neural dysconnectivity syndromes. To better understand ASD and uncover potential treatments, it is imperative to know and dissect the connectivity deficits under conditions of autism. Here, we apply a whole-brain immunostaining and quantification platform to demonstrate impaired structural and functional connectivity and aberrant whole-brain synchronization in a <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>autism mouse model. We express a channelrhodopsin variant oChIEF fused with Citrine at the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to outline the axonal projections of BLA neurons. By activating the BLA under blue light theta-burst stimulation (TBS), we then evaluate the effect of BLA activation on C-FOS expression at a whole brain level to represent neural activity. We show that <i>Tbr1</i> haploinsufficiency almost completely disrupts contralateral BLA axonal projections and results in mistargeting in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, thereby globally altering BLA functional connectivity. Based on correlated C-FOS expression among brain regions, we further show that <i>Tbr1</i> deficiency severely disrupts whole-brain synchronization in the absence of salient stimulation. <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>and wild-type (WT) mice exhibit opposing responses to TBS-induced amygdalar activation, reducing synchronization in WT mice but enhancing it in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice. Whole-brain modular organization and intermodule connectivity are also affected by Tbr1 deficiency and amygdalar activation. Following BLA activation by TBS, the synchronizations of the whole brain and the default mode network, a specific subnetwork highly relevant to ASD, are enhanced in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice, implying a potential ameliorating effect of amygdalar stimulation on brain function. Indeed, TBS-mediated BLA activation increases nose-to-nose social interactions of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice, strengthening evidence for the role of amygdalar connectivity in social behaviors. Our high-resolution analytical platform reveals the inter- and intrahemispheric connectopathies arising from ASD. Our study emphasizes the defective synchronization at a whole-brain scale caused by <i>Tbr1</i> deficiency and implies a potential beneficial effect of deep brain stimulation at the amygdala for TBR1-linked autism.

                Background The Rorschach test is one of the most popular tests used in clinical settings for psychopathology and personality assessment; however, there is still little evidence regarding the functional correlates of test responses. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for the investigation of biological correlates associated with different psychological functions. Among other applications, fMRI has been used to identify different networks that reflect brain activity in the resting state (rs-fMRI), that is, when an individual is not engaged in any specific task. Among these resting-state networks (RSN), the best-known and most studied are the Default Mode Network (DMN), along with other networks such as salience, frontoparietal, sensorimotor, temporo-parietal, visual, and cerebellar networks. Methods We used this type of analysis to obtain new evidence regarding Rorschach. This study aimed to analyze the functional brain architecture underlying Rorschach’s personality variables, administered according to Exner’s Comprehensive System (CS). In particular, the aims are: 1) to ascertain the existence of correlations between CS variables and activity of the RSN, and 2) to use these profiles of activity to develop a new data-driven clustering of the CS variables. Archival data from twenty-four non-clinical subjects were analyzed. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and partial least squares regression (PLS) were used to analyze the fMRI data. Results The results showed specific associations with the given Rorschach variables (several of which could be grouped into higher-order latent factors) and activity of the main RSN. Moreover, the cluster analysis outlined important groupings of Rorschach variables, particularly regarding their clinical implications. Conclusions Our study could be comprised in the existing literature providing strong evidence about the neurobiological validity of the Rorschach test.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-802/v1?src=rss">Unraveling the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus: Focus on mecA and PVL Genes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Staphylococcus aureus infections, including Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin-Sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), present significant challenges in healthcare due to rising antimicrobial resistance. This study evaluates the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus, focusing on key resistance-associated genes mecA and PVL. Methods A total of 568 clinical specimens were analyzed for the presence of S. aureus. Demographic data were collected to assess age-dependent prevalence. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted to evaluate resistance patterns. The prevalence of the mecA and PVL genes was determined using molecular techniques. Results S. aureus was identified in 37.9% of cases, with the highest prevalence (60-79 age group). All S. aureus isolates showed 100% resistance to penicillin. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains accounted for 84.19% of isolates, with a significant presence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. The mecA gene was prevalent in 82.79% of MRSA isolates, indicating its strong association with methicillin resistance. Additionally, 41.86% of all S. aureus isolates were positive for the PVL gene, highlighting its widespread distribution. Conclusions The high prevalence of mecA and PVL genes in S. aureus strains underscores the challenges in managing these infections. These findings emphasize the necessity for judicious antibiotic use and enhanced collaborative efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance. Understanding the genetic basis of resistance can inform more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in S. aureus infections.

                Background Studies have this reported the presence of death anxiety, ranging from near-death experiences to physically ill people, to a simple thought about death, as well as when it is associated with states of loneliness. The Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), based on Eysenk’s incubation theory, has been adapted and validated in different contexts and is still insufficient in countries such as Peru. This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the DAS, its internal structure, and factorial invariance. Methods An online scale was used in 1248 Peruvians aged between 18 and 70 years (M= 27.37, SD= 11.29) from all regions. DAS was validated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), convergent validity, measurement invariance, and internal consistency (reliability). Results Psychometric properties were found with adequate values in its structure and validity based on the internal structure through exploratory factor analysis, where it was found that the components of the scale are interrelated and the data matrix is factorizable. model of three specific factors and a general factor is presented, which is consistent with the theory and has practical utility, revealing adequate statistical values that reflect acceptable levels of reliability. Finally, there was fairness according to sex and age group of the scale by means of factorial invariance analysis. Conclusions Our results indicate adequate psychometric properties and facilitate a better data collection process for future research.

                Background The tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., is one of the most important horticultural crops that can be consumed fresh or after being processed worldwide. The tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta) is one of the most devastating pest to tomato plants due to its mine-feeding nature in the mesophyll tissue of the plant. Fungal entomopathogens can exist naturally in plants as an asymptote. This study aimed to detect the endophytic colonization of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii within tomato plants via artificial inoculation and their virulence effects on Tuta absoluta. Methods Isolates with the highest percent germination and virulence against T. absoluta were selected for endophytic evaluation within tomato plants by different artificial inoculation techniques. Results This study revealed that, isolates with the highest percent germination and virulent to Tuta absoluta had the potential to colonize tomato plants. The result showed that, the maximum mortality rate (97.5%) of Tuta absoluta larvae was achieved by Metarhizium robertsii isolate K-61 at a concentration of 1x108conidial/ml at 7 days post inoculated. However, the highest cumulative mortality (100%) was recorded by Beauveria bassiana isolate APPRC-27 at 10 days post inoculated through the direct contact method. The highest endophytic colonization was registered by isolate APPRC-27 (76.67%) at 7 days post-inoculated using the leaf spray technique, but it declined to 11.67% after 28 days of inoculated. In the case of the seedling inoculation technique, the highest endophytic colonization was obtained in the root tissues of tomatoes at 28 days of inoculated by isolate K-61. Conclusions This study revealed that the leaf spray inoculation technique was the most effective method, followed by seedling inoculation, for the deployment of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii endophytes in tomato plant tissues. Therefore, virulent Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii, are promising bioagents for the control of Tuta absoluta if deployed as endophytes.

                Background: Optimum productivity of beef cattle is achieved with adequate feed supply, both in quality and quantity. Consumption of local feedstuff Neptunia plena L. Benth and Leersia hexandra Swartz as a ration by the animal subject is expected to promote cost efficiency and production, as well as provide essential nutrition needs. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), N-NH3 production, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in beef cattle. Methods: Feed and rumen inoculum samples were prepared and analyzed for their proximate contents. There were five treatment groups based on the diet received by beef cattle. In vitro approaches were used to determine the DMD, OMD, N-NH3 production, and VFA in beef cattle. The research was conducted in the Laboratory of Feed Nutrient Science, Faculty of Animal Husbandry and Agriculture, Diponegoro University, Semarang. The data were analyzed using ANOVA at a significance level of 95%, and a Duncan Multiple Range Test. Results: The results showed that the highest DMD (P<0.05) was derived from T5 (56.47%), followed by T4 (56.45%) and T3 (55.90%). T5=62.40% significantly (P<0.05) generated the highest OMD followed by T4=61.95% and T3=60.82%. This treatment had the highest N-NH3 value, namely 5.02 mM, compared with T3=4.55 mM, T4=4.50 mM, T2=4.22 mM, and T1=3.99 mM. Furthermore, T5 had the highest VFA (P<0.05) compared with T4, T3, T2, and T1 with the value of 150.5, 133.0, 130.5, 130.0, and 123.5 mM, respectively. Conclusions: The local feedstuff-based ration contributed to beef cattle production.

                Background The consensus in scientific literature is that each child undergoes a unique linguistic development path, albeit with shared developmental stages. Some children excel or lag behind their peers in language skills. Consequently, a key challenge in language acquisition research is pinpointing factors influencing individual differences in language development. Methods We observed children longitudinally from 3 to 24 months of life to explore early predictors of vocabulary size. Based on the productive vocabulary size of children at 24 months, 30 children met our sample selection criteria: 10 late talkers and 10 early talkers, and we compared them with 10 typical talkers. We evaluated interactive behaviors at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, considering vocal production, gaze at mother’s face, and gestural production during mother-child interactions, and we considered mothers’ report of children’s actions and gestures and receptive-vocabulary size at 15 and 18 months. Results Results indicated early precursors of language outcome at 24 months identifiable as early as 3 months in vocal productions, 6 months for gaze at mother’s face and 12 months for gestural productions. Conclusions Our research highlights both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, identifying the early indicators of belonging to the group of late or early talkers underscores the significant role of this developmental period for future studies. On a practical note, our findings emphasize the crucial need for early investigations to identify predictors of vocabulary development before the typical age at which lexical delay is identified.

                Multicellular organisms are composed of specialized cell types with distinct proteomes. While recent advances in single-cell transcriptome analyses have revealed differential expression of mRNAs, cellular diversity in translational profiles remains underinvestigated. By performing RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in genetically defined cells in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain, we here revealed substantial post-transcriptional regulations that augment the cell-type distinctions at the level of protein expression. Specifically, we found that translational efficiency of proteins fundamental to neuronal functions, such as ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, was maintained low in glia, leading to their preferential translation in neurons. Notably, distribution of ribosome footprints on these mRNAs exhibited a remarkable bias toward the 5′ leaders in glia. Using transgenic reporter strains, we provide evidence that the small upstream open-reading frames in the 5’ leader confer selective translational suppression in glia. Overall, these findings underscore the profound impact of translational regulation in shaping the proteomics for cell-type distinction and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving cell-type diversity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97114">Differential functions of the dorsal and intermediate regions of the hippocampus for optimal goal-directed navigation in VR space</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed navigation requires the hippocampus to process spatial information in a value-dependent manner, but its underlying mechanism needs to be better understood. Here, we investigated whether the dorsal (dHP) and intermediate (iHP) regions of the hippocampus differentially function in processing place and its associated value information. Rats were trained in a place-preference task involving reward zones with different values in a visually rich virtual reality environment where two-dimensional navigation was possible. Rats learned to use distal visual scenes effectively to navigate to the reward zone associated with a higher reward. Inactivation of both dHP and iHP with muscimol altered the efficiency and precision of wayfinding behavior, but iHP inactivation induced more severe damage, including impaired place preference. Our findings suggest that the iHP is more critical for value-dependent navigation toward higher-value goal locations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93481">Specific and comprehensive genetic targeting reveals brain-wide distribution and synaptic input patterns of GABAergic axo-axonic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Axo-axonic cells (AACs), also called chandelier cells (ChCs) in the cerebral cortex, are the most distinctive type of GABAergic interneurons described in the neocortex, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). AACs selectively innervate glutamatergic projection neurons (PNs) at their axon initial segment (AIS), thus may exert decisive control over PN spiking and regulate PN functional ensembles. However, the brain-wide distribution, synaptic connectivity, and circuit function of AACs remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of specific and reliable experimental tools. Here, we have established an intersectional genetic strategy that achieves specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs throughout the mouse brain based on their lineage (<i>Nkx2.1</i>) and molecular (<i>Unc5b</i>, <i>Pthlh</i>) markers. We discovered that AACs are deployed across essentially all the pallium-derived brain structures, including not only the dorsal pallium-derived neocortex and medial pallium-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lateral pallium-derived claustrum–insular complex, and the ventral pallium-derived extended amygdaloid complex and olfactory centers. AACs are also abundant in anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, and lateral septum. AACs show characteristic variations in density across neocortical areas and layers and across subregions of the hippocampal formation. Neocortical AACs comprise multiple laminar subtypes with distinct dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing from AACs across neocortical, hippocampal, and BLA regions reveal shared as well as distinct patterns of synaptic input. Specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs facilitates the study of their developmental genetic program and circuit function across brain structures, providing a ground truth platform for understanding the conservation and variation of a bona fide cell type across brain regions and species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92700">How adverse childhood experiences get under the skin: A systematic review, integration and methodological discussion on threat and reward learning mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are a major risk factor for the development of multiple psychopathological conditions, but the mechanisms underlying this link are poorly understood. Associative learning encompasses key mechanisms through which individuals learn to link important environmental inputs to emotional and behavioral responses. ACEs may impact the normative maturation of associative learning processes, resulting in their enduring maladaptive expression manifesting in psychopathology. In this review, we lay out a systematic and methodological overview and integration of the available evidence of the proposed association between ACEs and threat and reward learning processes. We summarize results from a systematic literature search (following PRISMA guidelines) which yielded a total of 81 articles (threat: n=38, reward: n=43). Across the threat and reward learning fields, behaviorally, we observed a converging pattern of aberrant learning in individuals with a history of ACEs, independent of other sample characteristics, specific ACE types, and outcome measures. Specifically, blunted threat learning was reflected in reduced discrimination between threat and safety cues, primarily driven by diminished responding to conditioned threat cues. Furthermore, attenuated reward learning manifested in reduced accuracy and learning rate in tasks involving acquisition of reward contingencies. Importantly, this pattern emerged despite substantial heterogeneity in ACE assessment and operationalization across both fields. We conclude that blunted threat and reward learning may represent a mechanistic route by which ACEs may become physiologically and neurobiologically embedded and ultimately confer greater risk for psychopathology. In closing, we discuss potentially fruitful future directions for the research field, including methodological and ACE assessment considerations.

">Redundancy protects processing speed in healthy individuals with accelerated brain aging</a></h4>

              
                Recent advancements in computational learning techniques have enabled the estimation of brain age (BA) from neuroimaging data. The difference between chronological age (CA) and BA, known as the BA gap, can potentially serve as a biomarker of brain health. Studies, however, have documented low correlations between BA gap and cognition in healthy aging. This suggests that protective mechanisms in the brain may help counter the effect of accelerated brain aging. Here, we investigated whether redundancy in brain networks may protect cognitive function in individuals with accelerated brain aging. First, we employed deep learning to estimate individual brain ages from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Next, we associated CA, BA, and BA gap, with cognitive measures and network topology derived from diffusion MRI and tractography. We found that CA and BA were both similarly related to cognitive measures and network topology, while BA gap did not show strong relationships in either domain. Despite observing no strong relationships between brain-age gap (BA gap) and demographic variables, cognitive measures, or topological features in healthy aging, individuals with accelerated aging (BA gap+) exhibited lower average degree and redundancy within the dorsal attention network compared to those with delayed aging (BA gap-). Furthermore, redundancy in the dorsal attention network was positively associated with processing speed in BA gap+ individuals. These results indicate a potential neuroprotective role of redundancy in structural brain networks for mitigating the impact of accelerated brain atrophy on cognitive performance in healthy aging.

">High fat diet induces differential age- and gender-dependent changes in neuronal function linked to redox stress.</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, is steadily increasing, posing significant challenges to global healthcare systems. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary habits, particularly consumption of high-fat diets, may play a pivotal role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, several studies have shed light on the intricate communication between the gut and the brain, known as the gut-brain axis and its involvement in neurodegenerative processes. This study aims to assess the effects of a high-fat dietary intake on various angles of neuronal function during aging and following gender separation to help understanding potential contributions of diet to neuronal function. To investigate the effects of a high-fat diet, Drosophila melanogaster was used and exposed to standard normal food diet (NF) and high-fat diet (HF). Adults were grouped at 10 and 45 days of age in male and female flies reared under the same conditions. Multiple assays were conducted, showing differential gender- and HF diet-induced oxidative stress as determined by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, enhanced caspase-3 expression and reduced climbing activity. Adult lifespan under both dietary conditions was unchanged but odour-associated learning abilities were reduced in larvae reared in a HF diet. This is the first study to characterise effects of diet on neuronal phenotypes in an age- and gender-specific manner in a Drosophila model. Our findings suggest a HFD induces differential forms of neuronal dysfunction with age and sex-specific outcomes, characterised by enhanced oxidative stress and cell death which impacts on neuronal and behavioural functions.

">ROLE OF FORELIMB MORPHOLOGY IN MUSCLE SENSORIMOTOR FUNCTIONS DURING LOCOMOTION IN THE CAT</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies established strong links between morphological characteristics of mammalian hindlimb muscles and their sensorimotor functions during locomotion. Less is known about the role of forelimb morphology in motor outputs and generation of sensory signals. Here, we measured morphological characteristics of 46 forelimb muscles from 6 cats. These characteristics included muscle attachments, physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), fascicle length, etc. We also recorded full-body mechanics and EMG activity of forelimb muscles during level overground and treadmill locomotion in 7 and 16 adult cats of either sex, respectively. We computed forelimb muscle forces along with force- and length-dependent sensory signals mapped onto corresponding cervical spinal segments. We found that patterns of computed muscle forces and afferent activities were strongly affected by the muscles moment arm, PCSA, and fascicle length. Morphology of the shoulder muscles suggests distinct roles of the forelimbs in lateral force production and movements. Patterns of length-dependent sensory activity of muscles with long fibers (brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis) closely matched patterns of overall forelimb length, whereas the activity pattern of biceps brachii matched forelimb orientation. We conclude that cat forelimb muscle morphology contributes substantially to locomotor function, particularly to control lateral stability and turning, rather than propulsion.

">Extracellular Vesicles from hiPSC-derived NSCs Protect Human Neurons against Abeta-42 Oligomers Induced Neurodegeneration, Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Tau Phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the buildup of amyloid-beta 42 (A-beta 42) in the brain, which leads to various adverse effects. Therefore, therapeutic interventions proficient in reducing A-beta 42-induced toxicity in AD are of great interest. One promising approach is to use extracellular vesicles from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hiPSC-NSC-EVs) because they carry multiple therapeutic miRNAs and proteins capable of protecting neurons against A-beta 42-induced pathological changes. Therefore, this in vitro study investigated the proficiency of hiPSC-NSC-EVs to protect human neurons derived from two distinct hiPSC lines from A-beta 42 oligomers (A-beta 42o)-induced neurodegeneration. Methods: We isolated hiPSC-NSC-EVs using chromatographic methods and characterized their size, ultrastructure, expression of EV-specific markers and proficiency in getting incorporated into mature human neurons. Next, mature human neurons differentiated from two different hiPSC lines were exposed to 1 micromolar A-beta 42o alone or with varying concentrations of hiPSC-NSC-EVs. The protective effects of hiPSC-NSC-EVs against A-beta 42o-induced neurodegeneration, increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and tau phosphorylation were ascertained using multiple measures and one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons post hoc tests. Results: Significant neurodegeneration was observed when human neurons were exposed to A-beta 42o alone. Notably, neurodegeneration was associated with elevated levels of oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs), increased expression of proapoptotic Bax and Bad genes and proteins, reduced expression of the antiapoptotic gene and protein Bcl-2, increased expression of genes encoding mitochondrial complex proteins, decreased expression of autophagy-related proteins Beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B, and increased phosphorylation of tau. However, the addition of an optimal dose of hiPSC-NSC-EVs (6 billion EVs) to human neuronal cultures exposed to A-beta 42o significantly reduced the extent of neurodegeneration, along with diminished levels of MDA and PCs, normalized expressions of Bax, Bad, and Bcl-2, and genes linked to mitochondrial complex proteins, and reduced tau phosphorylation. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that an optimal dose of hiPSC-NSC-EVs could significantly decrease the degeneration of human neurons induced by A-beta 42o. The results also support further research into the effectiveness of hiPSC-NSC-EVs in AD, particularly their proficiency in preserving neurons and slowing disease progression.

">A SMARTR workflow for multi-ensemble atlas mapping and brain-wide network analysis</a></h4>

              
                In the last decade, activity-dependent strategies for labelling multiple immediate early gene (IEG) ensembles in mice have generated unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval. However, few strategies exist for brain-wide mapping of multiple ensembles, including their overlapping population, and none incorporate capabilities for downstream network analysis. Here, we introduce a scalable workflow to analyze traditionally coronally-sectioned datasets produced by activity-dependent tagging systems. Intrinsic to this pipeline is Simple Multi-ensemble Atlas Registration and statistical Testing in R (SMARTR), an R package which wraps mapping capabilities with functions for statistical analysis and network visualization. We demonstrate the versatility of SMARTR by mapping the ensembles underlying the acquisition and expression of learned helplessness (LH), a robust stress model. Applying network analysis, we find that exposure to inescapable shock (IS), compared to context training (CT), results in decreased centrality of regions engaged in spatial and contextual processing and higher influence of regions involved in somatosensory and affective processing. During LH expression, the substantia nigra emerges as a highly influential region which shows a functional reversal following IS, indicating a possible regulatory function of motor activity during helplessness. We also report that IS results in a robust decrease in reactivation activity across a number of cortical, hippocampal, and amygdalar regions, indicating suppression of ensemble reactivation may be a neurobiological signature of LH. These results highlight the emergent insights uniquely garnered by applying our analysis approach to multiple ensemble datasets and demonstrate the strength of our workflow as a hypothesis-generating toolkit.

">How the window of visibility varies around polar angle</a></h4>

              
                Contrast sensitivity, the amount of contrast required to detect or discriminate an object, depends on spatial frequency (SF): The Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) peaks at intermediate SFs and drops at lower and higher SFs and is the basis of computational models of visual object recognition. The CSF varies from foveal to peripheral vision, but only a couple studies have assessed changes around polar angle of the visual field. Sensitivity is generally better along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and better at the lower vertical than the upper vertical meridian, yielding polar angle asymmetries. Here, we investigate CSF attributes at polar angle locations at both group and individual levels, using Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling. This method enables precise estimation of CSF parameters by decomposing the variability of the dataset into multiple levels and analyzing covariance across observers. At the group level, peak contrast sensitivity and corresponding spatial frequency with the highest sensitivity are higher at the horizontal than vertical meridian, and at the lower than upper vertical meridian. At an individual level, CSF attributes (e.g., maximum sensitivity, the most preferred SF) across locations are highly correlated, indicating that although the CSFs differ across locations, the CSF at one location is predictive of the CSF at another location. Within each location, the CSF attributes co-vary, indicating that CSFs across individuals vary in a consistent manner (e.g., as maximum sensitivity increases, so does the SF at which sensitivity peaks), but more so at the horizontal than the vertical meridian locations. These results show similarities and uncover some critical polar angle differences across locations and individuals, suggesting that the CSF should not be generalized across iso-eccentric locations around the visual field. Our window of visibility varies with polar angle: It is enhanced and more consistent at the horizontal meridian.

">Fc-engineered large molecules targeting blood-brain barrier transferrin receptor and CD98hc have distinct central nervous system and peripheral biodistribution compared to standard antibodies</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge drug delivery to the brain. BBB-crossing molecules are emerging as a new class of therapeutics with significant potential for central nervous system (CNS) indications. In particular, transferrin receptor (TfR)- and CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc)-targeting molecules have been demonstrated to cross the BBB for enhanced brain delivery. Previously, we reported TfR and CD98hc antibody transport vehicles (ATVTfR and ATVCD98hc) that utilize these BBB receptors to improve CNS drug delivery1,2. Here, we provide a comprehensive and unbiased biodistribution characterization of ATVTfR and ATVCD98hc compared to a standard IgG at a multiscale level, ranging from whole-body to brain region- and cell type-targeting specificity. Mouse whole-body tissue clearing revealed distinct organ localization for each molecule. In the CNS, ATVTfR and ATVCD98hc not only achieves enhanced brain delivery but importantly, much broader parenchymal distribution in contrast to the severely limited distribution observed with a standard antibody that was not able to be improved even at very high dose levels. Using cell sorting and single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse brain, we revealed that standard IgG predominantly localizes to perivascular and leptomeningeal cells and reaches the CNS by entering the CSF, rather than crossing the BBB. In contrast, ATVTfR and ATVCD98hc enables broad parenchymal cell-specific distribution via transcytosis through brain endothelial cells (BECs) along the neurovasculature. Finally, we extended the translational relevance of our findings by revealing enhanced and broad brain and spinal cord biodistribution of ATVTfR compared to standard IgG in cynomolgus monkey. Taken together, this multiscale analysis reveals in-depth biodistribution differences between ATVTfR, ATVCD98hc, and standard IgG. These results may better inform platform selection for specific therapeutic targets of interest, optimally matching platforms to desired CNS target engagement, peripheral organ exposures, and predict or potentially reduce off-target effects.

">Muller glia cell cycle re-activation by simultaneous cyclin D1 overexpression and p27kip1 knockdown promotes retinal regeneration in mice</a></h4>

              
                Harnessing the regenerative potential of endogenous stem cells to restore lost neurons is a promising strategy for treating neurodegenerative disorders. Muller glia (MG), the primary glial cell type in the retina, exhibit remarkable regenerative abilities in lower vertebrate species, such as zebrafish and amphibians, where injury induces MG to proliferate and differentiate into various retinal neuron types. The regenerative potential of mammalian MG is constrained by their inherent inability to re-enter the cell cycle, likely due to high levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 and low levels of cyclin D1 observed in adult mouse MG. In this study, we found that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated cyclin D1 overexpression and p27Kip1 knockdown exerts a strong synergistic effect on MG proliferation. MG proliferation induced by this treatment was potent but self-limiting, as MG did not undergo uncontrolled proliferation or lead to retinal neoplasia. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that cell cycle reactivation leads to immunosuppression and dedifferentiation of MG. Notably, scRNA-seq analysis identified a new cluster of rod-like MG cells expressing both rod and MG genes, which was further validated by RNA in situ hybridization. Cell cycle reactivation also led to de novo genesis of bipolar- and amacrine-like cells from MG. Overall, our findings suggest that AAV-mediated cyclin D1 overexpression and p27Kip1 knockdown stimulate MG proliferation and promote MG reprogramming. This approach may be a promising strategy, especially when combined with other regeneration-promoting factors, to enhance MG-mediated retinal repair.

">Cerebellar output shapes cortical preparatory activity during motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum plays a key role in motor adaptation by driving trial-to-trial recalibration of movements based on previous errors. In primates, this adaptive response is achieved by cerebellar modulation of motor cortical signals, but the nature and timing of this process are unknown. Specifically, cortical correlates of adaptation are encoded already in the pre-movement motor plan, but these early cortical signals could be driven by a cerebellar-to-cortical information flow or evolve independently through intracortical mechanisms. To address this question, we trained monkeys to reach against a viscous force field while blocking cerebellar outflow. During the force field trials, the cerebellar block led to impaired adaptation and a compensatory, re-aiming-like shift in motor cortical preparatory activity. In the null-field conditions, the cerebellar block altered neural preparatory activity by increasing task-representation dimensionality and impeding generalization. A computational model indicated that low-dimensional (cerebellar-like) feedback is sufficient to replicate these findings. We conclude that cerebellar signals carry task structure information that constrains the dimensionality of the cortical preparatory manifold and promotes generalization. In the absence of these signals, cortical mechanisms are harnessed to partially restore adaptation.

">Appropriate data segmentation improves speech encoding models</a></h4>

              
                In recent decades, research on the neural processing of speech and language increasingly investigated ongoing responses to continuously presented naturalistic speech, allowing researchers to ask interesting questions about different representations of speech and their relationships. This requires statistical models that can dissect different sources of variance occurring in the processing of naturalistic speech. One commonly used family of models are temporal response functions (TRFs) which can predict neural responses to speech as a weighted combination of different features and points in time. TRFs model the brain as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system whose responses can be characterized by constant transfer functions. This implicitly assumes that the underlying signals are stationary, varying to a fixed degree around a constant mean. However, continuous neural recordings commonly violate this assumption. Here, we use simulations and EEG recordings to investigate how non-stationarities affect TRF models for continuous speech processing. Our results suggest that non-stationarities may impair the performance of TRF models, but that this can be partially remedied by dividing the data into shorter segments that approximate stationarity.

">Residual Microglia Following Short-term PLX5622 Treatment in 5xFAD Mice Exhibit Diminished NLRP3 Inflammasome and mTOR Signaling, and Enhanced Autophagy</a></h4>

              
                Chronic neuroinflammation represents a prominent hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While moderately activated microglia are pivotal in clearing amyloid beta (Abeta), hyperactivated microglia perpetuate neuroinflammation. Prior investigations have indicated that the elimination of ~80% of microglia through a month-long inhibition of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) during the advanced stage of neuroinflammation in 5xFamilial AD (5xFAD) mice mitigates synapse loss and neurodegeneration without impacting Abeta levels. Furthermore, prolonged CSF1R inhibition diminished the development of parenchymal plaques. Nonetheless, the immediate effects of short-term CSF1R inhibition during the early stages of neuroinflammation on residual microglial phenotype or metabolic fitness are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of 10-day CSF1R inhibition in three-month-old female 5xFAD mice, a stage characterized by the onset of neuroinflammation and minimal Abeta plaques. We observed ~65% microglia depletion in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The leftover microglia demonstrated a noninflammatory phenotype, with highly branched and ramified processes and reduced NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complexes. Moreover, plaque-associated microglia were reduced in number with diminished Clec7a (dectin-1) expression. Additionally, both microglia and neurons displayed reduced mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and autophagy. Biochemical assays validated the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, decreased mTOR signaling, and enhanced autophagy. However, short-term CSF1R inhibition did not influence Abeta plaques, soluble Abeta-42 levels, or hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, short-term CSF1R inhibition during the early stages of neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice promotes the retention of homeostatic microglia with diminished inflammasome activation and mTOR signaling, alongside increased autophagy.

">Functional analysis of conserved C. elegans bHLH family members uncovers lifespan control by a peptidergic hub neuron</a></h4>

              
                Throughout the animal kingdom, several members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family act as proneural genes during early steps of nervous system development. Roles of bHLH genes in specifying terminal differentiation of postmitotic neurons have been less extensively studied. We analyze here the function of five C. elegans bHLH genes, falling into three phylogenetically conserved subfamilies, which are continuously expressed in a very small number of postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. We show (a) that two orthologs of the vertebrate bHLHb4/b5 genes, called hlh-17 and hlh-32, function redundantly to specify the identity of a single head interneuron (AUA), as well as an individual motor neuron (VB2), (b) that the PTF1a ortholog hlh-13 acts as a terminal selector to control terminal differentiation and function of the sole octopaminergic neuron class in C. elegans, RIC, and (c) that the NHLH1/2 ortholog hlh-15 controls terminal differentiation and function of the peptidergic AVK head interneuron class, a known neuropeptidergic signaling hub in the animal. Strikingly, through null mutant analysis and cell-specific rescue experiments, we find that loss of hlh-15/NHLH in the peptidergic AVK neurons and the resulting abrogation of neuropeptide secretion causes a substantially expanded lifespan of the animal, revealing an unanticipated impact of a central, peptidergic hub neuron in regulating lifespan, which we propose to be akin to hypothalamic control of lifespan in vertebrates. Taken together, our functional analysis reveals themes of bHLH gene function during terminal differentiation that are complementary to the earlier lineage specification roles of other bHLH family members. However, such late functions are much more sparsely employed by members of the bHLH transcription factor family, compared to the function of the much more broadly employed homeodomain transcription factor family.

">Female sex hormones exacerbate retinal neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and macular degeneration represent major sources of human suffering, yet the factors influencing disease severity remain poorly understood. Sex has been implicated as one potential modifying factor. Here, we show that female sex is a risk factor for worsened outcomes in a model of retinal degeneration. Further, we show that this susceptibility is caused by the presence of female-specific circulating sex hormones. The adverse effect of female sex hormones was specific to diseased retinal neurons, and depletion of these hormones ameliorated this phenotypic effect. These findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurogenerative diseases and how sex hormones can impact the severity of disease. These findings have far-reaching implications for clinical trial design and the use of hormonal therapy in females with certain neurogenerative disorders.

">Spatially organized striatum-wide acetylcholine dynamics for the learning and extinction of Pavlovian cues and actions</a></h4>

              
                Striatal acetylcholine (ACh) has been linked to behavioral flexibility. A key component of flexibility is down-regulating responding as valued cues and actions become decoupled from positive outcomes. We used array fiber photometry in mice to investigate how ACh release across the striatum evolves during learning and extinction of Pavlovian associations. Changes in multi-phasic release to cues and consummatory actions were bi-directional and region-specific. Following extinction, increases in cue-evoked ACh release emerged in the anterior dorsal striatum (aDS) which preceded a down-regulation of anticipatory behavior. Silencing ACh release from cholinergic interneurons in the aDS blocked behavioral extinction. Dopamine release dipped below baseline for down-shifted cues, but glutamate input onto cholinergic interneurons did not change, suggesting an intrastriatal mechanism for the emergence of ACh increases. Our large-scale mapping of striatal ACh dynamics during learning pinpoints region-specific elevations in ACh release positioned to down-regulate behavior during extinction, a central feature of flexible behavior.

">Neural specialisation for concrete and abstract concepts revealed through meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the brain systems that process concrete and abstract concepts is key to understanding the neural architecture of thought, memory and language. We review current theories of concreteness effects and test their neural predictions in a meta-analysis of 72 neuroimaging studies. Concrete concepts preferentially activated visual and action processing regions, particularly when presented in sentences, while abstract concepts preferentially activated networks for language, social cognition and semantic control. Specialisation for both concept types was present in the default mode network (DMN), with effects dissociating along a social-spatial axis. Concrete concepts generated greater activation in a medial temporal DMN component, implicated in constructing mental models of spatial contexts and scenes. Abstract concepts showed greater activation in frontotemporal DMN regions involved in theory-of-mind and language. These results support claims that generating models of situations and events is a core DMN function and indicate specialisation within DMN for different aspects of these models.

">Tempo-dependent selective enhancement of neural responses at the beat frequency can be explained by both an oscillator and an evoked model</a></h4>

              
                The synchronization of neural oscillations with an external regularity such as a musical beat has been regarded as an important mechanism for the brain to make sense of our auditory environment. Such synchronization is often quantified as phase locking of neural oscillations to a stimulus, but this method has been criticized for not differentiating between entrainment - the rate-dependent adjustment of an ongoing endogenous oscillation to an external regularity - and evoked neural responses to the rhythmic stimulus. Here, we aimed to differentiate between these two accounts by measuring EEG responses to non-isochronous rhythmic sequences played at five different rates. Behaviorally, participants shifted the perceived level of regularity depending on the tempo, towards the preferred beat rate (~2 Hz). We found a similar shift in the EEG data, with strongest neural phase locking at the level of the note rate for slow tempi, and at the level of a hierarchical beat for faster tempi, independent of active attention to the sounds. While this pattern of results is in line with entrainment accounts of beat perception and could indeed be mimicked by an oscillator model, it was explained equally well using a model simulating evoked responses. An additional phase concentration metric of the EEG data fell in between the predictions of these two models. In conclusion, we show that neural responses to rhythm are selectively enhanced at the beat rate in a tempo-dependent manner, but that this selective neural enhancement can be explained by successive evoked responses as well as by assuming the presence of oscillatory entrainment.

                Ensembles of phase-oscillators are known to exhibit a variety of collective regimes. Here, we show that a simple mean-field model involving two heterogenous populations of pulse-coupled oscillators, exhibits, in the strong-coupling limit, a robust irregular macroscopic dynamics. The resulting, strongly synchronized, regime is sustained by a homeostatic mechanism induced by the shape of the phase-response curve combined with adaptive coupling strength, included to account for energy dissipated by the pulse emission. The proposed setup mimicks a neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

                In a real-world environment, the brain must integrate information from multiple sensory modalities, including the auditory and olfactory systems. However, little is known about the neuronal circuits governing how odors influence and modulate sound processing. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying auditory-olfactory integration using anatomical, electrophysiological, and optogenetic approaches, focusing on the auditory cortex as a key locus for cross-modal integration. First, retrograde and anterograde viral tracing strategies revealed a direct projection from the piriform cortex to the auditory cortex. Next, using in vivo electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity in the auditory cortex of awake mice, we found that odor stimuli modulate auditory cortical responses to sound. Finally, we used in vivo optogenetic manipulations during electrophysiology to demonstrate that olfactory modulation in auditory cortex, specifically, odor-driven enhancement of sound responses, depends on direct input from the piriform cortex. Together, our results identify a novel cortical circuit shaping olfactory modulation in the auditory cortex, shedding new light on the neuronal mechanisms underlying auditory-olfactory integration.

">Mild neonatal hypoxia disrupts adult hippocampal learning and memory and is associated with CK2-mediated dysregulation of synaptic calcium-activated potassium channel KCNN2</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Although nearly half of preterm survivors display persistent neurobehavioral dysfunction including memory impairment without overt gray matter injury, the underlying mechanisms of neuronal or glial dysfunction, and their relationship to commonly observed cerebral white matter injury are unclear. We developed a mouse model to test the hypothesis that mild hypoxia during preterm equivalence is sufficient to persistently disrupt hippocampal neuronal maturation related to adult cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Methods: Neonatal (P2) mice were exposed to mild hypoxia (8%O2) for 30 min and evaluated for acute injury responses or survived until adulthood for assessment of learning and memory and hippocampal neurodevelopment. Results: Neonatal mild hypoxia resulted in clinically relevant oxygen desaturation and tachycardia without bradycardia and was not accompanied by cerebral gray or white matter injury. Neonatal hypoxia exposure was sufficient to cause hippocampal learning and memory deficits and abnormal maturation of CA1 neurons that persisted into adulthood. This was accompanied by reduced hippocampal CA3-CA1 synaptic strength and LTP, and reduced synaptic activity of calcium-sensitive SK2 channels, key regulators of spike timing dependent neuroplasticity, including LTP. Structural illumination microscopy revealed reduced synaptic density, but intact SK2 localization at the synapse. Persistent loss of SK2 activity was mediated by altered casein kinase 2 (CK2) signaling. Interpretation: We unexpectedly found that a clinically relevant mild hypoxic exposure in the neonatal mouse is sufficient to produce morphometric and functional disturbances in hippocampal neuronal maturation independently of white matter injury. Additionally, we describe a novel persistent mechanism of potassium channel dysregulation after neonatal hypoxia. Collectively our findings suggest an unexplored explanation for the broad spectrum of neurobehavioral, cognitive and learning disabilities that paradoxically persist into adulthood without overt gray matter injury after preterm birth.

">On the Geometry of Somatosensory Representations in the Cortex</a></h4>

              
                It is well-known that cortical areas specializing in the processing of somatosensory information from different parts of the body are arranged in an orderly manner along the cortex. It is also generally accepted that in the cortex, somatosensory information is initially processed in the primary somatosensory cortex and from there, it is hierarchically processed in other cortical regions. Previous studies have focused on the organization of representation at a level of a single or few cortical regions, identifying multiple body maps. However, the question of the large-scale organization of these different maps, and their relation to the hierarchical organization has received little attention. This is primarily because the highly convoluted shape of the cortical surface makes it difficult to characterize the relationship between cortical areas that are centimeters apart. Here, we used functional MRI to characterize cortical responses to full-body light touch stimulation. Our results indicate that the organization of both body representation and hierarchy is radial, with a small number of extrema that reign over a large number of cortical regions. Quantitatively computing the local relationship between the gradients of body and hierarchy maps, we show that the interaction between these two radial geometries, body representation and hierarchy in S1 are approximately orthogonal. However, this orthogonality is restricted to S1. Similar organizational patterns in the visual and auditory systems suggest that radial topography may be a common feature across sensory systems.

">Rapid eye and hand responses in an interception task are differentially modulated by context-dependent predictability</a></h4>

              
                Humans can quickly generate eye and hand responses to unpredictable changes in the environment. Here, we investigated eye-hand coordination in a rapid interception task where human participants used a virtual paddle to intercept a moving target. The target moved vertically down a computer screen and could suddenly jump to the left or right. In high-certainty blocks, the target always jumped, and in low-certainty blocks, the target only jumped in a portion of trials. Further, we manipulated response urgency by varying the time of target jumps, with early jumps requiring less urgent and late jumps requiring more urgent responses. Our results highlighted differential effects of certainty and urgency on eye-hand coordination. Participants initiated both eye and hand responses earlier for high-certainty compared to low-certainty blocks. Hand reaction times decreased, and response vigor increased with increasing urgency levels. However, eye reaction times were lowest for medium-urgency levels, and eye vigor was unaffected by urgency. Across all trials, we found a weak positive correlation between eye and hand responses. Taken together, these results suggest that the limb and oculomotor systems use similar early sensorimotor processing; however, rapid responses are modulated differentially to attain system-specific sensorimotor goals.

">Hearing and cognitive decline in aging differentially impact neural tracking of context-supported versus random speech across linguistic timescales</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive decline and hearing loss are common in older adults and often co-occur while investigated separately, affecting the neural processing of speech. This study investigated the interaction between cognitive decline, hearing loss, and contextual cues in speech processing. Participants aged 60 years and older were assessed for cognitive decline using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and for hearing ability using a four-frequency pure tone average. They listened to in-house-designed matrix-style sentences that either provided supportive context or were random. Neurophysiological responses were analyzed through auditory evoked potentials and speech tracking at different linguistic timescales (i.e., phrase, word, syllable and phoneme rate) using phase-locking values. The results showed that cognitive decline was associated with a lower chance of correct responses in a speech recognition task. Cognitive decline significantly impacted the P2 component of auditory evoked potentials, while hearing loss influenced speech tracking at the word and phoneme rates, but not at the phrase or syllable rates. Contextual cues enhanced speech tracking at the syllable rate. These findings suggest that cognitive decline and hearing loss differentially affect the neural mechanisms underlying speech processing, with contextual cues playing a significant role in enhancing syllable rate tracking. This study emphasises the importance of considering both cognitive and auditory factors when studying speech processing in older people and highlights the need for further research to investigate the interplay between cognitive decline, hearing loss and contextual cues in speech processing.

">Structural comparisons of human and mouse fungiform taste buds</a></h4>

              
                Taste buds are commonly studied in rodent models, but some differences exist between mice and humans in terms of gustatory mechanisms and sensitivities. Whether these functional differences are reflected in structural differences between species is unclear. Using immunofluorescent image stacks, we compared morphological and molecular characteristics of mouse and human fungiform taste buds. The results suggest that while the general features of fungiform taste buds are similar between mice and humans, several characteristics differ significantly. Human taste buds are larger and taller than those of mice, yet they contain similar numbers of taste cells. Taste buds in humans are more heavily innervated by gustatory nerve fibers expressing the purinergic receptor P2X3 showing a 40% higher innervation density than in mice. Like Type II cells of mice, a subset (about 30%) of cells in human taste buds is immunoreactive for PLC{beta}2. These PLC{beta}2-immunoreactive cells display CALHM1-immunoreactive puncta closely apposed to gustatory nerve fibers suggestive of channel-type synapses described in mice. These puncta, used as a measure of synaptic contact, are however significantly larger in humans compared to mice. Altogether these findings suggest that while many similarities exist in the structural organization of murine and human fungiform taste buds, significant differences do exist in taste bud size, innervation density, and size of synaptic contacts that may impact gustatory signal transmission.

">The Neural efficiency score: Validation and application</a></h4>

              
                We propose an indirect measure of the efficiency of neural processing: the neural efficiency score (NES). The basis for this measure is the hazard function on the reaction time distribution from a task, h(t), which can be interpreted as an instantaneous measure of work being accomplished, and which has been foundational in characterizations of perceptual and cognitive workload capacity (e.g., Townsend & Ashby, 1978; Townsend & Nozawa, 1995; Townsend & Wenger, 2004). We suggest that the global field power on electroencephalographic (EEG) data (Skrandies, 1989, 1990) can function as a proxy for actual energy expended, and then place h(t) and GFP in a ratio to give a measure that can be interpreted as work accomplished relative to energy expended. To make this proposal plausible, we first need to show that the GFP can be interpreted in terms of energy expended, and we do this using previously unpublished data from an earlier study (Wenger, DellaValle, Murray-Kolb, & Haas, 2017) in which we simultaneously collected EEG and metabolic data during the performance of a cognitive task. Having shown that the GFP can be used as a proxy for energy expended, we then demonstrate the interpretability of the NES by applying it to previously unpublished data from a more recent study (Newbolds & Wenger, 2024). These outcomes suggest the potential for broad applicability of the NES and its potential for characterizing the efficiency of neural energy expenditure in the performance of perceptual and cognitive work.

">The flow state is not accompanied by frontal-midline theta activity: An EEG investigation of more than 700 video gameplay sessions</a></h4>

              
                People sometimes experience a "flow state"- characterized by hyperfocus, time distortion, and loss of self-awareness - during sports or video gameplay. Previous neuropsychological studies using simple laboratory tasks have reported that the flow state is associated with activation in the frontal lobe, reflected in theta (4-7 Hz) band rhythmic neural activity in medial prefrontal regions (frontal-midline theta [FMT] activity). However, the findings of previous studies might be problematic because they did not appropriately capture the neural activity associated with the flow state for the following reasons: 1) they used unfamiliar and unmotivating tasks; 2) they defined the neural basis of the flow state as neural activity occurring during tasks of optimal difficulty, disregarding trial-to-trial variations in subjective experience of the flow state; 3) the duration of the experiment or the number of trials was not sufficient to capture the rare experience of flow; or 4) they ignored individual differences in neural activities related to flow experiences. Thus, we examined the relationship between the flow state and FMT activity, recorded via scalp electroencephalography, in an experimental paradigm that addressed these four issues. First, participants played their favorite competitive video games, which they had been routinely playing. Second, task difficulty was kept as uniform as possible across trials by employing rank matching to directly examine the correlation between subjective flow level and FMT activity across trials. Third, to address the concern regarding the low frequency of the flow experience, more than 100 trials were completed over 10 days by each participant. Lastly, we adopted a within-participant statistical approach to examine individual differences in the nature of the flow experience. The results showed no correlation between FMT activity and the degree of subjective flow in six out of seven participants, contrary to previous reports. Our results challenge the conventional view that frontal lobe activity, as reflected in FMT activity, is instrumental in entering into the flow state.

">7 Tesla MRS estimates of GABA concentration relate to physiological measures of tonic inhibition in the human motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic neurotransmission within the cortex plays a key role in learning and is altered in several brain diseases. Quantification of bulk GABA in the human brain is typically obtained by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). However, the interpretation of MRS-GABA is still debated. A recent mathematical simulation contends that MRS detects extrasynaptic GABA, mediating tonic inhibition. Nevertheless, no empirical data have yet confirmed this hypothesis. Here we collected ultra-high field 7 Tesla MRS and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation coupled with high-density Electroencephalography (TMS-hdEEG) from the motor cortex of twenty healthy participants (age 23.95+-6.4), while they were at rest. We first applied a Neural Mass Model to TMS-evoked potentials to disentangle the contribution of different GABAergic pools. We then assessed to which of these different pools MRS-GABA was related to by means of Parametric Empirical Bayesian (PEB) analysis. We found that MRS-GABA was mostly positively related to the NMM-derived measures of tonic inhibition and overall functionality of the GABAergic synapse. This relationship was reliable enough to predict MRS-GABA from NMM-GABA. These findings clarify the mesoscopic underpinnings of GABA levels measured by MRS and will contribute to the concretization of MRS-GABA promises to improve our understanding of human behaviour, brain physiology and pathophysiology.

">Persistent activity during working memory maintenance predicts long-term memory formation in the human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Working Memory (WM) and Long-Term Memory (LTM) are often viewed as separate cognitive systems. Little is known about how these systems interact when forming memories. We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe while patients maintained novel items in WM and a subsequent recognition memory test for the same items. In the hippocampus but not the amygdala, the level of WM content-selective persist activity during WM maintenance was predictive of whether the item was later recognized with high confidence or forgotten. In contrast, visually evoked activity in the same cells was not predictive of LTM formation. During LTM retrieval, memory-selective neurons responded more strongly to familiar stimuli for which persistent activity was high while they were maintained in WM. Our study suggests that hippocampal persistent activity of the same cell supports both WM maintenance and LTM encoding, thereby revealing a common single-neuron component of these two memory systems.

">Big Data in Myoelectric Control: LargeMulti-User Models Enable Robust Zero-ShotEMG-based Discrete Gesture Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Myoelectric control, the use of electromyogram (EMG) signals generated during muscle contractions to control a system or device, is a promising modality for enabling always-available control of emerging ubiquitous computing applications. However, its widespread use has historically been limited by the need for user-specific machine learning models because of behavioural and physiological differences between users. Leveraging the publicly available 612-user EMG-EPN612 dataset, this work dispels this notion, showing that true zero-shot cross-user myoelectric control is achievable without user-specific training. By taking a discrete approach to classification (i.e., recognizing the entire dynamic gesture as a single event), a classification accuracy of 93.0% for six gestures was achieved on a set of 306 unseen users (who provided no training data), showing that big data approaches (compared to most EMG studies, which typically employ only 10-20 users) can enable robust cross-user myoelectric control. By organizing the results into a series of mini-studies, this work provides an in-depth analysis of discrete cross-user models to answer unknown questions and uncover new research directions. In particular, this work explores the number of participants required to build cross-user models, the impact of transfer learning for fine-tuning these models, and the effects of under-represented end-user demographics in the training data, among other issues. Additionally, in order to further evaluate the performance of the created cross-user models, a completely new data set was created (using the same recording device) that includes known covariate factors such as cross-day use and limb-position variability. The results show that the large data models can effectively generalize to new datasets and mitigate the impact of common confounding factors that have historically limited the adoption of EMG-based inputs.

">Tracking changes in functionality and morphology of repopulated microglia in young and old mice</a></h4>

              
                Microglia (MG) are myeloid cells of the central nervous system supporting its homeostasis and instigating neuroinflammation in pathologies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed the functional heterogeneity of MG in mice brains. Inhibition of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling with inhibitors deplete microglia which rapidly repopulate. Functionalities of repopulated microglia are poorly known. We combined scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, immunofluorescence and confocal imaging to study functionalities and morphology of repopulated microglia. CSRF1R inhibitor (BLZ-945) depleted MG in 21 days and their numbers were restored 7 days later as evidenced by TMEM119 staining and flow cytometry. ScRNA-seq and computational analyses demonstrate that repopulated MG originate from preexisting MG progenitors and reconstitute functional clusters but upregulate inflammatory genes. Percentages of proliferating, immature MG displaying inflammatory gene expression increase in aging mice. Morphometric analysis of MG cell body and branching shows distinct morphology of repopulated MG, particularly in old mouse brains. We demonstrate that with aging some repopulated MG fail to reach the homeostatic phenotype. These differences microglia may contribute to the deterioration of microglia protective functions with age.

">REM sleep quality is associated with balanced tonic activity of the locus coeruleus during wakefulness</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Animal studies established that the locus coeruleus (LC) plays important roles in sleep and wakefulness regulation. Whether it contributes to sleep variability in humans is not yet established. Here, we investigated if the in vivo activity of the LC is related to the variability in the quality of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. Methods: We assessed the LC activity of 34 healthy younger (~22y) and 18 older (~61y) individuals engaged in bottom-up and top-down cognitive tasks using 7-Tesla functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We further recorded their sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate associations between LC fMRI measures and REM sleep EEG metrics. Results: Theta oscillation energy during REM sleep was positively associated with LC response in the top-down task. In contrast, REM sleep theta energy was negatively associated with LC activity in older individuals during the bottom-up task. Importantly, sigma oscillations power immediately preceding a REM sleep episode was positively associated with LC activity in the top-down task. Interpretation: LC activity during wakefulness was related to REM sleep intensity and to a transient EEG change preceding REM sleep, a feature causally related to LC activity in animal studies. The associations depend on the cognitive task, suggesting that a balanced level of LC tonic activity during wakefulness is required for optimal expression of REM sleep. The findings may have implications for the high prevalence of sleep complaints reported in aging and for disorders such as insomnia, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons disease, for which the LC may play pivotal roles through sleep.

	<p>Speech-language therapy (SLT) is the most effective technique to improve language performance in persons with aphasia. However, residual language impairments remain even after intensive SLT. Recent studies suggest that combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with SLT may improve language performance in persons with aphasia. However, our understanding of how tDCS and SLT impact brain and behavioral relation in aphasia is poorly understood. We investigated the impact of tDCS and SLT on a behavioral measure of scripted conversation and on functional connectivity assessed with multiple methods, both resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs&amp;amp;ndash;fMRI) and resting-state electroencephalography (rs&amp;amp;ndash;EEG). An individual with aphasia received 15 sessions of 20-min cathodal tDCS to the right angular gyrus concurrent with 40 min of SLT. Performance during scripted conversation was measured three times at baseline, twice immediately post-treatment, and at 4- and 8-weeks post-treatment. rs&amp;amp;ndash;fMRI was measured pre-and post-3-weeks of treatment. rs&amp;amp;ndash;EEG was measured on treatment days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Results show that both communication performance and left hemisphere functional connectivity may improve after concurrent tDCS and SLT. Results are in line with aphasia models of language recovery that posit a beneficial role of left hemisphere perilesional areas in language recovery.</p>

	<p>The Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) hypothesis states that the visual percept is available to conscious awareness only if recurrent long-distance interactions among distributed brain regions activate neural circuitry extending from the posterior areas to prefrontal regions above a certain excitation threshold. To directly test this hypothesis, we trained 14 human participants to increase blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals with real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI)-based neurofeedback simultaneously in four specific regions of the occipital, temporal, insular and prefrontal parts of the brain. Specifically, we hypothesized that the up-regulation of the mean BOLD activity in the posterior&amp;amp;ndash;frontal brain regions lowers the perceptual threshold for visual stimuli, while down-regulation raises the threshold. Our results showed that participants could perform up-regulation (Wilcoxon test, session 1: p = 0.022; session 4: p = 0.041) of the posterior&amp;amp;ndash;frontal brain activity, but not down-regulation. Furthermore, the up-regulation training led to a significant reduction in the visual perceptual threshold, but no substantial change in perceptual threshold was observed after the down-regulation training. These findings show that the up-regulation of the posterior&amp;amp;ndash;frontal regions improves the perceptual discrimination of the stimuli. However, further questions as to whether the posterior&amp;amp;ndash;frontal regions can be down-regulated at all, and whether down-regulation raises the perceptual threshold, remain unanswered.</p>

                Introduction: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) encompasses several clinical manifestations, which are characterized by temporomandibular joint and masticatory muscle discomfort and dysfunction (TMJ). The best imaging technique for evaluating TMJ is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which makes it possible to see the anatomical and pathological characteristics of every joint component. In recent years, convolutional neural networks -based deep learning algorithms have been favoured because of their outstanding capability in recognizing objects in medical images. The objective of this study is to assess, compare and co-rrelate articular disc morphology by automated segmentation using deep learning on MRI images in skeletal Class II (vertical growth pattern) TMD cases as compared to skeletal Class II (horizontal growth pattern) TMD cases and Class I non-TMD cases Methods: Grading of skeletal Class II (vertical growth pattern) cases and skeletal Class II (horizontal growth pattern) cases based on severity of TMD will be carried out using diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders. Bilateral sagittal as well as coronal MRI images will be obtained. A convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder-decoder named U-Net will be used to segment the articular disc on MRI. Understanding the nature of variations between Class I and both types of Class IIs will help orthodontists to better predict the potential risk for the development of TMDs and accordingly take precautions while doing treatment in such cases. Moreover, it can be used to automate TMD diagnosis and other smart applications. Conclusions: This study will aid in identifying articular disc morphology on MRI. The deep learning algorithms with effective data augmentation may perform better in MRI readings than human clinicians when using the same data, which will be advantageous for TMD diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1574/v2?src=rss">Factors contributing to moral distress among intensive care nurses: A scoping review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The intensive care unit (ICU) is a busy and complex workplace, and several work-related and personal factors are known to make ICU nurses more vulnerable to moral distress than other healthcare professionals. It is crucial to identify these factors to guide future studies and preventive strategies. This scoping review explores such factors to present current knowledge on the factors that trigger moral distress and to guide future research by reviewing studies to explore and summarize factors that trigger moral distress in ICU nurses. Methods: The PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL Plus databases were searched to identify potentially relevant studies published between 2011 to 2022. Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed studies published in English that provided results regarding factors causes or correlated to moral distress in ICU nurses. After removing 618 duplicates, 316 papers were excluded after title and abstract screening, leaving 71 articles for full-text screening. A further 54 articles were excluded as their outcomes did not include factors that caused moral distress, or were not specific to ICU nurses, so 17 studies were eventually analysed using qualitative content analysis through an inductive approach. The findings of the articles were extracted and coded independently by two authors, and data were grouped and categorized. Results: The content categories of factors contributing to ICU nurses' moral distress were organized into themes and subthemes. Four major themes were identified: Powerlessness, end-of-life care, ineffective teamwork, and personal characteristics of ICU nurses. Conclusions: This review highlights the factors that contribute to moral distress in critical care nurses, which are mainly attributable to the organizational climate and the nature of the ICU clinical environment. Descriptive and intervention studies (experimental or action research) must investigate causality between identified variables to inform management strategies to improve support for ICU nurses’ coping relative to moral distress.

                Background: First line (1L) TP-Ex-like regimen followed by 2nd-line (2L) immunotherapy represents one of the standards of care in platinum-sensitive recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (R/M SCCHN). We report our experience from 2 tertiary care institutions of India. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients of platinum-sensitive R/M SCCHN treated with 1L weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab (PCC) regimen followed by cetuximab maintenance (if non-progressive) or 2L nivolumab or oral metronomic chemotherapy (OMCT) on progression. Overall response rates (ORR), progression-free survival after 1L and 2L (PFS-1 & PFS-2), overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated. Results: The study included 54 patients; median age 56.5 years; 89% men; 11% had cardiac dysfunction; 13% had renal dysfunction. After 1L PCC, ORR was 59.3%; median PFS-1 was 7.031 months; 61% had progression; 35% were treated with nivolumab and 18% with OMCT. The ORR was 26.3% (nivolumab) and 10% (OMCT). Median PFS-2 was 6.5 months (nivolumab) and 2 months (OMCT). The median OS was 15.01 months (entire cohort), 20.6 months (nivolumab), and 7 months (OMCT). Grade III/IV adverse events on PCC included neutropenia (31.4%), anaemia (35.1%), thrombocytopenia (7.4%), febrile neutropenia (11.1%), and skin reaction (16.6%); no Grade-III/IV treatment-related toxicities on 2L. Conclusions: 1L weekly PCC is an effective regimen for palliative therapy of platinum- sensitive R/MSCCHN with an acceptable toxicity profile. The addition of 2L nivolumab on progression further improves the outcomes.

                Abstract* Background Gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, have grim prognoses, necessitating early diagnostic and prognostic indicators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), influential in cancer research, show potential as glioma biomarkers. This systematic review aimed to examine the efficacy of miRNAs in the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies published from 2013 to 2023. The eligibility criteria included high-grade glioma, histopathological confirmation, miRNA samples from cerebrospinal fluid or plasma, and relevant outcome data. Studies were excluded if they were experimental or reviews and not in English. Results Of the 1120 initial results, 8 studies involving 660 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Several studies have assessed miRNA expression and its association with diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade gliomas. Overexpression of miR-221, miR-222, miR-210, miR-21, miR-125b, and miR-223 and under-expression of miR-15b and miR-124-3p showed significant potential in differentiating high-grade glioma patients from controls. Additionally, miRNAs are associated with distinct tumorigenic pathways. Conclusion Elevated or depressed expression levels of specific circulating miRNAs hold significant promise as noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. These miRNAs offer valuable insights into disease progression and patient outcome. Further validation through extensive clinical trials and in-depth mechanistic studies is essential to realize their full clinical utility.

Chromatin is a polymer complex of DNA and proteins that regulates gene expression. The three-dimensional (3D) structure and organization of chromatin controls DNA transcription and replication. High-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques generate Hi-C maps that can provide insight into the 3D structure of chromatin. Hi-C maps can be represented as a symmetric matrix A i j, where each element represents the average contact probability or number of contacts between chromatin loci <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. Previous studies have detected topologically associating domains (TADs), or self-interacting regions in A i j within which the contact probability is greater than that outside the region. Many algorithms have been developed to identify TADs within Hi-C maps. However, most TAD identification algorithms are unable to identify nested or overlapping TADs and for a given Hi-C map there is significant variation in the location and number of TADs identified by different methods. We develop a novel method to identify TADs, KerTAD, using a kernel-based technique from computer vision and image processing that is able to accurately identify nested and overlapping TADs. We benchmark this method against state-of-the-art TAD identification methods on both synthetic and experimental data sets. We find that the new method consistently has higher true positive rates (TPR) and lower false discovery rates (FDR) than all tested methods for both synthetic and manually annotated experimental Hi-C maps. The TPR for KerTAD is also largely insensitive to increasing noise and sparsity, in contrast to the other methods. We also find that KerTAD is consistent in the number and size of TADs identified across replicate experimental Hi-C maps for several organisms. Thus, KerTAD will improve automated TAD identification and enable researchers to better correlate changes in TADs to biological phenomena, such as enhancer-promoter interactions and disease states.

                <p>by Samuel E. Hoff, F. Emil Thomasen, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Massimiliano Bonomi</p>

Converting cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data into high-quality structural models is a challenging problem of outstanding importance. Current refinement methods often generate unbalanced models in which physico-chemical quality is sacrificed for excellent fit to the data. Furthermore, these techniques struggle to represent the conformational heterogeneity averaged out in low-resolution regions of density maps. Here we introduce EMMIVox, a Bayesian inference approach to determine single-structure models as well as structural ensembles from cryo-EM maps. EMMIVox automatically balances experimental information with accurate physico-chemical models of the system and the surrounding environment, including waters, lipids, and ions. Explicit treatment of data correlation and noise as well as inference of accurate B-factors enable determination of structural models and ensembles with both excellent fit to the data and high stereochemical quality, thus outperforming state-of-the-art refinement techniques. EMMIVox represents a flexible approach to determine high-quality structural models that will contribute to advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions.

The abundance of distractors in the world poses a major challenge to our brain’s limited processing capacity, but little is known about how selective attention modulates stimulus representations in the brain to reduce interference and support durable target memory. Here, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a selective attention task in which target and distractor pictures of different visual categories were simultaneously presented. Participants were asked to selectively process the target according to the effective cue, either before the encoding period (i.e., perceptual attention) or the maintenance period (i.e., reflective attention). On the next day, participants were asked to perform a memory recognition task in the scanner in which the targets, distractors, and novel items were presented in a pseudorandom order. Behavioral results showed that perceptual attention was better at enhancing target memory and reducing distractor memory than reflective attention, although the overall memory capacity (memory for both target and distractor) was comparable. Using multiple-voxel pattern analysis of the neural data, we found more robust target representation and weaker distractor representation in working memory for perceptual attention than for reflective attention. Interestingly, perceptual attention partially shifted the regions involved in maintaining the target representation from the visual cortex to the parietal cortex. Furthermore, the targets and distractors simultaneously presented in the perceptual attention condition showed reduced pattern similarity in the parietal cortex during retrieval compared to items not presented together. This neural pattern repulsion positively correlated with individuals’ recognition of both targets and distractors. These results emphasize the critical role of selective attention in transforming memory representations to reduce interference and improve long-term memory performance.

                <p>by Aude Bernheim, Jean Cury, Enzo Z. Poirier</p>

Immune defence mechanisms exist across the tree of life in such diversity that prokaryotic antiviral responses have historically been considered unrelated to eukaryotic immunity. Mechanisms of defence in divergent eukaryotes were similarly believed to be largely clade specific. However, recent data indicate that a subset of modules (domains and proteins) from prokaryote defence systems are conserved in eukaryotes and populate many stages of innate immune pathways. In this Essay, we propose the notion of ancestral immunity, which corresponds to the set of immune modules conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. After offering a typology of ancestral immunity, we speculate on the selective pressures that could have led to the differential conservation of specific immune modules across domains of life. The exploration of ancestral immunity is in its infancy and appears full of promises to illuminate immune evolution, and also to identify and decipher immune mechanisms of economic, ecological, and therapeutic importance.

Heterologous sensitization of adenylyl cyclase (AC) results in elevated cAMP signaling transduction that contributes to drug dependence. Inhibiting cullin3-RING ligases by blocking the neddylation of cullin3 abolishes heterologous sensitization, however, the modulating mechanism remains uncharted. Here, we report an essential role of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) protein 2, 5, and 17, especially the dominant isoform KCTD5 in regulating heterologous sensitization of AC1 and morphine dependence via working with cullin3 and the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. In cellular models, we observed enhanced association of KCTD5 with Gβ and cullin3, along with elevated dissociation of Gβ from AC1 as well as of CAND1 from cullin3 in heterologous sensitization of AC1. Given binding of CAND1 inhibits the neddylation of cullin3, we further elucidated that the enhanced interaction of KCTD5 with both Gβ and cullin3 promoted the dissociation of CAND1 from cullin3, attenuated the inhibitory effect of CAND1 on cullin3 neddylation, ultimately resulted in heterologous sensitization of AC1. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays an important role in mediating morphine dependence. Through pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we then demonstrated that KCTD5/cullin3 regulates morphine dependence via modulating heterologous sensitization of AC, likely AC1 in PVT in mice. In summary, the present study revealed the underlying mechanism of heterologous sensitization of AC1 mediated by cullin3 and discovered the role of KCTD proteins in regulating morphine dependence in mice.

Mutagenesis is responsive to many environmental factors. Evolution therefore depends on the environment not only for selection but also in determining the variation available in a population. One such environmental dependency is the inverse relationship between mutation rates and population density in many microbial species. Here, we determine the mechanism responsible for this mutation rate plasticity. Using dynamical computational modelling and in culture mutation rate estimation, we show that the negative relationship between mutation rate and population density arises from the collective ability of microbial populations to control concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. We demonstrate a loss of this density-associated mutation rate plasticity (DAMP) when <i>Escherichia coli</i> populations are deficient in the degradation of hydrogen peroxide. We further show that the reduction in mutation rate in denser populations is restored in peroxide degradation-deficient cells by the presence of wild-type cells in a mixed population. Together, these model-guided experiments provide a mechanistic explanation for DAMP, applicable across all domains of life, and frames mutation rate as a dynamic trait shaped by microbial community composition.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated entorhinal cortex (EC) tau in low beta-amyloid individuals can predict accumulation of pathology and cognitive decline. We compared the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived locus coeruleus integrity, neocortical beta-amyloid burden by positron emission tomography (PET), and hippocampal volume in identifying elevated entorhinal tau signal in asymptomatic individuals who are considered beta-amyloid PET-negative.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 188 asymptomatic individuals (70.78 ± 11.51 years, 58% female) who underwent 3T-MRI of the locus coeruleus, Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), and Flortaucipir (FTP) PET. Associations between elevated EC tau and neocortical PiB, hippocampal volume, or locus coeruleus integrity were evaluated and compared using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses in the PiB− sample with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. Associations with clinical progression (CDR-sum-of-boxes) over a time span of 6 years were evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 26 (21%) individuals with high EC FTP in the CDR = 0/PiB− sample. Locus coeruleus integrity was a significantly more sensitive and specific predictor of elevated EC FTP (area under the curve [AUC] = 85%) compared with PiB (AUC = 77%) or hippocampal volume (AUC = 76%). Based on the Youden-index, locus coeruleus integrity obtained a sensitivity of 77% and 85% specificity. Using the resulting locus coeruleus Youden cut-off, lower locus coeruleus integrity was associated with a two-fold increase in clinical progression, including mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Locus coeruleus integrity has promise as a low-cost, non-invasive screening instrument to detect early cortical tau deposition and associated clinical progression in asymptomatic, low beta-amyloid individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Maternal obesity before or during pregnancy has been associated previously in offspring with a wide range of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and mental health problems. The effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain structure and function that may be responsible for these poor outcomes are not well understood. We, therefore, undertook a systematic review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that have assessed the associations of maternal obesity with brain measures in offspring. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO on August 20, 2023. Of 15 eligible studies, seven employed functional MRI (fMRI), five diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and four anatomical MRI (one used both DTI and anatomical MRI) in the offspring. The ages of offspring varied widely: one was a study of fetuses in utero, five of neonates, one of infants, five of school-aged children, two of both neonates and infants, and one of both children and adults. Collectively, 12 studies reported significant associations of maternal obesity with structural or functional alterations of the offspring's brain, most frequently in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. In conclusion, maternal obesity appears to have a profound influence on offspring brain development, particularly within the prefrontal and limbic networks that regulate emotion and behavior. Further studies are needed to identify how changes in brain structure and function mediate the effects of maternal obesity on long-term emotional and behavioral outcomes, as well as the molecular pathways through which maternal obesity alters offspring brain development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93204">Glutamate neurotransmission from leptin receptor cells is required for typical puberty and reproductive function in female mice</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamic ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) is a glutamatergic nucleus essential for the metabolic control of reproduction. However, conditional deletion of leptin receptor long form (LepRb) in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) expressing neurons results in virtually no reproductive deficits. In this study, we determined the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission from leptin responsive PMv neurons on puberty and fertility. We first assessed if stimulation of PMv neurons induces luteinizing hormone (LH) release in fed adult females. We used the stimulatory form of designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in <i>Lepr<sup>Cre</sup></i> (LepRb-Cre) mice. We collected blood sequentially before and for 1 hr after intravenous clozapine-<i>N</i>-oxide injection. LH level increased in animals correctly targeted to the PMv, and LH level was correlated to the number of Fos immunoreactive neurons in the PMv. Next, females with deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2) in LepRb neurons (<i>Lepr</i><sup>ΔVGlut2</sup>) showed delayed age of puberty, disrupted estrous cycles, increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) concentration in the axon terminals, and disrupted LH secretion, suggesting impaired GnRH release. To assess if glutamate is required for PMv actions in pubertal development, we generated a Cre-induced reexpression of endogenous LepRb (<i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i>) with concomitant deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2<i><sup>flox</sup></i>) mice. Rescue of <i>Lepr</i> and deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> in the PMv was obtained by stereotaxic injection of an adeno-associated virus vector expressing Cre recombinase. Control <i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i> mice with PMv LepRb rescue showed vaginal opening, follicle maturation, and became pregnant, while <i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i>;Vglut2<i><sup>flox</sup></i> mice showed no pubertal development. Our results indicate that glutamatergic neurotransmission from leptin sensitive neurons regulates the reproductive axis, and that leptin action on pubertal development via PMv neurons requires Vglut2.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95191">Emerging role of oncogenic ß-catenin in exosome biogenesis as a driver of immune escape in hepatocellular carcinoma</a></h4>

              
                Immune checkpoint inhibitors have produced encouraging results in cancer patients. However, the majority of ß-catenin-mutated tumors have been described as lacking immune infiltrates and resistant to immunotherapy. The mechanisms by which oncogenic ß-catenin affects immune surveillance remain unclear. Herein, we highlighted the involvement of ß-catenin in the regulation of the exosomal pathway and, by extension, in immune/cancer cell communication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We showed that mutated ß-catenin represses expression of <i>SDC4</i> and <i>RAB27A</i>, two main actors in exosome biogenesis, in both liver cancer cell lines and HCC patient samples. Using nanoparticle tracking analysis and live-cell imaging, we further demonstrated that activated ß-catenin represses exosome release. Then, we demonstrated in 3D spheroid models that activation of β-catenin promotes a decrease in immune cell infiltration through a defect in exosome secretion. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that oncogenic ß-catenin plays a key role in exosome biogenesis. Our study gives new insight into the impact of ß-catenin mutations on tumor microenvironment remodeling, which could lead to the development of new strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88838">Emotional vocalizations alter behaviors and neurochemical release into the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain center of emotional expression, contributes to acoustic communication by first interpreting the meaning of social sounds in the context of the listener’s internal state, then organizing the appropriate behavioral responses. We propose that modulatory neurochemicals such as acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations. We tested this in a vocal playback experiment utilizing highly affective vocal sequences associated with either mating or restraint, then sampled and analyzed fluids within the BLA for a broad range of neurochemicals and observed behavioral responses of adult male and female mice. In male mice, playback of restraint vocalizations increased ACh release and usually decreased DA release, while playback of mating sequences evoked the opposite neurochemical release patterns. In non-estrus female mice, patterns of ACh and DA release with mating playback were similar to males. Estrus females, however, showed increased ACh, associated with vigilance, as well as increased DA, associated with reward-seeking. Experimental groups that showed increased ACh release also showed the largest increases in an aversive behavior. These neurochemical release patterns and several behavioral responses depended on a single prior experience with the mating and restraint behaviors. Our results support a model in which ACh and DA provide contextual information to sound analyzing BLA neurons that modulate their output to downstream brain regions controlling behavioral responses to social vocalizations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89656">Enrichment of rare codons at 5' ends of genes is a spandrel caused by evolutionary sequence turnover and does not improve translation</a></h4>

              
                Previously, Tuller et al. found that the first 30–50 codons of the genes of yeast and other eukaryotes are slightly enriched for rare codons. They argued that this slowed translation, and was adaptive because it queued ribosomes to prevent collisions. Today, the translational speeds of different codons are known, and indeed rare codons are translated slowly. We re-examined this 5’ slow translation ‘ramp.’ We confirm that 5’ regions are slightly enriched for rare codons; in addition, they are depleted for downstream Start codons (which are fast), with both effects contributing to slow 5’ translation. However, we also find that the 5’ (and 3’) ends of yeast genes are poorly conserved in evolution, suggesting that they are unstable and turnover relatively rapidly. When a new 5’ end forms de novo, it is likely to include codons that would otherwise be rare. Because evolution has had a relatively short time to select against these codons, 5’ ends are typically slightly enriched for rare, slow codons. Opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al., we show by direct experiment that genes with slowly translated codons at the 5’ end are expressed relatively poorly, and that substituting faster synonymous codons improves expression. Direct experiment shows that slow codons do not prevent downstream ribosome collisions. Further informatic studies suggest that for natural genes, slow 5’ ends are correlated with poor gene expression, opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al. Thus, we conclude that slow 5’ translation is a ‘spandrel’--a non-adaptive consequence of something else, in this case, the turnover of 5’ ends in evolution, and it does not improve translation.

	<p>The issue of literacy challenges among dyslexic adults remains a significant concern. This study investigates spelling deficits among highly educated adults with dyslexia learning a transparent orthography. Thirty-eight Italian dyslexic university students were examined and compared to a group of age- and education-matched typical readers. Firstly, we analyzed spelling performance using a Passage Dictation Test. Additionally, lists of words varying in length and word frequency were dictated under two experimental conditions: a normal condition (NC) and an articulatory suppression condition (ASC). The ASC assessed the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to spell with interference to the phonological (sublexical) spelling procedure, i.e., the most likely compensated spelling strategy of Italian dyslexic spellers. The results clearly indicated that, in spelling the meaningful passage, dyslexic participants underperformed compared to the controls, with a prevalence of lexical errors, despite the comparison with the normative reference data showing only mild spelling difficulties. In spelling isolated words in normal conditions, dyslexic participants performed within the reference norms and as accurately as control participants across all stimuli (short words, high- and low-frequency words), except for long words, where their spelling difficulties were evident. Articulatory suppression significantly impaired dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; performance on short stimuli, reducing the usual sublexical advantage associated with them, and exacerbated misspellings on long words. Additionally, articulatory suppression disproportionately affected dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; performance on high-frequency words, diminishing the typical lexical advantage associated with these words. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical, clinical, and educational implications.</p>

	<p>The global population has been significantly affected by the pandemic in terms of physical and mental health. According to transactional theory, individuals have undergone an adaptation process influenced by cognitive control abilities. Emotional responses to COVID-19-related stimuli may interfere with top-down attentional processes, thereby hindering adaptation. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related stimuli on attentional processing and to determine whether psychological factors could modulate these effects. A sample of 96 healthy undergraduate students participated in an emotional Stroop task in which they were presented with a series of stimuli, including both neutral and negative COVID-19-related as well as non-COVID-19 stimuli. COVID-19-related PTSD, as an index of distress (PTSS), and trait anxiety were evaluated. Results showed that participants were more accurate in identifying COVID-19-related stimuli compared to non-COVID-19 stimuli. Being female and having higher retrospective PTSS scores related to COVID-19 were predictive of faster reaction times for both neutral and negative COVID-19-related stimuli. This heightened attentional bias toward COVID-19-related stimuli suggests that individuals may be more sensitive to stimuli associated with the pandemic. The results suggest that the association between COVID-19 stimuli and attentional biases extends beyond emotional valence, being retrospectively influenced by mental health, suggesting potential pathways to future mental health challenges.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is associated with changes in white matter (WM) integrity and with reduced life expectancy, in part because of the cardiometabolic side effects of antipsychotics. Physical activity (PA) has emerged as a candidate lifestyle intervention that is safe and effective. The study aimed to assess how an adapted PA program delivered remotely by web (e-APA) improved WM integrity in patients with schizophrenia (SZPs) and healthy controls (HCs) and to evaluate associations among WM integrity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and symptom severity. This longitudinal study was conducted over 16 weeks with 31 participants (18 SZPs and 13 HCs). Diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics were employed to assess WM integrity. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), and assessments for clinical symptoms included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Self-evaluation of Negative Symptoms and the Brief Negative Syndrome Scale (BNSS). Only the SZPs had significantly increased WM integrity after the e-APA program, with increased fractional anisotropy and decreased radial diffusivity in fasciculi involved in motor functions and language process. Furthermore, decreased negative symptoms assessed with BNSS were associated with greater WM integrity following the program. These findings suggest that e-APA may improve WM integrity abnormalities and support e-APA as a promising therapeutic strategy.</p>

	<p>Background: Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) improved communicative skills in adults with post-stroke aphasia demonstrating the effectiveness in speech disorders and consequent improvement of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; communication skills. This study aimed to report the efficacy of AAC in the rehabilitation of cognitive disorders and to estimate how the changes in cognitive and communicative functions could enhance the quality of life in patients affected by severe acquired brain injury. Methods: Three patients with pontine cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and meningioma expressed in the posterior cranial fossa, respectively, were submitted to rehabilitative training with AAC for 6 months. Patients underwent to neuropsychological and mood evaluations at the beginning of AAC treatment (T0) and after rehabilitative training (T1). Results: The results support the efficacy of AAC in the improvement of cognitive functions, particularly in memory, attention, and language domains. In addition, we described also an improvement in the quality of life and a decrease in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The AAC seems to be an important rehabilitative technique for the recovery of cognitive functions with a consequent effect in improvement of psychological aspects and quality of life in patients with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).</p>

	<p>Sexual dimorphism in temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and their comorbidity with migraine are important phenomena observed in clinics. TMDs are the most prevalent orofacial pain conditions with jaw joint and masseter muscle dysfunction. Migraine is the predominant headache commonly associated with TMDs. Women much more often suffer from this orofacial pain than men. However, currently, there is no gender-specific therapy for such pain conditions. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms behind sex differences in TMDs as well as their comorbidity with migraines is essential for developing novel approaches for gender-specific treatment of TMDs and related orofacial pain comorbidity. In this review, we summarize recent research progress regarding sex differences in TMDs, focusing on the underlying mechanisms including craniofacial anatomy, hormonal regulation, and roles of opioids, transient receptor potential channels, and endocannabinoid systems. We also discuss the mechanisms of comorbid TMDs and migraine. The information covered in this review will provide mechanistic insights into sex differences in TMDs and their comorbidity with migraine, which could aid in developing effective treatment strategies for the overlapping orofacial pain condition.</p>

	<p>Lack of sleep has been found to be associated with cognitive impairment in children, yet the neural mechanism underlying this relationship remains poorly understood. To address this issue, this study utilized the data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n = 4930, aged 9&amp;amp;ndash;10), involving their sleep assessments, cognitive measures, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional n-back task. Using partial correlations analysis, we found that the out-of-scanner cognitive performance was positively correlated with sleep duration. Additionally, the activation of regions of interest (ROIs) in frontal and parietal cortices for the 2-back versus 0-back contrast was positively correlated with both sleep duration and cognitive performance. Mediation analysis revealed that this activation significantly mediated the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive function at both individual ROI level and network level. After performing analyses separately for different sexes, it was revealed that the mediation effect of the task-related activation was present in girls (n = 2546). These findings suggest that short sleep duration may lead to deficit in cognitive function of children, particularly in girls, through the modulation of frontoparietal activation during working memory load.</p>

	<p>This study determines the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test to detect perceptual abnormalities and whether there are differences between gender. Vision is a complex process involving visual perception. Any alterations can affect learning, so having a screening test in Spanish that is easy to use and reliable for timely diagnosis will reduce the percentage of visuo-perceptual interference during learning process. A total of 200 subjects participated, aged between 8 and 15 years old, with good visual acuity, and no strabismus, amblyopia, ocular pathology, or neurological damage. The Petrosyan questionnaire (screening test) was employed to identify symptoms associated with perceptual impairment, and a subsequent assessment was conducted to evaluate perceptual abilities. The mean age was 11.5 years (57% male; 44% female). The screening test indicated that 30% of the subjects were suspected of having perceptual alteration, while 24% were diagnosed with a real alteration in perceptual abilities. The sensitivity was 1 and the specificity was 0.92. The Spanish version of the Petrosyan questionnaire has high sensitivity and specificity values and is therefore considered very accurate for identifying the need for a perceptual assessment. There are statistically significant differences in perceptual abilities according to gender. The female group shows more symptomatology and a higher percentage of alteration in perceptual skills.</p>

	<p>This study aims to assess oculomotor and vestibular endurance by utilizing the Oculomotor and Vestibular Endurance Screening (MoVES) assessment in athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; pre-season and post-season and after a suspected head injury to detect impairment. Athletes (N = 311, 19.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years) were recruited to perform the following seven tasks: (1) horizontal saccades, (2) vertical saccades, (3) vergence jumps, (4) horizontal vestibular-oculomotor reflex (VOR), (5) vertical VOR, (6) amplitude of accommodation (AoA), and (7) near point of convergence (NPC). At pre-season, the observed number of eye movements in 60 s are horizontal saccades (74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13 initial 30 s; 67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 latter 30 s), vertical saccades (70 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13; 66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10), vergence jumps (48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12; 45 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13), horizontal VOR (38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11; 38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11), and vertical VOR (8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11; 38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11). These results establish a normative database for eye movements within the MoVES assessment and show consistency in the number of movements from pre-season to post-season. The initial results show a trending decrease in the number of eye movements in the initial days post-head injury, which improves to pre-season measures 14&amp;amp;ndash;21 days post-injury. This foundation can be used by future studies to explore the extent of binocular and vestibular endurance dysfunctions caused by head injuries that subside within two weeks.</p>

<p>Ventral subiculum is shown to be involved in learning and memory and mediate affective behaviors. The present study demonstrated the critical role of ventral subiculum in maintaining arousal and sleep, as its lesion caused a profound disturbance of sleep–wake behaviors. Exposure to SPR reversed the VSL-induced alterations in sleep–wakefulness behavior.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ventral subiculum regulates emotion, stress responses, and spatial and social cognition. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated anxiety- and depression-like symptoms, deficits in spatial and social cognition in ventral subicular lesioned (VSL) rats, and restoration of affective and cognitive behaviors following photoperiod manipulation (short photoperiod regime, SPR; 6:18 LD cycle). In the present study, we have studied the impact of VSL on sleep–wake behavioral patterns and the effect of SPR on sleep–wakefulness behavior. Adult male Wistar rats subjected to VSL demonstrated decreased wake duration and enhanced total sleep time due to increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Power spectral analysis indicated increased delta activity during NREMS and decreased sigma band power during all vigilance states. Light is one of the strongest entrainers of the circadian rhythm, and its manipulation may have various physiological and functional consequences. We investigated the effect of 21-day exposure to SPR on sleep–wakefulness (S–W) behavior in VSL rats. We observed that SPR exposure restored S–W behavior in VSL rats, resulting in an increase in wake duration and a significant increase in theta power during wake and REMS. This study highlights the crucial role of the ventral subiculum in maintaining normal sleep–wakefulness patterns and highlights the effectiveness of photoperiod manipulation as a non-pharmacological treatment for reversing sleep disturbances reported in mood and neuropsychiatric disorders like Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, which also involve alterations in circadian rhythm.</p>

	<p>Several therapies have been developed to reduce cognitive decline associated with aging. Aquatic exercises, which are widely used to enhance functional capacity, may play a role in stimulating cognitive functions. This study investigated the effects of a 3-month aquatic exercise program on cognitive functions in community-dwelling older adults. In this prospective, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, 31 participants were allocated to either the experimental (aquatic exercises) or control (no-exercise) group. The intervention program consisted of exercises conducted twice a week in a 1.2 m deep indoor pool. The main outcome measures were cognitive functions, assessed using Raven&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progressive Matrices test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess the impact of the exercise program. The effect sizes (&amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p) were reported when a level of significance was achieved (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, the participants who underwent aquatic exercises showed positive outcomes in Raven&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progressive Matrices test (p = 0.046; &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.131) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.589). Complementary analyses of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test indicated that the benefits of the aquatic exercise were observed in terms of the number of trials (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.478), number of errors (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.458), and number of non-perseverative errors (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.302). The results indicate that a period of three months of aquatic exercise was beneficial for stimulating specific aspects of the cognitive function of community-dwelling older individuals. Aquatic exercise should be prescribed to this population.</p>

	<p>In the pediatric population, epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that often results in cognitive dysfunction. It affects patients&amp;amp;rsquo; life quality by limiting academic performance and self-esteem and increasing social rejection. There are several interventions for the neurohabilitation of cognitive impairment, including LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy (LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T), which promotes neuronal connectivity and cortical plasticity through the use of assembly sets and robotic programming. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T on cognitive processes in pediatric patients with epilepsy. Eligible patients were identified; in the treatment group, an initial evaluation was performed with the NEUROPSI and BANFE-2 neuropsychological tests. Then, the interventions were performed once a week, and a final test was performed. In the control group, after the initial evaluation, the final evaluation was performed. An overall improvement was observed in the LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T patients, with a significant increase in BANFE-2 scores in the orbitomedial, anterior prefrontal, and dorsolateral areas. In addition, in the gain score analysis, the orbitomedial and memory scores were significantly different from the control group. LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T neurohabilitation is a remarkable option for epilepsy patients, who are motivated when they observe improvements.</p>

	<p>Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) display many cognitive and physiological alterations resulting from renal failure and physical inactivity. Caffeine intake has been reported to improve cognitive/physical performance in several studies. However, whether the benefits of caffeine intake apply to patients with ESRD remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of caffeine intake on postural balance, cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD. In a randomized order, 12 patients with ESRD (age: 33.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.57 years; Female: 45.5%) performed a battery of tests after either caffeine (CF) (400 mg) or placebo (PLA) ingestion. Postural balance was evaluated using a stabilometric platform. Functional capacity was assessed with the sit-to-stand and up-and-go tests, and for cognitive performances, reaction time test and a vigilance test were used. Results showed a significant improvement in up-and-go test (p = 0.01) and sit-to-stand test performances with CF compared to PLA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Time of reaction test and vigilance test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) performances were significantly higher with CF. No significant difference was observed in postural balance between CF and PLA. The results of this study suggest that acute caffeine ingestion positively enhances cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD.</p>

                Abstract* Background The level of liver fibrosis is the basis for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and it is necessary to adapt non-invasive liver fibrosis modalities. We aimed to investigate the use of M2BPGi as a single or combined diagnostic modality for liver fibrosis in CHB patients through a stepwise diagnostic analysis. Methods Cross-sectional data were taken from patients between October 2021 and August 2022. Demographic data, blood profile, liver function, and liver stiffness were measured in CHB patients over 18 years old, willing to take part in the research, and had complete data. APRI, FIB-4, and AAR were calculated using the well-known formulas. Serum M2BPGi-levels were converted into a cut-off index (COI). The patients were divided into low-risk (LR) and high-risk fibrosis (HR) groups. A cut-off for each predictor variable to differentiate between the LR and HR groups was determined. The obtained cut-off was assessed for its association with the grouping of liver elastography results. Models to diagnose the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥8 kPa were created and compared through multivariate and ROC analyses. Results The number of patients that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria was 143 (HR = 65, LR = 78). The cut-off for diagnosing LSM ≥8kPa was 0.311, 0.742, 0.635, and 1.434 for APRI, FIB-4, AAR, and M2BPGi, respectively. This cut-off was significantly associated with the results of the HR and LR groupings. A multivariate analysis found that FIB4, AAR, and M2BPGi added significantly to the model. Statistically, the most optimal use of M2BPGi was combined with FIB-4, with an AUC of 0.835. Conclusions The optimal cut-off of M2BPGi for diagnosing high-risk liver fibrosis in this study was 1.434. M2BPGi should be used with FIB-4 as a diagnostic tool for diagnosing liver fibrosis, especially in the absence of a liver biopsy or elastography.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health threat. Understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions within TB granulomas will assist in identifying what leads to the successful elimination of infection. <i>In vitro</i> TB models provide a controllable environment to study these granuloma dynamics. Previously we developed a biomimetic 3D spheroid granuloma model that controls bacteria better than a traditional monolayer culture counterpart. We used agent-based simulations to predict the mechanistic reason for this difference. Our calibrated simulations were able to predict heterogeneous bacterial dynamics that are consistent with experimental data. In one group of simulations, spheroids are found to have higher macrophage activation than their traditional counterparts, leading to better bacterial control. This higher macrophage activation in the spheroids was not due to higher counts of activated T cells, instead fewer activated T cells were able to activate more macrophages due to the proximity of these cells to each other within the spheroid. In a second group of simulations, spheroids again have more macrophage activation but also more T cell activation, specifically CD8+ T cells. This higher level of CD8+ T cell activation is predicted to be due to the proximity of these cells to the cells that activate them. Multiple mechanisms of control were predicted. Simulations removing individual mechanisms show that one group of simulations has a CD4+ T cell dominant response, while the other has a mixed/CD8+ T cell dominant response. Lastly, we demonstrated that in spheroids the initial structure and movement rules work synergistically to reduce bacterial load. These findings provide valuable insights into how the structural complexity of <i>in vitro</i> models impacts immune responses. Moreover, our study has implications for engineering more physiologically relevant <i>in vitro</i> models and advancing our understanding of TB pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.

Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.

                <p>by Pascal Grobecker, Thomas Sakoparnig, Erik van Nimwegen</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a popular experimental method to study variation of gene expression within a population of cells. However, obtaining an accurate picture of the diversity of distinct gene expression states that are present in a given dataset is highly challenging because the sparsity of the scRNA-seq data and its inhomogeneous measurement noise properties. Although a vast number of different methods is applied in the literature for clustering cells into subsets with ‘similar’ expression profiles, these methods generally lack rigorously specified objectives, involve multiple complex layers of normalization, filtering, feature selection, dimensionality-reduction, employ <i>ad hoc</i> measures of distance or similarity between cells, often ignore the known measurement noise properties of scRNA-seq measurements, and include a large number of tunable parameters. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to assign concrete biophysical meaning to the clusterings that result from these methods. Here we address the following problem: Given raw unique molecule identifier (UMI) counts of an scRNA-seq dataset, partition the cells into subsets such that the gene expression states of the cells in each subset are statistically indistinguishable, and each subset corresponds to a distinct gene expression state. That is, we aim to partition cells so as to maximally reduce the complexity of the dataset without removing any of its meaningful structure. We show that, given the known measurement noise structure of scRNA-seq data, this problem is mathematically well-defined and derive its unique solution from first principles. We have implemented this solution in a tool called Cellstates which operates directly on the raw data and automatically determines the optimal partition and cluster number, with zero tunable parameters. We show that, on synthetic datasets, Cellstates almost perfectly recovers optimal partitions. On real data, Cellstates robustly identifies subtle substructure within groups of cells that are traditionally annotated as a common cell type. Moreover, we show that the diversity of gene expression states that Cellstates identifies systematically depends on the tissue of origin and not on technical features of the experiments such as the total number of cells and total UMI count per cell. In addition to the Cellstates tool we also provide a small toolbox of software to place the identified cellstates into a hierarchical tree of higher-order clusters, to identify the most important differentially expressed genes at each branch of this hierarchy, and to visualize these results.

Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves has been used in various pathological contexts for rehabilitation purposes or to alleviate the symptoms of neuropathologies, thus improving the overall quality of life of patients. However, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is still a challenging issue requiring extensive <i>in vivo</i> experimental campaigns and technical development. To facilitate the design of new stimulation strategies, we provide a fully open source and self-contained software framework for the <i>in silico</i> evaluation of peripheral nerve electrical stimulation. Our modeling approach, developed in the popular and well-established Python language, uses an object-oriented paradigm to map the physiological and electrical context. The framework is designed to facilitate multi-scale analysis, from single fiber stimulation to whole multifascicular nerves. It also allows the simulation of complex strategies such as multiple electrode combinations and waveforms ranging from conventional biphasic pulses to more complex modulated kHz stimuli. In addition, we provide automated support for stimulation strategy optimization and handle the computational backend transparently to the user. Our framework has been extensively tested and validated with several existing results in the literature.

                <p>by Mani Erfanian Abdoust, Monja Isabel Froböse, Alfons Schnitzler, Elisabeth Schreivogel, Gerhard Jocham</p>

In everyday life, we encounter situations that require tradeoffs between potential rewards and associated costs, such as time and (physical) effort. The literature indicates a prominent role for dopamine in discounting of both delay and effort, with mixed findings for delay discounting in humans. Moreover, the reciprocal antagonistic interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic transmission in the striatum suggests a potential opponent role of acetylcholine in these processes. We found opposing effects of dopamine D2 (haloperidol) and acetylcholine M1 receptor (biperiden) antagonism on specific components of effort-based decision-making in healthy humans: haloperidol decreased, whereas biperiden increased the willingness to exert physical effort. In contrast, delay discounting was reduced under haloperidol, but not affected by biperiden. Together, our data suggest that dopamine, acting at D2 receptors, modulates both effort and delay discounting, while acetylcholine, acting at M1 receptors, appears to exert a more specific influence on effort discounting only.

Glial cells such as astrocytes can modulate neuronal signaling. Astrocytes can also acquire a reactive phenotype that correlates with cognitive impairments in brain diseases. A study in PLOS Biology shows that prolonged activation of astrocytes can trigger both cognitive impairments and a reactive astrocyte phenotype.

Over-generalized fear is a maladaptive response to harmless stimuli or situations characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. The dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) contains engram cells that play a crucial role in accurate memory retrieval. However, the coordination mechanism of neuronal subpopulations within the dDG network during fear generalization is not well understood. Here, with the Tet-off system combined with immunostaining and two-photon calcium imaging, we report that dDG fear engram cells labeled in the conditioned context constitutes a significantly higher proportion of dDG neurons activated in a similar context where mice show generalized fear. The activation of these dDG fear engram cells encoding the conditioned context is both sufficient and necessary for inducing fear generalization in the similar context. Activities of mossy cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vMCs) are significantly suppressed in mice showing fear generalization in a similar context, and activating the vMCs-dDG pathway suppresses generalized but not conditioned fear. Finally, modifying fear memory engrams in the dDG with “safety” signals effectively rescues fear generalization. These findings reveal that the competitive advantage of dDG engram cells underlies fear generalization, which can be rescued by activating the vMCs-dDG pathway or modifying fear memory engrams, and provide novel insights into the dDG network as the neuronal basis of fear generalization.

                Background Currently there are 1.3 billion adolescents worldwide, which makes up 16% of the world population. Over 20% of adolescents around the world are thought to have behavioural or mental health issues. Addressing mental health issues is very important for the promotion of positive health in adolescents. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among adolescents in urban and rural areas of Shivamogga. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 350 adolescents aged 16 to 19 years each from urban and rural areas of Shivamogga. Results Depression, anxiety and stress were found to be 23.1%, 29.4% and 26.6% in urban areas and 19.1%, 24% and 21.1% in rural areas respectively. Depression was more common among females in both urban and rural settings, with a significant difference observed in rural areas. Anxiety and stress were also more prevalent among females, with anxiety significantly higher in urban females. Urban adolescents exhibited higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress compared to their rural counterparts. Conclusions About a quarter of the adolescent population suffers from depression anxiety and stress. Adopting and implementing better education and health policies are necessary to enhance adolescent mental health.

                In statistical analyses, a common practice for enhancing the validity of variance analysis is the application of data transformation to convert measurements into a different mathematical scale. This technique was first employed in 1898 by Edgeworth and remains relevant in current scientific publications despite the proliferation of more modern and advanced techniques that obviate the need for certain assumptions. Data transformations, when appropriately used, can make the model error terms approximate a normal distribution. It is also possible to use the technique to correct the heterogeneity of variances or to render an additive model, ensuring the validity of the analysis of variances. Given that this technique can be hastily applied, potentially leading to erroneous or invalid results, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies in the field of agrarian sciences that utilized data transformations for the validation of analysis of variances. The aim was to check the transformations employed by the scientific community, the motivation behind their use, and to identify possible errors and inconsistencies in applying the technique in publications. In this study, we identified shortcomings and misconceptions associated with using this method, and we observed incomplete and inadequate utilization of the technique in 94.28 % of the analysed sample, resulting in misguided and erroneous conclusions in scientific research outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-785/v4?src=rss">Records of antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to COVID-19: A systematic review [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby’s immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340859, 23 June 2022).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-357/v3?src=rss">A detailed methodology for a three-dimensional, self-structuring bone model that supports the differentiation of osteoblasts towards osteocytes and the production of a complex collagen-rich mineralised matrix [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approve</a></h4>

              
                Background There are insufficient in vitro bone models that accommodate long-term culture of osteoblasts and support their differentiation to osteocytes. The increased demand for effective therapies for bone diseases, and the ethical requirement to replace animals in research, warrants the development of such models. Here we present an in-depth protocol to prepare, create and maintain three-dimensional, in vitro, self-structuring bone models that support osteocytogenesis and long-term osteoblast survival (>1 year). Methods Osteoblastic cells are seeded on a fibrin hydrogel, cast between two beta-tricalcium phosphate anchors. Analytical methods optimised for these self-structuring bone model (SSBM) constructs, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining and XRF, are described in detail. Results Over time, the cells restructure and replace the initial matrix with a collagen-rich, mineralising one; and demonstrate differentiation towards osteocytes within 12 weeks of culture. Conclusions Whilst optimised using a secondary human cell line (hFOB 1.19), this protocol readily accommodates osteoblasts from other species (rat and mouse) and origins (primary and secondary). This simple, straightforward method creates reproducible in vitro bone models that are responsive to exogenous stimuli, offering a versatile platform for conducting preclinical translatable research studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-794/v1?src=rss">Antecedents of entrepreneurial networking behavior and its impact on business performance - a systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the existing research on the antecedents of entrepreneurial networking behavior namely motivational factors and personality factors and its impact on business performance. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a systematic review methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines.. Using the SCOPUS database, the search involved Boolean operators to narrow down relevant articles published in English between 2000 and 2024. Following a meticulous screening process, 32 articles were selected for review after removing duplicates and excluding non-English articles. Methodological quality assessment ensuring focused research questions, precise subject selection methods, representative samples, and reliable measurement instruments was carried out. Findings The results demonstrate that entrepreneurs who are self-reliant and extroverted have fewer partners, however, these traits positively impact networking activities. The Big Five personality traits predict business creation and success of ventures. Desire for financial gain, risk-taking propensity, self-confidence, and the need for achievement influences networking behavior. Implications The insights given in this paper can be used for establishing valuable connections, investing in resources, and preparing effective strategies for businesses. Policymakers who aim to promote entrepreneurial behavior among experienced individuals must emphasize the motivations for starting a business and the role of personalities in harnessing and leveraging individual entrepreneurial expertise. Originality The existing literature on antecedents of entrepreneurial networking Behavior and the relationship of these antecedents together with business performance is limited. Further, this review article also offers avenues for future researchers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-793/v1?src=rss">Neurotoxicity of nanoplastics: A review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                With the increase in plastic waste in the environment, it is undeniable that humans and most organisms are exposed to plastic particles of various sizes, including nanoplastics (NPs). Humans are at risk owing to various routes of entry, including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. While the toxicity of NPs is still debatable due to the scarcity of resources and research, most studies have concluded that NPs may exert toxicity, which exacerbates their neurotoxicity potential. Earlier studies concluded that NPs can cause oxidative stress, which results in apoptosis of neuronal cells. Some studies have shown that NPs can affect fundamental cell functions by inducing physical stress through deposition. Furthermore, studies on in vivo models exposed to NPs have demonstrated behavioral changes that are presumably due to alterations in acetylcholinesterase activity and neurotransmitter levels. This review discusses studies conducted on the neurotoxic potential of NPs and their effects, which are dependent on several parameters, including size and type of NPs, exposure concentration, duration, and various models at risk of NP exposure. Furthermore, speculations on how NPs are related to neurotoxicity are also discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95397">Uncovering the BIN1-SH3 interactome underpinning centronuclear myopathy</a></h4>

              
                Truncation of the protein-protein interaction SH3 domain of the membrane remodeling Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1, Amphiphysin 2) protein leads to centronuclear myopathy. Here, we assessed the impact of a set of naturally observed, previously uncharacterized BIN1 SH3 domain variants using conventional <i>in vitro</i> and cell-based assays monitoring the BIN1 interaction with dynamin 2 (DNM2) and identified potentially harmful ones that can be also tentatively connected to neuromuscular disorders. However, SH3 domains are typically promiscuous and it is expected that other, so far unknown partners of BIN1 exist besides DNM2, that also participate in the development of centronuclear myopathy. In order to shed light on these other relevant interaction partners and to get a holistic picture of the pathomechanism behind BIN1 SH3 domain variants, we used affinity interactomics. We identified hundreds of new BIN1 interaction partners proteome-wide, among which many appear to participate in cell division, suggesting a critical role of BIN1 in the regulation of mitosis. Finally, we show that the identified BIN1 mutations indeed cause proteome-wide affinity perturbation, signifying the importance of employing unbiased affinity interactomic approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91931">The components of an electrical synapse as revealed by expansion microscopy of a single synaptic contact</a></h4>

              
                Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell-cell communication, known as 'chemical' and 'electrical' synapses, respectively. Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components. Electrical synapses are, on the other hand, generally defined by the presence of a 'gap junction' (a cluster of intercellular channels) between two neuronal processes. However, while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism, it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures. We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse. Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures. Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components. Remarkably, most of the synaptic contact's surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95318">RBM7 deficiency promotes breast cancer metastasis by coordinating MFGE8 splicing switch and NF-kB pathway</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant alternative splicing is well-known to be closely associated with tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis driven by deregulated splicing events remain largely unexplored. Here, we unveiled that RBM7 is decreased in lymph node and distant organ metastases of breast cancer as compared to primary lesions and low expression of RBM7 is correlated with the reduced disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. Breast cancer cells with RBM7 depletion exhibited an increased potential for lung metastasis compared to scramble control cells. The absence of RBM7 stimulated breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, RBM7 controlled the splicing switch of MFGE8, favoring the production of the predominant isoform of MFGE8, MFGE8-L. This resulted in the attenuation of STAT1 phosphorylation and alterations in cell adhesion molecules. MFGE8-L exerted an inhibitory effect on the migratory and invasive capability of breast cancer cells, while the truncated isoform MFGE8-S, which lack the second F5/8 type C domain had the opposite effect. In addition, RBM7 negatively regulates the NF-κB cascade and an NF-κB inhibitor could obstruct the increase in HUVEC tube formation caused by RBM7 silencing. Clinically, we noticed a positive correlation between RBM7 expression and MFGE8 exon7 inclusion in breast cancer tissues, providing new mechanistic insights for molecular-targeted therapy in combating breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93194">Evolutionary adaptation of an HP1-protein chromodomain integrates chromatin and DNA sequence signals</a></h4>

              
                Members of the diverse heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family play crucial roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin-binding patterns, likely due to interactions with various specificity factors. Previously, we showed that the chromatin-binding pattern of the HP1 protein Rhino, a crucial factor of the <i>Drosophila</i> PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, is largely defined by a DNA sequence-specific C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein named Kipferl (Baumgartner et al., 2022). Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between Rhino and its guidance factor Kipferl. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and in vivo genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhino’s chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but disrupts the interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the <i>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></i> mutation phenocopy <i>kipferl</i> mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of <i>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></i> flies. Thus, Rhino’s chromodomain functions as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89032">Vacuolar H+-ATPase determines daughter cell fates through asymmetric segregation of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) generate two daughter cells with identical genetic information but distinct cell fates through epigenetic mechanisms. However, the process of partitioning different epigenetic information into daughter cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell rather than the apoptotic one during ACDs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The absence of NuRD triggers apoptosis via the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway, while an ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic daughter cells to survive. We identify the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex as a crucial regulator of NuRD’s asymmetric segregation. V-ATPase interacts with NuRD and is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell. Inhibition of V-ATPase disrupts cytosolic pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry. We suggest that asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase may cause distinct acidification levels in the two daughter cells, enabling asymmetric epigenetic inheritance that specifies their respective life-versus-death fates.

	<p>Emotion dysregulation has long been considered a key symptom in multiple psychiatric disorders. Difficulties in emotion regulation have been associated with neural dysregulation in fronto-limbic circuits. Real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NFB) has become increasingly popular as a potential treatment for emotional dysregulation in psychiatric disorders, as it is able to directly target the impaired neural circuits. However, the clinical impact of these rt-fMRI-NFB protocols in psychiatric populations is still largely unknown. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of primary studies from 2010 to 2023 that used rt-fMRI-NFB to target emotion regulation. We assessed 41 out of 4001 original studies for methodological quality and risk of bias and synthesised concerning the frequency of significant rt-fMRI-NFB-related effects on the neural and behaviour level. Successful modulation of brain activity was reported in between 25 and 50 percent of study samples, while neural effects in clinical samples were more diverse than in healthy samples. Interestingly, the frequency of rt-fMRI-NFB-related behavioural improvement was over 75 percent in clinical samples, while healthy samples showed behavioural improvements between 0 and 25 percent. Concerning clinical subsamples, rt-fMRI-NFB-related behavioural improvement was observed in up to 100 percent of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) samples. Substance use samples showed behavioural benefits ranging between 50 and 75 percent. Neural effects appeared to be less frequent than behavioural improvements: most neural outcomes ranged between 25 and 50 percent for MDD and substance use and between 0 and 25 percent for PTSD. Using multiple individualised regions of interest (ROIs) for rt-fMRI-NFB training resulted in more frequent behavioural benefits than rt-fMRI-NFB solely based on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex. While a significant improvement in behavioural outcomes was reported in most clinical studies, the study protocols were heterogeneous, which limits the current evaluation of rt-fMRI-NFB as a putative treatment for emotional dysregulation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic and progressive neuropsychiatric illness. Apart from positive and negative symptoms, 98% of the population diagnosed with schizophrenia have impaired cognitive functioning, which significantly influences the quality of life. The correlation between lipids and cognitive functioning has been well established. Our study aimed to investigate correlations between cognitive functions, the severity of schizophrenia symptoms, and lipid profiles. (2) Methods: Fifty-two women diagnosed with schizophrenia participated in this study. Cognitive functioning was measured using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) was used. The serum lipid profile, including low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), and triglycerides was measured. (3) Results: Better cognitive functions were associated with normal HDL levels, while low HDL levels correlated with worse WSCT scores. Only the PANSS negative subscale showed a correlation with HDL levels. Correlations with chronicity of schizophrenia and the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s age with poorer cognitive functions, but not with symptom severity, were detected. Early/late age at onset did not influence WSCT scores. (4) Conclusions: Our results suggest high HDL levels might be a protective factor against cognitive impairment. The influences of age and illness duration also play a vital role in cognitive performance.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the significance of baseline measurements for amateur team athletes playing contact and collision team sports with a specific focus on the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) to improve concussion management. Symptoms of sports-related concussions (SRCs) can be diverse and long-lasting and include cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, and vestibular dysfunction. Therefore, comprehensive baseline data are essential to preventing recurrent concussions and secondary injuries. This study was conducted during the 2023 off-season and evaluated the baseline condition of 65 male university rugby players using the SCAT5, which includes self-reported symptoms, and the modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS). The athletes were assessed for the presence or absence of SRC, and the mean values were compared using the Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test. Among the participants, 35.38% (23/65) reported symptoms, with an average of 1.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8 symptoms per player and an average symptom score of 2.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.93. In the mBESS, no errors were observed in the tandem stance test; however, 72.31% (47/65) made errors in the single-leg stance test on the non-dominant foot, with an average of 1.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 errors. Many athletes self-reported symptoms and balance errors, even during asymptomatic periods before experiencing concussion, indicating unresolved issues. In the injury history survey, the baseline evaluations and injury histories of the participants classified into the SRC and non-SRC groups were compared. In the mBESS single-leg stance test (non-dominant foot), 84.21% (32/38) of the SRC group participants made errors, with an average score of 2.13 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.52, whereas 55.55% (15/27) of the non-SRC group participants made errors, with an average score of 1.15 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.35, showing a significant difference (p = 0.007). Additionally, significant differences were observed in the average number of ankle sprains (p = 0.027) and fractures (p = 0.048) between patients with and without a history of SRC. These findings indicate that athletes may have underlying issues even during normal periods before concussion. Moreover, the results highlighted the impact of previous concussions on motor control and injury risk. This underscores the importance of preseason baseline measurements using the SCAT to identify at-risk athletes and implement preventive measures. These findings align with the recommendations of the 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport and suggest further refinement of concussion assessment tools.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a significant concern as it is a risk factor for AD progression, and early detection is vital in order to delay dementia onset and enable potential therapeutic interventions. Olfactory impairment is recognized as a predictive biomarker in neurodegenerative processes. The aims of this study were to explore the degree of entorhinal cortical atrophy (ERICA) and the severity of MCI symptoms; to analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results for the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, peri entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellar tentorium; and to perform a comprehensive neuropsychological and psychophysical assessment. The main results highlighted that in our sample&amp;amp;mdash;multidomain amnesic MCI patients with hyposmic symptomatology&amp;amp;mdash;we found that ERICA scores were associated with the severity of anxiety symptomatology. One possible hypothesis to explain this observation is that anxiety may contribute to neurodegenerative processes by inducing chronic stress and inflammation. Future research should consider the longitudinal development of neuropsychological scores, anxiety disorders, and brain atrophy to determine their potential predictive value for MCI progression. These findings suggest the importance of psychological factors in MCI progression and the utility of neuropsychological assessment alongside neuroimaging techniques for early detection and follow-up in MCI patients.</p>

	<p>Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF)-induced illusion of hand movements produces beneficial effects in patients with chronic pain. However, neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly known. In this preliminary study, we test the novel hypothesis that such an MVF-induced movement illusion may exert its effects by changing the activity in midline cortical areas associated with pain processing. Electrical stimuli with individually fixed intensity were applied to the left hand of healthy adults to produce painful and non-painful sensations during unilateral right-hand movements with such an MVF illusion and right and bilateral hand movements without MVF. During these events, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG alpha rhythms (8&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz) indexed the neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms inducing cortical activation. Compared to the painful sensations, the non-painful sensations were specifically characterized by (1) lower alpha ERD estimated in the cortical midline, angular gyrus, and lateral parietal regions during the experimental condition with MVF and (2) higher alpha ERD estimated in the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions during the control conditions without MVF. These preliminary results suggest that the MVF-induced movement illusion may affect nociception and neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms, reducing the activation in cortical limbic and default mode regions.</p>

	<p>Over the past three decades, substantial advancements have occurred in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). These developments encompass various non-invasive techniques aimed at modulating brain function. Among the most widely utilized methods today are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), which include direct- or alternating-current transcranial stimulation (tDCS/tACS). In addition to these established techniques, newer modalities have emerged, broadening the scope of non-invasive neuromodulation approaches available for research and clinical applications in movement disorders, particularly for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and, to a lesser extent, atypical Parkinsonism (AP). All NIBS techniques offer the opportunity to explore a wide range of neurophysiological mechanisms and exert influence over distinct brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism. This paper&amp;amp;rsquo;s first aim is to provide a brief overview of the historical background and underlying physiological principles of primary NIBS techniques, focusing on their translational relevance. It aims to shed light on the potential identification of biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, by summarising available experimental data on individuals with Parkinsonism. To date, despite promising findings indicating the potential utility of NIBS techniques in Parkinsonism, their integration into clinical routine for diagnostic or therapeutic protocols remains a subject of ongoing investigation and scientific debate. In this context, this paper addresses current unsolved issues and methodological challenges concerning the use of NIBS, focusing on the importance of future research endeavours for maximizing the efficacy and relevance of NIBS strategies for individuals with Parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) increases primary motor cortex (M1) excitability and improves motor performance when applied unilaterally to the dominant hemisphere. However, the influence of tDCS on contralateral M1 excitability both during and after application has not been quantified. The purpose was to determine the influence of tDCS applied to the dominant M1 on the excitability of the contralateral non-dominant M1. This study employed a double-blind, randomized, SHAM-controlled, within-subject crossover experimental design. Eighteen young adults performed two experimental sessions (tDCS, SHAM) in counterbalanced order separated by a one-week washout. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to quantify the excitability of the contralateral M1 to which anodal tDCS was applied for 20 min with a current strength of 1 mA. Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed in 5 TMS test blocks (Pre, D5, D10, D15, and Post). The Pre and Post TMS test blocks were performed immediately before and after tDCS application, whereas the TMS test blocks performed during tDCS were completed at the 5, 10, and 15 min stimulation timepoints. MEPs were analyzed with a 2 condition (tDCS, SHAM) &amp;amp;times; 5 test (Pre, D5, D10, D15, Post) within-subject ANOVA. The main effect for condition (p = 0.213), the main effect for test (p = 0.502), and the condition &amp;amp;times; test interaction (p = 0.860) were all not statistically significant. These results indicate that tDCS does not modulate contralateral M1 excitability during or immediately after application, at least under the current set of common tDCS parameters of stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0263-24.2024?rss=1">Enhanced Synaptic Inhibition in the Dorsolateral Geniculate Nucleus in a Mouse Model of Glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                <p>Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) triggers glaucoma by damaging the output neurons of the retina called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This leads to the loss of RGC signaling to visual centers of the brain such as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is critical for processing and relaying information to the cortex for conscious vision. In response to altered levels of activity or synaptic input, neurons can homeostatically modulate postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor numbers, allowing them to scale their synaptic responses to stabilize spike output. While prior work has indicated unaltered glutamate receptor properties in the glaucomatous dLGN, it is unknown whether glaucoma impacts dLGN inhibition. Here, using DBA/2J mice, which develop elevated IOP beginning at 6&ndash;7&nbsp;months of age, we tested whether the strength of inhibitory synapses on dLGN thalamocortical relay neurons is altered in response to the disease state. We found an enhancement of feedforward disynaptic inhibition arising from local interneurons along with increased amplitude of quantal inhibitory synaptic currents. A combination of immunofluorescence staining for the -aminobutyric acid (GABA)<SUB>A</SUB>-&alpha;1 receptor subunit, peak-scaled nonstationary fluctuation analysis, and measures of homeostatic synaptic scaling pointed to an ~1.4-fold increase in GABA receptors at postsynaptic inhibitory synapses, although several pieces of evidence indicate a nonuniform scaling across inhibitory synapses within individual relay neurons. Together, these results indicate an increase in inhibitory synaptic strength in the glaucomatous dLGN, potentially pointing toward homeostatic compensation for disruptions in network and neuronal function triggered by increased IOP.</p>

                <p>Individuals exhibit significant variability in their ability to adapt locomotor skills, with some adapting quickly and others more slowly. Differences in brain activity likely contribute to this variability, but direct neural evidence is lacking. We investigated individual differences in electrocortical activity that led to faster locomotor adaptation rates. We recorded high-density electroencephalography while young, neurotypical adults adapted their walking on a split-belt treadmill and grouped them based on how quickly they restored their gait symmetry. Results revealed unique spectral signatures within the posterior parietal, bilateral sensorimotor, and right visual cortices that differ between fast and slow adapters. Specifically, fast adapters exhibited lower alpha power in the posterior parietal and right visual cortices during early adaptation, associated with quicker attainment of steady-state step length symmetry. Decreased posterior parietal alpha may reflect enhanced spatial attention, sensory integration, and movement planning to facilitate faster locomotor adaptation. Conversely, slow adapters displayed greater alpha and beta power in the right visual cortex during late adaptation, suggesting potential differences in visuospatial processing. Additionally, fast adapters demonstrated reduced spectral power in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices compared with slow adapters, particularly in the theta band, which may suggest variations in perception of the split-belt perturbation. These findings suggest that alpha and beta oscillations in the posterior parietal and visual cortices and theta oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are related to the rate of gait adaptation.</p>

                Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a G-coupled protein receptor that induces crucial biological processes when bound by sphingosine 1-phosphate. Here, we have characterized nine S1PR1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                One of the factors causing rice production disturbance in Indonesia is that farmers lack knowledge of early symptoms of rice plant diseases. These diseases are increasingly rampant because of the lack of experts. This study aimed to overcome this problem by providing an Expert System that helps farmers to make an early diagnosis of rice plant diseases. Data of rice plant pests and diseases in 2016 were taken from Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia using an in-depth survey, and rice experts from the Department of Food Crops and Horticulture of East Kalimantan Province were recruited for the project. The Expert System for Rice Plant Disease Diagnosis, ESforRPD2, was developed based on the pest and disease experiences of the rice experts and uses a Waterfall Paradigm and Unified Modeling Language. This Expert System can detect 48 symptoms and 8 types of diseases of rice plants from 16 data tests with a sensitivity of 87.5%. The system can also provide recommendations for the treatment of identified diseases. ESforRPD2 is available in Indonesian at http://esforrpd2.blog.unmul.ac.id

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-791/v1?src=rss">Real Customization or Just Marketing: Are Customized Versions of Generative AI Useful? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of fine-tuning their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-790/v1?src=rss">Prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms from online learning during the COVID-19 epidemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                <p>by Ziyan Guo, Jialu Yu, Wenxin Wang, Patricia Lockwood, Zhen Wu</p>

Altruistic punishment is key to establishing cooperation and maintaining social order, yet its developmental trends across cultures remain unclear. Using computational reinforcement learning models, we provided the first evidence of how social feedback dynamically influences group-biased altruistic punishment across cultures and the lifespan. Study 1 (<i>n</i> = 371) found that Chinese participants exhibited higher learning rates than Americans when socially incentivized to punish unfair allocations. Additionally, Chinese adults showed slower learning and less exploration when punishing ingroups than outgroups, a pattern absent in American counterparts, potentially reflecting a tendency towards ingroup favoritism that may contribute to reinforcing collectivist values. Study 2 (<i>n</i> = 430, aged 12–52) further showed that such ingroup favoritism develops with age. Chinese participants’ learning rates for ingroup punishment decreased from adolescence into adulthood, while outgroup rates stayed constant, implying a process of cultural learning. Our findings highlight cultural and age-related variations in altruistic punishment learning, with implications for social reinforcement learning and culturally sensitive educational practices promoting fairness and altruism.

                <p>by Vinoth Manivannan, Mandar M. Inamdar, Ranjith Padinhateeri</p>

Cells switch genes ON or OFF by altering the state of chromatin via histone modifications at specific regulatory locations along the chromatin polymer. These gene regulation processes are carried out by a network of reactions in which the histone marks spread to neighboring regions with the help of enzymes. In the literature, this spreading has been studied as a purely kinetic, non-diffusive process considering the interactions between neighboring nucleosomes. In this work, we go beyond this framework and study the spreading of modifications using a reaction-diffusion (RD) model accounting for the diffusion of the constituents. We quantitatively segregate the modification profiles generated from kinetic and RD models. The diffusion and degradation of enzymes set a natural length scale for limiting the domain size of modification spreading, and the resulting enzyme limitation is inherent in our model. We also demonstrate the emergence of confined modification domains without the explicit requirement of a nucleation site. We explore polymer compaction effects on spreading and show that single-cell domains may differ from averaged profiles. We find that the modification profiles from our model are comparable with existing H3K9me3 data of <i>S. pombe</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011953">An integrative approach to protein sequence design through multiobjective optimization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lu Hong, Tanja Kortemme</p>

With recent methodological advances in the field of computational protein design, in particular those based on deep learning, there is an increasing need for frameworks that allow for coherent, direct integration of different models and objective functions into the generative design process. Here we demonstrate how evolutionary multiobjective optimization techniques can be adapted to provide such an approach. With the established Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) as the optimization framework, we use AlphaFold2 and ProteinMPNN confidence metrics to define the objective space, and a mutation operator composed of ESM-1v and ProteinMPNN to rank and then redesign the least favorable positions. Using the two-state design problem of the foldswitching protein RfaH as an in-depth case study, and PapD and calmodulin as examples of higher-dimensional design problems, we show that the evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach leads to significant reduction in the bias and variance in RfaH native sequence recovery, compared to a direct application of ProteinMPNN. We suggest that this improvement is due to three factors: (i) the use of an informative mutation operator that accelerates the sequence space exploration, (ii) the parallel, iterative design process inherent to the genetic algorithm that improves upon the ProteinMPNN autoregressive sequence decoding scheme, and (iii) the explicit approximation of the Pareto front that leads to optimal design candidates representing diverse tradeoff conditions. We anticipate this approach to be readily adaptable to different models and broadly relevant for protein design tasks with complex specifications.

The Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) refers to a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. It is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG data, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach. The approach utilizes SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic capable of parallel computation, to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data, our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers. These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning, with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration, and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. Overall, this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process.

                <p>by Maud Delattre, Yusuke Toda, Jessica Tressou, Hiroyoshi Iwata</p>

The evaluation of plant and animal growth, separately for genetic and environmental effects, is necessary for genetic understanding and genetic improvement of environmental responses of plants and animals. We propose to extend an existing approach that combines nonlinear mixed-effects model (NLMEM) and the stochastic approximation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (SAEM) to analyze genetic and environmental effects on plant growth. These tools are widely used in many fields but very rarely in plant biology. During model formulation, a nonlinear function describes the shape of growth, and random effects describe genetic and environmental effects and their variability. Genetic relationships among the varieties were also integrated into the model using a genetic relationship matrix. The SAEM algorithm was chosen as an efficient alternative to MCMC methods, which are more commonly used in the domain. It was implemented to infer the expected growth patterns in the analyzed population and the expected curves for each variety through a maximum-likelihood and a maximum-a-posteriori approaches, respectively. The obtained estimates can be used to predict the growth curves for each variety. We illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach using simulated data and soybean plant growth data obtained from a soybean cultivation experiment conducted at the Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University. In this experiment, plant height was measured daily using drones, and the growth was monitored for approximately 200 soybean cultivars for which whole-genome sequence data were available. The NLMEM approach improved our understanding of the determinants of soybean growth and can be successfully used for the genomic prediction of growth pattern characteristics.

                <p>by Katherine S. Yanagi, Briar Jochim, Sheikh Omar Kunjo, Peter Breen, Gary Ruvkun, Nicolas Lehrbach</p>

The conserved SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcription factor regulates the expression of proteasome subunit genes and is essential for maintenance of adequate proteasome function in animal development, aging, and stress responses. Unusual among transcription factors, SKN-1A/Nrf1 is a glycoprotein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). N-glycosylated SKN-1A/Nrf1 exits the ER and is deglycosylated in the cytosol by the PNG-1/NGLY1 peptide:N-glycanase. Deglycosylation edits the protein sequence of SKN-1A/Nrf1 by converting N-glycosylated asparagine residues to aspartate, which is necessary for SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcriptional activation of proteasome subunit genes. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the peptide:N-glycanase (NGLY1) gene cause NGLY1 deficiency, a congenital disorder of deglycosylation. There are no effective treatments for NGLY1 deficiency. Since SKN-1A/Nrf1 is a major client of NGLY1, the resulting proteasome deficit contributes to NGLY1 disease. We sought to identify targets for mitigation of proteasome dysfunction in NGLY1 deficiency that might indicate new avenues for treatment. We isolated mutations that suppress the sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors caused by inactivation of the NGLY1 ortholog PNG-1 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We identified multiple suppressor mutations affecting 3 conserved genes: <i>rsks-1</i>, <i>tald-1</i>, and <i>ent-4</i>. We show that the suppressors act through a SKN-1/Nrf-independent mechanism and confer proteostasis benefits consistent with amelioration of proteasome dysfunction. <i>ent-4</i> encodes an intestinal nucleoside/nucleotide transporter, and we show that restriction of nucleotide availability is beneficial, whereas a nucleotide-rich diet exacerbates proteasome dysfunction in PNG-1/NGLY1-deficient <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. Our findings suggest that dietary or pharmacological interventions altering nucleotide availability have the potential to mitigate proteasome insufficiency in NGLY1 deficiency and other diseases associated with proteasome dysfunction.

                <p>by Jae-Hong Kim, Nakamura Michiko, In-Sun Choi, Yujung Kim, Ji-Young Jeong, Maan-Gee Lee, Il-Sung Jang, Kyoungho Suk</p>

Reactive astrocytes are associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in diverse neuropathologies; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We used optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to identify the crucial roles of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes in cognitive decline. Our results showed that repeated optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes induced cognitive impairment in mice and decreased synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), which was accompanied by the appearance of inflammatory astrocytes. Mechanistic studies conducted using knockout animal models and hippocampal neuronal cultures showed that lipocalin-2 (LCN2), derived from reactive astrocytes, mediated neuroinflammation and induced cognitive impairment by decreasing the LTP through the reduction of neuronal NMDA receptors. Sustained chemogenetic stimulation of hippocampal astrocytes provided similar results. Conversely, these phenomena were attenuated by a metabolic inhibitor of astrocytes. Fiber photometry using GCaMP revealed a high level of hippocampal astrocyte activation in the neuroinflammation model. Our findings suggest that reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus are sufficient and required to induce cognitive decline through LCN2 release and synaptic modulation. This abnormal glial–neuron interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive disturbances in neuroinflammation-associated brain conditions.

Tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) are model systems for global biodiversity science, but continuing data gaps, limited data standardisation, and ongoing flux in taxonomic nomenclature constrain integrative research on this group and potentially cause biased inference. We combined and harmonised taxonomic, spatial, phylogenetic, and attribute data with phylogeny-based multiple imputation to provide a comprehensive data resource (TetrapodTraits 1.0.0) that includes values, predictions, and sources for body size, activity time, micro- and macrohabitat, ecosystem, threat status, biogeography, insularity, environmental preferences, and human influence, for all 33,281 tetrapod species covered in recent fully sampled phylogenies. We assess gaps and biases across taxa and space, finding that shared data missing in attribute values increased with taxon-level completeness and richness across clades. Prediction of missing attribute values using multiple imputation revealed substantial changes in estimated macroecological patterns. These results highlight biases incurred by nonrandom missingness and strategies to best address them. While there is an obvious need for further data collection and updates, our phylogeny-informed database of tetrapod traits can support a more comprehensive representation of tetrapod species and their attributes in ecology, evolution, and conservation research.

                <p>by George A. Schaible, Zackary J. Jay, John Cliff, Frederik Schulz, Colin Gauvin, Danielle Goudeau, Rex R. Malmstrom, S. Emil Ruff, Virginia Edgcomb, Roland Hatzenpichler</p>

Consortia of multicellular magnetotactic bacteria (MMB) are currently the only known example of bacteria without a unicellular stage in their life cycle. Because of their recalcitrance to cultivation, most previous studies of MMB have been limited to microscopic observations. To study the biology of these unique organisms in more detail, we use multiple culture-independent approaches to analyze the genomics and physiology of MMB consortia at single-cell resolution. We separately sequenced the metagenomes of 22 individual MMB consortia, representing 8 new species, and quantified the genetic diversity within each MMB consortium. This revealed that, counter to conventional views, cells within MMB consortia are not clonal. Single consortia metagenomes were then used to reconstruct the species-specific metabolic potential and infer the physiological capabilities of MMB. To validate genomic predictions, we performed stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments and interrogated MMB consortia using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). By coupling FISH with bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), we explored their in situ activity as well as variation of protein synthesis within cells. We demonstrate that MMB consortia are mixotrophic sulfate reducers and that they exhibit metabolic differentiation between individual cells, suggesting that MMB consortia are more complex than previously thought. These findings expand our understanding of MMB diversity, ecology, genomics, and physiology, as well as offer insights into the mechanisms underpinning the multicellular nature of their unique lifestyle.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1492/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Disseminated hydatid cyst: Unusual presentation and therapeutic challenges [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, is a parasitic disease prevalent in endemic regions. CE frequently leads to the formation of hydatid cysts in various organs, with the liver being the most commonly affected site. Involvement of the spleen has been rarely reported in the literature. Managing disseminated hydatid cyst disease presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Case presentation: A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism presented with sudden onset shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain for 3 days. She had a recent travel history to Egypt. Physical examination revealed mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count with eosinophilia and increased inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray and pan-computed tomography (Pan-CT) scans identified multiple cystic lesions in the lung, liver and spleen. Serological tests confirmed the presence of anti-Echinococcus antibodies, leading to a diagnosis of disseminated hydatid cyst disease. The patient was managed medically and surgically by a multidisciplinary team. Conclusion: Disseminated hydatid cyst disease, though rare, presents complex diagnostic and management challenges. Timely recognition, supported by clinical, radiological, and serological assessments, is essential. Surgical intervention should be considered in a patient when multiple extrahepatic cysts are present, and rupture is evident, as this approach can significantly reduce patient morbidity and mitigate life-threatening complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1154/v2?src=rss">Severe meibomian gland loss in polycystic ovarian syndrome patients on estrogen-progesterone therapy: A case series [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To report the ocular surface and meibomian gland changes in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women taking hormone supplementation. Methods: Case series. Results: Three women (27 ± 11 years) already diagnosed with PCOS presented with dry eye symptoms (mean OSDI, 37.5) for a mean duration of 13 months and were taking hormonal supplements for a mean duration of 60 ± 11 months. The hormonal supplements included oral estrogen (n=3), oral progesterone (n=3), antiandrogen cyproterone (n=1) and isotretinoin (n=1). Ocular surface evaluation revealed mean NIBUT of 9.9 ± 1.6 seconds and mean TMH of 0.27 ± 0.05 mm, assessed non-invasively using Oculus keratograph 5M (K5M). Meibography (K5M) showed near total loss of all meibomian glands (n=8/12 eyelids) with residual ghost glands in all four eyelids of two patients, and gland shortening alone in one patient. The gland morphology did not change following intense thermal pulsation treatment or cessation of hormonal therapy. Conclusions: Near-total irreversible meibomian gland loss was seen in two young PCOS women taking hormonal supplements. Collaboration between ophthalmologists and gynecologists is advisable for early detection and better understanding of dry eye disease (DED) progression in these patients.
