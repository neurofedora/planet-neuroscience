We first consider the case where the retina does not itself provide anticipation—which is then only triggered by a cortical mechanism, the “anticipation by latency”—and unravel the effects of the retinal input amplitude, of stimulus features such as speed and contrast and of the size of cortical extensions and fiber conduction speed. Then we explore the changes in the cortical wave of anticipation when V1 is triggered by retina-driven anticipatory mechanisms: gain control and lateral inhibition by amacrine cells. Here, we show how retinal and cortical anticipation combine to provide an efficient processing where the simulated cortical response is in advance over the moving object that triggers this response, compensating the delays in visual processing.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neurons process sensory stimuli efficiently, showing sparse yet highly variable ensemble spiking activity involving structured higher-order interactions. Notably, while neural populations are mostly silent, they occasionally exhibit highly synchronous activity, resulting in sparse and heavy-tailed spike-count distributions. However, its mechanistic origin—specifically, what types of nonlinear properties in individual neurons induce such population-level patterns—remains unclear. In this study, we derive sufficient conditions under which the joint activity of homogeneous binary neurons generates sparse and widespread population firing rate distributions in infinitely large networks. We then propose a subclass of exponential family distributions that satisfy this condition. This class incorporates structured higher-order interactions with alternating signs and shrinking magnitudes, along with a base-measure function that offsets distributional concentration, giving rise to parameter-dependent sparsity and heavy-tailed population firing rate distributions. Analysis of recurrent neural networks that recapitulate these distributions reveals that individual neurons possess threshold-like nonlinearity, followed by supralinear activation that jointly facilitates sparse and synchronous population activity. These nonlinear features resemble those in modern Hopfield networks, suggesting a connection between widespread population activity and the network’s memory capacity. The theory establishes sparse and heavy-tailed distributions for binary patterns, forming a foundation for developing energy-efficient spike-based learning machines.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Number sense, the ability to rapidly estimate object quantities in a visual scene without precise counting, is a crucial cognitive capacity found in humans and many other animals. Recent studies have identified artificial neurons tuned to numbers of items in biologically inspired vision models, even before training, and proposed these artificial neural networks as candidate models for the emergence of number sense in the brain. But real-world numerosity perception requires abstraction from the properties of individual objects and their contexts, unlike the simplified dot patterns used in previous studies. Using novel synthetically generated photorealistic stimuli, we show that deep convolutional neural networks optimized for object recognition encode information on approximate numerosity across diverse objects and scene types, which could be linearly read out from distributed activity patterns of later convolutional layers of different network architectures tested. In contrast, untrained networks with random weights failed to represent numerosity with abstractness to other visual properties and instead captured mainly low-level visual features. Our findings emphasize the importance of using complex, naturalistic stimuli to investigate mechanisms of number sense in both biological and artificial systems, and they suggest that the capacity of untrained networks to account for early-life numerical abilities should be reassessed. They further point to a possible, so far underappreciated, contribution of the brain's ventral visual pathway to representing numerosity with abstractness to other high-level visual properties.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force makes them far from negative examples. Noncontrastive learning, represented by BYOL and SimSiam, gets rid of negative examples and improves computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al. (<a href="#bib41" class="reflinks">2021</a>) revealed through learning dynamics analysis that the representations can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account commonly used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may still collapse the dynamics, an unnatural behavior under the presence of feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2 loss by considering the cosine loss instead, which involves feature normalization. We show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus, we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.</span>

                arXiv:2510.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dream2Image is the world's first dataset combining EEG signals, dream transcriptions, and AI-generated images. Based on 38 participants and more than 31 hours of dream EEG recordings, it contains 129 samples offering: the final seconds of brain activity preceding awakening (T-15, T-30, T-60, T-120), raw reports of dream experiences, and an approximate visual reconstruction of the dream. This dataset provides a novel resource for dream research, a unique resource to study the neural correlates of dreaming, to develop models for decoding dreams from brain activity, and to explore new approaches in neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Available in open access on Hugging Face and GitHub, Dream2Image provides a multimodal resource designed to support research at the interface of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. It was designed to inspire researchers and extend the current approaches to brain activity decoding. Limitations include the relatively small sample size and the variability of dream recall, which may affect generalizability.

                arXiv:2510.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of consciousness is proposed which, having a logical basis, lends itself to simulation using a simple mathematical model called Consciousness as Entropy Reduction (CER). The approach has been inspired by previous models such as GWT, IIT and an earlier less mainstream model called "Feature Map" in Psychology. CER considers the contents of consciousness and subconsciousness as \textit{scenarios}: a vector of patterns (or features) on various "channels" (or feature locations). In CER, a feature map itself is not consciousness but only the input \textit{scenario} into a world of possible subconscious \textit{scenarios} from which the conscious \textit{scenario} (i.e., conscious experience) is chosen. Essentially, it creates an internal simulation of the outside world. Solving problems in simulation internally as a "thought experiment" is obviously more economical than doing experiments in a real environment and lends itself to adaptability and hence is a major evolutionary advantage. CER also has connections with the Hopfield model in artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2510.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work draws on the conjecture that fingerprints of stochastic event sequences can be retrieved from electroencephalographic data (EEG) recorded during a behavioral task. To test this, we used the Goalkeeper Game (game.numec.prp.usp.br). Acting as a goalkeeper, the participant predicted each kick in a probabilistic sequence while EEG activity was recorded. At each trial, driven by a context tree, the kicker chose one of three options: left, center, or right. The goalkeeper then predicted the next kick by pressing a button. Tree estimation was performed by applying the Context Algorithm to EEG segments locked to the button press (-300 to 0 ms). We calculated the distance between the penalty taker's tree and the trees retrieved per participant and electrode. This metric was then correlated with the goalkeeper's success rates. We observed a clear reduction in the overall distance distribution over time for a subset of electrodes, indicating that EEG dependencies become more congruent with the penalty taker's tree as the goalkeeper learns the sequence. This distance is inversely proportional to the goalkeepers' success rates, indicating a clear relationship between performance and the neural signatures associated with the sequence structure.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06361">Diffusion-Guided Renormalization of Neural Systems via Tensor Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.06361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, neural systems self-organize across multiple scales. Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations. Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics, coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and joint probability functions. Towards mesoscales, diffusion-guided renormalization targets learning the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative neural trajectories occupying lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling coarse-to-fine control in systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2510.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden hearing loss, or cochlear neural degeneration (CND), disrupts suprathreshold auditory coding without affecting clinical thresholds, making it difficult to diagnose. We present an information-theoretic framework to evaluate speech stimuli that maximally reveal CND by quantifying mutual information (MI) loss between inner hair cell (IHC) receptor potentials and auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses and acoustic input and ANF responses. Using a phenomenological auditory model, we simulated responses to 50 CVC words under clean, time-compressed, reverberant, and combined conditions across different presentation levels, with systematically varied survival of low-, medium-, and high-spontaneous-rate fibers. MI was computed channel-wise between IHC and ANF responses and integrated across characteristic frequencies. Information loss was defined relative to a normal-hearing baseline. Results demonstrate progressive MI loss with increasing CND, most pronounced for time-compressed speech, while reverberation produced comparatively smaller effects. These findings identify rapid, temporally dense speech as optimal probes for CND, informing the design of objective clinical diagnostics while revealing problems associated with reverberation as a probe.

Abstract: Functional variability in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) is closely associated with human brain cognitive and developmental processes, and is commonly assessed using functional connectivity (FC). However, as a correlation-based approach, FC captures the co-fluctuation between brain regions rather than the intensity of neural activity in each region. Consequently, FC provides only a partial view of functional variability, and this limitation is particularly pronounced in WM, where functional signals are weaker and more susceptible to noise. To tackle this limitation, we introduce fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to measure the intensity of spontaneous neural activity and analyze functional variability in WM. Specifically, we propose a novel method to quantify WM functional variability by estimating the differential identifiability of fALFF. Higher differential identifiability is observed in WM fALFF compared to FC, which indicates that fALFF is more sensitive to WM functional variability. Through fALFF differential identifiability, we evaluate the functional variabilities of both WM and GM, and find the overall functional variability pattern is similar although WM shows slightly lower variability than GM. The regional functional variabilities of WM are associated with structural connectivity, where commissural fiber regions generally exhibit higher variability than projection fiber regions. Furthermore, we discover that WM functional variability demonstrates a spatial gradient ascending from the brainstem to the cortex by hypothesis testing, which aligns well with the evolutionary expansion. The gradient of functional variability in WM provides novel insights for understanding WM function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate WM functional variability via fALFF.

                arXiv:2510.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing the twin concepts of reliability and precision along with the corresponding measures, Mainen and Sejnowski's seminal 1995 paper "Reliability of spike timing in neocortical neurons" (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995) paved the way for a new kind of quantitative spike train analysis. In subsequent years a host of new methods was introduced that measured both the synchrony among neuronal spike trains and the directional component, e.g. how activity propogates between neurons. This development culminated with a new class of measures that are both time scale independent and time resolved. These include the two spike train distances ISI- and SPIKE-Distance as well as the coincidence detector SPIKE-Synchronization and its directional companion SPIKE-Order. This article will not only review all of these measures but also include two recently proposed algorithms for latency correction which build on SPIKE-order and aim to optimize the spike time alignment of sparse spike trains with well-defined global spiking events. For the sake of clarity, all these methods will be illustrated on artificially generated data but in each case exemplary applications to real neuronal data will be described as well.

Abstract: We present our submission to the Algonauts 2025 Challenge, where the goal is to predict fMRI brain responses to movie stimuli. Our approach integrates multimodal representations from large language models, video encoders, audio models, and vision-language models, combining both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned variants. To improve performance, we enhanced textual inputs with detailed transcripts and summaries, and we explored stimulus-tuning and fine-tuning strategies for language and vision models. Predictions from individual models were combined using stacked regression, yielding solid results. Our submission, under the team name Seinfeld, ranked 10th. We make all code and resources publicly available, contributing to ongoing efforts in developing multimodal encoding models for brain activity.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network model (associative memory model) for memory and recall of images. In this model, only a single neuron can memorize multi-images and when that neuron is activated, it is possible to recall all the memorized images at the same time. The system is composed of a single cluster of numerous neurons, referred to as the "Cue Ball," and multiple neural network layers, collectively called the "Recall Net." One of the features of this model is that several different images are stored simultaneously in one neuron, and by presenting one of the images stored in that neuron, all stored images are recalled. Furthermore, this model allows for complete recall of an image even when an incomplete image is presented

Abstract: With traditional computing technologies reaching their limit, a new field has emerged seeking to follow the example of the human brain into a new era: neuromorphic computing. This paper provides an introduction to neuromorphic computing, why this and other new computing systems are needed, and what technologies currently exist in the neuromorphic field. It begins with a general introduction into the history of traditional computing and its present problems, and then proceeds to a general overview of neuromorphic systems. It subsequently discusses the main technologies currently in development. For completeness, the paper first discusses neuromorphic-style computing on traditional hardware, and then discusses the two top branches of specialized hardware in this field; neuromorphic chips and photonic systems. Both branches are explained as well as their relative benefits and drawbacks. The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook on the future.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06401">The Effect of Label Noise on the Information Content of Neural Representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters, akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels information.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03358">Attacking the Spike: On the Transferability and Security of Spiking Neural Networks to Adversarial Examples</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2209.03358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have drawn much attention for their high energy efficiency and recent advances in classification performance. However, unlike traditional deep learning, the robustness of SNNs to adversarial examples remains underexplored. This work advances the adversarial attack side of SNNs and makes three major contributions. First, we show that successful white-box attacks on SNNs strongly depend on the surrogate gradient estimation technique, even for adversarially trained models. Second, using the best single surrogate gradient estimator, we study the transferability of adversarial examples between SNNs and state-of-the-art architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNNs. Our analysis reveals two major gaps: no existing white-box attack leverages multiple surrogate estimators, and no single attack effectively fools both SNNs and non-SNN models simultaneously. Third, we propose the Mixed Dynamic Spiking Estimation (MDSE) attack, which dynamically combines multiple surrogate gradients to overcome these gaps. MDSE produces adversarial examples that fool both SNN and non-SNN models, achieving up to 91.4% higher effectiveness on SNN/ViT ensembles and a 3x boost on adversarially trained SNN ensembles over Auto-PGD. Experiments span three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and nineteen classifiers, and we will release code and models upon publication.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07179">Lagrange Oscillatory Neural Networks for Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.07179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-inspired computing paradigms are receiving renewed attention to enhance efficiency in compute-intensive tasks such as artificial intelligence and optimization. Similar to Hopfield neural networks, oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) minimize an Ising energy function that embeds the solutions of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite their success in solving unconstrained optimization problems, Ising machines still face challenges with constrained problems as they can become trapped in infeasible local minima. In this paper, we introduce a Lagrange ONN (LagONN) designed to escape infeasible states based on the theory of Lagrange multipliers. Unlike existing oscillatory Ising machines, LagONN employs additional Lagrange oscillators to guide the system towards feasible states in an augmented energy landscape, settling only when constraints are met. Taking the maximum satisfiability problem with three literals as a use case (Max-3-SAT), we harness LagONN's constraint satisfaction mechanism to find optimal solutions for random SATlib instances with up to 200 variables and 860 clauses, which provides a deterministic alternative to simulated annealing for coupled oscillators. We benchmark LagONN with SAT solvers and further discuss the potential of Lagrange oscillators to address other constraints, such as phase copying, which is useful in oscillatory Ising machines with limited connectivity.

                arXiv:2505.20834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

                <p>The maturation of inhibitory neurons is crucial for regulating plasticity in developing brains. Previous work has suggested that the Hurst exponent, the measure of autocorrelation in time series, reflects inhibition, but empirical data supporting this link are sparse. Here, we demonstrate significant spatial correlations between the Hurst exponent and ex vivo parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory mRNA expression in human children and adults, as well as between the Hurst exponent and PV-positive cell counts in mice, across both sexes. We further identified developmental plateaus in inhibition, as indicated by both PV inhibitory mRNA expression and the Hurst exponent, occurring prior to adolescence in humans and rats. In sum, this work suggests that the Hurst exponent can be used to study the development of inhibition in vivo and to understand inhibitory development across species.</p>

This process includes reference frame transformations as different sensory signals are encoded in different coordinate systems. Studies have shown multisensory integration (MSI) in humans is consistent with Bayesian optimal inference. However, neural mechanisms underlying this process are still debated. Different population coding models have been proposed to implement probabilistic inference. This includes a recent suggestion that explicit divisive normalization accounts for empirical principles of MSI. However, whether and how divisive operations are implemented in the brain is not well understood. Indeed, all existing models suffer from the curse of dimensionality and thus fail to scale to real-world problems. Here, we propose an alternative model for MSI that approximates Bayesian inference: a multilayer-feedforward neural network of MSI across different reference frames trained on the analytical Bayesian solution. This model displays all empirical principles of MSI and produces similar behavior to that reported in ventral intraparietal neurons in the brain. The model achieved this without a neatly organized and regular connectivity structure between contributing neurons, such as required by explicit divisive normalization. Overall, we show that simple feedforward networks of purely additive units can approximate optimal inference across different reference frames through parallel computing principles. This suggests that it is not necessary for the brain to use explicit divisive normalization to achieve multisensory integration.</p>

                <p>In the hippocampal formation, cholinergic modulation from the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca is known to correlate with the speed of an animal's movements at subsecond timescales and also supports spatial memory formation. Yet, the extent to which subsecond cholinergic dynamics, if at all, align with transient behavioral and cognitive states supporting the encoding of novel spatial information remains unknown. In this study, we used fiber photometry to record the temporal dynamics in the population activity of septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons at subsecond resolution during a hippocampus-dependent object location memory task using ChAT-Cre mice of both sexes. Using a linear mixed-effects model, we quantified the extent to which cholinergic dynamics were explained by changes in movement speed; behavioral states such as locomotion, grooming, and rearing; and hippocampus-dependent cognitive states such as recognizing a novel location of a familiar object. The data show that cholinergic dynamics contain a multiplexed code of fast and slow signals (1) coding for the logarithm of movement speed at subsecond timescales, (2) providing a phasic spatial novelty signal during the brief periods of exploring a novel object location, and (3) coding for recency of environmental change at a seconds-long timescale. Furthermore, behavioral event-related phasic cholinergic activity demonstrates that fast cholinergic transients correlate with a switch in cognitive and behavioral states. These findings enhance understanding of the mechanisms by which cholinergic modulation contributes to the coding of movement speed and encoding of novel spatial information.</p>

                <p>In temporal lobe epilepsy, interictal spikes (IS)&mdash;hyper-synchronous bursts of network activity&mdash;occur at high rates in between seizures. We sought to understand the influence of IS on working memory by recording hippocampal local field potentials from male epileptic mice while they performed a delayed alternation task. Interestingly, the rate of IS during behavior did not correlate with performance. Instead, we found that IS were correlated with worse performance when they were spatially non-restricted and occurred during running. In contrast, when IS were clustered at reward locations, animals tended to perform well. A machine learning decoding approach revealed that IS at reward sites were larger than IS elsewhere on the maze, and could be classified as occurring at specific reward locations. Finally, a spiking neural network model revealed that spatially clustered IS preserved hippocampal replay, while spatially dispersed IS disrupted replay by causing over-generalization. Together, these results show that the spatial specificity of IS on the maze, but not rate, correlates with working memory deficits.</p>

                <p>While the hyper- and hypo-reward or punishment sensitivities (RS, PS) have received considerable attention as prominent transdiagnostic features of psychopathology, the lack of an overarching neurobiological characterization currently limits their early identification and neuromodulation. Here we combined microarray data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas with a multimodal fMRI approach to uncover the neurobiological signatures of RS and PS in a discovery-replication design (<I>N</I> = 655 healthy participants, 442 females). Both RS and PS were mapped separately in the brain, with the functional connectome in the fronto-striatal network encoding reward responsiveness, while the fronto-insular system was particularly engaged in punishment sensitivity. These dissociable functional connectome patterns also exhibited high specificity in differentiating decisions driven by social or monetary reward and punishment motivations. Further imaging transcriptomic analyses revealed that functional connectome variations for RS and PS were associated with topography of specific gene sets enriched in ontological pathways, including synaptic transmission, dopaminergic metabolism, immune response, and stress adaptation. On the neurotransmitter level, the serotonin neuromodulator emerged as a pivotal hub regulating the intrinsic functional connectome patterns of RS and PS, with its modulatory effects dependent on interactions with the dopaminergic, opioid, and GABAergic systems. Overall, these findings indicate dissociable neural connectome mapping of RS and PS and highlight their linkage with transcriptomic profiles, which may inform future investigations on early identification of vulnerability and risk factors for psychopathological conditions.</p>

                <p>To produce a word, speakers need to decide which concept to express, select an appropriate item from the mental lexicon, and spell out its phonological form. The temporal dynamics of these processes remain a subject of debate. We investigated the time course of lexical access in picture naming with electroencephalography (EEG). Thirty participants (23 female) named pictures using simple nouns. The pictures varied in conceptual category (animate or inanimate), stress pattern (first or second syllable), and the structure of the first syllable (open or closed). Using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we decoded the time course in which each dimension was available during speech preparation. The results demonstrated above-chance decoding of animacy within 100&nbsp;ms after picture onset, confirming early access to conceptual information. This was followed by stress pattern and syllable structure, at approximately 150 and 250&nbsp;ms after picture onset, respectively. These results suggest that a word's stress pattern can be retrieved before syllable structure information becomes available. An exploratory analysis demonstrated the availability of the word-initial phoneme within 100&nbsp;ms after picture onset. This result hints at the possibility that during picture naming, conceptual, phonological, and phonetic information may be accessed rapidly and in parallel.</p>

                <p>Early structural and molecular development of the human cortex is extensively studied, but little is known about the development of neuronal activity across cortical regions. We used dense array electroencephalography recordings and a machine learning-based measure, functional brain age (FBA), to study spatiotemporally resolved maturation of cortical activity across the birth transition in human infants (male and female). We found clear spatial FBA gradients indicating more mature frontal cortical activity relative to other brain regions (geometric axis), as well as more mature activity in association cortices relative to sensory cortices (hierarchical axis). The frontal advance was explained by more mature bursting characteristics, a hallmark of early endogenous neuronal activity. The findings jointly support an advanced maturation of neuronal ensemble activity in cortical regions that are preparing to host synergistic, large-scale network interactions, a key global characteristic of mature brain function.</p>

                <p>Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) significantly impairs the quality of life of patients due to chronic pain and limited jaw function. Many treatment options have been used such as pharmacologic management, physical therapy, oral appliance therapy, and surgery. However, effective treatment options remain limited. In this study, we investigated the potential of botulinum toxin (BoNT) as a therapeutic approach for TMD using a forced mouth opening-induced TMD male mouse model. BoNT injection significantly alleviated mechanical hypersensitivity in the temporomandibular region over a 2&nbsp;week period as demonstrated by von Frey behavioral tests. Additionally, the mouse grimace test confirmed that BoNT alleviated pain in mice. The open field test and pasta gnawing test showed that BoNT injection effectively alleviated mouth motor and food intake problems and did not cause impairments in general behavior. Moreover, direct observation of neural activity via in vivo Pirt-GCaMP3 calcium imaging of intact trigeminal ganglia (TG) revealed that BoNT suppressed both stimulus-evoked and spontaneous activity in TG neurons. Mechanistically, BoNT downregulated the expression of pain-promoting proteins (TRPV1, TRPA1, and TRPC1) and glutamate transporting protein (VGLUT2), thereby suppressing peripheral neural activity in the TG. In summary, our study identified a novel mechanism by which BoNT alleviates TMD pain. These new findings not only expand our understanding of the effects of BoNT on pain but also provide a new therapeutic approach to TMJ pain management.</p>

                <p>Events and objects are two fundamental ways in which humans conceptualize their experience of the world. Despite the significance of this distinction for human cognition, it remains unclear whether the neural representations of object and event concepts are categorically distinct or, instead, can be explained in terms of a shared representational code. We investigated this question by analyzing fMRI data acquired from human participants (males and females) while they rated their familiarity with the meanings of individual words (all nouns) denoting object and event concepts. Multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that both categories of lexical concepts are represented in overlapping fashion throughout the association cortex, even in the areas that showed the strongest selectivity for one or the other type in univariate contrasts. Crucially, in these areas, a feature-based model trained on neural responses to individual event concepts successfully decoded object concepts from their corresponding activation patterns (and vice versa), showing that these two categories share a common representational code. This code was effectively modeled by a set of experiential feature ratings, which also accounted for the mean activation differences between these two categories. These results indicate that neuroanatomical dissociations between events and objects emerge from quantitative differences in the cortical distribution of more fundamental features of experience. Characterizing this representational code is an important step in the development of theory-driven brain&ndash;computer interface technologies capable of decoding conceptual content directly from brain activity.</p>

                <p>Neuronal hyperexcitability is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but its relationship with the TDP-43 aggregates that comprise the predominant pathology in over 90% of ALS cases remains unclear. Emerging evidence indicates that TDP-43 pathology induces neuronal hyperexcitability, which may contribute to excitotoxic neuronal death. To characterize TDP-43 mediated network excitability changes in a disease-relevant model, we performed in vivo continuous electroencephalography monitoring and ex vivo acute hippocampal slice electrophysiology in rNLS8 mice (males and females), which express human TDP-43 with a defective nuclear localization signal (hTDP-43NLS). Surprisingly, we identified the presence of seizures in ~64% of rNLS8 mice beginning ~2.5&nbsp;weeks after transgene induction (off-DOX). More broadly, we observed longitudinal changes in cortical EEG patterns and circuit hyperexcitability preceding neurodegeneration of vulnerable hippocampal subfields. Consistent with previous reports, we have observed broad dysregulation of AMPA subunit expression in mice expressing hTDP-43NLS. These changes were most pronounced in the hippocampus, where we hypothesized they promote hyperexcitability and ultimately, excitotoxic cell death. Interestingly, hippocampal injection of AAV encoding inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) and daily activation with CNO ligand rescued anxiety deficits on the elevated zero maze but did not reduce neurodegeneration. Moreover, therapeutic doses of the antiseizure medications, valproic acid and levetiracetam, did not improve behavior or prevent neurodegeneration. These results highlight the complex relationship between TDP-43-mediated neuronal hyperexcitability and neurodegeneration. Although targeting hyperexcitability may ameliorate some behavioral deficits, our study suggests it may not be sufficient to halt or slow neurodegeneration in TDP-43-related proteinopathies.</p>

                <p>The integration of olfactory and spatial information is critical for guiding animal behavior. The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is reciprocally interconnected with cortical areas for olfaction and the hippocampus and thus ideally positioned to encode odor&ndash;place associations. Here, we used miniendoscopes to record neural activity in the mouse piriform cortex (PCx) and LEC. We show that in head-fixed mice, odor identity could be decoded from LEC ensembles but less accurately than from PCx. In male mice freely navigating a linear track, LEC ensemble activity at the odor ports was dominated by spatial information. Spatial position along the linear track could be decoded from LEC and PCx activity; however, PCx but not LEC exhibited strong behavior-driven modulation of positional information. Together, our data reveal that information about odor cues and spatial context is differentially encoded along the PCx&ndash;LEC axis.</p>

                <p>Social interactions are fundamental to human cognition, with the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) playing a key role in integrating motor coordination and social inference. While transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a promising technique for modulating cortical excitability in real time, its effect on dynamic social processes remains largely unexplored. This study applied high-definition tRNS (HD-tRNS) over the rTPJ during an interactive task to modulate motor coordination and social inference. Eighty neurotypical adults (49 female) were equally distributed across two experiments: Experiment 1, a block design with randomized active and sham stimulation blocks; or Experiment 2, a trial-by-trial design with intermixed stimulation protocols. Participants performed a coordination task with a covert virtual partner programmed to behave cooperatively or competitively. Kinematic data and self-reported attributions of humanness and cooperativeness were analyzed. The results showed that HD-tRNS over the rTPJ did not affect motor coordination or overall task performance in either experiment. However, in Experiment 1, active stimulation progressively reduced attributed humanness and cooperativeness toward the competitive virtual partner, suggesting enhanced detection of antagonistic intent. This gradual modulation of social inference was absent in Experiment 2, where frequent protocol switching likely disrupted the buildup of stimulation effects. Together, these findings highlight the rTPJ's causal role in self&ndash;other distinction, underscore the importance of stimulation protocol design in shaping social cognition, and support the exploration of targeted neuromodulation in clinical and developmental populations with atypical social cognition.</p>

                South Sudan is one of the least electrified countries in the world, despite having abundant renewable energy resources that could be exploited to generate electricity. The country relies on imported diesel for electricity generation, besides having limited focus on renewable energy development. This policy brief sheds light on the potential of renewable energy as a solution to South Sudan’s ongoing electricity crisis. It examines the key factors hindering the development of renewable energy resources for electricity generation in the country. The brief also provides recommendations to the Government of South Sudan, policymakers, experts, and funding institutions on how to improve electricity access in the country. It is stressing on the importance of prioritising the development of diverse renewable energy resources, such as solar, wind, and small hydropower, as an immediate solution to the electricity access challenges in the country.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1054/v1?src=rss">Effect of combined hurdle technology treatments on the quality characteristics of minimally processed pitahaya  [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Fresh-cut pitahaya (Selenicereus spp.) faces significant postharvest challenges due to rapid quality deterioration. This study evaluated the effects of combined preservation treatments (ascorbic acid, calcium chloride, and UV-C light) on the physicochemical, textural, and sensory properties of pitahaya during refrigerated storage. The experimental design evaluated eight treatments analysing quality parameters (physicochemical, bioactive, color, texture, and sensory). Results demonstrated that UV-C light treatment (T4) preserved color stability most effectively, showing the lowest ΔE values (<4.6) until day 12 of storage, while maintaining soluble solids content between 14.4–17.9°Brix. The combined treatment of ascorbic acid + calcium chloride + UV-C light (T8) showed greater stability over storage time, bioactive compounds, maintaining the pH below 4.0 until day 12 and reaching intermediate scores of purchase intention, but overall liking values similar to the application of UV-C light (T4) and the control treatment (T1) (>6.3/9). However, the use of ascorbic acid (T2) or its combination with UV-C light (T6) reduced its consumer overall liking (5.8/9). Texture analysis revealed that while all treatments experienced progressive loss of firmness (>90% by day 15), T4 and T8 maintained their cohesiveness with better structural integrity compared to the control sample. The study concludes that the use of UV-C light offers optimal quality preservation, while the combined use of ascorbic acid (1%) with calcium chloride (1%) and UV-C light allows for an increase in bioactive compounds. UV-C light represents the most viable option for industrial application, given its balance between effectiveness and cost. Furthermore, it is suggested that UV-C light exposure times be optimized by combining it with edible coatings.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) has high mortality and relapse rates, yet no accepted pharmacotherapies. Reports based on six individuals suggest that ketogenic diet (KGD) combined with sub-anesthetic ketamine (KET) is an effective treatment. The animal model, Activity-Based Anorexia (ABA), captures AN's maladaptive behaviors of voluntary food restriction, excessive exercise, severe weight loss, heightened anxiety and relapse vulnerability. Using ABA, we tested whether (1) KGD, alone, can protect against relapses after a severe anorexia-like experience; (2) KGD must be maintained to prevent relapses; (3) sub-anesthetic KET combined with KGD is more ameliorative than KGD alone. We also (4) explored KGD's mechanism for protecting against relapses by electron microscopic (EM) analysis of synapses in the hippocampus. To simulate AN relapses, we imposed ABA induction twice (ABA1, ABA2), with 10 recovery days in between. Animals were fed a standard diet (SD, pellet plus wet food) during ABA1 and KGD during ABA2 (SD ➔ KGD). ABA vulnerability, measured by food restriction-evoked hyperactivity and weight loss, was severe during ABA1 but significantly less during ABA2, compared to those fed SD throughout ABA1 and ABA2 (SD ➔ SD). KGD withdrawal after ABA1 (KGD ➔ SD) caused vulnerability during ABA2 to become as severe as for the SD ➔ SD, indicating that KGD must be maintained to be protective. We tested whether KET plus KGD during ABA1 can protect against ABA2 relapse in the absence of KGD or KET (KGD + KET ➔ SD). During ABA2, KGD + KET ➔ SD exhibited low maladaptive behaviors, similarly to those maintained on KGD throughout ABA1 and ABA2 (KGD ➔KGD), with greater weight during recovery. Thus, KET sustains and boosts KGD's benefits for &gt; 10 days, supporting clinical findings that short-term KGD + KET may be an effective treatment for preventing AN relapses. EM revealed that KGD increases GABAergic synapse lengths and may reduce ABA vulnerability by increasing excitatory synaptic drive of GABAergic interneurons and increasing E-to-E synapses' role in body weight regulation.</p>

                Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) hold significant therapeutic potential, but their clinical application is often hindered by limitations such as donor variability. MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) present a promising alternative, offering comparable or superior therapeutic effects while overcoming some of these challenges. MSC-EVs exhibit strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, which could be leveraged in neurodegenerative diseases given the central role of neuroinflammation in these conditions. Additionally, MSC-EVs can be engineered for targeted drug delivery, enhancing their clinical utility. In this review we highlight the dual role of MSC-EVs as immunomodulators and drug carriers in neurodegenerative disorders. We discuss the current challenges, and outline strategies for clinical translation. Future advances in understanding MSC-EVs and their mechanisms of action could support their development into effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.

                The organisation of thalamocortical networks follows a conserved structure. Traditionally, these are divided into primary sensory systems that receive subcortical sensory signals, and higher-order systems that are driven predominantly by cortical activity. The rodent head-direction system – the neural ‘compass’ and a key input to the hippocampal formation – encodes orientation in the horizontal plane through a thalamocortical loop that links the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus and the postsubiculum. We argue that this circuit shares several hallmark features with canonical primary sensory systems, including a driver thalamic input, specific laminar targeting, and receptive field transformations. Drawing on recent anatomical and physiological studies in rodents, we propose that the postsubiculum functions as a primary cortex for the head-direction signal.

                Choi et al. demonstrate that stroke disrupts temporal separability between beta and movement-related ensemble co-firing states, which is restored during recovery. They also show that low-frequency alternating current stimulation enhances separability, improves motor performance, and thus represents a promising therapeutic approach.

                Kaur et al. identify histone acetylation as a host-encoded mechanism underlying Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Chemical and genetic inhibition of histone acetyltransferase activity in Drosophila recapitulates CI-like embryonic lethality, independent of the symbiont. These findings enable symbiont-free, programmable manipulation of arthropod reproduction for fundamental research and potentially applied arthropod control.

These findings highlight that TRF only partially improves obesity-induced microglial alterations, suggesting a persistent immunometabolic memory despite weight loss.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97495">High-content high-resolution microscopy and deep learning-assisted analysis reveals host and bacterial heterogeneity during Shigella infection</a></h4>

              
                <i>Shigella flexneri</i> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen and causative agent of bacillary dysentery. <i>S. flexneri</i> is closely related to <i>Escherichia coli</i> but harbours a virulence plasmid that encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS) required for host cell invasion. Widely recognised as a paradigm for research in cellular microbiology, <i>S. flexneri</i> has emerged as important to study mechanisms of cell-autonomous immunity, including septin cage entrapment. Here, we use high-content high-resolution microscopy to monitor the dynamic and heterogeneous <i>S. flexneri</i> infection process by assessing multiple host and bacterial parameters (DNA replication, protein translation, T3SS activity). In the case of infected host cells, we report a reduction in DNA and protein synthesis together with morphological changes that suggest <i>S. flexneri</i> can induce cell-cycle arrest. We developed an artificial intelligence image analysis approach using convolutional neural networks to reliably quantify, in an automated and unbiased manner, the recruitment of SEPT7 to intracellular bacteria. We discover that heterogeneous SEPT7 assemblies are recruited to bacteria with increased T3SS activation. Our automated microscopy workflow is useful to illuminate diverse host and bacterial interactions at the single-cell and population level, and to fully characterise the intracellular microenvironment controlling the <i>S. flexneri</i> infection process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104963">Megakaryocytes assemble a three-dimensional cage of extracellular matrix that controls their maturation and anchoring to the vascular niche</a></h4>

              
                Megakaryocytes, the progenitor cells of blood platelets, play a crucial role in hemostasis by residing in the bone marrow and ensuring continuous platelet production. Unlike other hematopoietic cells, megakaryocytes do not enter the blood circulation intact. They remain anchored within the bone marrow while extending cytoplasmic protrusions called proplatelets through the sinusoidal endothelial barrier. These proplatelets subsequently fragment into functional platelets. This unique process of intravasation facilitates efficient platelet production while maintaining the megakaryocyte cell body within the bone marrow niche, thus preventing potential thrombotic complications. How the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the delicate balance between megakaryocyte retention and proplatelet extension remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the spatial organization and functional role of ECM components in the megakaryocyte vascular niche of mice bone marrow. Our findings reveal that laminin and collagen IV form three-dimensional (3D) ECM cages encompassing megakaryocytes and anchor them to the sinusoidal basement membrane. Gene deletion shows the existence of laminin α4 in the ECM cage that is necessary to maintain megakaryocyte-sinusoid interactions. Notably, megakaryocytes actively contribute to the ECM cage assembly; β1/β3 integrin knockout weakens these structures, increasing intravasation and entire megakaryocyte entry into circulation. The retention of megakaryocytes by these 3D ECM cages depends on dynamic remodeling processes. Inhibition of ECM proteolysis results in denser cage formation, increasing the frequency of immature megakaryocytes with impaired demarcation membrane system (DMS) development. Thus, the ECM cage represents a novel concept of an active and dynamic 3D microenvironment that is continuously remodeled and essential for maintaining megakaryocyte perivascular positioning. This specific microarchitecture guides megakaryocyte maturation and intravasation, underscoring the critical role of ECM microarchitecture and dynamics in megakaryocyte function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101992">Bayesian meta-analysis reveals the mechanistic role of slow oscillation-spindle coupling in sleep-dependent memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                The active system consolidation theory suggests that information transfer between the hippocampus and cortex during sleep underlies memory consolidation in humans. Neural oscillations during sleep, including the temporal coupling between slow oscillations (SO) and sleep spindles (SP), may play a mechanistic role in memory consolidation. However, differences in analytical approaches and the presence of physiological and behavioral moderators have led to inconsistent conclusions. This meta-analysis, comprising 23 studies and 297 effect sizes, focused on four standard phase-amplitude coupling measures including coupling phase, strength, percentage, and SP amplitude, and their relationship with memory retention. We developed a standardized approach to incorporate non-normal circular-linear correlations. We found strong evidence supporting that precise and strong SO-fast SP coupling in the frontal lobe predicts memory consolidation. The strength of this association is mediated by memory type, aging, and spatiotemporal features, including SP frequency and cortical topography. In conclusion, SO-fast SP coupling should be considered as a general physiological mechanism for memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106513">Premature vision drives aberrant development of response properties in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Development of the mammalian visual system is thought to proceed in two stages. In the first stage, before birth in primates and before eye opening in altricial mammals, spontaneous activity generated by the retina and cortex shapes visual brain circuits in an activity-dependent but experience-independent manner. In the second stage, visual activity generated by sensory experience refines receptive fields. Here, we investigated the consequences of altering this sequence of events by prematurely opening one or both eyes of ferrets and examining visual receptive fields in monocular cortex after the closure of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. We observed that many cells in animals with prematurely opened eyes exhibited low-pass temporal frequency tuning and increased temporal frequency bandwidths, and these cells showed slightly increased orientation and direction selectivity index values. Spontaneous activity was greatly elevated in both hemispheres following the premature opening of one or both eyes, suggesting a global change in circuit excitability that was not restricted to cells that viewed the world through the prematurely opened eye. No major changes were noted in spatial frequency tuning. These results suggest that premature visual experience alters circuit excitability and visual receptive fields, in particular with respect to temporal processing. We speculate that closed lids in altricial mammals serve to prevent visual experience until circuits are initially established and are ready to be refined by visual experience.

">Developmental Reorganization of Whole-Body Muscle Synergies During Overarm Throwing in Children</a></h4>

              
                Overarm throwing is a uniquely human skill that requires precise whole-body coordination. Although throwing behavior emerges early in childhood, the neuromuscular mechanisms that support its development remain poorly characterized. Here, we provide novel evidence for the developmental reorganization of whole-body muscle synergies during maximum-effort throwing in preschool-aged (PS) and school-aged (SA) children. Electromyography was recorded from 16 muscles, and non-negative matrix factorization was applied to extract low-dimensional coordination modules (muscle synergies). We compared ball speed, number of synergies, synergy structure, and temporal consistency between groups. Ball speed was significantly higher in SA than PS (33.6 {+/-} 10.2 vs. 21.4 {+/-} 6.2 km/h, p < 0.05), reflecting improved performance. Yet, the number of synergies did not differ (PS: 6.0 {+/-} 1.1; SA: 6.4 {+/-} 1.3, p > 0.05), suggesting that the dimensionality of coordination is largely established by the preschool years. Instead, developmental improvements were driven by structural and temporal reorganization: trunk- and upper-limb synergies merged into a single module in SA, reflecting improved postural integration, while a bilateral soleus-dominant synergy fractionated into lateralized modules, reflecting increased lower-limb specialization. Moreover, the temporal variability of synergy activation was reduced in SA (p < 0.01), indicating that movement sequences became more precise and stable with development. These findings reveal that early gains in throwing arise not from expanding synergy number but from reorganizing their structure and sharpening temporal coordination, offering mechanistic insight into how complex whole-body skills are refined during childhood.

">Novel, small molecules targeting the 5-HT4R receptor protect against stress-induced maladapative behavior with efficacy across age</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Stress is a risk factor for developing psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Compounds targeting the serotonin type 4 receptor (5-HT4R) hold promise as novel rapid-acting treatments of mood disorders. However, a lack of selectivity and numerous side effects have been limiting factors for their clinical use. Here, we developed and characterized novel-composition 5-HT4R compounds in mouse models of stress. METHODS: Three 5-HT4R-targeting compounds were designed and synthesized based on PF-04995274, a high-affinity 5-HT4R ligand reported to be a partial agonist. G-protein assays were utilized to characterize molecular activity. Saline, PF-04995274, or a novel compound were administered before or after stress in male and female mice. Drug effects were assayed using behavioral paradigms. Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine the effect of drug on glutamatergic activity in hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3). RESULTS: Prophylactic administration of DL5, DL7, or DL8 was effective at reducing stress-induced maladaptive behaviors in male and female mice; DL7 and DL8 were effective when administered after stress. When administered following learned helplessness (LH), DL7 reduced behavioral despair and increased c-Fos in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3. All novel compounds attenuated large-amplitude AMPA receptor mediated bursts in ventral CA3 (vCA3). In aged male mice, prophylactic DL7 reduced behavioral despair. CONCLUSIONS: These results characterize novel 5-HT4R-targeting compounds for stress-induced psychiatric disease with the potential to address unmet needs in adult and aged patients with stress-induced psychiatric illness. Future work will characterize their mechanism of action with the goal of clinical development.

">Neural Underpinnings of Olfactory Dysfunction across Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Spectra</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent yet understudied feature of neurodegenerative spectrum disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). To disentangle the neural substrates of hyposmia across disease spectra, we examined 222 participants from the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease Dimensional Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Participants were classified according to the presence of cognitive disturbance, movement disorder, or both. Olfactory testing disclosed that cognitive disturbance and movement disorder were independently associated with hyposmia, and having both cognitive disturbance and movement disorder was associated with severe hyposmia. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry revealed that hyposmia was associated with atrophy in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in individuals with cognitive disturbance, whereas an artificial intelligence-based segmentation model identified olfactory bulb atrophy in those with movement disorder. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling further confirmed that the MTL and olfactory bulb volume contributed to olfactory performance through distinct processes. Individuals with cognitive disturbance and movement disorder had atrophy in both the MTL and olfactory bulb ("double hit"). We identified dual processes underlying hyposmia in the AD and PD spectra: a process linking MTL degeneration to cognitive disturbance and a process linking olfactory bulb degeneration to movement disorder. Our transdiagnostic approach enhances strategy in identifying specific neural correlates underlying hyposmia, lending support to the development of biomarkers for early intervention in AD and PD.

">Biophysical simulations of fMRI responses using realistic microvascular models: insights into distinct hemodynamics in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is broadly used to measure human brain activity, however the hemodynamic changes that comprise the fMRI response to neuronal activity are often interpreted using microscopy data in mice. These microscopy data provide ground-truth observations of how individual blood vessels respond to neuronal activity and thus form the basis of our fundamental understanding of neurovascular coupling. Although these invasive experiments provide invaluable insight, there are striking differences in the vascular architecture of mouse and human brains that may influence the hemodynamic response. Motivated by this, we developed a biophysical modeling framework for realistic hemodynamic simulations in both mouse and human cerebral cortex. For this, we utilized Vascular Anatomical Network (VAN) models that explicitly represent the full microvascular tree as a single connected network, originally based on anatomical reconstructions from a given location of mouse cerebral cortex. We extended the VAN modeling framework using synthetic VAN models representing the microvascular network at a single location of the human cerebral cortex. To account for larger size and complexity of the human VAN models, we developed an efficient computational framework to simulate the full hemodynamic responses in this human model and compared the simulated fMRI responses between mice and humans. Our biophysical simulations are based entirely on first principles (e.g., conservation of mass); model parameter values were fixed across all simulations, not tuned to fit data, as they represent meaningful physical constants taken from previous measurements. Only two simple calibrations were tuned for each simulation, to match baseline perfusion rates (blood flow) and oxygen extraction (OEF). Our results show that differences in microvasculature indeed influenced the hemodynamic response and led to observable differences in timing-e.g., the simulated fMRI response peak in humans was delayed by ~2 s compared to mice, consistent with prior fMRI observations. While there are many known differences in vascular architecture in rodents and humans, we also discovered that, unexpectedly, an asymmetry in the numbers of branches of the penetrating intracortical arterioles and venules appears to be conserved across species. We demonstrate through further simulations that this anatomical property may also be needed for suitable hemodynamic responses. Our framework thus provides a valuable tool for bridging in-vivo microscopy of microvascular dynamics to human fMRI.

">Human AUTS2 regulates neurodevelopmental pathways via dual DNA/RNA binding.</a></h4>

              
                The AUTS2 gene is implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, with patient mutations leading to intellectual disability, microcephaly, and autistic behavior. While AUTS2 chromatin- and RNA-related functions are recognized, its direct binding to RNA in human neural progenitors has not been previously demonstrated. Here, we used ChIP-seq and eCLIP-seq in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to map AUTS2 chromatin targets and, for the first time, its direct RNA interactome. AUTS2 knockdown in NPCs led to widespread gene expression changes and impaired cell proliferation, migration, and neurite outgrowth. Integrated analysis revealed downregulation of Wnt pathway genes, notably WNT7A, among targets directly bound by AUTS2 at both chromatin and RNA levels. Supplementation with WNT7A rescued cellular phenotypes in AUTS2-deficient NPCs, underscoring the significance of Wnt signaling. These findings highlight AUTS2 central role in human neurodevelopment and provide mechanistic insight into how its disruption may contribute to the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

">EEG Microstates Reveal Differential Network Dynamics under Constant Current and Oscillatory Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: EEG microstates are brief, quasi-stable scalp topographies that index large-scale network dynamics and may sensitively capture the net effects of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). Objective: To evaluate differential effects of three types of tES - tDCS, tACS and oscillatory tDCS - (otDCS), on canonical EEG microstates (A-D) in healthy adults. Methods: In a randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study, 42 participants completed four sessions (tDCS, tACS, otDCS, sham). Stimulation (20 min) used a P3-cheek montage: tDCS +1.5 mA; tACS at individualized theta frequency (ITF, 4-8 Hz), {+/-}1 mA; otDCS anodal with {+/-}0.5 mA oscillation around +1.5 mA at ITF. A five-minute resting EEG (eyes closed then eyes open) was recorded pre- and post-intervention. Microstates were extracted (A to D), back-fitted, and assessed on duration, occurrence, contribution, and mean GFP using linear mixed-effects models with sham and pre/post adjustments. Results: Four canonical microstates explained ~80% variance with stable topographies across conditions. Modulation patterns were modality-specific. MS A (sensory/arousal) increased across all active protocols, strongest after otDCS. MS B (visual-autobiographical) was consistently suppressed, again most following otDCS. MS C (self-referential) decreased selectively after oscillatory stimulation (tACS, otDCS) only. MS D (executive/attention) diverged by waveform: enhanced by tACS and otDCS but reduced by tDCS. Across outcomes, otDCS produced the largest and most widespread effects, overlapping features of both tDCS (tonic/stabilizing) and tACS (oscillatory/entraining) influences. Conclusions: Resting-state EEG microstates provide a sensitive systems-level assay of tES aftereffects. Constant and oscillatory current waveforms reorganize network states in dissociable ways, with otDCS exerting the most robust, comprehensive modulation. These findings support microstates as practical biomarkers for differentiating, optimizing, and monitoring neuromodulation strategies.

">Closed-loop beta stimulation enhances beta activity and motor behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Movement-related beta event-related synchronization (ERS) has been linked to motor control and learning, showing potential as a therapeutic target for those with movement deficits, such as stroke survivors. However, whether directly modulating beta ERS can causally influence motor performance remains unclear, largely due to the lack of methods designed to specifically target this neural activity. To address this gap, we developed a novel behaviourally-driven, closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) approach to target movement-related beta ERS during a visuomotor adaptation task. We found that the behaviourally-driven, closed-loop beta-tACS specifically enhances beta ERS without affecting beta event-related desynchronization (ERD). Critically, this targeted enhancement significantly improves retention of motor adaptation. These findings establish a causal relationship between beta ERS and motor behaviour and highlight the potential of behaviourally-driven beta-tACS as a therapeutic approach for improving motor function in clinical populations characterized by impaired beta activity.

">Novelty-dependent enhancement of sustained attention and electrophysiological signatures via transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation.</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention relies on Locus coeruleus - Noradrenaline (LC-NA) activity with tonic activity regulating arousal and phasic responses facilitating stimulus processing. In animals, phasic LC activity also depends on novelty of situations, yet human evidence is missing. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) was used to noninvasively modulate activity in the LC-NA system in forty-four healthy participants (36 female) while they completed a gradual-onset Go-Nogo task on two days [&ge;] 24 hours apart while EEG was recorded. 500 ms taVNS was applied with each stimulus onset either in the first, novel or second, familiar session while sham stimulation was applied in the remaining session. When delivered during the first, novel session, taVNS accelerated reaction times, reduced response variability, and attenuated the typical block-wise decline in subjective focus. Concurrently, fronto-central P1-N1 and parietal N1-P2 amplitudes were enhanced, and larger P1-N1 amplitudes predicted faster responses, linking early cortical gain to behavioral performance. Improvements persisted into the next-day sham session, whereas taVNS applied only during the familiar second session was ineffective. The results support a mechanistic account in which taVNS selectively enhances novelty-dependent phasic LC activity, underscoring context as critical for taVNS effects.

">Sleep Facilitates Pattern Separation through SK Channel-Mediated Sparse Coding</a></h4>

              
                The roles of sleep in priming the brain for associative learning remain unclear. Here, we report that acute sleep deprivation in Drosophila selectively impairs pattern separation, the ability to distinguish between similar stimuli, without affecting classical conditioning. This deficit correlates with disrupted sparse coding in the mushroom body, reflected by an increased number of active Kenyon cells and greater overlap in their odor representations. Electrophysiological analyses reveal that sleep loss enhances small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel-mediated afterhyperpolarization in GABAergic anterior paired lateral (APL) neurons, leading to reduced levels of feedback inhibition onto Kenyon cells and compromised sparse coding. Targeted knockdown of SK channels in APL neurons reduce their augmented afterhyperpolarization and rescues the pattern separation deficits caused by sleep deprivation. These findings identify a critical role for SK channels in inhibitory interneurons to enable sleep to preserve sparse and decorrelated neural representations, supporting cognitive processes such as pattern separation.

">Across-speaker articulatory reconstruction from sensorimotor cortex for generalizable brain-computer interfaces</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can restore speech features like articulatory movements from brain activity. However, for individuals with vocal tract paralysis, lack of articulatory movements can pose a challenge for speech BCI development. To address this challenge, our study aims at extracting generalizable articulatory features from a group of native Dutch speakers and reconstructing these features from brain data of a separate group of able-bodied individuals. Approach: We applied a tensor component analysis (TCA) model to extract generalizable articulatory features from a publicly available articulatory movement dataset. To reconstruct articulatory features from the brain, we analyzed data of three able-bodied participants P1, P2, and P3 with high-density electrocorticography (HD-ECoG) electrode arrays implanted over the sensorimotor cortex. For each participant, a separate TCA model was applied to extract neural features. A gradient boosting regression model was used to reconstruct articulatory features from neural features. Reconstruction performance was measured as Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) between the reconstructed and the generalizable articulatory features. Results: The extracted articulatory features showed even contributions across participants, indicating that these features captured generalizable articulatory kinematic patterns. By using these features, we were able to reconstruct articulatory features from brain data. PCC between the reconstructed and original articulatory features were significantly above chance for all three participants, with mean PCCs of 0.80, 0.75, and 0.76 for P1, P2, and P3 respectively. Significance: With the rapid development of speech BCI, our research demonstrates that speech-related articulatory features can be restored from HD-ECoG signal using generalizable articulatory features derived from able-bodied individuals. With the potential to reconstruct audio or speech-related facial movements from the reconstructed articulatory features, our framework may provide a new way for developing speech BCIs for people unable to produce mouth movements.

">PTH-Induced Behavioral and Metabolic Alterations in Mouse Models of Hyperparathyroidism</a></h4>

              
                Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a critical endocrine regulator of calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling and is widely employed in clinical settings through synthetic analogs for the treatment of osteoporosis. Although traditionally considered a peripheral regulator, emerging evidence indicates that PTH also exerts effects through the central nervous system (CNS). This study investigated the neuropsychiatric impact of elevated PTH and explored potential CNS involvement using multiple murine models of hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Distinct behavioral phenotypes were observed across models, indicating that psychiatric symptoms vary depending on disease etiology and progression. The effects of hPTH(1-34), a clinically approved PTH analog, were further assessed in male and female mice. Under pharmacological concentrations, hPTH(1-34) enhanced locomotor activity in males but induced mild anxiety-like behavior in females. These behavioral changes in females were independent of the estrus cycle and were amplified by ovariectomy. Metabolic analysis indicates PTH affects the basic metabolism by inhibiting the respiratory exchange ratio, promotes the energy expenditure and locomotion without affecting the food consumption in a 48hr range. To further investigate the molecular effect of PTH in the brain, a PTH1R-Cre mouse line was generated to map PTH receptor-1 (PTH1R) expression. Widespread expression of PTH1R was detected across the brain, including in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations. These findings suggest that PTH may influence behavior through interactions with PTH1R-expressing cells in brain vasculature and circumventricular regions. However, further studies are warranted to define the specific brain nuclei and cell types involved in PTH-driven modulation of neurobehavioral function.

">Profiles of Neuroaffective Responding to Natural Reward-Predicting Cues and Alcohol Images in Alcohol Use Disorder: An Event-Related Potential Approach</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND AND AIMS Incentive salience attribution (ISA) is the process by which the cues associated with reward take on value themselves. Individual differences in ISA are known to predict reward seeking and consuming behavior in animals and humans, suggesting prognostic potential in use disorders like alcohol use disorder (AUD). Since AUD etiology is thought to involve changes in natural (e.g., food) reward processing as much as alcohol-related processing, current research tested if differences in natural reward cue ISA are apparent, and predictive of behavior, in AUD. METHODS 30 individuals meeting AUD criteria and reporting heavy alcohol consumption on timeline follow-back (TLFB) participated. Subjects completed a validated ISA task wherein pictures depicting inherently appetitive, aversive, or emotionally neutral content are shown along with pictures that are less evocative but are predictive of reward (candy) delivery and (in this study) also alcohol images. To capture individual variations in ISA, a picture-elicited neural response that scales with picture salience - the late positive potential (LPP) - is indexed and then submitted to k-means clustering to classify different modulation profiles. RESULTS Replicating prior work, clustering indicated a 2-group solution where an "F>P" (n=14) group showed enhanced LPPs for food-predicting, relative to standard appetitive, pictures and an "F<P" group (n=16) showed reduced LPPs for food-predicting pictures. Also replicating prior work, both groups showed typical enhancement for appetitive and standard aversive, relative to neutral, pictures; and contrary to expectations, both also showed minimal LPP enhancement for alcohol pictures. Examining behavioral correlates of F>P versus F<P status, groups did not differ in reward consumption during the task, nor did they differ in AUD symptoms or weekly drinking per TLFB. Finally, while the LPP was not enhanced for alcohol pictures, enhancement for alcohol relative to neutral pictures was observed for an earlier (P300) neural response - and this was consistent across F>P and F<P groups. CONCLUSIONS Similarly sized groups of individuals who were more versus less responsive to natural reward cues is consistent with prior studies in non-AUD samples. At the same time, the lack of commensurate differences in task reward consumption differs from those studies, and could reflect change in natural reward processing in individuals with AUD. Implications for continued research are discussed.

">Convergent and Divergent Cerebellar Alterations in 22q11.2 Copy Number Variants</a></h4>

              
                Background: Individuals with copy number variants (CNVs) at 22q11.2 are at elevated risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. For psychosis, effects diverge, with 22q11.2 deletion (22qDel) conferring one of the highest known risks for schizophrenia, while duplication (22qDup) may be protective. Prior investigations of neurobiological mechanisms in 22q11.2 CNVs have predominantly focused on the cerebrum, whereas the cerebellum--a region increasingly recognized for its contributions to cognitive, affective, and social processes--remains underexplored and represents a promising target for investigation. Although alterations in cerebellar structure have been reported in 22qDel, they remain largely unexplored in 22qDup. This study provides the first characterization of regional cerebellar volumes in 22qDup and the first direct comparison of cerebellar structure across 22q11.2 CNVs, offering a unique opportunity to identify shared and distinct neurobiological mechanisms with implications for understanding cerebellar contributions to brain-behavior relationships in CNV carriers. Methods: We analyzed 514 longitudinally collected structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of 111 individuals with 22qDel, 37 individuals with 22qDup, and 167 typically developing (TD) controls. Total and regional cerebellar volumes were quantified using ACAPULCO, a deep-learning-based parcellation method that segments the cerebellum into 28 subregions. Group differences in cerebellar volumes, as well as their associations with cognition, autism-related traits, and psychosis-risk symptoms, were examined using linear mixed-effects models. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to control for multiple comparisons where appropriate. Results: In relation to TD controls, cerebellar volumes were broadly reduced in 22qDel, whereas cerebellar alterations in 22qDup were more modest and variable. Regional analyses revealed both linear (22qDel < TD < 22qDup) and nonlinear (22qDel {approx} 22qDup < TD; 22qDel < 22qDup < TD) gene-dosage patterns, though not all reached significance. Vermis VII was significantly reduced in both CNVs but showed no relationship to behavioral differences. In contrast, reduction of Right Lobule VIIIA was associated with greater social impairment in 22qDup. Unlike TD controls, this region was not associated with IQ in 22qDup, suggesting CNV-specific alterations in cerebellar-behavior relationships. Conclusion: These findings indicate that reciprocal CNVs at the 22q11.2 locus both affect cerebellar structure, yet their functional consequences diverge, suggesting overlapping but distinct pathways to clinical risk. They underscore the cerebellum's multifaceted role in neurodevelopment and highlight the need for studies examining broader cognitive and socio-affective domains, as well as cerebellar-cortical connectivity, to clarify links to clinical outcomes.

">Prenatal Acetaminophen Exposure Does Not Disrupt Human Fetal Brain Development in Cortical Organoid Models</a></h4>

              
                Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most widely used analgesic during pregnancy, yet epidemiological studies have reported conflicting associations between prenatal exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Direct mechanistic evidence from human-relevant models remains limited. To address this gap, we exposed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids (COs; six independent lines) to physiologically relevant APAP concentrations (25, 50, and 100 M) for 5 days starting at day 21, a developmental stage corresponding to the late first trimester. We assessed organoid growth, apoptosis, neuronal/progenitor ratios, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and functional maturation using multielectrode arrays (2-4 months). APAP exposure did not alter growth dynamics, cytoarchitecture, or viability, with apoptosis rates remaining below 1% in all conditions. Neuronal and progenitor cell proportions were unchanged. Bulk RNA-seq revealed subtle, dose-dependent transcriptional changes only at higher doses (0 differentially expressed genes at 25 {micro}M, 9 at 50 {micro}M, and 16 at 100 {micro}M), enriched for neurodevelopmental pathways. Despite these slight molecular perturbations, electrophysiological recordings showed normal firing rates, burst frequency, and network synchronicity across exposure groups. Taken together, therapeutic APAP concentrations produced only modest transcriptional effects without structural or functional consequences in developing cortical organoids. These results align with recent sibling-controlled epidemiological studies that attribute reported associations to confounding and provide mechanistic reassurance that recommended APAP use during pregnancy is unlikely to disrupt fetal brain development.

">Exploring the likelihood of the membrane pollution hypothesis with a physiologically plausible biophysical model.</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy affects more than 52 million people worldwide and has been known since ancient times. Despite this long history, available therapeutic methods, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, fail to control seizures in over 10% of patients. At the same time, there exists a diversity of theories regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying epilepsy. Understanding the biophysical basis of the simplest manifestation of epileptic activity, the paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS), could therefore be highly valuable. Prevailing ideas consider PDS as exaggerated synaptic excitatory potentials, but experimental evidence shows that PDS can be generated in isolated neurons devoid of synaptic input. Ulrich Altrup proposed an alternative view, suggesting that PDS represent aberrantly large pacemaker potentials rather than giant excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Theoretical work by Hernandez-Caceres and Brenes supported this concept, demonstrating a bifurcation-like transformation from physiological pacemaker potentials to PDS and finally to long-duration sustained depolarizations. According to Altrup's membrane pollution hypothesis (MPH), epileptic activity emerges as a consequence of incorporating amphiphilic pollutants into neuronal membranes, which leads to an increase in membrane micro-viscosity. Using a biophysically sound model for pacemaker activity, we explored the possibility of eliciting PDS through increased membrane micro-viscosity. Provided results suggest that this is theoretically plausible. Further experimental and theoretical research is needed to refine details of the MPH and to develop new strategies for combating epilepsy.

">Myelin pathology is a key feature of X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is a progressive, adult-onset neurodegenerative movement disorder that predominantly affects males of Filipino descent. The disease is caused by the insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu subfamily F (SVA_F) retrotransposon within an intron of the TATA-box binding protein-associated factor 1 (TAF1) gene. A major barrier to understanding the pathophysiology of XDP has been the lack of relevant animal models. Here, we introduce a novel conditional humanized XDP mouse model harboring a hybrid mouse-human Taf1/TAF1 gene (hyTAF1) containing the pathogenic SVA_F insertion. We activated the hyTAF1 in Nestin+ neural progenitor cells and found that the resulting XDP male mice recapitulate features of the human disease including severe motor impairment, striatal atrophy, and reactive gliosis. Transcriptomic, histological, and electron microscopy analysis revealed a dramatic reduction in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and widespread myelin disruption. Consistent with these findings, postmortem brain tissue from XDP patients revealed similar myelin pathology, including near-complete loss of myelin in parts of the medial prefrontal cortex. Together, these results identify oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelin loss as previously unrecognized contributors to XDP pathogenesis, providing new mechanistic insight into this debilitating disorder.

">Unmasking Early Microglial Remodeling in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                Early neuroimmune remodeling is a critical yet understudied component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. To investigate microglial contributions to AD development prior to overt plaque deposition, we developed an open-source morphometric pipeline to systematically quantify hippocampal microglial structure and activation states in pre-plaque 5xFAD mice. Across ~11,000 cells, we extracted multidimensional parameters including area, circularity, convex hull, branch points, nearest-neighbor distance, and nuclear features, alongside Iba1 and CD68 intensity measurements. While no significant overt gliosis was observed at this early stage, microglia from 5xFAD mice exhibited subtle trends toward increased structural complexity compared to wild-type controls. Importantly, significant sex-specific differences were detected within the CA1 subregion: male 5xFAD microglia displayed hyper-ramified morphologies consistent with enhanced surveillance states, whereas female microglia demonstrated greater density and a more reactive phenotype. Correlation analyses revealed a conserved association between microglial complexity and Iba1/CD68 expression, independent of sex or genotype, underscoring a fundamental link between cytoskeletal remodeling and phagolysosomal activity. These findings highlight the capacity of morphometric profiling to sensitively detect early, region-specific, and sex-dependent shifts in microglial phenotype before amyloid deposition. By integrating quantitative morphology with canonical molecular markers, this framework provides a robust and unbiased approach for characterizing microglial activation trajectories. Such early readouts may inform biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating microglial responses to delay or prevent AD progression

">Parallelized Brightfield and Fluorescence Imaging of Organoids Using a Scalable Multi-Camera Platform</a></h4>

              
                Organoid viability, maturation, and growth is commonly assayed through brightfield and fluorescence microscopy using a single objective lens. However, standard microscopic imaging systems pose significant limitations for high-throughput applications, particularly in large-scale experiments where simultaneous imaging of multiple organoids requires increased throughput. There is a strong need for systems that can capture organoid growth rapidly and consistently while minimizing disturbances to culture conditions. Here, we present a novel multi-camera array scanner (MCAS) that parallelizes imaging through the simultaneous use of 48 objective lenses and sensors, resulting in a 95% reduction in acquisition times compared to commercial high-content imagers. We demonstrate and validate this system in multiple well plate formats, in both 2D and 3D neural cell cultures, and in brightfield and fluorescence. The MCAS improves efficiency for measuring organoid growth rates, assessing responses to morphogens and drugs, and measuring viral transduction efficiency. Together, these findings establish the MCAS as a scalable and versatile imaging platform for rapid phenotyping in organoid research.

">ASSESSMENT OF CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC EXCITATORY SYNAPTIC STRENGTH IN THE DORSOLATERAL STRIATUM OF GOAL-DIRECTED AND HABITUAL COCAINE-SEEKING BEHAVIOR</a></h4>

              
                With repeated exposure to addictive drugs, there is a shift from drug abuse to drug addiction that is mediated by the transition from goal-directed to habitual control. It is well known that the development of habitual control over behavior relies upon cell-type-specific synaptic changes in both D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in dorsal striatum. Specifically, habitual behavior is mediated by increased synaptic strength in D2 MSNs in dorsolateral striatum (DLS), suggesting similar cell-type-specific synaptic changes may underlie the development of habitual cocaine-seeking behavior. However, cell-type-specific synaptic changes have not been evaluated in DLS in this context. Therefore, we trained rats to self-administer cocaine in a cocaine self-administration paradigm that allows for differentiation of goal-directed vs. habitual cocaine-seeking behavior. Moreover, we used a viral vector under a D2-specific promoter to fluorescently label D2 MSNs with eYFP in DLS. Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were used to determine AMPA:NMDA receptor ratio and the rectification index. Surprisingly, we did not observe any significant differences in these measures in DLS of cocaine-seeking rats, regardless of whether cocaine seeking was under habitual control. Interestingly, preliminary observations revealed significant changes in the paired pulse ratio (PPR), suggesting that presynaptic mechanisms may be involved in the development of habitual control over cocaine seeking. Overall, however, these results suggest there are no changes in postsynaptic strength of D2 MSNs in the DLS of rats with an extended history of cocaine self-administration and regardless of whether the cocaine seeking is under goal-directed or habitual control.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A network model of a “selection-for-action” system was proposed with the primary idea that the functions of stimulus and response selection are carried out within a visuomotor oscillatory network. To examine the network’s dynamics under different sensorimotor demands, an electroencephalographic experiment was performed, contrasting visual detection and discrimination variants of a Posner cueing task. In the former, the required response can be prepared before target onset, whereas in the latter—only after target onset. Using the generalized eigenvalue decomposition method for EEG source isolation, we identified four network subcomponents: lateral motor, lateral visual, midfrontal, and midparietal sources. The local and inter-source activity relevant for spatial attention (visual and midparietal sources) were involved before target onset in both tasks but stronger for the discrimination task. The local activity and inter-source connectivity relevant for action control (motor and midfrontal sources) were involved before target onset only in the detection task. Importantly, in line with the model’s predictions, we observed that proactive response preparation in the detection task entailed beta-band connectivity between the response control areas and visual areas. Moreover, we observed a response-related spatial modulation of pre-target local visual alpha activity in the detection task. These results likely reflect automatic visuomotor integration.</span>

                <p>The parabrachial (PB) nucleus participates in taste processing and integration with other senses. PB neurons that express the <I>Calca</I> gene support sensory-integrative responses, albeit only limited data have addressed their influence on taste. Here we investigated how chemogenetic dampening of PB-<I>Calca</I> neurons affected mouse orosensory preferences for diverse taste stimuli in brief-access fluid exposure tests, which capture oral sensory/tongue control of licking behavior. Intracranial delivery of Cre-dependent viruses in female and male <I>Calca</I><sup>Cre/+</sup> mice induced expression of the inhibitory designer receptor hM4Di:mCherry (hM4Di mice) or fluorophore mCherry alone (mCherry control mice) in PB-<I>Calca</I> neurons. Several weeks later, hM4Di and mCherry mice entered brief-access tests where they could lick solutions during discrete, seconds-long trials. Stimuli included concentration series of the behaviorally avoided bitter taste stimuli quinine and cycloheximide, the appetitive sugar sucrose, and mildly cool water and less preferred innocuous warm water. Blinded experimenters administered the hM4Di ligand clozapine-<I>N</I>-oxide (CNO) to all hM4Di and mCherry mice prior to daily tests. With CNO, hM4Di mice displayed greater average licking (i.e., less avoidance) of quinine than mCherry mice (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, male hM4Di mice selectively showed reduced mean licking preferences for sucrose under CNO (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that PB-<I>Calca</I> neurons participate in both aversive and appetitive taste-guided behaviors, with their role in appetitive taste dependent on sex. Finally, orosensory responses to cycloheximide and thermal-controlled water did not differ (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05) between hM4Di and mCherry mice under CNO. Results are discussed considering functional differences among stimuli and study limitations.</p>

                <p>Despite various histological, electrophysiological, and imaging studies, the topographic organization of saccade-related activity in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been notoriously difficult to characterize. In part, this is because areas of interest in PPC are often embedded deep in sulci in macaques and humans. Understanding the extent of topographic organization in PPC can provide insights into the computation contributions of PPC. The lissencephalic cortex of the common marmoset offers a unique opportunity to investigate fine-scale topographic organization in PPC. Recordings were obtained from the PPC of two male marmosets performing a visually guided center-out saccade task with 8 or 36 peripheral targets using multichannel electrode arrays with 100&nbsp;&mu;m spacing. By plotting the pattern of saccade direction tuning preferences across all penetrations and cortical depths, we uncovered topographic organizational features within the PPC. Like other primates, multiunits in marmoset PPC tend to prefer saccade targets in the contralateral visual field. The results detail how preference for saccadic direction changes in a systematic manner across cortical distance, such that response units closer in proximity tend to show systematic changes in their tuning preferences. Across cortical distance, the visual field was also systematically encoded but reversals in direction varied across penetrations. The analysis highlights the likelihood of multiple representations of the visual field for saccade direction preference across PPC. These novel findings suggest a possible functional organization of saccade-related activity in marmoset PPC, giving insights into the computational capacity of the PPC.</p>

                Background Chronic arsenic exposure interferes with hippocampal-dependent cognition through glutamate excitotoxicity, which in turn interferes with the regulation of receptors and transporters. Bromelain, a combination of proteolytic enzymes derived from Ananas comosus, is known to have neuroprotective effects; however, the mechanisms by which it counteracts glutamate-mediated toxicity in the brain are poorly understood. This study investigated the potential of bromelain to normalize glutamatergic homeostasis and cognitive function in arsenic-treated rats by specifically examining the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A and glutamate transporters GLT-1, EAAC1, and xCT. Methods Seventy-two adult male Wistar rats (200-220 g) were randomly divided into nine groups (n=8 each): control, arsenic-only (20 mg/kg/day sodium arsenite, administered via oral gavage for 14 days), bromelain-only (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg/day, oral gavage), arsenic plus bromelain (at the same doses), and arsenic plus donepezil (2 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal). Arsenic was coadministered with bromelain and donepezil for 14 consecutive days. The Morris water maze test was used to assess the cognitive performance. Glutamate concentration was measured using sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay [ELISA] and total RNA was isolated to perform RT-qPCR to evaluate the expression of NR2A, GLT-1, EAAC1, and xCT. Results Exposure to arsenic impaired spatial memory, increased glutamate levels, and downregulated the expression of NR2A and transporter genes. These effects were reversed by co-treatment with bromelain, especially at 10 mg/kg, which re-established gene expression and lowered glutamate levels. Bromelain at 15 mg/kg was more effective than donepezil in improving glutamate clearance and cognitive performance. Conclusions Bromelain provides multi-target neuroprotection in arsenic neurotoxicity, rescuing glutamatergic homeostasis by coordinated upregulation of NMDA receptor NR2A and the transport network (GLT-1, EAAC1, xCT), accompanied by spatial learning and memory improvement. The demonstrated dose-response, dosing-related superiority over 15 mg/kg donepezil, and lack of overt adverse effects support its translational potential as a safe, plant-based adjunct to excitotoxic diseases and toxin-exposed populations.

                This policy brief investigates the impact of membership in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the East African Community (EAC) on export promotion and household welfare in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, and Burundi. The analysis reveals a positive association between export performance and investment, imports, consumption, political stability, and government effectiveness. Notably, traditionally relevant factors like GDP and FDI lacked statistically significant associations with export performance. The impact of EAC and AfCFTA membership on exports remains inconclusive. Regarding household welfare, a positive correlation emerged with GDP, domestic savings, trade (imports and exports), rule of law, and corruption control. Counterintuitively, EAC membership displayed a negative and significant impact on household welfare, while AfCFTA membership had a positive but insignificant effect. Policymakers should prioritize investments boosting domestic savings and productive capacity, cultivate a rule-of-law business environment, and implement strategic export promotion informed by import composition analysis. Future research should adopt a disaggregated approach to explore the insignificant effects of economic factors and EAC membership on EAC export performance, while investigating AfCFTA’s true impact and the negative EAC-welfare association.

                Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) is a rare and anatomically specific form of stroke that occurs in the cerebral veins, with pregnant and postpartum women at particular risk. Obstetric CVT carries high mortality due to its atypical presentation, often mimicking or being masked by other conditions such as preeclampsia. We report a case of a 37-year-old Sasak woman who, on the 32nd day postpartum following a cesarean section, experienced more than five seizures beginning with left arm weakness and heaviness. Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient was conscious but complained of a severe headache and left-sided limb weakness. Her vital signs showed blood pressure of 152/87 mmHg, pulse of 84 beats/min, and a temperature of 37.1°C. During her stay in the ER, she experienced three additional seizures. Initially treated as eclampsia with magnesium sulfate by the obstetrics team, the patient underwent urgent brain MRI and MR venography, which confirmed a diagnosis of CVT in the superior sagittal sinus, complicated by intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and uncal herniation. The patient did not respond to anticoagulant therapy and subsequently underwent delayed decompressive craniectomy. To further manage elevated intracranial pressure, barbiturates were administered as a third-tier treatment. This case emphasizes the diagnostic challenges and high-risk nature of postpartum CVT, underlining the need for rapid neuroimaging and multidisciplinary intervention in postpartum women presenting with seizures and neurological deficits.

                Background Metastatic dissemination is critically reliant on the formation of a receptive niche, a process which is thought to rely on signals derived from the primary tumor. Lymph nodes are continuously exposed to such signals through the flow of afferent lymph, allowing the potential reprograming of lymphoid tissue stroma in support of metastases or immunosuppression. The objective of this study was therefore to better characterize tumor-driven transcriptomic changes occurring to specific stromal populations within the tumor-draining lymph node. Methods We utilize single cell RNA sequencing of dissociated LN tissue extracted from tumor-bearing and naïve mice to profile the reprograming of tissue stroma within the pre-metastatic lymph node. Results Resulting data provides transcriptomic evidence of tumor-induced imprinting on marginal reticular cells (MRCs) and floor lymphatic endothelial cells (fLECs) populating the subcapsular sinus. These alterations appear to be unique to the tumor-draining LN and are not observed during inflammatory antigenic challenge. Notably, MRCs exhibit characteristics reminiscent of early desmoplastic CAF differentiation, fLECs engage distinct chemoattractant pathways thought to facilitate recruitment of circulating cancer cells, and both stromal populations exhibit signs of metabolic reprograming and immune-modulating potential. Conclusions Cumulatively, these findings build upon existing literature describing pre-metastatic niche formation and offer several promising avenues for future exploration.

                Background This study explores the lived experiences of individuals recovering from COVID-19, aiming to deepen understanding and inform supportive measures in future health crises. Methods Fifteen participants were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and non-aggregated behavioral observations. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) guided the analytic process, allowing for in-depth exploration of participants’ meaning-making. Reporting adhered to the COREQ qualitative research guidelines. Results Five superordinate themes emerged: stress, economic and social disruption, social stigma, social support, and the reappraisal of adversity (“finding meaning in misfortune”). Participants’ narratives revealed complex adaptive processes shaped by contextual challenges and relational resources. Conclusion The findings highlight the need for multidisciplinary care approaches that attend to psychosocial and economic dimensions of illness. Insights from this study may inform post-COVID-19 recovery policies, including targeted psychosocial training for health and community workers, and the development of integrated response frameworks for future public health emergencies.

                Background Pulmonary congestion, as opposed to low cardiac output, is the predominant cause of hospitalizations for heart failure and is associated with elevated mortality rates. Persisting congestion symptoms at discharge and during outpatient follow-ups are critical predictors of adverse outcomes. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a simple, non-invasive tool for assessing pulmonary congestion. Objectives This study aims to evaluate the prognostic significance of pulmonary congestion detected via LUS in predicting short-term adverse events in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure (AHF). Methods We conducted a bi-centric prospective observational study involving consecutive patients admitted for AHF at two hospitals in Tunisia. Each participant underwent a thorough clinical assessment, biological evaluation, chest X-ray, LUS, and echocardiography. LUS operators were blinded to clinical data and examined eight thoracic zones. The primary outcomes included a composite of urgent care visits, rehospitalization due to acute heart failure decompensation, or cardiac death within a six-month follow-up. Results A total of 116 patients (median age: 69 years; 53% male; mean ejection fraction: 40%) were included. At discharge, the mean number of B-lines observed was 6.6 ± 3.3. During the follow-up period, we recorded 72 adverse events, with 52 patients experiencing severe heart failure symptoms requiring hospitalization and 20 dying from cardiac causes. Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of ≥3 B-lines bilaterally significantly predicted the combined endpoint of rehospitalization or cardiac death at the six-month mark (HR: 11.024; 95% CI: 5.542-21.926; P < 0.001). Additionally, the number of B-lines decreased from 31.9 ± 12.7 upon admission to 6.6 ± 3.1 at discharge (P < 0.001). Conclusions The application of an 8-zone LUS protocol is effective in assessing the severity and monitoring the resolution of pulmonary congestion in heart failure patients. Persistent pulmonary congestion at discharge, as evaluated by LUS, correlates with a poorer prognosis.

                <p>by June Hyung Kim, Taeyoon Kim</p>

Lamellipodia are quasi-two-dimensional actin projections formed on the leading edge of the cell, playing an important role in sensing surrounding mechanical environments by forming focal adhesions. A branched actin network in the lamellipodia exhibits a stable, yet dynamic steady state characterized by a retrograde flow, which is attributed to a balance between network assembly at the leading edge and disassembly at the rear. Although the molecular players and architecture of the lamellipodia have been investigated extensively during recent decades, it still remains elusive how the dynamic steady state with continuous retrograde flow is achieved and robustly maintained. Using an agent-based computational model, we probed how physical interactions between subcellular components in the lamellipodia mediate and sustain the dynamic steady state. We simulated the branched network found in the lamellipodia, consisting of F-actin, myosin motor, Arp2/3 complex, and actin cross-linking protein, on an elastic substrate. We reproduced a steady retrograde flow induced by myosin activity and balanced by the interplay between network assembly and disassembly, but hindered by resistances from adhesions formed on the underlying substrate. We found that F-actin severing is crucial for maintaining a continuous, uniform retrograde flow because it enhances the disassembly of actin bundle/arc formed due to network contraction at the rear. In addition, we demonstrated that different modes of dynamic steady states are possible, and that a network which failed to show the retrograde flow due to perturbations can be rescued by altering other factors. Our study provides insights into understanding how cells maintain the dynamic steady state of the lamellipodia in highly varying microenvironments.

Background <p>It is urgent to explore the potential biomarkers of PC prognosis and treatment to improve patients’ outcomes with pancreatic cancer (PC).</p> Methods <p>Firstly, we performed an integrated bioinformatics analysis based on extensive transcriptome data from 615 PC tumors and 329 adjacent tissues, screening for genes with prognostic value. We then validated the prognostic value of <i>OCIAD2</i>, <i>DCBLD2</i>, and <i>SAMD9</i> in different datasets and analyzed their expression levels in single-cell sequencing datasets of normal, paracancer, primary, and metastatic tissues.

Deep learning for protein function prediction faces significant challenges in identifying disease-specific proteins. We present Extracellular Matrix Protein Predictor (EPOP), an advanced transfer learning framework leveraging protein language models to decode disease mechanisms. Focusing on pelvic organ prolapse (POP), which affects up to 50% of women worldwide, EPOP demonstrates AI’s power to reveal novel therapeutic targets. We developed a sophisticated fine-tuning protocol for the ESM-2 model, optimized for ECM protein prediction. Our architecture integrates specialized attention mechanisms with interpretability modules, trained on expertly curated and balanced datasets totaling 80,000 proteins (40,000 ECM and 40,000 non-ECM). The framework employs a novel validation strategy using a 16,000-sample independent test set and clinical proteomics data. EPOP achieved unprecedented performance (99.40% accuracy) in ECM protein classification, significantly surpassing traditional deep learning architectures (10.81% improvement over Transformer models, 21.71% over Long Short-Term Memory). Applied to clinical samples, our model revealed a previously unknown pattern of ECM remodeling, identifying 24 novel disease-associated proteins. Model interpretability analysis uncovered specific sequence motifs and structural features critical for ECM protein function, providing mechanistic insights into disease progression. EPOP demonstrates how advanced AI bridges molecular analysis and clinical applications, uncovering novel therapeutic targets. Its success suggests broader applications across ECM-related disorders, potentially transforming approaches to diseases affecting connective tissue architecture.

Highly multiplexed imaging assays allow simultaneous quantification of multiple protein and phosphorylation markers, providing a static snapshots of cell types and states. Pseudo-time techniques can transform these static snapshots of unsynchronized cells into dynamic trajectories, enabling the study of dynamic processes such as development trajectories and the cell cycle. Such ordering also enables training of mathematical models on these data, but technical challenges have hitherto made it difficult to integrate multiple experimental conditions, limiting the predictive power and insights these models can generate. In this work, we propose data processing and model training approaches for integrating multiplexed, multi-condition immunofluorescence data with mathematical modelling. We devise training strategies for mathematical models that are applicable to datasets where cells exhibit oscillatory as well as arrested dynamics and use them to train a cell cycle model on a dataset of MCF-10A mammary epithelial exposed to cell-cycle arresting small molecules. We validate the model by investigating predicted growth factor sensitivities and responses to inhibitors of cells at different initial conditions. We anticipate that our framework will generalise to other highly multiplexed measurement techniques such as mass-cytometry, rendering larger bodies of data accessible to dynamic modelling and paving the way to deeper biological insights.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012677">A digital DNA system favours the superiority of unidirectional inheritance over ‘Lamarckian’ inheritance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aswathi Shiju, Samantha D. M. Arras, Allen G. Rodrigo, Anthony M. Poole</p>

In biology, changes to a DNA sequence can impact protein sequence but changes to protein sequences (phenotype) do not flow back into DNA (genotype). A system with bidirectional information flow (i.e., both translation and ‘reverse translation’) remains a theoretical possibility for an independent origin of life or an artificial biosystem, but the recent development of digital data storage in DNA does just this: changes made to a digital file can be written back into DNA, meaning changes to ‘phenotype’ can be written back to ‘genotype’. To explore the evolutionary properties of such a system, we created an artificial system where synthetic DNA serves as genotype and music as phenotype. Audio can be output from a DNA sequence, then recorded and written to DNA as ‘codons’, enabling bidirectional information flow (DNA→music and music→DNA). Our results show that the mutation rate in a bidirectional system is much higher than for unidirectional information flow, and that, under reverse translation there is no mechanism for preservation of codon choice across generations. This has the effect of eliminating the impact of spontaneous synonymous mutations, a key benefit of a redundant genetic code. As a result, non-synonymous mutations are the only DNA-level changes that are transmitted across generations, and, as non-synonymous mutations can emerge at both ‘genotypic’ and ‘phenotypic’ levels, these occur at a two-fold higher frequency than in a unidirectional system. Our system holds some practical insight. First, for DNA read/write systems, it may be wise to avoid designing systems with ‘<i>de novo</i> reverse translation’ because the opportunities for mutation are higher; tracking genotype information from the preceding generation to guide this process may reduce error. Second, our system helps clarify how a ‘Lamarckian’ biological system might operate. We conclude that, were a ‘Lamarckian’ system of inheritance a feature of early genetic systems, it would likely have been short lived as the high frequency of mutation would risk driving the system to extinction. A system based on unidirectional information flow thus appears superior as there are fewer opportunities for mutational error.

                <p>by Aurore A. Perrault, Valeria Kebets, Nicole M. Y. Kuek, Nathan E. Cross, Rackeb Tesfaye, Florence B. Pomares, Jingwei Li, Michael W. L. Chee, Thien Thanh Dang-Vu, B. T. Thomas Yeo</p>

Sleep is essential for optimal functioning and health. Interconnected to multiple biological, psychological, and socio-environmental factors (i.e., biopsychosocial factors), the multidimensional nature of sleep is rarely capitalized on in research. Here, we deployed a data-driven approach to identify sleep-biopsychosocial profiles that linked self-reported sleep patterns to inter-individual variability in health, cognition, and lifestyle factors in 770 healthy young adults. We uncovered five profiles, including two profiles reflecting general psychopathology associated with either reports of general poor sleep or an absence of sleep complaints (i.e., sleep resilience), respectively. The three other profiles were driven by the use of sleep aids and social satisfaction, sleep duration, and cognitive performance, and sleep disturbance linked to cognition and mental health. Furthermore, identified sleep-biopsychosocial profiles displayed unique patterns of brain network organization. In particular, somatomotor network connectivity alterations were involved in the relationships between sleep and biopsychosocial factors. These profiles can potentially untangle the interplay between individuals’ variability in sleep, health, cognition, and lifestyle—equipping research and clinical settings to better support individual’s well-being.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Volumetry of subregions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) computed from automatic segmentation in MRI can track neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. However, poor quality MR images can lead to unreliable segmentation of MTL subregions. Considering that different MRI contrast mechanisms and field strengths (jointly referred to as “modalities” here) offer distinct advantages in imaging different parts of the MTL, we developed a multi-modality segmentation model using both 7T and 3T structural MRI to obtain robust segmentation in poor-quality images. MRI modalities including 3T T1-weighted, 3T T2-weighted, 7T T1-weighted and 7T T2-weighted (7T-T2w) of 197 participants were collected from a longitudinal aging study at the Penn Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Among them, 7T-T2w was used as the primary modality, and all other modalities were rigidly registered to the 7T-T2w. A model derived from nnU-Net took these registered modalities as input and outputted subregion segmentation in 7T-T2w space. 7T-T2w images most of which had high quality from 25 selected training participants were manually segmented to train the multi-modality model. Modality augmentation, which randomly replaced certain modalities with Gaussian noise, was applied during training to guide the model to extract information from all modalities. The multi-modality model delivered good performance regardless of 7T-T2w quality, while the single-modality model under-segmented subregions in poor-quality images. The multi-modality model generally demonstrated stronger discrimination of A + MCI versus A-CU. Intra-class correlation and Bland–Altman plots demonstrate that the multi-modality model had higher longitudinal segmentation consistency in all subregions while the single-modality model had low consistency in poor-quality images. The multi-modality MRI segmentation model provides an improved biomarker for neurodegeneration in the MTL that is robust to image quality. It also provides a framework for other studies which may benefit from multimodal imaging.</p>

<p>In snakes, profound differences in retinal architecture are observed between diurnal and nocturnal species. Additionally, in the rod-dominated retinas of nocturnal snakes, coexpression of the cone opsins SWS1 and LWS in individual cones is common, while rhodopsin (RH1) is restricted to typical rods. In the cone-dominated retinas of diurnal species, rhodopsin is expressed in transmuted, cone-like rods and frequently coexpressed with SWS1 in some single cones, with some instances of triple coexpression (SWS1, RH1, and LWS) in single cones.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Snakes are a valuable yet understudied taxon for investigating evolutionary adaptations in the vertebrate retina. They possess up to three visual pigments: a short-wavelength-sensitive opsin (SWS1), a medium/long-wavelength-sensitive opsin (LWS), and rhodopsin (RH1). Nocturnal snakes have duplex retinas containing both rod and cone photoreceptors, whereas diurnal caenophidian (“advanced”) snakes exhibit simplex “all-cone” retinas, lacking morphologically typical rods. In this study, we analyzed photoreceptor morphology in the retinas of caenophidian snakes using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and examined visual-opsin expression patterns with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Our analyses revealed remarkable interspecific variability in visual-cell morphology. Light microscopy showed that in all sampled diurnal caenophidians, photoreceptors expressing RH1 exhibit a gross cone-like morphology. However, SEM analysis revealed a subset of photoreceptors with distinct features—thinner inner segments and rod-like synaptic terminals—suggesting they are transmuted, cone-like rods. In retinal sections from nocturnal caenophidian snakes, coexpression of the cone opsins SWS1 and LWS in individual cones was observed, whereas rhodopsin expression remained restricted to morphologically typical rods and showed no coexpression. In contrast, diurnal caenophidians commonly coexpress rhodopsin and SWS1 in single cones, with some instances of triple coexpression (SWS1, RH1, and LWS) in single cones. We evaluated the patterns of spatial distribution of RH1- and SWS1-expressing photoreceptors, as well as SWS1 + RH1 multiopsin cones, in wholemounted retinas of ten species. Our findings revealed considerable species-specific variation in photoreceptor density, topography, and opsin coexpression patterns. IHC results suggest that in some species, rhodopsin is not only expressed in transmuted, cone-like rods but may also be co-opted by UV/violet-sensitive (SWS1-expressing) cones. These findings underscore the exceptional diversity and adaptive innovation in snake visual systems. The unique features and striking interspecific differences in their photoreceptors highlight snakes as an outstanding taxon for studying vertebrate visual-system function and evolution.</p>

<p>Hypothetical network of audio-vocal integration of motor neurons (twin circles) and interneurons (circles) in the medulla oblongata of the toad.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anurans are an established paradigm to study vocal mechanisms in vertebrates. Regarding the motor patterns, airborne vocalization of most evolutionarily old anurans (Archaeobatrachia) resembles breathing—that is, lung inflation is used to generate sound. Vocal behavior and call timing can be rapidly elicited or modulated by auditory stimulation so that, for example, calls are uttered antiphonally in a chorus to avoid acoustic overlap. Accordingly, in an in vitro preparation of the isolated whole brain of the Chinese fire-bellied toad, <i>Bombina orientalis</i>, motor patterns similar to those of respiration and vocalization can be elicited reliably by stimulation of the posterior (auditory) branchlet of the statoacoustic nerve (N. VIII). Here, we show that audio–vocal integration does not exclusively involve higher brain centers such as mesencephalic torus semicircularis (colliculus inferior) but is in parallel and more rapidly accomplished within the medulla oblongata. We recorded 228 neurons in the areas of motor nuclei of Nn. V, X, and XII. Hypoglossal motor neurons showed fast activation (latency of the first action potential: 9.9 ± 2.3 ms), exceeded by the very fast activation of interneurons within the hypoglossal area (minimum latency of action potential peak 2.9 ms) after N. VIII stimulation. These data support the idea that the area between the roots of the vagal (N. X) and hypoglossal (N. XII) nerves may be a crucial part of the breathing rhythm generator. It suggests that the hypoglossal area plays an important role in controlling the other motor nuclei involved in vocalization. Thus, this post-vagal area may be an important supplementary interface of audio–vocal integration to initiate and coordinate vocal motor patterns and probably inhibit buccal respiration. With this information, a hypothetical motor network of buccal and lung ventilation, as well as vocalization, was constructed.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autophagy is a fundamental biological pathway with vital roles in intracellular homeostasis. During autophagy, defective cargoes including mitochondria are targeted to lysosomes for clearance and recycling. Recessive truncating variants in the autophagy gene <i>EPG5</i> have been associated with Vici syndrome, a severe early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with extensive multisystem involvement. Here, we aimed to delineate the extended, age-dependent <i>EPG5</i>-related disease spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated clinical, radiological, and molecular features from the largest cohort of <i>EPG5</i>-related patients identified to date, complemented by experimental investigation of cellular and animal models of EPG5 defects.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Through worldwide collaboration, we identified 211 patients, 97 of them previously unpublished, with recessive <i>EPG5</i> variants. The phenotypic spectrum ranged from antenatally lethal presentations to milder isolated neurodevelopmental disorders. A novel Epg5 knock-in mouse model of a recurrent <i>EPG5</i> missense variant featured motor impairments and defective autophagy in brain areas particularly relevant for the neurological disorders in milder presentations. Novel age-dependent neurodegenerative manifestations in our cohort included adolescent-onset parkinsonism and dystonia with cognitive decline, and myoclonus. Radiological features suggested an emerging continuum with brain iron accumulation disorders. Patient fibroblasts showed defects in PINK1-Parkin-dependent mitophagic clearance and α-synuclein overexpression, indicating a cellular basis for the observed neurodegenerative phenotypes. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <i>EPG5</i> knockdown caused motor impairments, defective mitophagic clearance, and changes in mitochondrial respiration comparable to observations in <i>C. elegans</i> knockdown of parkinsonism-related genes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings illustrate a lifetime neurological disease continuum associated with pathogenic <i>EPG5</i> variants, linking neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders through the common denominator of defective autophagy. ANN NEUROL 2025 ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                A recent study by Lindman and colleagues highlights a cell type-specific function of receptor-interacting kinase 3 (RIPK3) in astrocytes during neurotropic flavivirus infection. Despite a proinflammatory transcriptional profile, RIPK3 in astrocytes can attenuate neuroinflammation and reduce leucocyte infiltration through upregulation of Serpin clade A member 3N (SerpinA3N), protecting mice from excessive neuroinflammation and increasing overall survival.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01161-1?rss=yes">Specific phosphorylation at Ser60 in N terminus of SlCAK1 propels bacterial cold shock protein-induced immunity in Solanaceae plants</a></h4>

              
                Li et al. demonstrate that SlCAK1 is a key signaling component in csp22-triggered immunity in tomato. Upon csp22 perception, SlCAK1 is rapidly recruited into the SlCORE/SlBAK1a receptor complex, and then SlBAK1a mediates the phosphorylation at Ser60 in the N terminus of SlCAK1, thereby activating SlCAK1 and initiating downstream immune responses.
