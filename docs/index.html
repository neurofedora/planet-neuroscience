              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural defensive circuits underlie helping under threat in humans</a></h4>

              
                Empathy for others’ distress has long been considered the driving force of helping. However, when deciding to help others in danger, one must consider not only their distress, but also the risk to oneself. Whereas the role of self-defense in helping has been overlooked in human research, studies in other animals indicate defensive responses are necessary for the protection of conspecifics. In this pre-registered study (N=49), we demonstrate that human defensive neural circuits are implicated in helping others under threat. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while deciding whether to help another participant avoid aversive electrical shocks, at the risk of also being shocked. We found that higher engagement of neural circuits that coordinate fast escape from self-directed danger (including the insula, PAG, and ACC) facilitated decisions to help others. Importantly, using representational similarity analysis, we found that the strength with which the amygdala and insula uniquely represented the threat to oneself (and not the other’s distress) predicted helping. Our findings indicate that in humans, as other mammals, defensive mechanisms play a greater role in helping behavior than previously understood.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oxytocin signaling in the posterior hypothalamus prevents hyperphagic obesity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Decades of studies have revealed molecular and neural circuit bases for body weight homeostasis. Neural hormone oxytocin (Oxt) has received attention in this context because it is produced by neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), a known output center of hypothalamic regulation of appetite. Oxt has an anorexigenic effect, as shown in human studies, and can mediate satiety signals in rodents. However, the function of Oxt signaling in the physiological regulation of appetite has remained in question, because whole-body knockout (KO) of <i>Oxt</i> or <i>Oxt receptor</i> (<i>Oxtr</i>) has little effect on food intake. We herein show that acute conditional KO (cKO) of <i>Oxt</i> selectively in the adult PVH, but not in the supraoptic nucleus, markedly increases body weight and food intake, with an elevated level of plasma triglyceride and leptin. Intraperitoneal administration of Oxt rescues the hyperphagic phenotype of the PVH <i>Oxt</i> cKO model. Furthermore, we show that cKO of <i>Oxtr</i> selectively in the posterior hypothalamic regions, especially the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, a primary center for appetite regulations, phenocopies hyperphagic obesity. Collectively, these data reveal that Oxt signaling in the arcuate nucleus suppresses excessive food intake.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Continuous sensing of IFNα by hepatic endothelial cells shapes a vascular antimetastatic barrier</a></h4>

              
                Hepatic metastases are a poor prognostic factor of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and new strategies to reduce the risk of liver CRC colonization are highly needed. Herein, we used mouse models of hepatic metastatization to demonstrate that the continuous infusion of therapeutic doses of interferon-alpha (IFNα) controls CRC invasion by acting on hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). Mechanistically, IFNα promoted the development of a vascular antimetastatic niche characterized by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) defenestration extracellular matrix and glycocalyx deposition, thus strengthening the liver vascular barrier impairing CRC trans-sinusoidal migration, without requiring a direct action on tumor cells, hepatic stellate cells, hepatocytes, or liver dendritic cells (DCs), Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver capsular macrophages (LCMs). Moreover, IFNα endowed LSECs with efficient cross-priming potential that, along with the early intravascular tumor burden reduction, supported the generation of antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and ultimately led to the establishment of a protective long-term memory T cell response. These findings provide a rationale for the use of continuous IFNα therapy in perioperative settings to reduce CRC metastatic spreading to the liver.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional ultrasound imaging reveals an aberrant developmental trajectory of functional connectivity in a mouse model of the 15q13.3 copy number variant microdeletion</a></h4>

              
                The developmental nature of many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia necessitates the detection of functional biomarkers during the prodromal phase of disease that can predict symptomatic conversion and outcomes. Structural chromosomal aberrations, such as copy number variants, confer high risk and penetrance of neuropsychiatric disorders. We used functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) to characterize the functional connectivity profile of the 15q13.3+/- copy number variant mouse model during major developmental milestones on post-natal day (p)35, 42, 60, and 90 in comparison to wild type littermates. We identified divergent trajectories for 15q13.3+/- mice and WT littermate controls where functional connectivity was reduced for both genotypes with age, but to a lesser extent for 15q13.3+/- mice. We were then able to isolate the distinct differences between genotypes to identify a large-scale network where 15q13.3+/- mice displayed global cortical hyperconnectivity and elevated intra-connectivity within the hippocampus and amygdala, in particular. In order to determine the stage of development where the connectivity trajectories bifurcated, we used machine learning to predict genotype. We found that the connectivity profile from p42, but not p35, predicted the genotype of individual mice at p90 with 82% accuracy. All together, these results suggest a crucial period of network maturation from early to late pubescence that is pivotal in the transition of healthy network connectivity into adulthood. This novel application of fUS longitudinally through development shows promise in improving the understanding of the disease biology of mouse models of psychiatric diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal tissue maturation of thalamocortical pathways in the human fetal brain</a></h4>

              
                The development of connectivity between the thalamus and maturing cortex is a fundamental process in the second half of human gestation, establishing the neural circuits that are the basis for several important brain functions. In this study, we acquired high-resolution in utero diffusion MRI from 140 fetuses as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project, to examine the emergence of thalamocortical white matter over the second to third trimester. We delineate developing thalamocortical pathways and parcellate the fetal thalamus according to its cortical connectivity using diffusion tractography. We then quantify microstructural tissue components along the tracts in the fetal compartments that are critical substrates for white matter maturation, such as the subplate and intermediate zone. We identify patterns of change in the diffusion metrics that reflect critical neurobiological transitions occurring in the second to third trimester, such as the disassembly of radial glial scaffolding and the lamination of the cortical plate. These maturational trajectories of MR signal in transient fetal compartments provide a normative reference to complement histological knowledge, facilitating future studies to establish how developmental disruptions in these regions contribute to pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell analysis of prenatal and postnatal human cortical development</a></h4>

              
                Human cortical development involves birth, differentiation and maturation of a multitude of cellular lineages over the course of prenatal and postnatal life. Single-cell genomics provided insight into the molecular changes that underlie the development of early cortical lineages but has mostly been applied to the second trimester of prenatal human cortical development. Here, we utilize single-nucleus RNA sequencing to capture the development of the main human cortical lineages across prenatal and postnatal stages until adulthood and generate a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human cortical development. We collected more than 350,000 single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles from 108 tissue samples from 60 donors representing the second and third trimester of gestation, as well as neonatal, early and late postnatal stages of development. We identify lineage-specific developmental programs that underlie the development of specific subtypes of excitatory cortical neurons, interneurons, glial cell types and brain vasculature. Moreover, we discover sex- and region-specific developmental changes in each of these lineages. By intersecting our results with genetic risk factors for autism, we identify the cortical cell types and lineages most vulnerable to genetic insults that cause autism. We show that lineage-specific gene expression programs upregulated in female cells are especially enriched for the genetic risk factors of autism. Since these genes are expressed at lower levels in males during development, they may be more susceptible to heterozygous loss of function in ASD, providing a basis for the increased male to female ratio of autism incidence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A cross-species proteomic map of synapse development reveals neoteny during human postsynaptic density maturation</a></h4>

              
                The molecular mechanisms and evolutionary changes accompanying synapse development are still poorly understood. Here, we generated a cross-species proteomic map of synapse development in the human, macaque, and mouse neocortex. By tracking the changes of >1,000 postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins from midgestation to adolescence, we found that PSD maturation in humans separates into three major phases that are dominated by distinct pathways. Cross-species comparisons reveal that the human PSD matures about three times slower than other species and contains higher levels of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) in the perinatal period. Enhancement of the RhoGEF signaling in human neurons delays the morphological maturation of dendritic spines and functional maturation of synapses, potentially contributing to the neotenic traits of human brain development. In addition, PSD proteins can be divided into four modules that exert stage- and cell type-specific functions, possibly explaining their differential associations with cognitive functions and diseases. Together, our proteomic map of synapse development provides a blueprint for studying the molecular basis and evolutionary changes of synapse maturation.

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly worse worldwide since it was discovered in China in late December 2019. Easy contact transmission between people and a low to moderate mortality rate may cause failure in medical health services if there is no proper personal protective equipment for personnel. During the pandemic, patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion who required immediate treatment through mechanical thrombectomy (MT) were still being sent to the emergency room. Knowing how to maintain effective treatment standards has become our concern. We used a retrospective, single-center study to select COVID-19 (-) patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy during the years 2020&amp;amp;ndash;2021. Patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion received mechanical thrombectomy were compared with patients admitted from December 2020 to May 2021 (the pre- COVID-19 group) and those from June 2021 to November 2021 (the during COVID-19 group). Furthermore, the time disparity of mechanical thrombectomy was compared between these two groups. Of patients confirmed with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) during the study period, 62 were included. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (34 patients; median age, 70.5 years), the during COVID-19 group (28 patients; median age, 71.5 years) showed no major median time difference in door-to-computed-tomography-angiography (CTA) time (19.0 min vs. 20.0 min, p = 0.398) and no major median time difference in door-to-groin-puncture time (118.0 min vs. 109.0 min, p = 0.281). In our study, with a prepared protocol for the pandemic having been established in the healthcare system, we could see no difference between the pre-pandemic and during-pandemic time periods when using mechanical thrombectomy to treat COVID-19 (-) patients of AIS with LVO. By means of a quick-PCR test during triage, there was no time delay to perform MT or any lowering of safety protocol for workers in the healthcare system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dignity in the care of older adults living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Depending on the fields and actors involved, dignity may involve, signify, and encompass different meanings. This fundamental right can be subjectively experienced and rooted in a person's perception of being treated and cared for. Care refers to a set of specific activities combined in a complex life-sustaining network, including long-term Care, which involves various services designed to meet a person's health or personal care needs. However, older residents' human rights have been disrespected and widened the gaps between theory and practice regarding the precarious protection of their rights and dignity inside long-term facilities and nursing homes. This paper aims to discuss threats to dignity and elucidate some strategies to promote and conserve dignity in care, including the person-centered practice in long-term care. Some barriers to the dignity of older residents involve the organizational culture, restraints of time, heavy workload, burnout, and lack of partnership between the residents, their families, and the long-term care homes' staff. Person-centered integrated care quality frameworks are core components of a good quality of care in these spaces in high-income countries. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how weak long-term care policies were and demonstrated that much progress in the dignity of care in long-term care facilities and nursing homes is needed. In low- and middle-income countries, long-term care policies do not accompany the accelerated and intense aging process, and there are other threats, like their invisibility to the public sector and the prejudices about this service model. It's urgent to create strategies for designing and implementing sustainable and equitable long- term care systems based on a person-centered service with dignity to everyone who needs it.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Axonal Domain Structure as a Putative Identifier of Neuron-Specific Vulnerability to Oxidative Stress in Cultured Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several populations of neurons are purported to degenerate in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD). One current hypothesis suggests that vulnerable neurons in PD share common characteristics including projecting to voluminous territories and having extremely long and branched axonal domains with large numbers of neurotransmitter release sites. In this study, we used a mouse <I>in vitro</I> culture system to compare the axonal domain of neuronal populations suspected to be vulnerable in PD to that of neuronal populations considered at a lesser risk. In the first category, we included dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra, noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), serotonin neurons of the raphe nuclei (R), and cholinergic neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). In the second category, we included DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area, cholinergic neurons of the hypoglossal nucleus, and cholinergic interneurons of the dorsal striatum. Validating their differential vulnerability, we find that, when compared with neurons presumed to be resilient in PD, a larger proportion of neurons presumed to be vulnerable in PD degenerate in response to cell stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. We also find that they are endowed with larger axonal domains, that are more complex, have more axonal varicosities with a higher proportion of varicosities that are positive for synaptotagmin 1 (Syt-1). Notwithstanding the obvious limitations related to the dissection of small brain nuclei and to the growth of these neurons <I>in vitro</I>, these findings support the hypothesis that axonal domain structure is a key characteristic of neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption in Preclinical Mouse Models of Stroke Can Be an Experimental Artifact Caused by Craniectomy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The pathophysiological features of ischemia-related blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) disruption are widely studied using preclinical stroke models. However, in many of these models, craniectomy is required to confirm arterial occlusion via laser Doppler flowmetry or to enable direct ligation of the cerebral artery. In the present study, mice were used to construct a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model, a preclinical stroke model that requires craniectomy to enable direct ligation of the cerebral artery, or were subjected to craniectomy alone. dMCAO but not craniectomy caused neurodegeneration and cerebral infarction, but both procedures induced an appreciable increase in BBB permeability to Evans blue dye, fluorescein, and endogenous albumin but not to 10 kDa dextran-FITC, leading to cerebral edema. Using rats, we further showed that BBB disruption induced by craniectomy with no evidence of dural tearing was comparable to that induced by craniectomy involving tearing of the dura. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that craniectomy can be a major contributor to BBB disruption and cerebral edema in preclinical stroke models. The implications of this experimental artifact for translational stroke research and preclinical data interpretation are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mutation patterns of resistance genes for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in nontuberculous mycobacteria isolates from Kenya [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) treatment constitutes a macrolide-based antibiotic regimen in combination with aminoglycosides for Rapid-Growing mycobacteria (RGM), and rifampicin for Slow-Growing mycobacteria (SGM). Mutations in the anti-NTM drug target regions promote NTM evolution to mutant strains that are insusceptible to NTM drugs leading to treatment failure. We, therefore, described the mutation patterns of anti-NTM drug target genes including rrl, rrs, and rpoB in NTM isolates from Kenya.  Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study that included 122 NTM obtained from the sputum of symptomatic tuberculosis-negative patients in Kenya. All the 122 NTM underwent targeted sequencing of the rrl gene. The 54 RGM were also sequenced for rrs, and the 68 SGM were sequenced for rpoB genes using ABI 3730XL analyzer. The obtained sequences were aligned to their wild-type reference sequences for each gene using Geneious then mutations were identified. Pearson chi-square at 95% confidence interval tested the association of NTM to mutation patterns for each gene. Results: Twenty-eight (23%) of the NTM were resistant to at least one of the antibiotics used in the macrolide-based treatment. Twelve (10.4%) of NTM were macrolide resistant, with 7(58.3%) of RGM and 5(41.7%) of SGM having mutations in the rrl gene. For ten (83.3%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2058, while for two (16.6%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2059. Six (11.1%) of the 54 RGM exhibited mutations in the aminoglycoside target gene rrs at location 1408. Ten (14.7%) of the 68 SGM were resistant to rifampicin, with 40 percent having mutations at codon 531 in the rpoB gene.   Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant level of drug resistance for macrolides, aminoglycosides and rifampicin in NTM isolated from symptomatic TB negative patients in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automated segmentation of endometriosis using transfer learning technique [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper focuses on segmenting the exact location of endometriosis using the state-of-art technique known as U-Net. Endometriosis is a progressive disorder that has a significant impact on women. The lesion-like appearance that grows inside the uterus and sheds for every periodical cycle is known as endometriosis. If the lesion exists and is transferred to other locations in the women’s reproductive system, it may lead to a serious problem. Besides radiologists deep learning techniques exist for recognizing the presence and aggravation of endometriosis. Methods: The proposed method known as structural similarity analysis of endometriosis (SSAE) identifies the similarity between pathologically identified and annotated images obtained from standardized dataset known as GLENDA v1.5 by implementing two systematic approaches. The first approach is based on semantic segmentation and the second approach uses statistical analysis. Semantic segmentation is a cutting-edge technology for identifying exact locations by performing pixel-level classification. In semantic segmentation, U-Net is a transfer-learning architecture that works effectively for biomedical image classification. The SSAE implements the U-Net architecture for segmenting endometriosis based on the region of occurrence. The second approach proves the similarity between pathologically identified images and the corresponding annotated images using a statistical evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using calculation of both the mean and standard deviation of all four regions by implementing systematic sampling procedure. Results: The SSAE obtains the intersection over union value of 0.72 and the F1 score of 0.74 for the trained dataset. The means of both the laparoscopic and annotated images for all regions were similar. Consequently, the SSAE facilitated the presence of abnormalities in a specific region. Conclusions: The proposed SSAE approach identifies the affected region using U-Net architecture and systematic sampling procedure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, psychological issues, college adjustment, and digital skills [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 ± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32; RMSE: 2.42; R2: 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59; RMSE: 2.49; R 2: 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety; while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion: Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genetics and functional significance of the understudied methamphetamine sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO) [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The last 50 years have witnessed extraordinary discoveries in the field of circadian rhythms. However, there are still several mysteries that remain. One of these chronobiological mysteries is the circadian rhythm that is revealed by administration of stimulant drugs to rodents. Herein we describe the discovery of this circadian rhythm and its underlying oscillator, which is frequently called the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator, or MASCO. This oscillator is distinct from canonical circadian oscillators because it controls robust activity rhythms independently of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and circadian genes are not essential for its timekeeping. We discuss these fundamental properties of MASCO and integrate studies of strain, sex, and circadian gene mutations on MASCO. The anatomical loci of MASCO are not known, so it has not been possible thus far to discover its novel molecular timekeeping mechanism or its functional significance. However, studies in mutant mice suggest that genetic approaches can be used to identify the neural network involved in the rhythm generation of MASCO. We also discuss parallels between human and rodent studies that support our working hypothesis that a function of MASCO may be to regulate sleep-wake cycles.

Ancestral sequence reconstruction is a technique that is gaining widespread use in molecular evolution studies and protein engineering. Accurate reconstruction requires the ability to handle appropriately large numbers of sequences, as well as insertion and deletion (indel) events, but available approaches exhibit limitations. To address these limitations, we developed Graphical Representation of Ancestral Sequence Predictions (GRASP), which efficiently implements maximum likelihood methods to enable the inference of ancestors of families with more than 10,000 members. GRASP implements partial order graphs (POGs) to represent and infer insertion and deletion events across ancestors, enabling the identification of building blocks for protein engineering.
To validate the capacity to engineer novel proteins from realistic data, we predicted ancestor sequences across three distinct enzyme families: glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases, cytochromes P450, and dihydroxy/sugar acid dehydratases (DHAD). All tested ancestors demonstrated enzymatic activity. Our study demonstrates the ability of GRASP (1) to support large data sets over 10,000 sequences and (2) to employ insertions and deletions to identify building blocks for engineering biologically active ancestors, by exploring variation over evolutionary time.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the first wave of COVID-19 in India</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dhiraj Kumar Hazra, Bhalchandra S. Pujari, Snehal M. Shekatkar, Farhina Mozaffer, Sitabhra Sinha, Vishwesha Guttal, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Gautam I. Menon</p>

Estimating the burden of COVID-19 in India is difficult because the extent to which cases and deaths have been undercounted is hard to assess. Here, we use a 9-component, age-stratified, contact-structured epidemiological compartmental model, which we call the INDSCI-SIM model, to analyse the first wave of COVID-19 spread in India. We use INDSCI-SIM, together with Bayesian methods, to obtain optimal fits to daily reported cases and deaths across the span of the first wave of the Indian pandemic, over the period Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 15, 2021. We account for lock-downs and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), an overall increase in testing as a function of time, the under-counting of cases and deaths, and a range of age-specific infection-fatality ratios. We first use our model to describe data from all individual districts of the state of Karnataka, benchmarking our calculations using data from serological surveys. We then extend this approach to aggregated data for Karnataka state. We model the progress of the pandemic across the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, and then for India as a whole. We estimate that deaths were undercounted by a factor between 2 and 5 across the span of the first wave, converging on 2.2 as a representative multiplier that accounts for the urban-rural gradient. We also estimate an overall under-counting of cases by a factor of between 20 and 25 towards the end of the first wave. Our estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) are in the range 0.05—0.15, broadly consistent with previous estimates but substantially lower than values that have been estimated for other LMIC countries. We find that approximately 35% of India had been infected overall by the end of the first wave, results broadly consistent with those from serosurveys. These results contribute to the understanding of the long-term trajectory of COVID-19 in India.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Understanding the impact of third-party species on pairwise coexistence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jie Deng, Washington Taylor, Serguei Saavedra</p>

The persistence of virtually every single species depends on both the presence of other species and the specific environmental conditions in a given location. Because in natural settings many of these conditions are unknown, research has been centered on finding the fraction of possible conditions (probability) leading to species coexistence. The focus has been on the persistence probability of an entire multispecies community (formed of either two or more species). However, the methodological and philosophical question has always been whether we can observe the entire community and, if not, what the conditions are under which an observed subset of the community can persist as part of a larger multispecies system. Here, we derive long-term (using analytical calculations) and short-term (using simulations and experimental data) system-level indicators of the effect of third-party species on the coexistence probability of a pair (or subset) of species under unknown environmental conditions. We demonstrate that the fraction of conditions incompatible with the possible coexistence of a pair of species tends to become vanishingly small within systems of increasing numbers of species. Yet, the probability of pairwise coexistence in isolation remains approximately the expected probability of pairwise coexistence in more diverse assemblages. In addition, we found that when third-party species tend to reduce (resp. increase) the coexistence probability of a pair, they tend to exhibit slower (resp. faster) rates of competitive exclusion. Long-term and short-term effects of the remaining third-party species on all possible specific pairs in a system are not equally distributed, but these differences can be mapped and anticipated under environmental uncertainty.

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has placed a significant burden on public health systems to provide swift and accurate diagnostic testing highlighting the critical need for innovative testing approaches for future pandemics. In this study, we present a novel sample pooling procedure based on compressed sensing theory to accurately identify virally infected patients at high prevalence rates utilizing an innovative viral RNA extraction process to minimize sample dilution. At prevalence rates ranging from 0–14.3%, the number of tests required to identify the infection status of all patients was reduced by 69.26% as compared to conventional testing in primary human SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and a coronavirus model system. Our method provided quantification of individual sample viral load within a pool as well as a binary positive-negative result. Additionally, our modified pooling and RNA extraction process minimized sample dilution which remained constant as pool sizes increased. Compressed sensing can be adapted to a wide variety of diagnostic testing applications to increase throughput for routine laboratory testing as well as a means to increase testing capacity to combat future pandemics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel methods for estimating the instantaneous and overall COVID-19 case fatality risk among care home residents in England</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoper E. Overton, Luke Webb, Uma Datta, Mike Fursman, Jo Hardstaff, Iina Hiironen, Karthik Paranthaman, Heather Riley, James Sedgwick, Julia Verne, Steve Wilner, Lorenzo Pellis, Ian Hall</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has had high mortality rates in the elderly and frail worldwide, particularly in care homes. This is driven by the difficulty of isolating care homes from the wider community, the large population sizes within care facilities (relative to typical households), and the age/frailty of the residents. To quantify the mortality risk posed by disease, the case fatality risk (CFR) is an important tool. This quantifies the proportion of cases that result in death. Throughout the pandemic, CFR amongst care home residents in England has been monitored closely. To estimate CFR, we apply both novel and existing methods to data on deaths in care homes, collected by Public Health England and the Care Quality Commission. We compare these different methods, evaluating their relative strengths and weaknesses. Using these methods, we estimate temporal trends in the instantaneous CFR (at both daily and weekly resolutions) and the overall CFR across the whole of England, and dis-aggregated at regional level. We also investigate how the CFR varies based on age and on the type of care required, dis-aggregating by whether care homes include nursing staff and by age of residents. This work has contributed to the summary of measures used for monitoring the UK epidemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structural spine plasticity: Learning and forgetting of odor-specific subnetworks in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John Hongyu Meng, Hermann Riecke</p>

Learning to discriminate between different sensory stimuli is essential for survival. In rodents, the olfactory bulb, which contributes to odor discrimination via pattern separation, exhibits extensive structural synaptic plasticity involving the formation and removal of synaptic spines, even in adult animals. The network connectivity resulting from this plasticity is still poorly understood. To gain insight into this connectivity we present here a computational model for the structural plasticity of the reciprocal synapses between the dominant population of excitatory principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. It incorporates the observed modulation of spine stability by odor exposure. The model captures the striking experimental observation that the exposure to odors does not always enhance their discriminability: while training with similar odors enhanced their discriminability, training with dissimilar odors actually <i>reduced</i> the discriminability of the training stimuli. Strikingly, this differential learning does not require the activity-dependence of the spine stability and occurs also in a model with purely random spine dynamics in which the spine density is changed homogeneously, e.g., due to a global signal. However, the experimentally observed odor-specific reduction in the response of principal cells as a result of extended odor exposure and the concurrent disinhibition of a subset of principal cells arise only in the activity-dependent model. Moreover, this model predicts the experimentally testable recovery of odor response through weak but not through strong odor re-exposure and the forgetting of odors via exposure to interfering odors. Combined with the experimental observations, the computational model provides strong support for the prediction that odor exposure leads to the formation of odor-specific subnetworks in the olfactory bulb.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mechanics of lung cancer: A finite element model shows strain amplification during early tumorigenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rebecca G. Zitnay, Michael R. Herron, Keith R. Carney, Scott Potter, Lyska L. Emerson, Jeffrey A. Weiss, Michelle C. Mendoza</p>

Early lung cancer lesions develop within a unique microenvironment that undergoes constant cyclic stretch from respiration. While tumor stiffening is an established driver of tumor progression, the contribution of stress and strain to lung cancer is unknown. We developed tissue scale finite element models of lung tissue to test how early lesions alter respiration-induced strain. We found that an early tumor, represented as alveolar filling, amplified the strain experienced in the adjacent alveolar walls. Tumor stiffening further increased the amplitude of the strain in the adjacent alveolar walls and extended the strain amplification deeper into the normal lung. In contrast, the strain experienced in the tumor proper was less than the applied strain, although regions of amplification appeared at the tumor edge. Measurements of the alveolar wall thickness in clinical and mouse model samples of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) showed wall thickening adjacent to the tumors, consistent with cellular response to strain. Modeling alveolar wall thickening by encircling the tumor with thickened walls moved the strain amplification radially outward, to the next adjacent alveolus. Simulating iterative thickening in response to amplified strain produced tracks of thickened walls. We observed such tracks in early-stage clinical samples. The tracks were populated with invading tumor cells, suggesting that strain amplification in very early lung lesions could guide pro-invasive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. The simulation results and tumor measurements suggest that cells at the edge of a lung tumor and in surrounding alveolar walls experience increased strain during respiration that could promote tumor progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Phosphoinositide species and filamentous actin formation mediate engulfment by senescent tumor cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wesley D. Frey, Ashlyn Y. Anderson, Hyemin Lee, Julie B. Nguyen, Emma L. Cowles, Hua Lu, James G. Jackson</p>

Cancer cells survive chemotherapy and cause lethal relapse by entering a senescent state that facilitates expression of many phagocytosis/macrophage-related genes that engender a novel cannibalism phenotype. We used biosensors and live-cell imaging to reveal the basic steps and mechanisms of engulfment by senescent human and mouse tumor cells. We show filamentous actin in predator cells was localized to the prey cell throughout the process of engulfment. Biosensors to various phosphoinositide (PI) species revealed increased concentration and distinct localization of predator PI(4) P and PI(4,5)P2 at the prey cell during early stages of engulfment, followed by a transient burst of PI(3) P before and following internalization. PIK3C2B, the kinase responsible for generating PI(3)P, was required for complete engulfment. Inhibition or knockdown of Clathrin, known to associate with PIK3C2B and PI(4,5)P2, severely impaired engulfment. In sum, our data reveal the most fundamental cellular processes of senescent cell engulfment, including the precise localizations and dynamics of actin and PI species throughout the entire process.

                Background: Cardiovascular involvement is not well studied in children with sickle cell disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the echocardiographic parameters and to investigate speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) interest in detecting subclinical myocardial impairment of children with sickle cell disease. Methods: The study was directed in the echocardiographic laboratory in the military hospital of Tunis between July 2018 and December 2018. 30 patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and 30 controls were compared. The echocardiographic measurements were indexed according to body surface. Cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction, wall thickness, as well as LV 2-D longitudinal systolic strain were assessed. Results: The SCA Group included 30 patients (11.8 ± 2yrs, sex ratio: 1.31) with homozygous SCA and the C Group included 30 healthy controls (12.7 ± 1,2yrs, sex ratio: 1.27). According to the findings, SCA Group showed significantly larger LV diameter (36.2±2.5mm/m2 vs 29.3±1.3mm/m2, p=0.005). SCA Group also showed lower LV ejection fraction (62%±0.5 vs 65%±5, p=0.001). No significant difference was observed for cardiac output (p=0.4). Otherwise, two-dimensional longitudinal strain of LV was higher in SCA group (-21%±3.07 vs -25%±2.98; p<0.01). Conclusions: Our study highlights several cardiac abnormalities in children with SCA, which could represent a marker of disease severity and point out the importance of the cardiologic screening of these patients.

                Tropical sprue (TS) is a post-infective disease of the small bowel characterized by a malabsorption syndrome affecting tropics inhabitants and visitors. Diagnosis of TS remain challenging since it can be confused with common diarrheal diseases, especially in non-endemic areas. We report a Tunisian case of latent TS. A 58-year-old male with a history of chronic watery diarrhea, was admitted to the intensive care unit for confusion which was related to severe metabolic acidosis. Despite the neurological improvement after hydro-electrolytic resuscitation and acid-base disorders correction, the patient continued to have three to five loose stools daily. A nutritional assessment showed a malabsorption syndrome: iron, Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies; normochromic normocytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed duodenal villous atrophy and biopsy confirmed subtotal villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis and a thickened hyalonalized sub-epithelial basal lamina. Celiac disease was evoked, however the patient did not improve on a gluten-free diet and the celiac serology was negative. On re-interviewing, we discovered that the patient had spent two months in India three years prior. Given the travel history, clinico-biological and histological data TS was highly considered and a good response to a five-month antibiotic course combined to nutritional supplementation supported this diagnosis. Clinico-biological, endoscopic and histological findings were overlapping between TS and other malabsorption diseases, explaining diagnosis difficulties. TS should be systematically discussed in tropics visitors presenting with chronic diarrhea. Improvement after micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies replacement combined to a prolonged antibiotic course supports the diagnosis of TS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural dynamics of causal inference in the macaque frontoparietal circuit</a></h4>

              
                Natural perception relies inherently on inferring causal structure in the environment. However, the neural mechanisms and functional circuits essential for representing and updating the hidden causal structure and corresponding sensory representations during multisensory processing are unknown. To address this, monkeys were trained to infer the probability of a potential common source from visual and proprioceptive signals based on their spatial disparity in a virtual reality system. The proprioceptive drift reported by monkeys demonstrated that they combined previous experience and current multisensory signals to estimate the hidden common source and subsequently updated the causal structure and sensory representation. Single-unit recordings in premotor and parietal cortices revealed that neural activity in the premotor cortex represents the core computation of causal inference, characterizing the estimation and update of the likelihood of integrating multiple sensory inputs at a trial-by-trial level. In response to signals from the premotor cortex, neural activity in the parietal cortex also represents the causal structure and further dynamically updates the sensory representation to maintain consistency with the causal inference structure. Thus, our results indicate how the premotor cortex integrates previous experience and sensory inputs to infer hidden variables and selectively updates sensory representations in the parietal cortex to support behavior. This dynamic loop of frontal-parietal interactions in the causal inference framework may provide the neural mechanism to answer long-standing questions regarding how neural circuits represent hidden structures for body awareness and agency.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NaV1.1 is essential for proprioceptive signaling and motor behaviors</a></h4>

              
                The voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>V</sub>), Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, is well-studied in the central nervous system; conversely, its contribution to peripheral sensory neuron function is more enigmatic. Here, we identify a new role for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in mammalian proprioception. RNAscope analysis and <i>in vitro</i> patch clamp recordings in genetically identified mouse proprioceptors show ubiquitous channel expression and significant contributions to intrinsic excitability. Notably, genetic deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in sensory neurons caused profound and visible motor coordination deficits in conditional knockout mice of both sexes, similar to conditional Piezo2-knockout animals, suggesting this channel is a major contributor to sensory proprioceptive transmission. <i>Ex vivo</i> muscle afferent recordings from conditional knockout mice found that loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 leads to inconsistent and unreliable proprioceptor firing characterized by action potential failures during static muscle stretch; conversely, afferent responses to dynamic vibrations were unaffected. This suggests that while a combination of Piezo2 and other Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms are sufficient to elicit activity in response to transient stimuli, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is required for transmission of receptor potentials generated during sustained muscle stretch. Impressively, recordings from afferents of heterozygous conditional knockout animals were similarly impaired, and heterozygous conditional knockout mice also exhibited motor behavioral deficits. Thus, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 haploinsufficiency in sensory neurons impairs both proprioceptor function and motor behaviors. Importantly, human patients harboring Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 loss-of-function mutations often present with motor delays and ataxia; therefore, our data suggest sensory neuron dysfunction contributes to the clinical manifestations of neurological disorders in which Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 function is compromised. Collectively, we present the first evidence that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is essential for mammalian proprioceptive signaling and behaviors.

                Being able to perform adept goal-directed actions requires predictive, feed-forward control, including a mapping between the visually estimated target locations and the motor commands reaching for them. When the mapping is perturbed, e.g., due to muscle fatigue or optical distortions, we are quickly able to recalibrate the sensorimotor system to update this mapping. Here we investigated whether early visual and visuomotor experience is essential for developing sensorimotor recalibration. To this end, we assessed young individuals deprived from pattern vision due to dense congenital bilateral cataracts, who were surgically treated for sight restoration only years after birth. We compared their recalibration performance to such distortion to that of age-matched sighted controls. Their sensorimotor recalibration performance was impaired right after surgery. This finding cannot be explained by their still lower visual acuity alone, since blurring vision in controls to a matching degree did not lead to comparable behavior.  Nevertheless, the recalibration ability of cataract-treated participants gradually improved with time after surgery. Thus, the lack of early pattern vision affects visuomotor recalibration. However, this ability is not lost but slowly develops after sight restoration, highlighting the importance of sensorimotor experience gained late in life.

                Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are the most potent producer of type I interferon (IFN), but how pDC are primed <i>in vivo</i> is poorly defined. Using a mouse model of severe malaria, we have previously established that upon priming by CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages (MP), pDC initiate type I IFN-I secretion in the bone marrow (BM) of infected mice via cell-intrinsic TLR7 sensing and cell-extrinsic STING sensing. Herein we show that CD169<sup>+</sup> MP and TLR7-sensing are both required for pDC arrest during priming, suggesting CD169<sup>+</sup> MP are the source of TLR7 ligands. We establish that TLR7 sensing in pDC and chemotaxis are both required for pDC arrest and functional communication with CD169<sup>+</sup> MP in the BM. Lastly, we demonstrate that STING-sensing in CD169<sup>+</sup> MP control pDC initiation of type I IFN production while also regulating pDC clustering and retention/egress from the BM. Collectively, these results link pDC acquisition of type I IFN secreting capacity with changes in their motility, homing and interactions with CD169<sup>+</sup> MP during infection. Thus, targeting this cellular interaction may help modulate type I IFN to improve outcomes of microbial infections and autoimmune diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nature over Nurture: Functional neuronal circuits emerge in the absence of developmental activity</a></h4>

              
                During development, the complex neuronal circuitry of the brain arises from limited information contained in the genome. After the genetic code instructs the birth of neurons, the emergence of brain regions, and the formation of axon tracts, it is believed that neuronal activity plays a critical role in shaping circuits for behavior. Current AI technologies are modeled after the same principle: connections in an initial weight matrix are pruned and strengthened by activity-dependent signals until the network can sufficiently generalize a set of inputs into outputs. Here, we challenge these learning-dominated assumptions by quantifying the contribution of neuronal activity to the development of visually guided swimming behavior in larval zebrafish. Intriguingly, dark-rearing zebrafish revealed that visual experience has no effect on the emergence of the optomotor response (OMR). We then raised animals under conditions where neuronal activity was pharmacologically silenced from organogenesis onward using the sodium-channel blocker tricaine. Strikingly, after washout of the anesthetic, animals performed swim bouts and responded to visual stimuli with 75% accuracy in the OMR paradigm. After shorter periods of silenced activity OMR performance stayed above 90% accuracy, calling into question the importance and impact of classical critical periods for visual development. Detailed quantification of the emergence of functional circuit properties by brain-wide imaging experiments confirmed that neuronal circuits came 'online' fully tuned and without the requirement for activity-dependent plasticity. Thus, we find that complex sensory guided behaviors can be wired up by activity-independent developmental mechanisms.

                Background: The CYFIP1 gene, located in the neurodevelopmental risk locus 15q11.2, is highly expressed in microglia, but its role in human microglial function as it relates to neurodevelopment is not well understood. Methods: We generated multiple CRISPR knockouts of CYFIP1 in patient-derived models of microglia to characterize function and phenotype. Using microglia-like cells reprogrammed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we quantified phagocytosis of synaptosomes (isolated and purified synaptic vesicles) from human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures as an in vitro model of synaptic pruning. We repeated these analyses in human iPSC-derived microglia, and characterized microglial development and function through morphology and motility. Results: CYFIP1 knockout using orthogonal CRISPR constructs in multiple patient-derived cell lines was associated with statistically significant decrease in synaptic vesicle phagocytosis in microglia models derived from both PBMCs and iPSCs (p<0.0001). Morphology was also shifted toward a more ramified profile (p<0.0001), and motility was significantly reduced (p<0.0001). However, iPSC-CYFIP1 knockout lines retained the ability to differentiate to functional microglia. Conclusion: The changes in microglial phenotype and function from loss of CYFIP1 may contribute to pruning abnormalities observed in CYFIP1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Investigating risk genes in a range of CNS cell types may be required to fully understand the way in which common and rare variants intersect to yield neuropsychiatric disorders.

                It has been recognized that the efficacy of TMS-based modulation may depend on the network profile of the stimulated regions throughout the brain. However, what profile of this stimulation network optimally benefits treatment outcomes is yet to be addressed. The answer to the question is crucial for informing network-based optimization of stimulation parameters, such as coil placement, in TMS treatments. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of taking a disease-specific network as the target of stimulation network for guiding individualized coil placement in TMS treatments. We present here a novel network-based model for TMS targeting of the pathological network. First, combining E-field modeling and resting-state functional connectivity, stimulation networks were modeled from locations and orientations of the TMS coil. Second, the spatial anti-correlation between the stimulation network and the pathological network of a given disease was hypothesized to predict the treatment outcome. The proposed model was validated to predict treatment efficacy from the position and orientation of TMS coils in two depression cohorts and one auditory verbal hallucinations cohort. We further demonstrate the utility of the proposed model in guiding individualized TMS treatment for psychiatric disorders. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated the feasibility of the novel network-based targeting strategy that uses the whole-brain, system-level abnormity of a specific psychiatric disease as a target. Results based on empirical data suggest that the strategy may potentially be utilized to identify individualized coil parameters for maximal therapeutic effects.

                Synaptic dysfunction, weakening, and loss of synapses are well-correlated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have implicated hyper-activation of the complement cascade as the driving force for loss of synapses in AD. However, the synaptic cues to trigger pathological complement activity remain elusive. To address this, we studied the actions of oligomeric, 42 residue length amyloid {beta} (oA{beta}) on metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) at hippocampal CA1 synapses, a form of synaptic plasticity that is disrupted in rodent models of AD. We found that exogenous application of oA{beta} to mouse hippocampal slices enhanced the magnitude of mGluR subtype 5 (mGlu5R)-dependent LTD. This enhanced synaptic weakening occurred via both NMDARs and complement C3aR/C5aR signaling, as revealed by pharmacological inhibition experiments. Our findings reveal a novel mechanistic interaction between mGlu5R, NMDARs, and the complement cascade in synaptic weakening induced by oA{beta}, which could represent an early trigger of synaptic degeneration in AD.

                Primates actively touch objects with their hands to collect information. In investigations of the tactile information processes, participants should experience tactile stimuli through active touch while brain activities are monitored. Here, we developed a pneumatic tactile stimulus delivery system (pTDS) that delivers various tactile stimuli on a programmed schedule and allows tactile perception through voluntary finger touches during MRI scanning. A pneumatic actuator moved tactile blocks and placed one in a finger hole. The time when an index finger touched a tactile stimulus was detected with a photosensor, allowing analysis of the touch-elicited brain responses. The brain responses were examined while the participants actively touched braille objects presented by the pTDS. BOLD responses during tactile perception were significantly stronger in a finger touch area of the contralateral somatosensory cortex compared with that of visual perception. This pTDS enables MR study of brain mechanisms for tactile processes through natural finger touch.

                Sleep awake cycle is critical for cognitive and functional abilities. Conventional sleep homeostasis mechanisms are neuronal in nature and recent views indicate glial regulation of the sleep-wake process. Mechanisms of homeostatic regulation of sleep remain to be understood. A simplified astrocytic sleep-awake homeostasis mathematical model with sleep pressure and synaptic strength dynamics is proposed using feedback control loops. The model provides insights into the emergence of two discrete states through sleep and awake promoting neuronal populations giving rise to a homeostatic process S and oscillatory process C is regulated by astrocytic sleep pressure. It also explains the variations seen in synaptic strength dynamics during sleep and awake states.

                According to most memory theories, encoding involves continuous communication between the hippocampus and neocortex leaving the temporal dynamics of hippocampal-neocortical interactions often overlooked. Recent work has shown that we perceive complex events in our lives as dynamic, with relatively distinct starting and stopping points known as event boundaries. Event boundaries may be important for memory, as they are associated with increased activity in the hippocampus, and extended neocortical regions (the posterior cingulate cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex). Our objective was to determine how functional connectivity between the hippocampus and neocortical regions during the encoding of naturalistic events (movies) related to subsequent retrieval and retention of those events. Participants encoded two 16-minute cartoon movies during fMRI scanning. After encoding, participants freely recalled one of the movies immediately, and the other after a 2-day delay. We quantified hippocampal-neocortical functional connectivity (FC) at time windows around each event onset, middle, and offset, and compared these FC measures with subsequent recall. These analyses revealed that higher FC between the hippocampus and the posterior medial network (PMN) at an event's offset related to whether that event was subsequently recalled. In contrast, mid-event connectivity between the hippocampus and PMN was associated with poorer memory. Furthermore, hippocampal-PMN offset connectivity predicted not only whether events were retained in memory, but also the degree to which these events could be recalled in detail after a 2-day delay. These data demonstrate that the relationship between memory encoding and hippocampal-neocortical interaction is more dynamic than suggested by most memory theories, and they converge with recent modeling work suggesting that event offset is an optimal time for encoding.

                The discovery of place cells within the hippocampus has pointed to the importance of the hippocampus for navigation. The more recent discovery of hippocampal time cells has broadened the perspective of encoding in the hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis to the existence of time cells is based on the notion that hippocampal cells deduce location by integrating travelled distance ("path integration"). According to this alternate hypothesis, time cells, which fire at particular times when animals are running on a treadmill without changing location, actually encode accumulated distance on the treadmill. To examine this hypothesis, Kraus et al. performed treadmill experiments in which animals either ran for a fixed time or a fixed distance with varying velocities. Two distinct coding modes of hippocampal principal cells were found. Some cells encoded travelled distance and others elapsed time, thus refuting the notion that all hippocampal cells were performing path integration. Using the data from these experiments, we asked whether the two populations depended on the type of task the rats were engaged in. We show that the type of experiment determined the cells' encoding, such that in fixed-distance experiments distance-encoding cells dominated, while on fixed-time experiments time-encoding cells dominated. These results suggest that the cells' encoding contains a predictive element, dependent on the important variables of the experiment.

                Neuronal subnetworks are common features of adult cortical circuits and serve as functional units for information processing and encoding. To determine when neuronal subnetworks are established, we employed in vivo calcium imaging to monitor neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice during early postnatal development. We found several striking developmental trajectories: (1) neuronal activity frequencies and network synchrony were sex-dependent; (2) neuronal subnetworks merged as early as P11; (3) the number of neurons in a subnetwork decreases with increasing age; (4) subnetwork neurons are initially spatially segregated, but become intermingled with other subnetworks neurons with increasing age; (5) neurons within the same subnetwork acquire a more cohesive activity pattern as age increases, and (6) enhancing GABAergic activity at P15 acutely increased female but not male subnetwork coherence. Together, our findings demonstrate that P11-P21 is the critical time for subnetwork assembly and GABAergic inputs strengthen subnetwork coherence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult lifespan trajectories of neuromagnetic signals and interrelations with cortical thickness</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory power and phase synchronization map neuronal dynamics and are commonly studied to describe the healthy or diseased brain. Yet, little is known about the course of these features from early adulthood into old age. Leveraging magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting-state data in a cross-sectional adult sample (n = 350), we probed lifespan differences (18-88 years) in connectivity and power and interaction effects with sex. Building upon recent attempts to link structure and function in the brain, we tested the spatial correspondence of age effects on cortical thickness and those on functional networks and a direct relationship at the level of the study sample. We found MEG frequency-specific patterns for lower- and higher-order brain regions and divergence between sexes in low frequencies. Connectivity and power exhibited distinct linear trajectories with age or turning points at midlife. Variability in cortical thickness with age corresponded to those in neuromagnetic activity, particularly in delta and beta oscillations, and showed coupling in either unimodal or transmodal regions depending on the frequency. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive overview of the topographic functional profile of adulthood that can form a basis for neurocognitive and clinical investigations. This study further sheds new light on how the brain's structural architecture relates to fast oscillatory activity in large-scale networks.

                The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) integrates homeostatic processes and reward-motivated behaviors. Here we show that LHA neurons that produce melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are dynamically responsive to both food-directed appetitive and consummatory processes. Specifically, our results reveal that MCH neuron Ca+2 activity increases in response to both discrete and contextual food-predictive cues and is correlated with food-motivated responses. MCH neuron activity also increases during eating and this response is highly predictive of caloric consumption and declines throughout a meal, thus supporting a role for MCH neurons in the positive feedback consummatory process known as appetition. These physiological MCH neural responses are functionally-relevant as chemogenetic MCH neuron activation promotes appetitive behavioral responses to food-predictive cues and increases meal size. Finally, MCH neuron activation enhances preference for a noncaloric flavor paired with intragastric glucose. Collectively, these data identify a hypothalamic neural population that orchestrates both food-motivated appetitive and intake-promoting consummatory processes.

                Perturbations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes disrupt neural circuit dynamics and ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities. To understand how ASD-implicated genes influence network computation during behavior, we performed in vivo calcium imaging from hundreds of individual hippocampal CA1 neurons simultaneously in freely locomoting mice with total knockout of NEXMIF. NEXMIF is an ASD risk gene most highly expressed in the hippocampus, and NEXMIF knockout in mice creates a range of behavioral deficits, including impaired hippocampal-dependent memory. We found that NEXMIF knockout does not alter the overall excitability of individual neurons but exaggerates movement-mediated neuronal responses. At the network level, NEXMIF knockout creates over-synchronization of the CA1 circuit, quantified by pairwise correlation and network closeness centrality. These neuronal effects observed upon NEXMIF knockout highlight the network consequences of perturbations in ASD-implicated genes, which have broad implications for cognitive performance and other ASD-related behavioral disruptions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological correlates of associative recognition memory for identity, spatial, and temporal relations</a></h4>

              
                The formation of associative representations and their retrieval from episodic memory are vital cognitive functions. However, it is unclear to what extent retrieval of the basic component relations of episodic memory, identity, time, and space, requires different or shared brain mechanisms. In the current study, we employed EEG to track the time courses of electrophysiological correlates of retrieval processes of memory for identity relations, temporal order, and spatial configuration. Participants engaged in pair-associate learning of serially presented and spatially configured object picture pairs, followed by discrimination of identity, spatially, or temporally intact and rearranged pairs. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) revealed distinct patterns of activity during successful retrieval of identity, spatial, and temporal relations that differed by the status of association, across the three retrieval time windows examined (300-500, 500-800, and 800-1000 ms). The identity relations condition was distinguished by a widespread greater negative-going deflection for rearranged relative to intact pairs in all three time windows. For the temporal relations condition, we observed a widespread more negative-going deflection for rearranged than intact pairs, significant in the second time window only. For the spatial relations condition, there was a widespread positive-going deflection greater for rearranged than for intact pairs, significant in the early and in middle time windows. These patterns of activity suggest that retrieval of associative memory traces for identity, spatial, and temporal relationships involve dynamically different processes, which may partially rely on different sets of basic associative mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The matrisome of the murine and human dorsal root ganglion: a transcriptomal approach</a></h4>

              
                The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic structure composed of a large number of molecules that can be divided into six different categories and are collectively called the matrisome. The ECM plays pivotal roles in physiological and pathological processes in many tissues, including the nervous system. Intriguingly, alterations in ECM molecules/pathways are often associated with painful human conditions and murine experimental pain models. Nevertheless, mechanistic insight into the interplay of normal or defective ECM and pain is largely lacking. To expand the knowledge on ECM composition and synthesis in the peripheral nervous system, we used a transcriptomal approach to investigate the expression and cellular origin of matrisome genes in murine and human dorsal root ganglia (DRG), containing the cell bodies of sensory neurons. Bulk RNA sequencing data showed that over 60% of all matrisome genes were expressed in both murine and human DRG, with proportionally more core matrisome genes (glycoproteins, collagens, and proteoglycans) expressed compared to matrisome-associated genes (ECM-affiliated genes, ECM regulators and secreted factors). Examination of the cellular origin of matrisome expression by single cell RNA sequencing on murine DRG revealed that core matrisome genes, especially collagens, were expressed by vascular leptomeningeal-like (fibroblast) cell types whereas matrisome-associated genes were mainly expressed by neuronal cell types. We analyzed cell-cell communication networks with the CellChat R package and predicted an important role for the Collagen signaling pathway in connecting vascular cell types and nociceptors in murine tissue, which we confirmed by analysis of spatial transcriptomic data from human DRG. RNAscope in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of collagens in fibroblasts surrounding nociceptors in human DRG. This study supports the idea that the DRG matrisome may contribute to neuronal signaling in both mouse and human. The identification of the cellular distribution of murine and human matrisome genes provides a framework to study the role of the ECM in peripheral nervous tissue and its effects on pain signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction of amyloid β accumulation from multiple biomarkers using a hierarchical Bayesian model</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) in the brain is associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and can be an indicator of early disease progression. Thus, the non-invasively and inexpensively observable features related to A{beta} accumulation are promising biomarkers. However, in the experimental discovery of biomarkers in preclinical models, A{beta} and biomarker candidates are usually not observed in identical sample populations. This study established a hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts A{beta} accumulation level solely from biomarker candidates by integrating incomplete information. The model was applied to 5xFAD mouse behavioral experimental data. The predicted A{beta} accumulation level obeyed the observed amount of A{beta} when multiple features were used for learning and prediction. Based on the evaluation of predictability, the results suggest that the proposed model can contribute to discovering novel biomarkers, that is, multivariate biomarkers relevant to the accumulation state of abnormal proteins.

                Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neuromuscular disease with limited therapeutic options. Diagnostic and surrogate endpoint biomarkers are needed for early disease detection, clinical trial design, and personalized medicine. Methods: We tested the predictive power of a large set of primary skin fibroblast (n=443) from sporadic and familial ALS patients and healthy controls. We measured morphometric features of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and lysosomes by imaging with vital dyes. We also analysed immunofluorescence images of ALS-linked proteins, including TDP-43 and stress granule components. We studied fibroblasts under basal conditions and under metabolic (galactose medium), oxidative (arsenite), and heat stress conditions. We then employed machine learning (ML) techniques on the dataset to develop biomarkers. Results: Stress perturbations caused robust changes in the measured features, such as organellar morphology, stress granule formation, and TDP-43 mislocalization. ML approaches were able to predict the perturbation with near perfect performance (ROC-AUC > 0.99). However, when trying to predict disease state or disease groups (e.g., sporadic, or familial ALS), the performance of the ML algorithm was more modest (ROC-AUC Control vs ALS = 0.63). We also detected modest but significant scores when predicting clinical features, such as age of onset (ROC-AUC late vs early = 0.60). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the ML morphometry we developed can accurately predict if human fibroblasts are under stress, but the differences between ALS and controls, while statistically significant, are small and pose a challenge for the development of biomarkers for clinical use by these approaches.

                Cephalopod molluscs are growing in popularity and use as comparative models of complex brains and behaviors. Although the gross anatomy of their central and peripheral nervous systems have been well characterized for decades, there is still very limited information about the diversity of cell types in each ganglion or lobe, their arrangement or their network properties. Unlike more standard neuroscience models, there are limited tools available for cephalopods and few validated techniques for imaging neural activity. Here, live calcium imaging in a reduced preparation of the stellate ganglion and mantle tissue reveals mechanosensory afferents and interneurons, which are arranged somatotopically in the ganglion. Retrograde labeling from stellate nerves confirms that neurons sending axonal projections to distinct dermatomes are organized in roughly oblong clusters along the dorsal side of the ganglion. This is the first demonstration of afferent somatotopy in cephalopods, and the first direct visualization of mechanoreceptive and mechano-nociceptive neurons that fire in response to localized, firm touch on the body surface. The methods and findings in this study open multiple new lines of enquiry related to sensory processing in the cephalopod nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for an Intricate Relationship Between Express Visuomotor Responses, Postural Control and Rapid Step Initiation in the Lower Limbs</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has described express visuomotor responses (EVRs) on the upper limb. EVRs are directionally-tuned bursts of muscle activity that occur within 100 ms of visual stimulus appearance, facilitating rapid reaching. Rapid stepping responses are also important in daily life, and while there is evidence of EVR expression on lower limbs, it is unknown whether lower-limb EVRs are influenced by increased postural demands. Here, we investigate the interaction between stepping-related EVRs and anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) that typically precede step initiation. 16 healthy young subjects rapidly stepped towards visual targets presented in front of the left or right foot. We recorded bilateral surface EMG of gluteus medius (GM), a muscle involved in both APAs and stepping, and bilateral ground reaction forces. Two conditions were introduced: a lateral or medial stepping condition with reduced or increased postural demands, respectively. In the lateral stepping condition, EVRs were robustly and strongly present in stance-side GM, and ground reaction forces revealed the absence of APAs. Larger EVRs preceded shorter RTs, consistent with EVRs facilitating step initiation. In contrast, in the medial stepping condition, EVRs were largely absent, and ground reaction forces revealed the consistent presence of APAs. When occasionally present, EVRs in the medial stepping condition preceded larger APAs and longer RTs. Thus, while EVRs in lower limbs can facilitate rapid stepping, their expression is normally suppressed when postural stability is low. Failing to appropriately suppress EVRs in such situations disrupts postural stability, necessitating larger compensatory APAs and leading to longer stepping RTs.

                Brain networks supporting visual memory include extrastriate and other cortical regions associated with visual perception, which manifest domain-specific processing of "where," "how," and various aspects of "what" information. However, whether and how such specialization affects memory for these types of information is still a matter of debate. Functional neuroimaging studies point to dissociable as well as common network components supporting the perception and memory of different aspects of visual information. In the current neuropsychological study, we assess the impact of stroke lesion topography on recall of identity, location, and action of event participants, as assessed by the WMS-III Family Pictures subtest. We used voxel-based lesion-behavior mapping (VLBM) to identify brain lesions specifically implicated in memory deficits for each dimension. Behavioral analysis disclosed impaired performance by both right- and left-hemisphere damage patients, with lesions on each side yielding distinct effects. VLBM analysis revealed a bi-hemispheric network supporting these various aspects of visual memory. In the right hemisphere, the network includes frontal, parietal, and temporal cortical regions and the basal ganglia. In the left hemisphere, the network is more restricted, including visual association areas and medial temporal lobe regions. We further observed that a subset of these regions - those included in the ventral ("what") stream, and in the putative core recollection network - is implicated in multiple aspects of visual memory, whereas other areas are specifically implicated in memory for specific aspects of the visual scene.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective retrieval revealed by electroencephalographic (EEG) neural pattern reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                For past experiences to guide our actions we need to retrieve the relevant memories. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how a memory is selected for retrieval from a large store of mnemonic traces, and to evaluate how selection operates during the retrieval cascade. We analyzed data from two studies in which people studied objects in picture or auditory word formats, and later recalled them using either written words (Experiment 1, N=28) or line drawings (Experiment 2, N=28) as retrieval cues. We used multivariate decoding to quantify the reinstatement of study phase neural patterns when people successfully identified items that had been studied in the format currently designated as targets, versus non-targeted items. Neural reinstatement emerged by 500 ms post-stimulus, as did the established left parietal event-related potential (ERP) signature of recollection. Reinstatement was also target-selective (greater for targets than non-targets) when test cues overlapped more with targets, as had previously been shown for the left parietal ERP (Moccia and Morcom, 2021). In contrast, when cues overlapped more with non-targets, neural reinstatement was non-selective or reversed, unlike the left parietal ERP. We also tested for goal-directed reinstatement prior to retrieval cues, hypothesized to drive selection. When words were cues there was strong evidence of this proactive reinstatement, but it was not detected when pictures were cues. Together, the data suggest that selection can act at multiple stages of recovery of a memory and depends on both external cues and goal-directed control. Keywords: Episodic memory, Recollection, EEG, Neural Pattern Reinstatement, Pre-retrieval Control

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanotransduction events at the physiological site of touch detection</a></h4>

              
                Afferents of peripheral mechanoreceptors innervate the skin of vertebrates, where they detect physical touch via mechanically gated ion channels (mechanotransducers). While the afferent terminal is generally understood to be the primary site of mechanotransduction, the functional properties of mechanically activated (MA) ionic current generated by mechanotransducers at this location remain obscure. Here, we report patch-clamp recordings from the afferent terminal innervating Grandry (Meissner) corpuscles in the bill skin of a tactile specialist duck. We show that mechanical stimulation evokes MA current in the afferent with fast kinetics of activation and inactivation during the dynamic phases of the mechanical stimulus. These responses trigger rapidly adapting firing in the afferent detected at the terminal and in the afferent fiber outside of the corpuscle. Our findings elucidate the initial electrogenic events of touch detection in the mechanoreceptor nerve terminal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High Angular Resolution Susceptibility Imaging and Estimation of Fiber Orientation Distribution Functions in Primate Brain</a></h4>

              
                Uncovering brain-tissue microstructure including axonal characteristics is a major neuroimaging research focus. Within this scope, anisotropic properties of magnetic susceptibility in white matter have been successfully employed to estimate primary axonal trajectories using mono-tensorial models. However, anisotropic susceptibility has not yet been considered for modeling more complex fiber structures within a voxel, such as intersecting bundles, or an estimation of orientation distribution functions (ODFs). This information is routinely obtained by high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) techniques. In applications to fixed tissue, however, diffusion-weighted imaging suffers from an inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial resolution, leading to high demands on the performance of the gradient system in order to mitigate these limitations. In the current work, high angular resolution susceptibility imaging (HARSI) is proposed as a novel, phase-based methodology to estimate ODFs. A multiple gradient-echo dataset was acquired in an entire fixed chimpanzee brain at 61 orientations by reorienting the specimen in the magnetic field. The constant solid angle method was adapted for estimating phase-based ODFs. HARDI data were also acquired for comparison. HARSI yielded information on whole-brain fiber architecture, including identification of peaks of multiple bundles that resembled features of the HARDI results. Distinct differences between both methods suggest that susceptibility properties may offer complementary microstructural information. These proof-of-concept results indicate a potential to study the axonal organization in post-mortem primate and human brain at high resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory Brainstem Response as an Objective Measure of Temporal Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Background and Aims: Temporal resolution is assessed using behavioral tests, which are highly affected by extraneous variables. We explored the relationship between behavioral Across-Channel Gap Detection Threshold (AC GDT) and different temporal parameters of an objective measure, Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), to account for the extraneous variables. Settings and Design: We conducted an experimental study on thirty native Kannada-speaking adults with normal hearing sensitivity in the age range of 18-25 years. Materials and Methods: We estimated the Gap detection threshold (GDT) using an across-channel (AC) paradigm, and Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) was recorded at 80 dBnHL for three repetition rates of 11.1, 30.1, and 90.1/sec. Statistical Analyses used: Normality testing, the Friedman test, post-hoc analysis by Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, along with descriptive statistics was performed using SPSS v20 (IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences, New York, USA). Results: The results showed a significant positive correlation between AC GDT scores and latency of wave I for the repetition rates of 11.1 and 30.1/sec and latency of wave V at 30.1 and 90.1/sec. There was a negative correlation (but not significant) between AC GDT scores and the slope of wave V across the repetition rates. Conclusions: The results suggest a relationship between the behavioral and electrophysiological measures of temporal processing. Measuring the latency of wave I and wave V of ABR would give an estimate of their AC GDT scores, especially in difficult-to-test populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptopodin-associated ribosomal hubs regulate lesion-induced homeostatic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neurological diseases can lead to the denervation of brain regions caused by demyelination, traumatic injury or cell death. Nevertheless, the molecular and structural mechanisms underlying the lesion-induced reorganization of denervated brain regions are a matter of ongoing investigation. In order to address this issue, we performed an entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL) in organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures and studied denervation-induced homeostatic plasticity of mossy fiber synapses, which connect dentate granule cells with CA3 pyramidal neurons and play important roles in spatial learning. Partial denervation caused a homeostatic strengthening of excitatory neurotransmission in dentate granule cells (GC), in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and their direct synaptic connections as revealed by paired recordings (GC-to-CA3). These functional changes were accompanied by ultrastructural reorganization of mossy fiber synapses, which regularly contain the plasticity-related protein synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle. We demonstrate that the spine apparatus organelle and its associated protein synaptopodin assemble ribosomes in close proximity to synaptic sites and moreover we unravel synaptopodin-related transcriptome, which can be linked to the expression of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Notably, synaptopodin-deficient tissue preparations that lack the spine apparatus organelle, failed to express homeostatic adjustments of both excitatory neurotransmission and the region-specific transcriptome. Hence, synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle form local protein synthesis hubs that are essential for mediating lesion-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain signatures of chronic gut inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Gut inflammation is thought to modify brain activity and behaviour via modulation of the gut-brain axis. However, how relapsing and remitting exposure to peripheral inflammation over the natural history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) contributes to altered brain dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to characterise changes in spontaneous spatiotemporal brain states in Crohns Disease (CD) (n = 40) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) (n = 30), compared to healthy individuals (n = 28). We first provide evidence of a significantly perturbed and heterogeneous microbial profile in CD, consistent with previous work showing enduring and long-standing dysbiosis in clinical remission. Results from our brain state assessment show that CD and UC exhibit alterations in the temporal properties of states implicating default-mode network, parietal, and visual regions, reflecting a shift in the predominance from externally to internally-oriented attentional modes. We investigated these dynamics at a finer sub-network resolution, showing a CD-specific and highly selective enhancement of connectivity between the insula and mPFC, regions implicated in cognitive-interoceptive appraisal mechanisms. Alongside overall higher anxiety scores in CD, we also provide preliminary support to suggest that the strength of chronic interoceptive hyper-signalling in the brain co-occurs with disease duration. Together, our results demonstrate that a long-standing diagnosis of CD is, in itself, a key factor in determining the risk of developing altered brain network signatures.

	<p>Migraine, as the seventh most disabling neurological disease with 26.9% prevalence in Saudi females, lacks studies on identifying associated genes and pathways with migraines in the Arab population. This case control study aims to identify the migraine-associated novel genes and risk variants. More than 1900 Arab ancestry young female college students were screened: 103 fulfilled the ICHD-3 criteria for migraine and 20 cases confirmed in the neurology clinic were included for the study with age-matched healthy controls. DNA from blood samples were subjected to paired-end whole-exome sequencing. After quality control, 3365343 missense, frameshift, missense splice region variants and insertion&amp;amp;ndash;deletion (indels) polymorphisms were tested for association with migraine. Significant variants were validated using Sanger sequencing. A total of 17 (p-value 9.091 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;05) functional variants in 12 genes (RETNLB, SCAI, ADH4, ESPL1, CPT2, FLG, PPP4R1, SERPINB5, ZNF66, ETAA1, EXO1 and CPA6) were associated with higher migraine risk, including a stop-gained frameshift (-13-14*SX) variant in the gene RETNLB (rs5851607; p-value 3.446 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;06). Gene analysis revealed that half of the significant novel migraine risk genes were expressed in the temporal lobe (p-value 0.0058) of the cerebral cortex. This is the first study exploring the migraine risk of 17 functional variants in 12 genes among Saudi female migraineurs of Arab ancestry using whole-exome sequencing. Half of the significant genes were expressed in the temporal lobe, which expands migraine pathophysiology and early identification using biomarkers for research possibilities on personalised genetics.</p>

	<p>Angiogenic factors play an important role in protecting, repairing, and reconstructing vessels after ischemic stroke. In the brains of transient focal cerebral ischemic mice, we observed a reduction in infarct volume after the administration of Angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2), but whether this process is promoted by Angpt2-induced angiogenesis has not been fully elaborated. Therefore, this study explored the angiogenic activities, in reference to CD34 which is a marker of activated ECs and blood vessels, of cultured ECs in vitro and in ischemic damaged cerebral area in mice following Angpt2 administration. Our results demonstrate that Angpt2 administration (100 ng/mL) is neuroprotective by significantly increasing the CD34 expression in in vitro-cultured ECs, reducing the infarct volume and mitigating neuronal loss, as well as enhancing CD34+ vascular length and area. In conclusion, these results indicate that Angpt2 promotes repair and attenuates ischemic injury, and that the mechanism of this is closely associated with angiogenesis in the brain after stroke.</p>

	<p>ASD consists of a set of permanent neurodevelopmental conditions, which are studded with social and communication differences, limited interests, and repetitive behaviors. Individuals with ASD have difficulty reading eye gestures and expressions, and may also have stereotyped or repetitive language, excessive adherence to routines, fixed interests, and rigid thinking. However, sexuality in adolescents and young adults with ASD is still a poorly studied and neglected issue. This review aims to evaluate sexual function and behavior in individuals with ASD to foster a greater understanding of this important, although often overlooked, issue. This review was conducted by searching peer-reviewed articles published between 01 June 2000 and 31 May 2022 using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database, and Web of Science. A comprehensive search was conducted using the terms: &amp;amp;ldquo;Autism&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;ASD&amp;amp;rdquo; AND &amp;amp;ldquo;Sexuality&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;Romantic relation&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;sexual behavior&amp;amp;rdquo; AND/OR &amp;amp;ldquo;sexual awareness&amp;amp;rdquo;. After an accurate revision of 214 full manuscripts, 11 articles satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review found that, although individuals with ASD may have sexual functioning, their sexuality is characterized by higher prevalence rates of gender dysphoria and inappropriate sexual behavior. Furthermore, sexual awareness is reduced in this patient population, and the prevalence of other variants of sexual orientation (i.e., homosexuality, asexuality, bisexuality, etc.) is higher in adolescents with ASD than in non-autistic peers. Sexual health and education should be included in the care path of patients with ASD in order to improve their quality of life and avoid/reduce inappropriate and risky behaviors.</p>

	<p>Glioblastomas are incurable primary brain tumors harboring a heterogeneous landscape of genetic and metabolic alterations. Longitudinal imaging by MRI and [18F]FET-PET measurements enable us to visualize the features of evolving tumors in a dynamic manner. Yet, close-meshed longitudinal imaging time points for characterizing temporal and spatial metabolic alterations during tumor evolution in patients is not feasible because patients usually present with already established tumors. The replication-competent avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (RCAS)/tumor virus receptor-A (tva) system is a powerful preclinical glioma model offering a high grade of spatial and temporal control of somatic gene delivery in vivo. Consequently, here, we aimed at using MRI and [18F]FET-PET to identify typical neuroimaging characteristics of the platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB)-driven glioma model using the RCAS-tva system. Our study showed that this preclinical glioma model displays MRI and [18F]FET-PET features that highly resemble the corresponding established human disease, emphasizing the high translational relevance of this experimental model. Furthermore, our investigations unravel exponential growth dynamics and a model-specific tumor microenvironment, as assessed by histology and immunochemistry. Taken together, our study provides further insights into this preclinical model and advocates for the imaging-stratified design of preclinical therapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>In recent years, there has been a growing body of literature highlighting the relationship between presbycusis and consequences in areas other than hearing. In particular, presbycusis is linked to depression, dementia, and cognitive decline. Among this literature, the effect of hearing aids, currently the most common method of treating presbycusis, is also a growing research topic. This pilot study aims to explore the effects of hearing aids on the cognitive and multisensory consequences of presbycusis. To that purpose, saccades and vergences eye movements were studied, towards visual and audiovisual targets, of a presbycusis population wearing hearing aids for an average of two years. These measurements were done whether or not participants were wearing their hearing aids. Eye-movement characteristics, particularly latencies (the reaction time taken to initiate an eye movement), allows one to measure attentional and multisensory characteristics. Previous studies showed that presbycusis was linked with an increase of saccade latencies and an improvement in audiovisual interaction capacities, i.e., latencies for audiovisual targets are shorter than those for visual targets. Eye movements are measured and analyzed with REMOBI and AIDEAL technologies. Results show a shortening, with hearing aids, of right saccade latencies to visual targets, suggesting an increase in attention and/or engagement. Yet, saccade latencies are not shorter for audiovisual vs. visual targets alone, neither when wearing hearing aids, nor without. Moreover, convergence latencies are particularly slow for any type of target and with or without hearing aids. The results suggest deficits for audiovisual interactions and the initiation of convergences in that population. These deficits could be part of the factors triggering the need to wear hearing aids. These results therefore show interesting relationships between hearing-aid wearing in a presbycusis population and oculomotricity and invite further research in this area.</p>

<p>The main objective of this work was to obtain detailed information on the distribution and localization of the spexin (Spx) system in the sea bass brain. To this purpose, we first identified and characterized the <i>spx1</i> gene and analyzed its expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of the European sea bass by using quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Then, we mapped the Spx1 system by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against mammalian SPX, and finally we determined its interaction with other reproductive-related neuroendocrine systems by using double immunohistochemistry and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih), prepro-gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gnrh1), -(Gnrh2) and -(Gnrh3) antisera. The results obtained suggest that Spx1 could be involved in both reproductive and nonreproductive (i.e., food intake, behavior) functions in sea bass.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spexin (Spx) is a recently characterized neuropeptide implicated in multiple physiological processes in vertebrates, including reproduction, food intake, and regulation of anxiety and stress. Two orthologs (Spx1 and Spx2) are present in some nonmammalian vertebrates, including teleosts. However, information on the distribution of Spx in the brain and its interactions with other neuroendocrine systems in fish is still scarce. In this work, we cloned and sequenced the sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) Spx1, which included a 27 aa signal peptide and a mature peptide of 14 aa that is C-terminal amidated. <i>spx1</i> transcripts were higher in the diencephalon/caudal preoptic area/hypothalamus and medulla but were also detected in the olfactory bulbs, telencephalon/rostral preoptic area, optic tectum/tegmentum, cerebellum/pons, and pituitary. The immunohistochemical study revealed Spx1-immunoreactive (ir) cells in different nuclei of the preoptic area, habenula, prethalamus, mesencephalic tegmentum and in the proximal <i>pars distalis</i> (PPD) and <i>pars intermedia</i> of the pituitary. Spx1-ir fibers were widely distributed throughout the brain being particularly abundant in the midbrain and hindbrain, in close contact with tegmental gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 (Gnrh2) cells and isthmic gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih) cells of the secondary gustatory nucleus. Moreover, Gnih fibers were observed innervating Spx1-ir cells lying in several subdivisions of the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and in the lateral nucleus of the valvula, whereas ventrolateral prethalamic Spx1-ir cells received immunopositive Gnrh2 fibers. In the pituitary, Gnrh1-ir fibers were observed closely associated with Spx1-ir cells of the PPD. These results suggest that Spx1 could be involved in both reproductive and nonreproductive (i.e., food intake, behavior) functions in sea bass.</p>

                Sensory difficulties represent a crucial issue in the life of autistic individuals. The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders describes both hyper- and hypo-responsiveness to sensory stimulation as a criterion for the diagnosis autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Among the sensory domain affected in ASD, altered responses to tactile stimulation represent the most commonly reported sensory deficits. Although tactile abnormalities have been reported in monogenic cohorts of patients and genetic mouse models of ASD, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Traditionally, autism research has focused on the central nervous system as the target to infer the neurobiological bases of such tactile abnormalities. Nonetheless, the peripheral nervous system represents the initial site of processing of sensory information and a potential site of dysfunction in the sensory cascade. Here we investigated the gene expression deregulation in the trigeminal ganglion (which directly receives tactile information from whiskers) in two genetic models of syndromic autism (Shank3b and Cntnap2 mutant mice) at both adult and juvenile ages. We found several neuronal and non-neuronal markers involved in inhibitory, excitatory, neuroinflammatory and sensory neurotransmission to be differentially regulated within the trigeminal ganglia of both adult and juvenile Shank3b and Cntnap2 mutant mice. These results may help in entangling the multifaced complexity of sensory abnormalities in autism and open avenues for the development of peripherally targeted treatments for tactile sensory deficits exhibited in ASD.

	<p>A specific interpretation of embodiment assigns a central role to the body representations (BR) in cognition. In the social cognition domain, BR could be pivotal in representing others&amp;amp;rsquo; actions and states. However, empirical evidence on the relationship between different BR and social cognition, in terms of Theory of Mind (ToM), in the same sample of participants is missing. Here, this relationship was explored considering individual differences in the action-oriented BR (aBR), nonaction-oriented BR (NaBR), and subjective predisposition toward internal bodily sensations (interoceptive sensibility, ISe). Eighty-two healthy adults were given behavioral measures probing aBR, NaBR, ISe, and affective/cognitive ToM. The results suggest that NaBR, which mainly relies on exteroceptive signals, predicts individual differences in cognitive ToM, possibly because it can allow differentiating between the self and others. Instead, the negative association between affective ToM and ISe suggests that an alteration of the internal body state representation (i.e., over-reporting interoceptive sensations) can affect emotional processing in social contexts. The finding that distinct aspects of the body processing from within (ISe) and from the outside (NaBR) differently contribute to ToM provides empirical support to the BR role in social cognition and can be relevant for developing interventions in clinical settings.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Apart from Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), no biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of dementia have been established to date. Inflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia subtypes, e.g., AD or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In the context of cancer or cardiovascular diseases, white blood cell (WBC) populations and platelet counts, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), have emerged as biomarkers. Their clinical relevance in dementia, however, is currently only insufficiently investigated. In the present study, hematological and inflammatory parameters were measured in the peripheral blood of 97 patients admitted to the gerontopsychiatric ward of Hannover Medical School, a university hospital in Germany, for dementia assessment. The study population comprised 20 non-demented, depressed patients (control group) and 77 demented patients who were assigned to five different groups based on their underlying dementia etiology: AD, n = 33; vascular dementia, n = 12; mixed dementia, n = 21; FTD, n = 5; and Korsakoff syndrome, n = 6. We observed neither statistically significant differences regarding total WBC populations, platelet counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, nor CRP levels between the control group and the five dementia groups. CRP levels tended to be higher in patients with Korsakoff syndrome than in the control group and in AD patients. Thus, CRP could possibly play a role in the differential diagnosis of dementia. This should be investigated further in future prospective studies with larger sample sizes. WBC and platelet counts, by contrast, do not appear to be suitable biomarkers in the differential diagnosis of dementia.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks cause intracranial hypotension (SIH) and also may cause infratentorial superficial siderosis (iSS) but the rate of development among different CSF leak types and outcome of treatment are not known. We determined the time interval from SIH onset to iSS and the outcome of treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 1,589 patients with SIH underwent neuroimaging and iSS was detected in 57 (23 men and 34 women, mean age = 41.3 years [3.6%]). We examined the type of underlying CSF leak by various imaging modalities. Percutaneous and surgical procedures were used to treat the CSF leaks.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The iSS was detected in 46 (10.3%) of 447 patients with ventral CSF leaks, in 2 (3.9%) of 51 patients with dural ectasia, in 5 (2.6%) of 194 patients with CSF-venous fistulas, in 4 (0.9%) of 457 patients with simple meningeal diverticula, and in none of the 101 patients with lateral CSF leaks or the 339 patients with leaks of indeterminate origin (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The estimated median latency period from SIH onset to iSS was 126 months. Ventral CSF leaks could not be eliminated with percutaneous procedures in any patient and surgical repair was associated with low risk (&lt;5%) and resulted in resolution of the CSF leak in all patients in whom the exact site of the CSF leak could be determined. Other types of CSF leak were treated with percutaneous or surgical procedures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The iSS can develop in most types of spinal CSF leak, including CSF-venous fistulas, but mainly in chronic ventral CSF leaks, which require surgical repair. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore longitudinal changes in brain volumetric measures and retinal layer thicknesses following acute optic neuritis (AON) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), to investigate the process of trans-synaptic degeneration, and determine its clinical relevance.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>PwMS were recruited within 40 days of AON onset (n = 49), and underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging followed by longitudinal tracking for up to 5 years. A comparator cohort of PwMS without a recent episode of AON were similarly tracked (n = 73). Mixed-effects linear regression models were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accelerated atrophy of the occipital gray matter (GM), calcarine GM, and thalamus was seen in the AON cohort, as compared with the non-AON cohort (−0.76% vs −0.22% per year [<i>p</i> = 0.01] for occipital GM, −1.83% vs −0.32% per year [<i>p</i> = 0.008] for calcarine GM, −1.17% vs −0.67% per year [<i>p</i> = 0.02] for thalamus), whereas rates of whole-brain, cortical GM, non-occipital cortical GM atrophy, and T2 lesion accumulation did not differ significantly between the cohorts. In the AON cohort, greater AON-induced reduction in ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thickness over the first year was associated with faster rates of whole-brain (r = 0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.04), white matter (r = 0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and thalamic (r = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.02) atrophy over the study period. Significant relationships were identified between faster atrophy of the subcortical GM and thalamus, with worse visual function outcomes after AON.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide <i>in-vivo</i> evidence for anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration following AON in PwMS, and suggest that trans-synaptic degeneration may be related to clinically-relevant visual outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau<sub>181</sub>) is reliably elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but less explored is its specificity relative to other neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we find novel evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative condition typically lacking tau pathology. We performed a detailed evaluation to identify the clinical correlates of elevated p-tau<sub>181</sub> in ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were clinically or pathologically diagnosed with ALS (n = 130) or AD (n = 79), or were healthy non-impaired controls (n = 26). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed and area under the curve (AUC) was used to discriminate AD from ALS. Within ALS, Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests compared analytes by presence/absence of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs. Spearman correlations tested associations between plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> and postmortem neuron loss.</p>

<p>A Wilcoxon test showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was higher in ALS than controls (<i>W</i> = 2,600, <i>p</i> = 0.000015), and ROC analyses showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> poorly discriminated AD and ALS (AUC = 0.60). In ALS, elevated plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with LMN signs in cervical (<i>W</i> = 827, <i>p</i> = 0.0072), thoracic (<i>W</i> = 469, <i>p</i> = 0.00025), and lumbosacral regions (<i>W</i> = 851, <i>p</i> = 0.0000029). In support of LMN findings, plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with neuron loss in the spinal cord (rho = 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.017), but not in the motor cortex (<i>p</i> = 0.41). Cerebrospinal spinal fluid p-tau<sub>181</sub> and plasma neurofilament light chain were included as reference analytes, and demonstrate specificity of findings.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found strong evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in ALS and may be a novel marker specific to LMN dysfunction. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:807–818</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau Mediates Synergistic Influence of Vascular Risk and Aβ on Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk and beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden have been synergistically associated with cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation mediates the vascular risk-Aβ interaction on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 175 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age 70.5 ± 8.0 years). Baseline vascular risk was quantified using the office-based Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease risk score (FHS-CVD). Baseline Aβ burden was measured with Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography (PET). Tau burden was measured longitudinally (3.6 ± 1.5 years) with Flortaucipir PET, focusing on inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Cognition was assessed longitudinally (7.0 ± 2.0 years) using the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Linear mixed effects models examined the interactive effects of baseline vascular risk and Aβ on longitudinal ITC tau. Additionally, moderated mediation was used to determine whether tau accumulation mediated the FHS-CVD*Aβ effect on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between elevated baseline FHS-CVD and Aβ on greater ITC tau accumulation (<i>p</i> = 0.004), even in individuals with Aβ burden below the conventional threshold for amyloid positivity. Examining individual vascular risk factors, we found elevated systolic blood pressure and body mass index showed independent interactions with Aβ on longitudinal tau (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). ITC tau accumulation mediated 33% of the interactive association of FHS-CVD and Aβ on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Vascular risks interact with subthreshold levels of Aβ to promote cognitive decline, partially by accelerating early neocortical tau accumulation. Our findings support vascular risk reduction, especially treating hypertension and obesity, to attenuate Aβ-related tau pathology and reduce late-life cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Network Effects of Brain Lesions Causing Central Poststroke Pain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to test whether lesions causing central poststroke pain (CPSP) are associated with a specific connectivity profile, whether these connections are associated with metabolic changes, and whether this network aligns with neuromodulation targets for pain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two independent lesion datasets were utilized: (1) subcortical lesions from published case reports and (2) thalamic lesions with metabolic imaging using 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography. Functional connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was assessed using a normative connectome (n = 1,000), and connections specific to CPSP were identified. Metabolic changes specific to CPSP were also identified and related to differences in lesion connectivity. Therapeutic relevance of the network was explored by testing for alignment with existing brain stimulation data and by prospectively targeting the network with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 7 patients with CPSP.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Lesion locations causing CPSP showed a specific pattern of brain connectivity that was consistent across two independent lesion datasets (spatial <i>r</i> = 0.82, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Connectivity differences were correlated with postlesion metabolism (<i>r</i> = −0.48, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The topography of this lesion-based pain network aligned with variability in pain improvement across 12 prior neuromodulation targets and across 32 patients who received rTMS to primary motor cortex (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Prospectively targeting this network with rTMS improved CPSP in 6 of 7 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lesions causing pain are connected to a specific brain network that shows metabolic abnormalities and promise as a neuromodulation target. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:834–845</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Brain Connectivity Predicts Chronic Pain in Acute Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Previous studies have established the role of the cortico-mesolimbic and descending pain modulation systems in chronic pain prediction. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an acute pain model where chronic pain is prevalent and complicated for prediction. In this study, we set out to study whether functional connectivity (FC) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is predictive of pain chronification in early-acute mTBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To estimate FC, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of 105 participants with mTBI following a motor vehicle collision was acquired within 72 hours post-accident. Participants were classified according to pain ratings provided at 12-months post-collision into chronic pain (head/neck pain ≥30/100, n = 44) and recovery (n = 61) groups, and their FC maps were compared.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The chronic pain group exhibited reduced negative FC between NAc and a region within the primary motor cortex corresponding with the expected representation of the area of injury. A complementary pattern was also demonstrated between PAG and the primary somatosensory cortex. PAG and NAc also shared increased FC to the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) within the recovery group. Brain connectivity further shows high classification accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = .86) for future chronic pain, when combined with an acute pain intensity report.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FC features obtained shortly after mTBI predict its transition to long-term chronic pain, and may reflect an underlying interaction of injury-related primary sensorimotor cortical areas with the mesolimbic and pain modulation systems. Our findings indicate a potential predictive biomarker and highlight targets for future early preventive interventions. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:819–833</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition in which genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to its etiology. Remarkable progress has been made in deciphering disease etiology through genetic approaches, but there is limited data about how environmental and genetic factors interact to modify penetrance, risk, and disease severity. Here, we provide insights into environmental modifiers of PD, discussing precedents from other neurological and non-neurological conditions. Based on these examples, we outline genetic and environmental factors contributing to PD and review potential environmental modifiers of penetrance and clinical variability in monogenic and idiopathic PD. We also highlight the potential challenges and propose how future studies might tackle these important questions. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:715–724</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Microglial Activation and Connectivity in Alzheimer Disease and Aging</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, but increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation also plays a key role, driven by the activation of microglia. Aβ and tau pathology appear to spread along pathways of highly connected brain regions, but it remains elusive whether microglial activation follows a similar distribution pattern. Here, we assess whether connectivity is associated with microglia activation patterns.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 32 Aβ-positive early AD subjects (18 women, 14 men) and 18 Aβ-negative age-matched healthy controls (10 women, 8 men) from the prospective ActiGliA (Activity of Cerebral Networks, Amyloid and Microglia in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease) study. All participants underwent microglial activation positron emission tomography (PET) with the third-generation mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure resting-state functional and structural connectivity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that inter-regional covariance in TSPO-PET and standardized uptake value ratio was preferentially distributed along functionally highly connected brain regions, with MRI structural connectivity showing a weaker association with microglial activation. AD patients showed increased TSPO-PET tracer uptake bilaterally in the anterior medial temporal lobe compared to controls, and higher TSPO-PET uptake was associated with cognitive impairment and dementia severity in a disease stage-dependent manner.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Microglial activation distributes preferentially along highly connected brain regions, similar to tau pathology. These findings support the important role of microglia in neurodegeneration, and we speculate that pathology spreads throughout the brain along vulnerable connectivity pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Antibody Response to HML‐2 May Be Protective in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Reactivation of HERV-K(HML-2) has been found in subsets of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This study examines the antibody response against HML-2 in ALS and analyzes its clinical relevance.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Antibodies to HML-2 envelope (env) were analyzed using a peptide array for epitope mapping and by a peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 242 healthy donors, and 243 ALS and 85 multiple sclerosis (MS) individuals. Extracellular levels of HML-2 were analyzed by digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Antibodies in the sera of ALS individuals recognized more HML-2 env peptides compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). ALS individuals had higher levels of HML-2 than healthy donors (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and higher antibody levels against a select HML-2 env peptide compared to healthy donors or individuals with multiple sclerosis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). 55.14% of ALS compared to 21.16% of healthy donors and 13.10% of MS individuals had antibodies against the HML-2 peptide (AUC = 0.769, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Levels of extracellular HML-2 DNA in serum (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and the number of HML-2 env peptides recognized by ALS sera (<i>p</i> = 0.02) correlated with disease duration. Among ALS individuals, lower levels of HML-2 antibodies were associated with a definite diagnosis per EL Escorial criteria (<i>p</i> = 0.03), and with a lower predicted (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and observed survival (<i>p</i> = 0.03).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There is a differential antibody response against specific epitopes of HML-2 env in ALS and controls, suggesting epitope spreading, likely due to persistent antigenic exposure following reactivation of the viral genes. Low levels of antibodies to HML-2 env in ALS are associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival probability. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:782–792</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative neurological disorder with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the potential biomarkers implicated in the occurrence and progression of AD prior to clinical testing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We selected 119 unique blood metabolites from 3 metabolome genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with 147,827 European participants. Summary data about AD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis with 63,926 European individuals from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. MR analyses were performed to assess the associations of blood metabolites with AD, and a phenome-wide MR analysis was further applied to ascertain the potential on-target side effects of metabolite interventions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four metabolites were identified as causal mediators for AD, including epiandrosterone sulfate (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51–0.71; <i>p</i> = 6.14 × 10<sup>−9</sup>), 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate (OR per SD increase: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57–0.84; <i>p</i> = 1.98 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), sphingomyelin (OR per SD increase: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.78–3.59; <i>p</i> = 2.10 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), and glutamine (OR per SD increase: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77–0.89; <i>p</i> = 2.09 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Phenome-wide MR analysis showed that epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate and sphingomyelin mediated the risk of multiple diseases, and glutamine had beneficial effects on the risk of 4 diseases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted increased epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate, and glutamine might be associated with a decreased risk of AD, while sphingomyelin was associated with an increased risk. Side-effect profiles were characterized to help inform drug target prioritization, and glutamine might be a promising target for the prevention and treatment of AD with no predicted detrimental side effects.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) exon 45–55 deletion (del45–55) has been postulated as a model that could treat up to 60% of DMD patients, but the associated clinical variability and complications require clarification. We aimed to understand the phenotypes and potential modifying factors of this dystrophinopathy subset.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study applied clinical and functional evaluation. Next generation sequencing was employed to identify intronic breakpoints and their impact on the <i>Dp140</i> promotor, intronic long noncoding RNA, and regulatory splicing sequences. DMD modifiers (<i>SPP1, LTBP4, ACTN3</i>) and concomitant mutations were also assessed. Haplotypes were built using <i>DMD</i> single nucleotide polymorphisms. Dystrophin expression was evaluated via immunostaining, Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and droplet digital PCR in 9 muscle biopsies.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The series comprised 57 subjects (23 index) expressing Becker phenotype (28%), isolated cardiopathy (19%), and asymptomatic features (53%). Cognitive impairment occurred in 90% of children. Patients were classified according to 10 distinct index-case breakpoints; 4 of them were recurrent due to founder events. A specific breakpoint (D5) was associated with severity, but no significant effect was appreciated due to the changes in intronic sequences. All biopsies showed dystrophin expression of &gt;67% and traces of alternative del45–57 transcript that were not deemed pathogenically relevant. Only the <i>LTBP4</i> haplotype appeared associated the presence of cardiopathy among the explored extragenic factors.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We confirmed that del45–55 segregates a high proportion of benign phenotypes, severe cases, and isolated cardiac and cognitive presentations. Although some influence of the intronic breakpoint position and the <i>LTBP4</i> modifier may exist, the pathomechanisms responsible for the phenotypic variability remain largely unresolved.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed (1) to analyze salivary calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels in patients with migraine, (2) to predict erenumab response from baseline CGRP levels, and (3) to evaluate CGRP change post-treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a prospective observational study that measured salivary CGRP levels in healthy controls (HCs), patients with episodic migraine (EM) and patients with chronic migraine (CM). Participants collected saliva samples at baseline and, the patients who were candidates to receive erenumab, also collected saliva after 3 doses of treatment. We quantified CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and we performed an analysis at baseline and post-treatment through generalized linear mixed models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, a higher headache frequency was associated with higher CGRP levels, those being even higher in the presence of depressive symptoms. A cutoff point (mean, 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 103.93 (95% CI = 103.35–104.51) pg/ml was estimated to differentiate migraine from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC, 95% CI) of 0.801 (95% CI = 0.798–0.804). We also found that higher pretreatment salivary CGRP levels were statistically significantly associated to a higher probability of having 50% or greater reduction in headache frequency in patients with EM, but not in patients with CM. After 12 weeks of treatment with erenumab, salivary CGRP levels from patients within all spectrum of migraine frequency converged to similar CGRP values. In contrast, in patients with concomitant depressive symptoms, this convergence did not happen.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with migraine not only have higher CGRP levels compared with HCs, but also the presence of depressive symptoms seems to increase salivary CGRP levels and we have evidence, for the first time, that baseline salivary CGRP concentration is associated with treatment response to erenumab.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate whether adjunct alteplase improves brain reperfusion following successful thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 36 patients (mean [standard deviation] = 70.8 [13.5] years old, 18 [50%] women) with large vessel occlusion undergoing thrombectomy resulting in near-normal (expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [eTICI] b50/67/2c, n = 23, 64%) or normal angiographic reperfusion (eTICI 3, n = 13, 36%). Seventeen patients were randomized to intra-arterial alteplase (0.225mg/kg), and 19 received placebo. At 48 hours, patients had brain perfusion/diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-spectroscopy. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of patients with areas of hypoperfusion on MRI. Secondary outcomes were the infarct expansion ratio (final to initial infarction volume), and the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak relative to total creatine as a marker of neuronal integrity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The prevalence of hypoperfusion was 24% with intra-arterial alteplase, and 58% with placebo (adjusted odds ratio = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04–0.91, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Among 14 patients with final eTICI 3 scores, hypoperfusion was found in 1 of 7 (14%) in the alteplase group and 3 of 7 (43%) in the placebo group. Abnormal brain perfusion was associated with worse functional outcome at day 90. Alteplase significantly reduced the infarct expansion ratio compared with placebo (median [interquartile range (IQR)] = 0.7 [0.5–1.2] vs 3.2 [1.8–5.7], <i>p</i> = 0.01) and resulted in higher NAA peaks (median [IQR] = 1.13 [0.91–1.36] vs 1.00 [0.74–1.22], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There is a high prevalence of areas of hypoperfusion following thrombectomy despite successful reperfusion on angiography. Adjunct alteplase enhances brain reperfusion, which results in reduced expansion of the infarction and improved neuronal integrity. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:860–870</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">5‐Year Associations among Cerebral Arterial Pulsatility, Perivascular Space Dilation, and White Matter Lesions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>High cerebral arterial pulsatility index (PI), white matter lesions (WMLs), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVSs), and lacunar infarcts are common findings in the elderly population, and considered indicators of small vessel disease (SVD). Here, we investigate the potential temporal ordering among these variables, with emphasis on determining whether high PI is an early or delayed manifestation of SVD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a population-based cohort, 4D flow MRI data for cerebral arterial pulsatility was collected for 159 participants at baseline (age 64–68), and for 122 participants at follow-up 5 years later. Structural MRI was used for WML and PVS segmentation, and lacune identification. Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were used to model longitudinal changes testing for pairwise associations, and latent change score (LCS) models to model multiple relationships among variables simultaneously.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Longitudinal 5-year increases were found for WML, PVS, and PI. Cerebral arterial PI at baseline did not predict changes in WML or PVS volume. However, WML and PVS volume at baseline predicted 5-year increases in PI. This was shown for PI increases in relation to baseline WML and PVS volumes using LME models (R ≥ 0.24; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02 and R ≥ 0.23; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.03, respectively) and LCS models (β = 0.28; <i>p</i> = 0.015 and β = 0.28; <i>p</i> = 0.009, respectively). Lacunes at baseline were unrelated to PI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In healthy older adults, indicators of SVD are related in a lead–lag fashion, in which the expression of WML and PVS precedes increases in cerebral arterial PI. Hence, we propose that elevated PI is a relatively late manifestation, rather than a risk factor, for cerebral SVD. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:871–881</p>

                <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether  differential phosphorylation states of blood markers can identify patients with LRRK2 Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed phospho(P)-Ser-935-LRRK2 and P-Ser-473-AKT levels in peripheral blood cells from patients with G2019S <i>LRRK2</i>-associated PD (L2PD, n = 31), G2019S <i>LRRK2</i> non-manifesting carriers (L2NMC, n = 26), idiopathic PD (iPD, n = 25), and controls (n = 40, total n = 122). We found no differences at P-Ser-935-LRRK2 between groups but detected a specific increase of P-Ser-473-AKT levels in all G2019S carriers, either L2PD or L2NMC, absent in iPD. Although insensitive to LRRK2 inhibition, our study identifies P-Ser-473-AKT as an endogenous candidate biomarker for peripheral inflammation in G2019S carriers using accessible blood cells.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite a 90% reperfusion rate, only 50% of patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion-related acute ischemic stroke (LVO-AIS) have a functional recovery at 3 months. Parenchymal hematoma (PH) is a predictor of poor outcome after endovascular treatment (EVT). We aim to investigate the relationship between the delay from onset to reperfusion, the occurrence of PH, and functional outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) registry is an ongoing prospective observational study. Data were analyzed from the subgroup of patients who underwent a successful EVT defined by a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) score 2b-3. We assessed the factors associated with PH, (ie, PH1 or PH2 grade according to the European Collaborative Acute Stroke Study 2 (ECASS) classification of hemorrhagic transformation), then evaluated the relationships between PH, delay from onset to reperfusion, and functional recovery defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0–2.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We analyzed 2,919 patients with an LVO-related AIS who underwent a successful EVT. Overall, 13.3% of the participant experienced a PH. The rate of PH increased by 2.5% (95% CI 1.5%–3.6%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) for every additional hour of onset to reperfusion delay and was, by comparison with the other study patients, consistently associated with a lower rate of functional recovery 19.7% (95% CI 11.6%–27.7%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) irrespective of time from onset to reperfusion.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that PH rate is associated with the delay from onset to reperfusion and participates in the relationship between time to reperfusion and outcome. Time is Bleeding. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:882–887</p>

                <p>The first case of paralytic poliomyelitis in nearly a decade in the US was discovered in a 20-year-old unvaccinated man from Rockland County, New York, in July 2022, who developed acute flaccid myelitis. The isolated virus from stool sampling was found to be a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, derived from the oral polio vaccine. Since the discovery of this case, local wastewater surveillance has revealed evidence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in local counties, as well as in New York City, representing community transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, routine vaccination administration has declined globally, with increasing numbers of communities not vaccinated for poliovirus. Now, with evidence of local community transmission, the clinical implication for at-risk unvaccinated individuals is significant. Here, we review the epidemiological origin of this discovered strain of poliovirus, national and international methods of surveillance for poliovirus, and neurological features of poliovirus. We also highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in monitoring suspected cases, as well as the unique role neurologists might play in national and global poliomyelitis surveillance.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the characteristics of participants with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in a trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>142 DIAD mutation carriers received either gantenerumab SC (n = 52), solanezumab IV (n = 50), or placebo (n = 40). Participants underwent assessments with the Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®), neuropsychological testing, CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor ARIA. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated potential ARIA-related risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven participants developed ARIA-E, including 3 with mild symptoms. No ARIA-E was reported under solanezumab while gantenerumab was associated with ARIA-E compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 9.1, confidence interval [CI][1.2, 412.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.021). Under gantenerumab, <i>APOE-ɛ4</i> carriers were more likely to develop ARIA-E (OR = 5.0, CI[1.0, 30.4]; <i>p</i> = 0.055), as were individuals with microhemorrhage at baseline (OR = 13.7, CI[1.2, 163.2]; <i>p</i> = 0.039). No ARIA-E was observed at the initial 225 mg/month gantenerumab dose, and most cases were observed at doses &gt;675 mg. At first ARIA-E occurrence, all ARIA-E participants were amyloid-PET+, 60% were CDR &gt;0, 60% were past their estimated year to symptom onset, and 60% had also incident ARIA-H. Most ARIA-E radiologically resolved after dose adjustment and developing ARIA-E did not significantly increase odds of trial discontinuation. ARIA-E was more frequently observed in the occipital lobe (90%). ARIA-E severity was associated with age at time of ARIA-E.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In DIAD, solanezumab was not associated with ARIA. Gantenerumab dose over 225 mg increased ARIA-E risk, with additional risk for individuals <i>APOE-ɛ4(+)</i> or with microhemorrhage. ARIA-E was reversible on MRI in most cases, generally asymptomatic, without additional risk for trial discontinuation. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:729–744</p>

     alt="Mimicking partial to total placental insufficiency in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy"/>
<p>A new model of Partial+Full uterine ischemia mimicking the transition from partial to total placental abruption in humans was developed in rabbits. Similar neurobehavioral deficits but worse cell viability <i>ex vivo</i> were found in the new Partial+Full uterine ischemia model compared to the previous Full uterine ischemia model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>All placental abruptions begin as partial abruptions, which sometimes manifest as fetal bradycardia. The progression from partial to total abruption was mimicked by a new rabbit model of placental insufficiency, and we compared it, with sufficient statistical power, with the previous model mimicking total placental abruption. The previous model uses total uterine ischemia at E22 or E25 (70% or 79% term, respectively), in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits for 40 min (Full H-I). The new model, Partial+Full H-I, added a 30-min partial ischemia before the 40-min total ischemia. Fetuses were delivered either at E31.5 (full term) vaginally for neurobehavior testing, or by C-section at E25 for <i>ex vivo</i> brain cell viability evaluation. The onset of fetal bradycardia was within the first 2 min of either H-I protocol. There was no difference between Full H-I (<i>n</i> = 442 for E22, 312 for E25) and Partial+Full H-I (<i>n</i> = 154 and 80) groups in death or severely affected kits at E22 (76% vs. 79%) or at E25 (66% vs. 64%), or normal kits at E22 or E25, or any of the individual newborn neurobehavioral tests at any age. No sex differences were found. Partial+Full H-I (<i>n</i> = 6) showed less cell viability than Full H-I (<i>n</i> = 8) at 72-hr <i>ex vivo</i> in the brain regions studied. Partial+Full H-I insult produced similar cerebral palsy phenotype as our previous Full H-I model in a sufficiently powered study and may be more suitable for testing of potential neuroprotectants.</p>

     alt="How lung injury and therapeutic oxygen could alter white matter development"/>
<p>Here we review the literature to shed light on the possibility that high oxygen levels and/or lung injury, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, can lead to neurodevelopmental impairment. The literature is especially convincing that these factors affect the neurodevelopment of extremely preterm or very low birth weight infants. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Developmental brain injury describes a spectrum of neurological pathologies resulting from either antenatal or perinatal injury. This includes both cognitive and motor defects that affect patients for their entire lives. Developmental brain injury can be caused by a spectrum of conditions including stroke, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, and intracranial hemorrhage. Additional risk factors have been identified including very low birth weight, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) supplementation. In fact, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, an inflammatory disease associated with disrupted lung development, have been shown to have decreased cerebral white matter and decreased intracranial volumes. Thus, there appears to be a developmental link between the lung, O<sub>2</sub>, and the brain that leads to proper myelination. Here, we will discuss what is currently known about the link between O<sub>2</sub> and myelination and how scientists are exploring mechanisms through which supplemental O<sub>2</sub> and/or lung injury can affect brain development. Consideration of a link between the diseased lung and developing brain will allow clinicians to fine tune their approaches in managing preterm lung disease in order to optimize brain health.</p>

     alt="Neonatal administration of erythropoietin attenuates cognitive deficits in adult rats following placental insufficiency"/>
<p>In a transient systemic hypoxic-ischemic model of placental insufficiency, erythropoietin is found to have lasting, mitigating effects on the diminished cognitive flexibility and increased perseveration which are associated with encephalopathy of prematurity. Highly translatable testing, including novel object recognition and touchscreen-based visual discrimination and reversal learning, reveal significant differences post-treatment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Preterm birth is a principal cause of neurological disability later in life, including cognitive and behavioral deficits. Notably, cognitive impairment has greater impact on quality of life than physical disability. Survivors of preterm birth commonly have deficits of executive function. Difficulties with tasks and planning complexity correlate positively with increasing disability. To overcome these barriers for children born preterm, preclinical and clinical studies have emphasized the importance of neurorestoration. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a endogenous cytokine with multiple beneficial mechanisms of action following perinatal brain injury. While most preclinical investigations have focused on pathology and molecular mechanisms, translational studies of repair using clinically viable biobehavioral biomarkers are still lacking. Here, using an established model of encephalopathy of prematurity secondary to placental insufficiency, we tested the hypothesis that administration of EPO in the neonatal period would attenuate deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility in adult rats of both sexes. We assessed cognition and executive function in two ways. First, using the classic test of novel object recognition and second, using a touchscreen platform. Touchscreen testing allows for rigorous testing of cognition and executive function in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Data show that adult rats exhibit deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility following <i>in utero</i> placental insufficiency. Notably, neonatal treatment of EPO attenuates these deficits in adulthood and facilitates functional repair. Together, these data validate EPO neurorestoration using a clinically relevant outcome measure and support the concept that postnatal treatment following <i>in utero</i> injury can improve cognition and executive function through adulthood.</p>

<p>Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) that purportedly arises from hypoxia-ischemia is labeled hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Perinatal asphyxia is a clinical syndrome involving acidosis, a low Apgar score and the need for resuscitation in the delivery room; asphyxia alerts one to the possibility of NE. In the present systematic review, we focused on the noninflammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are involved in the development of possible brain injury in asphyxia or HIE. A literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for case–control studies was conducted and 17 studies were found suitable by <i>a priori</i> criteria. Statistical analysis used the Mantel–Haenszel model for dichotomous data. The pooled mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. We identified the best biomarkers, based on the estimation approach in evaluating the biological significance, out of hundreds in three categories: cell adhesion and proliferation, oxidants and antioxidants, and cell damage. The following subtotal-population comparisons were made: perinatal asphyxia versus no asphyxia, asphyxia with HIE versus asphyxia without HIE, asphyxia with HIE versus no asphyxia, and term versus preterm HIE newborn with asphyxia. Biological significance of the biomarkers was determined by using a modification of the estimation approach, by ranking the biomarkers according to the difference in the bounds of the CIs. The most promising CSF biomarkers for prognostication especially for the severest HIE include creatine kinase, xanthine oxidase, vascular endothelial growth factor, neuron-specific enolase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde. Future studies are recommended using such a combined test to prognosticate the most severely affected patients.</p>

<p>Insomnia is prevalent in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and heavily influences quality of life. Using a mouse model of ASD we show that sleep problems are present from young ages and worsen with time, supporting abnormal sleep as a core feature of ASD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep problems are prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), can be observed before diagnosis, and are associated with increased restricted and repetitive behaviors. Therefore, sleep abnormalities may be a core feature of the disorder, but the developmental trajectory remains unknown. Animal models provide a unique opportunity to understand sleep ontogenesis in ASD. Previously we showed that adult mice with a truncation in the high-confidence ASD gene <i>Shank3</i> (Shank3<sup>∆C</sup>) recapitulate the clinical sleep phenotype. In this study we used longitudinal electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings to define, for the first time, changes in sleep from weaning to young adulthood in an ASD mouse model. We show that Shank3<sup>∆C</sup> male mice sleep less overall throughout their lifespan, have increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep early in life despite significantly reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and have abnormal responses to increased sleep pressure that emerge during a specific developmental period. We demonstrate that the ability to fall asleep quickly in response to sleep loss develops normally between 24 and 30 days in mice. However, mutants are unable to reduce sleep latency after periods of prolonged waking and maintain the same response to sleep loss regardless of age. This phenomenon seems independent of homeostatic NREM sleep slow-wave dynamics. Overall, our study recapitulates both preclinical models and clinical studies showing that reduced sleep is consistently associated with ASD and suggests that problems falling asleep may reflect abnormal development of sleep and arousal mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is solid evidence for the prominent involvement of the central autonomic and default mode systems in shaping personality. However, whether functional connectivity of these systems can represent neural correlates and predictors of individual variation in personality traits is largely unknown. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 215 healthy young adults were used to construct the sympathetic (SN), parasympathetic (PN), and default mode (DMN) networks, with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity measured. Personality factors were assessed using the five-factor model. We examined the associations between personality factors and functional network connectivity, followed by performance of personality prediction based on functional connectivity using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a recently developed machine learning approach. All personality factors (neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) other than openness were significantly correlated with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity of the SN, PN, and DMN. Moreover, the CPM models successfully predicted conscientiousness and agreeableness at the individual level using functional network connectivity. Our findings may expand existing knowledge regarding the neural substrates underlying personality.</p>

     alt="IL-12p40 promotes secondary damage and functional impairment after spinal cord contusional injury"/>
<p>IL-12p40 is acutely upregulated, specifically on astrocytes in the ventro- and dorsomedial regions of the injured cords. IL-12RB1 and IL-12RB2 are expressed early and chronically after SCI expanding from the ventromedial regions throughout the rest of the injured cord. <i>IL-12p40</i>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secondary damage obstructs functional recovery for individuals who have sustained a spinal cord injury (SCI). Two processes significantly contributing to tissue damage after trauma are spinal cord hemorrhage and inflammation: more specifically, the recruitment and activation of immune cells, frequently driven by pro-inflammatory factors. Cytokines are inflammatory mediators capable of modulating the immune response. While cytokines are necessary to elicit inflammation for proper healing, excessive inflammation can result in destructive processes. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 are pathogenic in multiple autoimmune diseases. The cytokine subunit IL-12p40 is necessary to form bioactive IL-12 and IL-23. In this study, we examined the relationship between spinal cord hemorrhage and IL-12-related factors, as well as the impact of IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) on secondary damage and functional recovery after SCI. Using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and protein tissue analyses, we demonstrated a positive correlation between IL-12 and tissue hemorrhage. Receptor and ligand subunits of IL-12 were significantly upregulated after injury and colocalized with astrocytes, demonstrating a myriad of opportunities for IL-12 to induce an inflammatory response. <i>IL-12p40</i>

<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> female mice after SCI revealed an upregulation of genes associated with worsened recovery after SCI. Taken together, our data reveal a pathogenic role of IL-12p40 in the secondary damage after SCI, hindering functional recovery. IL-12p40 (IL-12/IL-23) is thus an enticing neuroinflammatory target for further study as a potential therapeutic target to benefit recovery in acute SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Animal models of compression spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Compression spinal cord injuries are a common cause of morbidity in people who experience a spinal cord injury (SCI). Either as a by-product of a traumatic injury or due to nontraumatic conditions such as cervical myelitis, compression injuries are growing in prevalence clinically and many attempts of animal replication have been described within the literature. These models, however, often focus on the traumatic side of injury or mimic short-term injuries that are not representative of the majority of compression SCI. Of this, nontraumatic spinal cord injuries are severely understudied and have an increased prevalence in elderly populations, adults, and children. Therefore, there is a need to critically evaluate the current animal models of compression SCI and their suitability as a method for clinically relevant data that can help reduce morbidity and mortality of SCI. In this review, we reviewed the established and emerging methods of animal models of compression SCI. These models are the clip, balloon, solid spacer, expanding polymer, remote, weight drop, calibrated forceps, screw, and strap methods. These methods showed that there is a large reliance on the use of laminectomy to induce injury. Furthermore, the age range of many studies does not reflect the elderly and young populations that commonly suffer from compression injuries. It is therefore important to have techniques and methods that are able to minimize secondary effects of the surgeries, and are representative of the clinical cases seen so that treatments and interventions can be developed that are specific.</p>

                Traditionally, lymphocytic interferon γ (IFN-γ) was considered to be a simple 'booster' of proinflammatory responses by microglia (brain-resident macrophages) during bacterial or viral infection. Recent slice culture (in situ) and in vivo studies suggest, however, that IFN-γ has a unique role in microglial activation. Priming by IFN-γ results in proliferation (microgliosis), enhanced synapse elimination, and moderate nitric oxide release sufficient to impair synaptic transmission, gamma rhythm activity, and cognitive functions.

                Data on animals emphasize the importance of neuronal GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) for feeding suppression, although it is unclear whether astrocytes participate in the transduction of anorectic GLP-1R-dependent signals. In humans, the brain circuitry underlying these effects remains insufficiently investigated. The present study aimed to explore GLP-1R protein expression in human hypothalamus and its correlation with body mass index (BMI). Sections of hypothalamus from 28 autopsy cases, 11 with normal weight (BMI<25 Kg/m2) and 17 with non-normal weight (BMI[&ge;]25 Kg/m2), were examined using immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence labeling. Prominent GLP-1R immunoexpression was detected in neurons of several hypothalamic nuclei, including paraventricular, supraoptic, and infundibular nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area (LH), and basal forebrain nuclei. Interestingly, in LH, GLP-1R was significantly decreased in individuals with BMI[&ge;]25 Kg/m2, compared with normal weight counterparts (p=0.03). Furthermore, GLP-1R was negatively correlated ({tau}b=-0.347, p=0.024) with BMI levels only in the LH. GLP-1R extensively colocalized with the anorexigenic and anti-obesogenic neuropeptide nucleobindin-2/nesfatin-1, but not with the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. These data suggest a potential role for GLP-1R in the regulation of energy balance in human hypothalamus, possibly through interactions with nesfatin-1. In LH, an appetite- and reward-related brain region, reduced GLP-1R immunoexpression may contribute to dysregulation of homeostatic and/or hedonic feeding behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain DNA methylomic analysis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration reveals OTUD4 and CEBPZ in shared dysregulated signatures across pathological subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is an umbrella term describing the neuropathology of a clinically, genetically and pathologically heterogeneous group of diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Among the major FTLD pathological subgroups, FTLD with TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and FTLD with tau positive inclusions (FTLD-tau) are the most common, representing about 90% of the cases. Although alterations in DNA methylation have been consistently associated with neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, little is known for FTLD and its heterogeneous subgroups and subtypes. The main goal of this study was to investigate DNA methylation variation in FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. We used frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from three FTLD cohorts (228 individuals), generated using the Illumina 450K or EPIC arrays. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) for each cohort followed by meta-analysis to identify shared differential methylated loci across FTLD subgroups/subtypes. Additionally, we used weighted gene correlation network analysis to identify co-methylation signatures associated with FTLD and other disease-related traits. Wherever possible, we also incorporated relevant gene/protein expression data. The EWAS meta-analysis revealed four differentially methylated loci in FTLD, some of which showed altered gene and protein expression in FTLD. Two of the meta-analysis hits, OTUD4 and CEBPZ, were found to be co-methylated within signatures strongly associated with FTLD. These signatures were enriched for genes implicated in the ubiquitin system, RNA/stress granule formation and glutamatergic synaptic signalling. Altogether, our findings identified novel FTLD-associated loci, and support a role for DNA methylation as a mechanism involved in the dysregulation of biological processes relevant to FTLD, highlighting novel potential avenues for therapeutic development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal birthdate reveals topography in a vestibular brainstem circuit for gaze stabilization</a></h4>

              
                Across the nervous system, neurons with similar attributes are topographically organized. This topography reflects developmental pressures. Oddly, vestibular (balance) nuclei are thought to be disorganized. By measuring activity in birthdated neurons, we revealed a functional map within the central vestibular projection nucleus that stabilizes gaze in the larval zebrafish. We first discovered that both somatic position and stimulus selectivity follow projection neuron birthdate. Next, with electron microscopy and loss-of-function assays, we found that patterns of peripheral innervation to projection neurons were similarly organized by birthdate. Lastly, birthdate revealed spatial patterns of axonal arborization and synapse formation to projection neuron outputs. Collectively, we find that development reveals previously hidden organization to the input, processing, and output layers of a highly-conserved vertebrate sensorimotor circuit. The spatial and temporal attributes we uncover constrain the developmental mechanisms that may specify the fate, function, and organization of vestibulo-ocular reflex neurons. More broadly, our data suggest that, like invertebrates, temporal mechanisms may assemble vertebrate sensorimotor architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clustering of CaV1.3 L-type calcium channels by Shank3</a></h4>

              
                Clustering of neuronal L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCC) in the plasma membrane is increasingly implicated in creating highly localized Ca2+ signaling nanodomains. For example, LTCC activation can increase phosphorylation of the nuclear CREB transcription factor by increasing Ca2+ concentrations within a nanodomain close to the channel, without requiring bulk Ca2+ increases in the cytosol or nucleus. However, the molecular basis for LTCC clustering is poorly understood. The postsynaptic scaffolding protein Shank3 specifically associates with one of the major neuronal LTCCs, the CaV1.3 calcium channel, and is required for optimal LTCC-dependent excitation-transcription coupling. Here, we co-expressed CaV1.3 1 subunits with two distinct epitope-tags with or without Shank3 in HEK cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using the cell lysates revealed that Shank3 can assemble multiple CaV1.3 1 subunits in a complex under basal conditions. Moreover, CaV1.3 LTCC complex formation was facilitated by CaV{beta} subunits ({beta}3 and {beta}2a), which also interact with Shank3. Shank3 interactions with CaV1.3 LTCCs and multimeric CaV1.3 LTCC complex assembly were disrupted following addition of Ca2+ and calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to cell lysates, perhaps simulating conditions within an activated CaV1.3 LTCC nanodomain. In intact HEK293T cells, co-expression of Shank3 enhanced the intensity of membrane-localized CaV1.3 LTCC clusters under basal conditions, but not after Ca2+ channel activation. Live cell imaging studies also revealed that Ca2+ influx through LTCCs disassociated Shank3 from CaV1.3 LTCCs clusters and reduced the CaV1.3 cluster intensity. Deletion of the PDZ domain from Shank3 prevented both binding to CaV1.3 and the changes in multimeric CaV1.3 LTCC complex assembly in vitro and in HEK293 cells. Finally, we found that shRNA knock-down of Shank3 expression in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons reduced the intensity of surface-localized CaV1.3 LTCC clusters in dendrites. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism contributing to neuronal LTCC clustering under basal conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Computational Model for Storing Memories in the Synaptic Structures of the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is widely accepted as a mechanism through which the brain can learn information from different stimuli. Basing synaptic changes on the timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes enhances contributing edges within a network. While STDP rules control the evolution of networks, most research focuses on spiking rates or specific activation paths when evaluating learned information. However, since STDP augments structural weights, synapses may also contain embedded information. While imaging studies demonstrate physical changes to synapses due to STDP, these changes have not been interrogated based on their embedding capacity of a stimulus. Here, we show that networks with biological features and STDP rules can embed information on their stimulus into their synaptic weights. We use a k-nearest neighbor algorithm on the synaptic weights of thousands of independent networks to identify their stimulus with high accuracy based on local neighborhoods, demonstrating that the network structure can store stimulus information. While spike rates and timings remain useful, structural embeddings represent a new way to integrate information within a biological network. Our results demonstrate that there may be value in observing these changes directly. Beyond computational applications for monitoring these structural changes, this analysis may also inform investigation into neuroscience. Research is underway on the potential of astrocytes to integrate synapses in the brain and communicate that information elsewhere. In addition, observations of these synaptic embeddings may lead to novel therapies for memory disorders that are difficult to explain with current paradigms, such as transient epileptic amnesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomics reveals amygdala neuron regulation by fasting and ghrelin thereby promoting feeding</a></h4>

              
                The central amygdala (CeA) consists of numerous genetically-defined inhibitory neurons that control defensive and appetitive behaviors including feeding. Transcriptomic signatures of cell types and their links to function remain poorly understood. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we describe nine CeA cell clusters, of which four are mostly associated with appetitive and two with aversive behaviors. To analyze the activation mechanism of appetitive CeA neurons, we characterized Serotonin receptor 2a (Htr2a)-expressing neurons (CeAHtr2a) that comprise three appetitive clusters and were previously shown to promote feeding. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that CeAHtr2a neurons are activated by fasting, the hormone ghrelin, and the presence of food. Moreover, these neurons are required for the orexigenic effects of ghrelin. Appetitive CeA neurons responsive to fasting and ghrelin project to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) causing inhibition of target PBN neurons. These results illustrate how the transcriptomic diversification of CeA neurons relates to fasting and hormone-regulated feeding behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal mapping of cell types and projections in the central nucleus of the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) is a brain region that integrates external and internal sensory information and executes innate and adaptive behaviors through distinct output pathways. Despite its complex functions, the diversity of molecularly defined neuronal types in the CEA and their contributions to major axonal projection targets have not been examined systematically. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to classify molecularly defined cell types in the CEA and identified marker-genes to map the location of these neuronal types using expansion assisted iterative fluorescence in situ hybridization (EASI-FISH). We developed new methods to integrate EASI-FISH with 5-plex retrograde axonal labeling to determine the spatial, morphological, and connectivity properties of ~30,000 molecularly defined CEA neurons. Our study revealed spatio-molecular organization of the CEA, with medial and lateral CEA associated with distinct cell families. We also found a long-range axon projection network from the CEA, where target regions receive inputs from multiple molecularly defined cell types. Axon collateralization was found primarily among projections to hindbrain targets, which are distinct from forebrain projections. This resource reports marker-gene combinations for molecularly defined cell types and axon-projection types, which will be useful for selective interrogation of these neuronal populations to study their contributions to the diverse functions of the CEA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictive Network Analysis Identifies JMJD6 and Other Novel Key Drivers in Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of genetic studies on late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer disease (AD) remain unclear. Furthermore, different cell types in the central nervous system (CNS) play distinct roles in the onset and progression of AD pathology. To better comprehend the complex etiology of AD, we used an integrative approach to build robust predictive (causal) network models which were cross-validated over multiple large human multi-omics datasets in AD. We employed a published method to delineate bulk-tissue gene expression into single cell-type gene expression and integrated clinical and pathologic traits of AD, single nucleotide variation, and deconvoluted gene expression for the construction of predictive network models for each cell type in AD. With these predictive causal models, we are able to identify and prioritize robust key drivers of the AD-associated network state. In this study, we focused on neuron-specific network models and prioritized 19 predicted key drivers modulating AD pathology. These targets were validated via shRNA knockdown in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons (iNs), in which 10 out of the 19 neuron-related targets (JMJD6, NSF, NUDT2, YWHAZ, RBM4, DCAF12, NDRG4, STXBP1, ATP1B1, and FIBP) significantly modulated levels of amyloid-beta and/or phosphorylated tau peptides in the postmitotic iNs. Most notably, knockdown of JMJD6 significantly altered the neurotoxic ratios of A{beta} to 40 and p231-tau to total tau, indicating its potential therapeutic relevance to both amyloid and tau pathology in AD. Molecular validation by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in iNs further confirmed the network structure, showing significant enrichment in differentially expressed genes after knockdown of the validated targets. Interestingly, our network model predicts that these 10 key drivers are upstream regulators of REST and VGF, two recently identified key regulators of AD pathogenesis.

                The foraging behavior of honeybees is one of the most systematically composed behaviors among social insects which are admirable to watch. The main purpose of honeybee foraging is to collect food for their colony and since ancient days honeybee products have been used for various medicinal purposes (Singh and Takhellambam 2021). During foraging, honeybees gather information and transmit to their colony members regarding the location, distance, and profitability of forage sites with the help of unique movements called waggle dance. The capacities of honeybees time memory enable the foragers to return to a good food source in anticipation of the time of day. This highly intellectual, dynamic, and well-coordinated behavior of honeybees makes them to be one of the best choices of behavioral model to study various aspects of dynamic behaviors. As a result, vast knowledge in honeybee behavior has been accumulated and several recent studies immerge towards finding the underpinning regulatory biology of honeybee foraging behaviors. Immediate early genes (IE) genes are well documented neural markers and their promising roles in honeybee foraging have been demonstrated. Two of our recent studies showed three IE genes Egr-1, Hr38 and Kakusei involvement during the daily foraging of honeybees. This finding has provided an avenue to further explore and identify the regulatory genes/proteins and neurons that underlie a specific behavior such as learning, memory, communication, and interaction etc. In this study we further analyze our previous published data to examine interaction of the three genes during the daily foraging of honeybees.

                Background: How we discuss older adults can influence our perceptions of aging and age-related policies, particularly during times of crisis. Ageist discourse in the media impacts how society views older adults and how older adults view themselves. Negative stereotypes have been associated with negative health outcomes and can exacerbate the adverse events faced by older adults during a pandemic. This study examined the Quebec media’s portrayal of older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes before and during the first wave of COVID-19. Methods: The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Quebec was on 27 February 2020. The Factiva database was searched for newspaper articles that were published three months before (pre) and three months after (peri) the first confirmed case. Articles had to include the terms: older adults, LTC, and/or residence. Articles were excluded if they did not discuss direct or indirect impacts in the lives of people living in LTC (i.e., only discussed statistics of COVID-19 cases). After screening, 208 articles were retained, and critical discourse analysis was conducted. Results: The media discourse regarding older adults in LTC homes revealed a lack of resources (i.e., insufficient staff) and negative health outcomes for older adults (i.e., bed sores) in both the pre- and peri-COVID-19 articles. Negative and positive elements emerged from the peri-COVID-19 discourse, including increased social isolation of those in LTC, government action and advocacy (by health care practitioners and family) to support those in LTC homes. Conclusions: Existing systemic problems were exacerbated by the pandemic and this impacted older adults in LTC homes negatively. Despite this, the peri-COVID-19 discourse suggests meaningful change at the societal and policy levels to improve outcomes for future generations of older adults who reside in LTC homes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian parameter estimation for dynamical models in systems biology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathaniel J. Linden, Boris Kramer, Padmini Rangamani</p>

Dynamical systems modeling, particularly via systems of ordinary differential equations, has been used to effectively capture the temporal behavior of different biochemical components in signal transduction networks. Despite the recent advances in experimental measurements, including sensor development and ‘-omics’ studies that have helped populate protein-protein interaction networks in great detail, modeling in systems biology lacks systematic methods to estimate kinetic parameters and quantify associated uncertainties. This is because of multiple reasons, including sparse and noisy experimental measurements, lack of detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the reactions, and missing biochemical interactions. Additionally, the inherent nonlinearities with respect to the states and parameters associated with the system of differential equations further compound the challenges of parameter estimation. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework for Bayesian parameter estimation and complete quantification of the effects of uncertainties in the data and models. We apply these methods to a series of signaling models of increasing mathematical complexity. Systematic analysis of these dynamical systems showed that parameter estimation depends on data sparsity, noise level, and model structure, including the existence of multiple steady states. These results highlight how focused uncertainty quantification can enrich systems biology modeling and enable additional quantitative analyses for parameter estimation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stochastic dynamics of Type-I interferon responses</a></h4>

Interferon (IFN) activates the transcription of several hundred of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that constitute a highly effective antiviral defense program. Cell-to-cell variability in the induction of ISGs is well documented, but its source and effects are not completely understood. The molecular mechanisms behind this heterogeneity have been related to randomness in molecular events taking place during the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Here, we study the sources of variability in the induction of the IFN-alpha response by using MxA and IFIT1 activation as read-out. To this end, we integrate time-resolved flow cytometry data and stochastic modeling of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The complexity of the IFN response was matched by fitting probability distributions to time-course flow cytometry snapshots. Both, experimental data and simulations confirmed that the MxA and IFIT1 induction circuits generate graded responses rather than all-or-none responses. Subsequently, we quantify the size of the intrinsic variability at different steps in the pathway. We found that stochastic effects are transiently strong during the ligand-receptor activation steps and the formation of the ISGF3 complex, but negligible for the final induction of the studied ISGs. We conclude that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a robust biological circuit that efficiently transmits information under stochastic environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MetaLP: An integrative linear programming method for protein inference in metaproteomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shichao Feng, Hong-Long Ji, Huan Wang, Bailu Zhang, Ryan Sterzenbach, Chongle Pan, Xuan Guo</p>

Metaproteomics based on high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) plays a crucial role in characterizing microbiome functions. The acquired MS/MS data is searched against a protein sequence database to identify peptides, which are then used to infer a list of proteins present in a metaproteome sample. While the problem of protein inference has been well-studied for proteomics of single organisms, it remains a major challenge for metaproteomics of complex microbial communities because of the large number of degenerate peptides shared among homologous proteins in different organisms. This challenge calls for improved discrimination of true protein identifications from false protein identifications given a set of unique and degenerate peptides identified in metaproteomics. MetaLP was developed here for protein inference in metaproteomics using an integrative linear programming method. Taxonomic abundance information extracted from metagenomics shotgun sequencing or 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, was incorporated as prior information in MetaLP. Benchmarking with mock, human gut, soil, and marine microbial communities demonstrated significantly higher numbers of protein identifications by MetaLP than ProteinLP, PeptideProphet, DeepPep, PIPQ, and Sipros Ensemble. In conclusion, MetaLP could substantially improve protein inference for complex metaproteomes by incorporating taxonomic abundance information in a linear programming model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comprehensive characterization of the Hsp70 interactome reveals novel client proteins and interactions mediated by posttranslational modifications</a></h4>

Hsp70 interactions are critical for cellular viability and the response to stress. Previous attempts to characterize Hsp70 interactions have been limited by their transient nature and the inability of current technologies to distinguish direct versus bridged interactions. We report the novel use of cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to comprehensively characterize the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (budding yeast) Hsp70 protein interactome. Using this approach, we have gained fundamental new insights into Hsp70 function, including definitive evidence of Hsp70 self-association as well as multipoint interaction with its client proteins. In addition to identifying a novel set of direct Hsp70 interactors that can be used to probe chaperone function in cells, we have also identified a suite of posttranslational modification (PTM)-associated Hsp70 interactions. The majority of these PTMs have not been previously reported and appear to be critical in the regulation of client protein function. These data indicate that one of the mechanisms by which PTMs contribute to protein function is by facilitating interaction with chaperones. Taken together, we propose that XL-MS analysis of chaperone complexes may be used as a unique way to identify biologically important PTMs on client proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The rearing environment persistently modulates mouse phenotypes from the molecular to the behavioural level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ivana Jaric, Bernhard Voelkl, Melanie Clerc, Marc W. Schmid, Janja Novak, Marianna Rosso, Reto Rufener, Vanessa Tabea von Kortzfleisch, S. Helene Richter, Manuela Buettner, André Bleich, Irmgard Amrein, David P. Wolfer, Chadi Touma, Shinichi Sunagawa, Hanno Würbel</p>

The phenotype of an organism results from its genotype and the influence of the environment throughout development. Even when using animals of the same genotype, independent studies may test animals of different phenotypes, resulting in poor replicability due to genotype-by-environment interactions. Thus, genetically defined strains of mice may respond differently to experimental treatments depending on their rearing environment. However, the extent of such phenotypic plasticity and its implications for the replicability of research findings have remained unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which common environmental differences between animal facilities modulate the phenotype of genetically homogeneous (inbred) mice. We conducted a comprehensive multicentre study, whereby inbred C57BL/6J mice from a single breeding cohort were allocated to and reared in 5 different animal facilities throughout early life and adolescence, before being transported to a single test laboratory. We found persistent effects of the rearing facility on the composition and heterogeneity of the gut microbial community. These effects were paralleled by persistent differences in body weight and in the behavioural phenotype of the mice. Furthermore, we show that environmental variation among animal facilities is strong enough to influence epigenetic patterns in neurons at the level of chromatin organisation. We detected changes in chromatin organisation in the regulatory regions of genes involved in nucleosome assembly, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of behaviour. Our findings demonstrate that common environmental differences between animal facilities may produce facility-specific phenotypes, from the molecular to the behavioural level. Furthermore, they highlight an important limitation of inferences from single-laboratory studies and thus argue that study designs should take environmental background into account to increase the robustness and replicability of findings.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">GBPL3 localizes to the nuclear pore complex and functionally connects the nuclear basket with the nucleoskeleton in splants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Tang, Man Ip Ho, Byung-Ho Kang, Yangnan Gu</p>

The nuclear basket (NB) is an essential structure of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and serves as a dynamic and multifunctional platform that participates in various critical nuclear processes, including cargo transport, molecular docking, and gene expression regulation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely understood, particularly in plants. Here, we identified a guanylate-binding protein (GBP)-like GTPase (GBPL3) as a novel NPC basket component in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Using fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, we found that GBPL3 localizes to the nuclear rim and is enriched in the nuclear pore. Proximity labeling proteomics and protein-protein interaction assays revealed that GBPL3 is predominantly distributed at the NPC basket, where it physically associates with NB nucleoporins and recruits chromatin remodelers, transcription apparatus and regulators, and the RNA splicing and processing machinery, suggesting a conserved function of the NB in transcription regulation as reported in yeasts and animals. Moreover, we found that GBPL3 physically interacts with the nucleoskeleton via disordered coiled-coil regions. Simultaneous loss of <i>GBPL3</i> and 1 of the 4 <i>Arabidopsis</i> nucleoskeleton genes <i>CRWN</i>s led to distinct development- and stress-related phenotypes, ranging from seedling lethality to lesion development, and aberrant transcription of stress-related genes. Our results indicate that GBPL3 is a bona fide component of the plant NPC and physically and functionally connects the NB with the nucleoskeleton, which is required for the coordination of gene expression during plant development and stress responses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Differences in temporal processing speeds between the right and left auditory cortex reflect the strength of recurrent synaptic connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Demetrios Neophytou, Diego M. Arribas, Tushar Arora, Robert B. Levy, Il Memming Park, Hysell V. Oviedo</p>

Brain asymmetry in the sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation is an established functional feature that underlies the perception of speech and music. The left auditory cortex (ACx) is believed to specialize in processing fast temporal components of speech sounds, and the right ACx slower components. However, the circuit features and neural computations behind these lateralized spectrotemporal processes are poorly understood. To answer these mechanistic questions, we use mice, an animal model that captures some relevant features of human communication systems. In this study, we screened for circuit features that could subserve temporal integration differences between the left and right ACx. We mapped excitatory input to principal neurons in all cortical layers and found significantly stronger recurrent connections in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left. We hypothesized that the underlying recurrent neural dynamics would exhibit differential characteristic timescales corresponding to their hemispheric specialization. To investigate, we recorded spike trains from awake mice and estimated the network time constants using a statistical method to combine evidence from multiple weak signal-to-noise ratio neurons. We found longer temporal integration windows in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left as predicted by stronger recurrent excitation. Our study shows substantial evidence linking stronger recurrent synaptic connections to longer network timescales. These findings support speech processing theories that purport asymmetry in temporal integration is a crucial feature of lateralization in auditory processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Plasmodium knowlesi infection in East Kalimantan, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Plasmodium knowlesi is the fifth species of plasmodium infecting humans and the infection was first discovered in Southeast Asia in 2004. The incidence has been increasingly reported from almost all Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia. Although the global incidence of malaria has decreased around 50% in the last decade, the increase of knowlesi malaria infection which can cause severe malaria is of concern. During the period of 2018 to 2021, there were seven newfound cases of knowlesi malaria infection in patients treated at hospital in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations of these patients are described here. All patients were male and worked in mining and palm oil plantations in the forest in several districts in East, North, and South Kalimantan. The diagnosis was based on microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smear and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Antimalarial treatment was artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) / dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) fixed-dose combination via oral administration for three days with the doses were based on body weight. All knowlesi malaria patients in this report were presented as uncomplicated cases with great response to ACT after 2-3 days of administration without any adverse effects. Besides fever, gastrointestinal symptoms were major symptoms. Anemia was rare, leukocyte count was normal, however thrombocytopenia was found in all patients. P. knowlesi infection has been discovered in East Kalimantan Province and recently the incidence might be higher than the reported cases, making it resemble an iceberg phenomenon. Therefore, we should build awareness of the rapid increasing of knowlesi malaria cases and its prevention.

                Background: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) that affects millions of people. Children are the most vulnerable group to developing overt disease. An estimated 779 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis and 50 million preschool-age children (PSAC) need treatment. PSAC are not currently targeted by national chemotherapy campaigns due to a lack of suitable pediatric formulations of praziquantel. The Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium has developed an orally dispersible praziquantel formulation (arpraziquantel) and is facilitating its adoption for schistosomiasis control by endemic countries through the ADOPT program – an implementation research program that paves the way for the large-scale delivery of the child-friendly formulation to treat schistosomiasis in preschool-aged children in endemic countries. A key challenge for comprehensive NTD control including schistosomiasis is reaching all at-risk populations, including those hard to reach. Main access barriers include geographic, social and economic conditions. Objective: This scoping literature review aims to document the epidemiology of schistosomiasis in children under 6 years of age living in hard-to-reach areas and populations. Methods: This review will adopt the five-stage scoping review process of identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting data and collating, summarizing and reporting results. Electronic databases including Medline, Web of Science, Embase (Ovid), LILACS and African Journals OnLine (AJOL) will be searched for relevant articles. Two independent reviewers will screen identified articles using a two-stage approach of reviewing the title/abstract and then the full text of provisionally retained articles. Relevant literatures will be downloaded into EndNote X9 to maintain and manage citation and facilitate the overall review process. A meta-analysis will be conducted if indicated. Relevance: The results will provide insights into the burden of schistosomiasis among marginalized PSAC, aiming to produce evidence on the need for inclusion of this population when designing the expansion of preventive chemotherapy programs.

                The dorsal striatum integrates prior and current information to guide appropriate decision-making. Chronic stress and stimulant exposure interferes with decision-making, and can confer similar cognitive and behavioral inflexibilities. This review examines the literature on acute and chronic regulation of the epigenome by stress and stimulants. Recent evidence suggests that exposures to stress and stimulants share similarities in the manners in which they regulate the dorsal striatum epigenome through DNA methylation, transposable element activity, and histone post-translational modifications.

                The correlation coefficient gauges linear association between two variables. However, interpreting its value depends on the question at hand. This article argues that relying on the correlation coefficient may be irrelevant for many neuroscience research tasks. When the experimental dataset is contextually suitable for binning-averaging, other indicators of statistical association could prove more suitable.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">COVID-19 cluster size and transmission rates in schools from crowdsourced case reports</a></h4>

              
                The role of schools in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is controversial, with some claiming they are an important driver of the pandemic and others arguing that transmission in schools is negligible. School cluster reports that have been collected in various jurisdictions are a source of data about transmission in schools. These reports consist of the name of a school, a date, and the number of students known to be infected. We provide a simple model for the frequency and size of clusters in this data, based on random arrivals of index cases at schools who then infect their classmates with a highly variable rate, fitting the overdispersion evident in the data. We fit our model to reports from four Canadian provinces, providing estimates of mean and dispersion for cluster size, as well as the distribution of the instantaneous transmission parameter β, whilst factoring in imperfect ascertainment. According to our model with parameters estimated from the data, in all four provinces i) more than 65% of non-index cases occur in the 20% largest clusters, and ii) reducing instantaneous transmission rate and the number of contacts a student has at any given time are effective in reducing the total number of cases, whereas strict bubbling (keeping contacts consistent over time) does not contribute much to reduce cluster sizes. We predict strict bubbling to be more valuable in scenarios with substantially higher transmission rates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Landscape of epithelial mesenchymal plasticity as an emergent property of coordinated teams in regulatory networks</a></h4>

              
                Elucidating the design principles of regulatory networks driving cellular decision-making has fundamental implications in mapping and eventually controlling cell-fate decisions. Despite being complex, these regulatory networks often only give rise to a few phenotypes. Previously, we identified two 'teams' of nodes in a small cell lung cancer regulatory network that constrained the phenotypic repertoire and aligned strongly with the dominant phenotypes obtained from network simulations (Chauhan et al., 2021). However, it remained elusive whether these 'teams' exist in other networks, and how do they shape the phenotypic landscape. Here, we demonstrate that five different networks of varying sizes governing epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity comprised of two 'teams' of players - one comprised of canonical drivers of epithelial phenotype and the other containing the mesenchymal inducers. These 'teams' are specific to the topology of these regulatory networks and orchestrate a bimodal phenotypic landscape with the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes being more frequent and dynamically robust to perturbations, relative to the intermediary/hybrid epithelial/ mesenchymal ones. Our analysis reveals that network topology alone can contain information about corresponding phenotypic distributions, thus obviating the need to simulate them. We propose 'teams' of nodes as a network design principle that can drive cell-fate canalization in diverse decision-making processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Augmin prevents merotelic attachments by promoting proper arrangement of bridging and kinetochore fibers</a></h4>

              
                The human mitotic spindle is made of microtubules nucleated at centrosomes, at kinetochores, and from pre-existing microtubules by the augmin complex. However, it is unknown how the augmin-mediated nucleation affects distinct microtubule classes and thereby mitotic fidelity. Here we use superresolution microscopy to analyze the previously indistinguishable microtubule arrangements within the crowded metaphase plate area and demonstrate that augmin is vital for the formation of uniformly arranged parallel units consisting of sister kinetochore fibers connected by a bridging fiber. This ordered geometry helps both prevent and resolve merotelic attachments. Whereas augmin-nucleated bridging fibers prevent merotelic attachments by creating a nearly parallel and highly bundled microtubule arrangement unfavorable for creating additional attachments, augmin-nucleated k-fibers produce robust force required to resolve errors during anaphase. STED microscopy revealed that bridging fibers were impaired twice as much as k-fibers following augmin depletion. The complete absence of bridging fibers from a significant portion of kinetochore pairs, especially in the inner part of the spindle, resulted in the specific reduction of the interkinetochore distance. Taken together, we propose a model where augmin promotes mitotic fidelity by generating assemblies consisting of bridging and kinetochore fibers that align sister kinetochores to face opposite poles, thereby preventing erroneous attachments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vinculin recruitment to α-catenin halts the differentiation and maturation of enterocyte progenitors to maintain homeostasis of the Drosophila intestine</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms communicating changes in tissue stiffness and size are particularly relevant in the intestine because it is subject to constant mechanical stresses caused by peristalsis of its variable content. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal epithelium, we investigate the role of vinculin, one of the best characterised mechanoeffectors, which functions in both cadherin and integrin adhesion complexes. We discovered that vinculin regulates cell fate decisions, by preventing precocious activation and differentiation of intestinal progenitors into absorptive cells. It achieves this in concert with α-catenin at sites of cadherin adhesion, rather than as part of integrin function. Following asymmetric division of the stem cell into a stem cell and an enteroblast (EB), the two cells initially remain connected by adherens junctions, where vinculin is required, only on the EB side, to maintain the EB in a quiescent state and inhibit further divisions of the stem cell. By manipulating cell tension, we show that vinculin recruitment to adherens junction regulates EB activation and numbers. Consequently, removing vinculin results in an enlarged gut with improved resistance to starvation. Thus, mechanical regulation at the contact between stem cells and their progeny is used to control tissue cell number.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A tug of war between filament treadmilling and myosin induced contractility generates actin ring</a></h4>

              
                In most eukaryotic cells, actin filaments assemble into a shell-like actin cortex under the plasma membrane, controlling cellular morphology, mechanics, and signaling. The actin cortex is highly polymorphic, adopting diverse forms such as the ring-like structures found in podosomes, axonal rings, and immune synapses. The biophysical principles that underlie the formation of actin rings and cortices remain unknown. Using a molecular simulation platform, called MEDYAN, we discovered that varying the filament treadmilling rate and myosin concentration induces a finite size phase transition in actomyosin network structures. We found that actomyosin networks condense into clusters at low treadmilling rates or high myosin concentration but form ring-like or cortex-like structures at high treadmilling rates and low myosin concentration. This mechanism is supported by our corroborating experiments on live T cells, which exhibit ring-like actin networks upon activation by stimulatory antibody. Upon disruption of filament treadmilling or enhancement of myosin activity, the pre-existing actin rings are disrupted into actin clusters or collapse towards the network center respectively. Our analyses suggest that the ring-like actin structure is a preferred state of low mechanical energy, which is, importantly, only reachable at sufficiently high treadmilling rates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An inhibitory circuit from central amygdala to zona incerta drives pain-related behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Central amygdala neurons expressing protein kinase C-delta (CeA-PKCδ) are sensitized following nerve injury and promote pain-related responses in mice. The neural circuits underlying modulation of pain-related behaviors by CeA-PKCδ neurons, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified a neural circuit that originates in CeA-PKCδ neurons and terminates in the ventral region of the zona incerta (ZI), a subthalamic structure previously linked to pain processing. Behavioral experiments show that chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic ZI neurons induced bilateral hypersensitivity in uninjured mice and contralateral hypersensitivity after nerve injury. In contrast, chemogenetic activation of GABAergic ZI neurons reversed nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity. Optogenetic manipulations of CeA-PKCδ axonal terminals in the ZI further showed that inhibition of this pathway reduces nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity whereas activation of the pathway produces hypersensitivity in the uninjured paws. Altogether, our results identify a novel nociceptive inhibitory efferent pathway from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI that bidirectionally modulates pain-related behaviors in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KAT2-mediated acetylation switches the mode of PALB2 chromatin association to safeguard genome integrity</a></h4>

              
                The tumour suppressor PALB2 stimulates RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA damage, whilst its steady-state association with active genes protects these loci from replication stress. Here, we report that the lysine acetyltransferases 2A and 2B (KAT2A/2B, also called GCN5/PCAF), two well-known transcriptional regulators, acetylate a cluster of seven lysine residues (7K-patch) within the PALB2 chromatin association motif (ChAM) and, in this way, regulate context-dependent PALB2 binding to chromatin. In unperturbed cells, the 7K-patch is targeted for KAT2A/2B-mediated acetylation, which in turn enhances the direct association of PALB2 with nucleosomes. Importantly, DNA damage triggers a rapid deacetylation of ChAM and increases the overall mobility of PALB2. Distinct missense mutations of the 7K-patch render the mode of PALB2 chromatin binding, making it either unstably chromatin-bound (7Q) or randomly bound with a reduced capacity for mobilisation (7R). Significantly, both of these mutations confer a deficiency in RAD51 foci formation and increase DNA damage in S phase, leading to the reduction of overall cell survival. Thus, our study reveals that acetylation of the ChAM 7K-patch acts as a molecular switch to enable dynamic PALB2 shuttling for HR repair while protecting active genes during DNA replication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Facilitatory stimulation of the pre-SMA in healthy aging has distinct effects on task-based activity and connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Semantic cognition is central to communication and our understanding of the world. It is usually well preserved in healthy aging. However, semantic control processes, which guide semantic access and retrieval, decline with age. The present study explored the potential of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) to enhance semantic cognition in healthy middle-aged to older adults. Using an individualized stimulation approach, we applied iTBS to the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and assessed task-specific effects on semantic judgments in functional neuroimaging. We found increased activation after effective relative to sham stimulation only for the semantic task in visual and dorsal attention networks. Further, iTBS increased functional connectivity in domain-general executive networks. Notably, stimulation-induced changes in activation and connectivity related differently to behavior: While increased activation of the parietal dorsal attention network was linked to poorer semantic performance, its enhanced coupling with the pre-SMA was associated with more efficient semantic processing. Our findings indicate differential effects of iTBS on activity and connectivity. We show that iTBS modulates networks in a task-dependent manner and generates remote network effects. Stimulating the pre-SMA was linked to more efficient but not better performance, indicating a role in domain-general semantic control processes distinct to domain-specific semantic control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parsing brain-behavior heterogeneity in very preterm born children using integrated similarity networks</a></h4>

              
                Very preterm birth (VPT; [&le;] 32 weeks gestation) is associated with altered brain development and cognitive and behavioral difficulties across the lifespan. However, heterogeneity in outcomes among individuals born VPT makes it challenging to identify those most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental sequelae. Here, we aimed to stratify VPT children into distinct behavioral subgroups and explore between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain structure and function. 198 VPT children (98 females) previously enrolled in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42) underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging at term-equivalent age and neuropsychological assessments at 4-7 years. Using an integrative clustering approach, we combined neonatal socio-demographic, clinical factors and childhood socio-emotional and executive function outcomes, to identify distinct subgroups of children based on their similarity profiles in a multidimensional space. We characterized resultant subgroups using domain-specific outcomes (temperament, psychopathology, IQ and cognitively stimulating home environment) and explored between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain volumes (voxel-wise Tensor-Based-Morphometry), functional connectivity (voxel-wise degree centrality) and structural connectivity (Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics). Results showed two- and three-cluster data-driven solutions. The two-cluster solution comprised a "resilient" subgroup (lower psychopathology and higher IQ, executive function and socio-emotional outcomes) and an "at-risk" subgroup (poorer behavioral and cognitive outcomes). The three-cluster solution showed an additional third "intermediate" subgroup displaying behavioral and cognitive outcomes intermediate between the resilient and at-risk subgroups. The resilient subgroup had the most cognitively stimulating home environment and the at-risk subgroup showed the highest neonatal clinical risk, while the intermediate subgroup showed the lowest clinical but the highest socio-demographic risk. Compared to the intermediate subgroup, the resilient subgroup displayed larger neonatal insular and orbitofrontal volumes and stronger orbitofrontal functional connectivity, while the at-risk group showed widespread white matter microstructural alterations. These findings suggest that risk stratification following VPT birth is feasible and could be used translationally to guide personalized interventions aimed at promoting children's resilience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Action, attention, and temporal binding</a></h4>

              
                Outcome binding has long been understood as an illusion of timing perception, in which an action-effect is perceived as occurring earlier than it actually does. This illusion has been heavily investigated over the past two decades with regards to the mechanisms behind and potential applications. Here we present evidence in favour of understanding outcome binding as a spatial attentional effect, at least in part. In a series of 3 experiments, it was shown that an action-effect was preceded by a predictive attention shift in the classic Libet clock paradigm. The magnitude of attention shift predicted the size of outcome binding. When the attention shift was controlled for, binding also disappeared. Our study also calls for a reassessment of results obtained from the clock-like method in mental chronometry dating back to Wundt, as attention may well be a critical confounding factor in the interpretation of the results from these studies.

                The formation of long-term memories requires changes in the transcriptional program and de novo protein synthesis. One of the critical regulators for long-term memory (LTM) formation and maintenance is the transcription factor CREB. Genetic studies have dissected the requirement of CREB activity within memory circuits, however less is known about the genetic mechanisms acting downstream of CREB and how they may contribute defining LTM phases. To better understand the downstream mechanisms, we here used a targeted DamID approach (TaDa). We generated a CREB-Dam fusion protein using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as model. Expressing CREB-Dam in the mushroom bodies (MBs), a brain center implicated in olfactory memory formation, we identified genes that are differentially expressed between paired and unpaired appetitive training paradigm. Of those genes we selected candidates for an RNAi screen in which we identified genes causing increased or decreased LTM.

                Appropriate modulation of escape behaviors in response to potentially damaging stimuli is essential for survival. Although nociceptive circuitry has been studied, it is poorly understood how genetic contexts affect the relevant escape responses. Using an unbiased genome-wide association analysis, we identified a Ly6/-neurotoxin family protein, Belly roll (Bero), which negatively regulates Drosophila nociceptive escape behavior. We show that Bero is expressed in abdominal leucokinin-producing neurons (ABLK neurons) and bero knockdown in ABLK neurons resulted in enhanced escape behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ABLK neurons responded to the activation of nociceptors and initiated the behavior. Notably, bero knockdown reduced the persistent neuronal activity and increased the evoked nociceptive responses in ABLK neurons. Our findings reveal that Bero modulates an escape response by regulating distinct neuronal activities in ABLK neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Converging pathways direct synapse elimination through the homeodomain transcriptional regulator DVE-1</a></h4>

              
                An important step in brain development is the remodeling of juvenile neural circuits to establish mature connectivity. The elimination of juvenile synapses is a critical step in this process; however, the molecular mechanisms directing synapse elimination processes and their timing are not fully understood. We identify here a conserved transcriptional regulator, DVE-1, that directs the elimination of juvenile synaptic inputs onto remodeling C. elegans GABAergic neurons. Dorsally localized juvenile acetylcholine receptor clusters and apposing presynaptic sites are eliminated during maturation of wild type GABAergic neurons but persist into adulthood in dve-1 mutants. The persistence of juvenile synapses in dve-1 mutants does not impede synaptic growth during GABAergic remodeling and therefore results in heightened motor connectivity, producing a turning bias during movement. DVE-1 is localized to GABAergic nuclei prior to remodeling and DVE-1 nuclear localization is required for synapse elimination to proceed. Synaptic remodeling is antagonized by the expression of the Ig domain protein OIG-1. Premature synapse elimination in oig-1 mutants is reversed by dve-1 mutation, while precocious synaptic growth is unaffected, indicating a functional separation of synapse destruction and growth during remodeling. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel strategy for sculpting mature connectivity through the coordination of parallel DVE-1-regulated pro-degenerative processes and temporally regulated maintenance mechanisms.

                Spatial memory requires an intact hippocampus. Hippocampal function during epochs of locomotion and quiet rest (e.g., grooming and reward consumption) have been the target of extensive study. However, during navigation rats frequently rear up on to their hind legs and the importance of hippocampal activity during these periods of attentive sampling for spatial memory is unknown. To address this, we tested the necessity of dorsal hippocampal activity during rearing epochs in the study phase of a delayed win-shift task for memory performance in the subsequent test phase. Hippocampal activity was manipulated with closed-loop, bilateral, optogenetic inactivation. Spatial memory accuracy was significantly and selectively reduced when the dorsal hippocampus was inactivated during rearing epochs at encoding. These data show that hippocampal activity during periods of rearing can be important for spatial memory, revealing a novel link between hippocampal function during epochs of rearing and spatial memory.

                Conductance-based models have played an important role in the development of modern neuroscience. These mathematical models are powerful 'tools' that enable theoretical explorations in experimentally untenable situations, and can lead to the development of novel hypotheses and predictions. With advances in cell imaging and computational power, multi-compartment models with morphological accuracy are becoming common practice. However, as more biological details are added, they make extensive explorations and analyses more challenging largely due to their huge computational expense. Here, we focus on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) cell models. OLM cells can contribute to functionally relevant theta rhythms in the hippocampus by virtue of their ability to express spiking resonance at theta frequencies, but what characteristics underlie this is far from clear. We converted a previously developed detailed multi-compartment OLM cell model into a reduced single compartment model that retained biophysical fidelity with its underlying ion currents. We showed that the reduced OLM cell model can capture complex output that includes spiking resonance in in vivo-like scenarios as previously obtained with the multi-compartment model. Using the reduced model, we were able to greatly expand our in vivo-like scenarios. Applying spike-triggered average analyses, we were thus able to to determine that it is a combination of hyperpolarization-activated cation and muscarinic type potassium currents that specifically allow OLM cells to exhibit spiking resonance at theta frequencies. Further, we developed a robust Kalman Filtering (KF) method to estimate parameters of the reduced model in real-time. We showed that it may be possible to directly estimate conductance parameters from experiments since this KF method can reliably extract parameter values from model voltage recordings. Overall, our work showcases how the contribution of cellular biophysical current details could be determined and assessed for spiking resonance. As well, our work shows that it may be possible to directly extract these parameters from current clamp voltage recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inherent envelope fluctuations in forward masking: Effects of age and hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Forward masking is generally greater for Gaussian noise (GN) than for low-fluctuation noise (LFN) maskers for listeners with and without sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Because older age and SNHL may affect recovery from masker envelope fluctuations differently, the current study explored which of these two factors contributed more substantially to the persistence of GN disruption. GN disruption was measured using three masker-signal delays (25, 75, and 150 ms) for three adult participant groups: younger listeners with normal hearing (YNH), older participants with normal, or near-normal, hearing (ONH), and older participants with sensorineural hearing loss (OSNHL). The role of underlying mechanisms was tested using a computational model for midbrain neurons. The primary result suggests that older listeners with normal or near normal hearing may be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of masker-envelope fluctuations than younger listeners with normal hearing. Results from the computational model propose that there may be a larger influence of efferent feedback and saturation of inner hair cells on GN disruption than previously expected.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The line bisection bias stems from left-side underawareness, not from right-side hyperattention</a></h4>

              
                It is still a matter of scientific debate whether the line bisection bias frequently observed in patients with spatial neglect is due to attentional underawareness of the left end of the line, attentional hyperattention towards the right end, or a logarithmically compressed perception of the line. To address this question, neglect patients who showed a line bisection bias were administered additional tasks involving horizontal lines (e.g., number line estimation tasks). Their performance was compared to neglect patients not showing a line bisection bias, patients with right hemisphere damage without neglect, and healthy controls. Results indicated that patients with a line bisection bias tended to overestimate lefthand segments when they had to dissect lines into three or four equal parts. This is congruent with both the notions of an underawareness of lefthand segments as well as a logarithmic compression of the line. However, when these patients had to imagine the lines as bounded fraction number lines ranging from 0-1, the results were mixed. When the number lines ranged from 0-10, these patients showed rightward overestimation biases for the numbers 4 and 5. Additionally, all patient groups, but not healthy controls, tended to place number 1 too far to the left and number 9 too far to the right, suggesting a general bias towards endpoints. In sum, this seems more congruent with attentional accounts than a perceptual one. Spatial-numerical associations could be ruled out, as all participants showed a verbal number bisection bias towards smaller numbers (i.e., the "left" of the mental number line). Therefore, these findings seem to indicate that the line bisection bias is most likely due to underawareness of the left end rather than hyperattention towards the right or a logarithmic perception of the line.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel method for measuring the priming effect of rewarding brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Receipt of an intense reward boosts motivation to work for more of that reward. This phenomenon is called the priming effect of rewards. Previous research on the priming effect of electrical brain stimulation utilized a runway paradigm in which running speed serves as the measure of motivation. One goal of the present study was to develop a method for measuring the priming effect of electrical brain stimulation in conventional operant-conditioning chambers. The speed with which a two-lever response chain was executed serves as the measure of motivation. Using this new paradigm, we document how the priming effect depends on both the strength and cost of the reward. In a second experiment, we assessed a modification of the new method that entails self-administered priming stimulation and alternating blocks of primed and unprimed trials. Reliable, consistent priming effects of substantial magnitude were obtained in the modified paradigm, which is closely analogous to the runway paradigm. The modified paradigm can be readily implemented in the standard operant-conditioning chambers available in most behavioral neuroscience laboratories.

                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the de facto clinical side effect that limits the administration of anti-cancer treatments. Recently, we reported that intrathecally injected bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) reduced nerve trauma-induced neuropathic pain in male mice via TGF-{beta}1 signaling. In this study, we examined sex-dependent pain relief mediated by intrathecally delivered BMSCs and TGF-{beta}1 in paclitaxel (PTX)-induced CIPN. BMSCs were prepared from primary cultures of male or female mice separately. A single intrathecal injection of BMSCs, prepared from male donors, completely prevented the development of PTX-evoked mechanical allodynia in male mice. However, female mice showed no analgesic response to either male or female BMSCs. Additionally, male mice did not demonstrate an analgesic response to BMSCs from female donors. Intrathecal injection of TGF-{beta}1 neutralizing antibody reversed the analgesic action of BMSCs. Interestingly, spinal administration of TGF-{beta}1 reduced mechanical allodynia in male mice but not in female mice. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in spinal cord slices revealed that TGF-{beta}1 inhibited PTX-induced synaptic plasticity, i.e. increase in spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPsCs), in spinal cord neurons from male mice only. Intrathecal TGF-{beta}1 increased the paw withdrawal threshold in von Frey testing in naive mice of males but not females, and the antinociceptive effect of TGF-{beta}1 in males was blocked by orchiectomy-induced androgen deficiency. Together, these findings reveal sex dimorphism in BMSC control of mechanical pain through spinal TGF-{beta}1 signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal gamma oscillations form complex ensembles modulated by behavior and learning</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex display a rich oscillatory activity, believed to support neural information processing in key cognitive functions. In the hippocampal region CA1, a slow gamma rhythm (30-80 Hz) generated in CA3 would support memory retrieval whereas a medium gamma rhythm (60-120 Hz) generated in the entorhinal cortex would support memory encoding. However, descriptions involving discrete gamma sub-bands can only partially account for the haphazard diversity of oscillatory behaviors observed in individual recordings during spatial navigation behavior. Here, we stress that transient gamma oscillatory episodes at any frequency or phase relative to the ongoing theta (4-12 Hz) rhythm can be recorded at any layer within CA1. Eventually, the commonly reported averages are dominated by a minority of very strong power events overshadowing gamma heterogeneity. Nevertheless, we show that such gamma diversity can be naturally explained by a simple mechanistic model, and that behavior-related information (position within a maze) can be decoded from most individual gamma events, despite their low power and erratic-like nature. Our results indicate that behavior specifically shapes ensembles of irregular hippocampal gamma oscillations, in a way which evolves with learning, depends on the hippocampal layer and is hard to reconcile with the hypothesis of rigid, narrowly tuned gamma sub-bands. Beyond randomness, the pervasive gamma diversity may thus reflect complexity at the "fringe-of-synchrony" likely functional but invisible to classic average-based analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Naturally occurring Alzheimer's disease in rhesus monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. To date, its cause is unclear and there are no effective treatments or preventive measures. Despite there are accumulating evidences for the existence of AD pathological hallmarks in the brain of aging rhesus monkeys, it remains a mainstream notion that monkeys do not develop AD naturally. This is an important issue because it will determine how we use monkeys in AD studies. To settle down this issue, a group (n=10) of aged rhesus monkeys 26 years old or above went through a systematic AD screening procedure in this study. Three of these monkeys showed severe memory impairments (SMI) after evaluated with a classic working memory test. Further behavioral testing revealed that the SMI monkeys also exhibited apathy-like behavior, which is another core AD clinical symptom. In addition to the cognitive deficits, two of the three SMI monkeys developed all of the three AD pathological hallmarks, including neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques and neuronal loss. According to the diagnostic criteria of human AD, the two SMI monkeys were clearly naturally occurring AD monkeys. These results suggest that AD is not a uniquely human disease and monkeys have great potential for the development of much needed etiological AD models, which are vital for better understanding of developmental process of AD and the base of identification of early diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets of AD.

                Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene that codes for the protein huntingtin (HTT or Htt in mice). HTT is a multi-functional, ubiquitously expressed protein that is essential for embryonic survival, normal neurodevelopment, and adult brain function. The ability of wild-type HTT to protect neurons against various forms of death raises the possibility that loss of normal HTT function may worsen disease progression in HD. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics are being evaluated in clinical trials for HD, but concerns have been raised that decreasing wild-type HTT levels may have adverse effects. Here we show that Htt levels modulate the occurrence of an idiopathic seizure disorder that spontaneously occurs in FVB/N mice. These abnormal FVB/N mice demonstrate various cardinal features of mouse models of epilepsy including spontaneous seizures, astrocytosis, neuronal hypertrophy, upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and sudden seizure-related death. Interestingly, decreasing wild-type Htt levels increased the frequency of this disorder, while over-expression of HTT completely prevented it. Examination of the mechanism underlying huntingtin's ability to modulate the frequency of this seizure disorder indicated that over-expression of full length HTT can promote neuronal survival following seizures. Overall, our results demonstrate a protective role for huntingtin in this form of epilepsy and provide a plausible explanation for the observation of seizures in the juvenile form of HD, Lopes-Maciel-Rodan syndrome, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Adverse effects caused by altering huntingtin levels has ramifications related to Huntingtin-lowering therapies in development to treat HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Training stochastic stabilized supralinear networks by dynamics-neutral growth</a></h4>

              
                There continues to be a trade-off between the biological realism and performance of neural networks. Contemporary deep learning techniques allow neural networks to be trained to perform challenging computations at (near) human-level, but these networks typically violate key biological constraints. More detailed models of biological neural networks can incorporate many of these constraints but typically suffer from subpar performance and trainability. Here, we narrow this gap by developing an effective method for training a canonical model of cortical neural circuits, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), that in previous work had to be constructed manually or trained with undue constraints. SSNs are particularly challenging to train for the same reasons that make them biologically realistic: they are characterized by strongly-connected excitatory cells and expansive firing rate non-linearities that together make them prone to dynamical instabilities unless stabilized by appropriately tuned recurrent inhibition. Our method avoids such instabilities by initializing a small network and gradually increasing network size via the dynamics-neutral addition of neurons during training. We first show how SSNs can be trained to perform typical machine learning tasks by training an SSN on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by training an SSN on the challenging task of performing amortized Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference under a Gaussian scale mixture generative model of natural image patches with a rich and diverse set of basis functions - something that was not possible with previous methods. These results open the way to training realistic cortical-like neural networks on challenging tasks at scale.

                Associative memory is the ability to encode and retrieve relations between different stimuli. To better understand its neural basis, we investigated whether associative memory involves precisely timed spiking of neurons in the medial temporal lobes that exhibit stimulus-specific tuning. Using single-neuron recordings from epilepsy patients performing an associative object-location memory task, we identified the object- and place-specific neurons that encoded the separate elements of each memory. When patients encoded and retrieved particular memories, the relevant object- and place-specific neurons activated synchronously during hippocampal ripples. This ripple-locked coactivity of stimulus-specific neurons emerged over time as the patients associative learning progressed. Our results suggest a cellular account of associative memory, in which hippocampal ripples coordinate the activity of specialized cellular populations to facilitate links between stimuli.

                Mated females reallocate resources to offspring production, causing changes in nutritional requirements and challenges to energy homeostasis. Although observed in most species, the neural and endocrine mechanisms that regulate the nutritional needs of mated females are not well understood. Here, we investigate the neural circuitry that regulates sugar appetite in mated Drosophila melanogaster females. During copulation, a male-derived sex peptide is transferred to females, silencing the mating status circuit to elicit many postmating behavioral changes1-3. We find that increased sucrose consumption is a postmated female behavior and show that it is mediated by the mating status circuit. We discovered that sexually dimorphic insulin receptor (Lgr3) neurons integrate mating status and nutritional state signals to adjust sucrose consumption. Lgr3+ cells receive inhibitory input from the mating status circuit via female specific pdC2 neurons. In mated females, the inhibition of Lgr3 cells from pdC2 is attenuated, transforming the mated signal into a long-term hunger signal that promotes sugar intake. Our results thus demonstrate that the mating circuit alters nutrient sensing centers in females to promote sugar consumption, providing a mechanism to increase intake in anticipation of the energetic costs associated with reproduction.

                Systems consolidation theories propose two mechanisms that enable the behavioral integration of related memories: coordinated reactivation between hippocampus and cortex, and the emergence of cortical traces that reflect overlap across memories. However, there is limited empirical evidence that links these mechanisms to the emergence of behavioral integration over time. In two experiments, participants implicitly encoded sequences of objects with overlapping structure. Assessment of behavioral integration showed that response times during a recognition task reflected behavioral priming between objects that never occurred together in time but belonged to overlapping sequences. This priming was consolidation-dependent and only emerged for sequences learned 24 hours prior to the test. Critically, behavioral integration was related to changes in neural pattern similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increases in post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and lateral occipital cortex. These findings suggest that memories with a shared predictive structure become behaviorally and neurally integrated through a consolidation-related restructuring of the learned sequences, providing insight into the relationship between different consolidation mechanisms that support behavioral integration.

                Neuropathic pain is a common health problem, resulting in exacerbated response to noxious and non noxious stimuli, as well as impaired emotional and cognitive responses. Unfortunately, neuropathic pain is also one of the most difficult pain syndromes to manage, highlighting the importance of better understanding of the brain regions and neuromodulatory mechanisms involved in its regulation. Among the many interconnected brain areas which process pain, the amygdala is known to play an important role in the integration of sensory and emotional pain signals. Here, we questioned the ability of a recently identified neuromodulatory mechanisms associated to the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGlu4 in the amygdala to modulate neuropathic pain. In a murine model of peripheral mononeuropathy induced by a chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve, we demonstrate that pharmacological activation of amygdala mGlu4 receptors efficiently alleviates sensory and depressive-like symptoms in both male and female mice. Moreover, we reveal a differential modulation of those symptoms, activating mGlu4 receptors in the controlateral amygdala, relatively to the side of the mononeuropathy, is necessary and sufficient to relieve both sensory and depressive-like symptoms while ipsilateral activation solely reduces depressive-like symptoms. Furthermore, using photopharmacology, a recent strategy allowing a precise spatiotemporal photocontrol of deep brain endogenous targets, we further demonstrate the rapid and reversible action of mGlu4-mediated neuromodulation on neuropathic pain symptoms. Finally, coupling photopharmacology and analgesic conditioned place preference, we show an important pain-reducing effect of mGlu4 activation. Taken together, these data highlight the analgesic potential of enhancing amygdala mGlu4 activity to counteract neuropathy in the hope of improving existing treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vutiglabridin improves neurodegeneration in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice by targeting mitochondrial paraoxonase-2</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, share pathogenic features with obesity, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that is highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress. However, no drug targeting PON2 has ever been developed for the treatment of PD. Here, we show that vutiglabridin, a clinical phase 2-stage drug for the treatment of obesity, has therapeutic effects in PD models, targeting mitochondrial PON2. Vutiglabridin penetrates into the brain, binds to PON2, and restores 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Knockdown of PON2 by lentiviral shRNA infection abolished the effects of vutiglabridin on mitochondria. In mice, vutiglabridin significantly alleviated motor impairments and damage to dopaminergic neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model, and these effects were also abolished in PON2-knockdown mice, suggesting that vutiglabridin is neuroprotective via PON2. Extensive in vitro and in vivo assessment of potential neurotoxicity showed vutiglabridin to be safe. Overall, these findings provide support for the clinical development of vutiglabridin as a novel PON2 modulator for the treatment of PD.

                Cell-specific pharmaceutical technologies promise mechanistic insight into clinical drugs[-]those that treat, and often define, human disease. In particular, DART (drug acutely restricted by tethering) achieves genetically programmable control of drug concentration over cellular dimensions. The method is compatible with clinical pharmaceuticals and amenable to studies in behaving animals. Here, we describe DART.2, comprising three advances. First, we improve the efficiency of chemical capture, enabling cell-specific accumulation of drug to ~3,000-times the ambient concentration in 15 min. Second, we develop tracer reagents, providing a behavior- independent measure of cellular target engagement in each animal. Third, we extend the method to positive allosteric modulators and outline design principles for this clinically significant class. We showcase the platform with four pharmaceuticals[-]two that weaken excitatory (AMPAR) or inhibitory (GABAAR) chemical neurotransmission, and two that strengthen these forms of synaptic communication. Across four labs, we tested reagents in the mouse cerebellum, basal ganglia, visual cortex, and retina. Collectively, we demonstrate robust, bidirectional editing of chemical neurotransmission. We provide for distribution of validated reagents, community design principles, and synthetic building blocks for application to diverse pharmaceuticals.

                Receipt of an intense reward boosts motivation to work for more of that reward. This phenomenon is called the priming effect of rewards. A previous study demonstrated that the priming effect of rewarding medial forebrain bundle stimulation was remarkably resilient following administration of medium-high doses of pimozide. Here, we used the operant-chamber paradigm described in the preceding paper to assess the dependence of the priming effect on D2-like dopamine receptors. We found that the priming effect also proved resilient to the effect of eticlopride, a selective D2-like receptor antagonist. The results are discussed within the framework of a new model of brain reward circuitry in which non-dopaminergic medial forebrain bundle fibers and dopamine axons provide parallel inputs to the final common paths for reward and incentive motivation.

                Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are essential determinants of late-onset Alzheimer Disease (LOAD) neuropathology. Here, we developed an integrative computational systems biology approach to construct causal network models of genetic regulatory programs for microglia in Alzheimer Disease (AD). This model enabled us to identify novel key driver (KDs) genes for microglial functions that can be targeted for AD pharmacotherapy. We prioritized FCER1G, HCK, LAPTM5, ITGB2, SLC1A2, PAPLN, GSAP, NTRK2, and CIRBP as KDs of microglial phagocytosis promoting neuroprotection and/or neural repair. In vitro, shRNA knockdown of each KD significantly reduced microglial phagocytosis. We repurposed riluzole, an FDA-approved ALS drug that upregulates SLC1A2 activity, and discovered that it stimulated phagocytosis of A{beta}1-42 in human primary microglia and decreased hippocampal amyloid plaque burden/phosphorylated tau levels in the brain of aged 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, these data emphasize the utlility of our integrative approach for repurposing drugs for AD therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying Patients with Cognitive Motor Dissociation Using Resting-state Temporal Stability</a></h4>

              
                Background: Using task-dependent neuroimaging techniques, recent studies discovered a fraction of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) who had no command-following behaviors but showed a clear sign of awareness, which was defined as cognitive motor dissociation (CMD). Although many efforts were made to identify the CMD, existing task-dependent approaches might fail when patients had multiple cognitive function (e.g., attention, memory) impairments, and thus lead to false-negative findings. However, recent advances in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) analysis allow investigation of the dynamic change of spontaneous brain activity, which might be a powerful tool to test the patient's cognitive functions, while its capacity in identifying CMD was unclear. Methods: The rs-fMRI study included 119 participants from three independent research sites. A sliding-window approach was used to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity of the brain in two aspects: the global and regional temporal stability, which measures how stable the brain functional architecture is across time. The temporal stability was compared in the first dataset (36/16 DOC/controls), and then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was built to discriminate DOC patients from controls. Furthermore, the generalizability of the SVM classifier was tested in the second independent dataset (35/21 DOC/controls). Finally, the SVM classifier was applied to the third independent dataset where patients underwent an rs-fMRI and brain-computer interface assessment (4/7 CMD/potential non-CMD), to test its performance in identifying CMD. Results: Our results showed that the global and regional temporal stability were impaired in DOC patients, especially in regions from the cingulo-opercular task control, default mode, fronto-parietal task control, and salience network. Using the temporal stability as features, the SVM model not only showed a good performance in the first dataset (accuracy = 90 %), but a good generalizability in the second dataset (accuracy = 82 %). Most importantly, the SVM model generalized well in identifying CMD in the third dataset (accuracy = 91 %). Conclusion: The current findings suggested that rs-fMRI could be a potential tool to assist in diagnosing CMD. Furthermore, the temporal stability investigated in this study also contributed to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanism of the consciousness.

                Although sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most commonly performed bariatric surgery in the US, its mechanistic underpinnings have not been fully determined. Thus, we set out to investigate whether changes in the peripheral sympathetic system could mediate the metabolic effects of SG. The celiac-superior mesenteric ganglia (CSMG) lie juxtaposed to the stomach and supply the sympathetic innervation of the stomach, as well as to numerous other intra-abdominal organs. Here we investigated the effects of SG on the CSMG. SG led to the degeneration of neurons in the CSMG, as evidenced by chromatolysis, which was not found in control mice. Furthermore, CSMG ablation (CGX) completely recapitulated the glycemic and weight loss effects of SG, promoting weight loss at the expense of fat mass. Norepinephrine tissue content measurement by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that liver, duodenum, and ileum were organs where both SG and CGX displayed evidence of significant sympathetic denervation. Both SG and CGX were associated with increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and high free fatty acid content in the stools. In conclusion, CSMG neuronal degeneration caused by SG may be a partial mediator of the metabolic effects of this type of bariatric surgery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Macaque Brainnetome Atlas with Fine-grained Parcellations and Reliable Connections</a></h4>

              
                The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is a crucial experimental animal that shares many genetic, brain organizational, and behavioral characteristics with humans. A macaque brain atlas that identifies anatomically and functionally distinct regions is fundamental to biomedical and evolutionary research. However, even though connectivity information is vital for understanding brain functions, a connectivity-based whole-brain atlas of the macaque has not previously been made. In this study, we created a new whole-brain map, the Macaque Brainnetome Atlas, based on the anatomical connectivity profile provided by high-resolution angular and spatial diffusion MRI data. The new atlas consists of 248 cortical and 56 subcortical regions as well as their structural and resting-state functional connections. We systematically evaluated the parcellations and connections using multi-site and multi-modal datasets to ensure reproducibility and reliability. The resulting resource, which is downloadable from http://atlas.brainnetome.org, includes (1) the thoroughly delineated Macaque Brainnetome Atlas (MacBNA), (2) the multi-modal connections, (3) the largest postmortem high resolution macaque dMRI dataset, and (4) ex vivo MRI, block-face, and Nissl-stained images obtained from a different macaque. We provide an exemplar use of the resource with a joint multi-modal and multi-scale utilization of MRI and Nissl data with our atlas as a reference system. The goals of the resource are not only to provide a backbone of the mesoscopic connectivity and a multi-omics (such as transcriptomes and proteomes) atlas but also to facilitate translational medicine, cross-species comparisons, and computational modelling, enriching the collaborative resource platform of nonhuman primate data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct beta frequencies reflect categorical decisions</a></h4>

              
                Beta oscillations are involved in a variety of cognitive functions beyond their traditional sensorimotor role. Based on prior findings of content-specific beta synchronization during working memory and decision making, we hypothesized that beta activity supports the activation and reactivation of cortical representations by mediating neural ensemble formation within and between brain regions. We here found that beta activity in monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and in pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) reflects the content of a stimulus in relation to the task context, regardless of its objective properties. In multiple versions of a categorization task, we changed the boundary between categories from one block of trials to the next, such that a stimulus which belonged to one of two categories during one block could belong to the other category during the next one. During a delay in which monkeys had to hold their categorical decision in mind, we found that two distinct beta-band frequencies were consistently associated with the same two relative categories, and that activity in these respective bands predicted the animals' responses. We characterized beta at these frequencies as transient bursts with distinct temporal profiles. We further showed that dlPFC and preSMA are connected via these distinct frequency channels, with dlPFC driving the frequency separation, a result supported by Granger causality and spike-field coherence analyses. In sum, these results provide support for the role of beta in forming neural ensembles, and further show that such ensembles synchronize at different beta frequencies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Actigraphic Correlates of Neuropsychiatric Disability in Adult Patients with Focal Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Disability in patients with epilepsy (PWE) is multifactorial: beyond seizure frequency/severity, PWE are prone to a range of neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and somatic comorbidities that significantly impact quality of life. In this study, we explored how variations in epilepsy severity and the burden of self-reported somatic/neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with disruptions to 24h activity patterns (rest-activity rhythms, RARs), determined through wrist accelerometry/actigraphy. Continuous multiday recordings were obtained from 59 adult patients with focal epilepsy (44% male, ages 18-72), who contemporaneously provided responses to a range of validated psychometric instruments to measure the burden of anxiety, depression, sleepiness, and somatic symptoms. As a comparator, we conducted a similar psychometric-actigraphic correlation in 1761 subjects of Hispanic origin (35% male, ages 18-65) from the Study of Latinos (SOL) Sueno Ancillary Study. RARs were analyzed via a sigmoidally-transformed cosine model (quantifying RAR amplitude, steepness, acrophase and robustness) and non-parametric measures to estimate RAR stability, fragmentation, and sleep. Compared with age- and sex-matched SOL subjects, RARs from PWE subjects featured a significantly diminished amplitude, a wider rest phase and significantly more total daily sleep. Within PWE, similar RAR distortions were associated with seizure intractability and/or anticonvulsant polytherapy. In contrast, high anxiety, depression, and somatic symptom scores were associated with diminished RAR robustness and a delayed acrophase. We applied the complete SOL Sueno database to train logistic regression models to dichotomously classify anxiety, depression and sleepiness symptoms using age, sex, body mass index and a range of non-collinear RAR parameters. When tested on PWE, these models predicted prevalent anxiety and depression symptoms with modest success (accuracy ~70%) but failed to predict subjective sleepiness. Together, these results demonstrate that RAR features may vary with depression and anxiety symptoms in ambulatory patients with focal epilepsy, potentially offering a set of objective wearable-derived endpoints to adjunct routine clinical care and drug/device treatment trials. With larger actigraphic-psychometric datasets in PWE, we may identify RAR signatures that can more precisely distinguish between variations in seizure risk, the burden of anticonvulsant therapy and prevalent mood/anxiety symptoms.

                Knowledge about one's personality, the self-concept, shapes human experience. Social cognitive neuroscience has made strides addressing the question of where and how the self is represented in the brain. The answer, however, remains elusive. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments (with the second being preregistered) employing a self-reference task with a broad range of attributes and carrying out a searchlight representational similarity analysis. The importance of attributes to self-identity was represented in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas mPFC activation was unrelated both to self-descriptiveness of attributes (Experiments 1-2) and importance of attributes to a friend's self-identity (Experiment 2). Our research provides a comprehensive answer to the abovementioned question: The self-concept is conceptualized in terms of self-importance and represented in the mPFC.

	<p>The menstrual cycle affects women&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional states, with estrogen and progesterone having predominant roles. However, it remains unclear whether the phases of the menstrual cycle also affect women&amp;amp;rsquo;s motivational behaviors. In this study, the main aim was to investigate how the menstrual cycle influences approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance behavior under conditions of conscious versus unconscious processing of emotions. Briefly, after recruitment by advertisement and screening with a menstrual cycle survey questionnaire, 27 naturally cycling, healthy women participated in an improved &amp;amp;ldquo;manikin task&amp;amp;rdquo; and were presented both positive and negative emotional stimuli during early follicular, late follicular, and mid-luteal phases. Estrogen and progesterone levels were measured. Women in the late follicular phase exhibited the shortest response times for approaching positive stimuli, while women in the mid-luteal phase exhibited the shortest response times for avoiding negative stimuli. Estrogen and progesterone levels significantly correlated with the speed of the approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance responses observed for the women, indicating the important role that sex hormones have in mediating emotionally motivated behavior. Overall, these findings suggest that the menstrual cycle has strong and specific influences on women&amp;amp;rsquo;s approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance behaviors that are in part mediated by estrogen and progesterone. By identifying characteristics of these behaviors in the late follicular and mid-luteal phases, greater insight can be provided to women regarding the physiological influences of the menstrual cycle on their personal growth and security.</p>

	<p>The principal reason for measuring mental workload is to quantify the cognitive cost of performing tasks to predict human performance. Unfortunately, a method for assessing mental workload that has general applicability does not exist yet. This is due to the abundance of intuitions and several operational definitions from various fields that disagree about the sources or workload, its attributes, the mechanisms to aggregate these into a general model and their impact on human performance. This research built upon these issues and presents a novel method for mental workload modelling from EEG data employing deep learning. This method is self-supervised, employing a continuous brain rate, an index of cognitive activation, and does not require human declarative knowledge. The aim is to induce models automatically from data, supporting replicability, generalisability and applicability across fields and contexts. This specific method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable with spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data, aimed at fitting a novel brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional layers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since within-subject models had, on average, a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error of around 11%. The addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of high-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their accuracy. These findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of automatically learnt high-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced through convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time, intuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses. Additionally, across-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of participants, thus trained with data containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to the within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of the induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence of subject-independent cognitive activation patterns. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing scholars with a novel computational method for mental workload modelling that aims to be generally applicable and does not rely on ad hoc human crafted models.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Target temperature management (TTM) is often used in patients after cardiac arrest, but the effects of cooling on cerebral microcirculation, oxygenation and metabolism are poorly understood. We studied the time course of these variables in a healthy swine model.Methods: Fifteen invasively monitored, mechanically ventilated pigs were allocated to sham procedure (normothermia, NT; n = 5), cooling (hypothermia, HT, n = 5) or cooling with controlled oxygenation (HT-Oxy, n = 5). Cooling was induced by cold intravenous saline infusion, ice packs and nasal cooling to achieve a body temperature of 33&amp;amp;ndash;35 &amp;amp;deg;C. After 6 h, animals were rewarmed to baseline temperature (within 5 h). The cerebral microvascular network was evaluated (at baseline and 2, 7 and 12 h thereafter) using sidestream dark-field (SDF) video-microscopy. Cerebral blood flow (laser Doppler MNP100XP, Oxyflow, Oxford Optronix, Oxford, UK), oxygenation (PbtO2, Licox catheter, Integra Lifesciences, USA) and lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR) using brain microdialysis (CMA, Stockholm, Sweden) were measured hourly. Results: In HT animals, cerebral functional capillary density (FCD) and proportion of small-perfused vessels (PSPV) significantly decreased over time during the cooling phase; concomitantly, PbtO2 increased and LPR decreased. After rewarming, all microcirculatory variables returned to normal values, except LPR, which increased during the rewarming phase in the two groups subjected to HT when compared to the group maintained at normothermia. Conclusions: In healthy animals, TTM can be associated with alterations in cerebral microcirculation during cooling and altered metabolism at rewarming.</p>

	<p>Delayed diagnosis and a lack of adequate care for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are related to worse outcomes and quality of life. This study aimed to identify the profile of service use, barriers to access care, and factors related to those barriers in Brazilian families with children with ASD. A total of 927 families with children with ASD (3&amp;amp;ndash;17 years) from five Brazilian regions completed an online version of the Caregivers Needs Survey. Results showed that the most used services were behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy, while the most used professionals were neurologists, nutritionists, speech therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and pediatricians. The main barriers included waiting lists, costs, and the absence of services or treatment. Service use varied according to age, the region of residence, type of health care system used, and the parents/caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; education. Access to behavioral interventions was more frequent among users of the private system/health insurance and families whose caregivers had higher education. The absence of specialized services/treatments was less frequent among residents of state capitals and families whose caregivers had higher levels of education. This study highlights how families with children/adolescents with ASD in Brazil face significant barriers to access care related to sociodemographic factors.</p>

	<p>Action observation (AO) combined with motor imagery (MI) was verified as more effective in improving limb function than AO or MI alone, while the underlying mechanism of swallowing was ambiguous. The study aimed at exploring the efficacy of AO combined with MI in swallowing. In this study, twelve subjects performed the motor imagery of swallowing (MI-SW) during magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanning, and trials were divided into three groups: the non-induced group (control group, CG), male AO-induced group (M-AIG), and female AO-induced group (F-AIG). We used event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) and phase locking value (PLV) to assess the degree of activation and connectivity of the brain regions during MI-SW in the three groups. The results showed that compared to CG, F-AIG and M-AIG significantly activated more brain regions in the frontoparietal, attention, visual, and cinguloopercular systems. In addition, M-AIG significantly activated the sensorimotor cortex compared to CG and F-AIG. For the brain network, F-AIG and M-AIG increased the diffusion of non-hub hot spots and cold hubs to the bilateral hemispheres which enhanced interhemispheric functional connectivity and information transmission efficiency in the MI-SW task. This study provided supporting evidence that AO induction could enhance the effect of MI-SW and supported the application of AO-induced MI-SW in clinical rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background: The recent introduction of near-infrared spectroscopy has enabled the monitoring of cerebral blood flow in real-time. Previous studies have shown that blood flow velocity is a predictor of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that cerebral oxygenation with a change in posture is a predictor for cerebral infarction. We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between postural-related changes in cerebral oxygenation and a history of chronic cerebral infarction. Methods: A total of 100 consecutive participants were enrolled in this study. We evaluated changes in cerebral oxygenation with a change in posture from the supine to the upright position in the bilateral forehead. The association between a decline in cerebral oxygenation and chronic cerebral infarction was analyzed with multiple logistic regression adjusted for covariates. Results: Cerebral blood oxygenation increased in 52 participants and decreased in 48 participants with a postural change. The prevalence of decreased cerebral oxygenation was 76.3% in participants with chronic cerebral infarction. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a decline in cerebral oxygenation upon a postural change was strongly associated with chronic cerebral infarction (adjusted odds ratio: 3.42, p = 0.025). Conclusions: Cerebral blood oxygenation upon a postural change could be a useful predictor for cerebral infarction.</p>

	<p>Sound-induced flash illusion (SiFI) is typical auditory dominance phenomenon in multisensory illusion. Although a number of studies have explored the SiFI in terms of age-related effects, the reasons for the enhanced SiFI in older adults are still controversial. In the present study, older and younger adults with equal visual discrimination were selected to explore age differences in SiFI effects, and to explore the neural indicators by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals. A correlation analysis was calculated to examine the relationship between regional homogeneity (ReHo) and the SiFI. The results showed that both younger and older adults experienced significant fission and fusion illusions, and fission illusions of older adults were greater than that of younger adults. In addition, our results showed ReHo values of the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were significantly positively correlated with the SiFI in older adults. More importantly, the comparison between older and younger adults showed that ReHo values of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) decreased in older adults, and this was independent of the SiFI. The results indicated that when there was no difference in unisensory ability, the enhancement of multisensory illusion in older adults may not always be explained by compensation mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in authorship demographics for manuscripts published in endocrine journals - A 70-year analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over the previous few decades, trends in author demographics have significantly changed. Such trends have already been studied for many sub-specialties but endocrinology is among the few branches that are yet to see an analysis of such trends. This paper aims to fill this gap.  Methods: Journal of Endocrinology and General & Comparative Endocrinology are two landmark journals that publish articles from around the world. Each decade during the 70-year period from 1961 to 2021 has been examined in this study. Funding source, first author – senior author gender, their demographics and proportion of papers with at least one female author were the parameters considered while studying each publication. It was predicted that the number of female authors per paper would increase with time, as would the range of degrees held by the authors, demographical variations in authorship, and the funding source. The aim was also to determine the distribution of female first authors and senior authors in endocrinology journals over a 70-year period, as well as to check the gender combinations using the Punnett square. Results: Female first authors rose from 7% to 29.6% (p<0.0006) between 1961 and 2021, whereas female senior authors rose from 15.6% to 22.2%. Despite women's small contributions to first and senior authors, female participation rose from 17.48% (25/143) to 70% (170/250) between 1961 and 2021. Male-Female and Female-Male combinations rose with Chi-Square = 124.6, (p<0.0001). Europe and the Americas had the most female academic medical contributors (p<0.0001) Regardless of author status, female participation rose from 17.48% in 1961 to 68% in 2021.  Conclusion: In papers published in endocrinology journals, there was a rising trend in female contributions to academic medicine. Even with the large growth of female endocrinologists, there is still a disparity in why the increase in female authors is comparably fewer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Returning to work at school during the COVID -19 pandemic, is it stressful for schoolteachers? Assessment of immediate psychological effects: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The adoption of remote classes for students has been in vogue since the onset of the pandemic. Schools reopened in a phased manner after the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India. Reverting to the regular face-to-face teaching for students became a challenge to the teachers and students, especially at times when there was an impending third wave on the way. The study aimed to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers who attended reopened schools in the scenario of face-to-face classes. In addition, we studied the association of psychological symptoms with teachers' age groups, gender, school boards, and school institution type. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October to December 2021 after schools had reopened. Data was collected using Google Form questionnaires in 124 schoolteachers. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire assessed the psychological symptoms. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers, 108(87.1%) were female, 112 (90.3%) were from private institutions, and 70(56.5%) were from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school boards. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers was 30.6%, 45.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. Nearly 80% of the female teachers expressed depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Amongst all the age groups, symptoms were higher in 40-49 group. We found anxiety to be statistically significant when compared with gender (p-0.042). We found no statistically significant differences concerning age groups, school boards, or school institutions with any psychological symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychological symptoms was high among schoolteachers after schools reopened for regular face-to-face teaching. Gender was associated with anxiety in teachers. We agree that identifying teachers' symptoms and providing adequate psychological counseling/support would improve their mental health status and thereby the quality of teaching to students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mulberroside A could serve as a pan inhibitor for the tyrosine kinase domains of the HER family [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Numerous medicines were authorized for their targeting of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of human epidermal receptors (HER). However, it has been demonstrated that these TKDs exhibit persistent resistance, necessitating the development of additional inhibitors with different modes of action. A single pharmacophore can be manipulated to create a pan-inhibitor where the binding site of these receptors has been highly conserved. The development of anti-cancer agents and the introduction of synergistic action to increase the efficacy of current medications have both recently benefited from the use of medicinal plants and herbal extracts as a reliable source. The binding affinity to the TKDs was predicted by molecular docking, followed by molecular dynamic simulation to examine the changes in the motion of the enzymes, with a focus on the components responsible for catalytic activity (C α-helix), activation (activation loop), and autophosphorylation (C-terminal loop). According to the ∆G value provided by Autodock Vina (-40.54, -40.12, -37.20, -37.62 kJ/mol for HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4, respectively) and MM/PBSA, which indicates a strong affinity for the TKDs, the outcomes are undeniably positive. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and the principal component analysis (PCA) detected significant dynamic changes in the TKDs, particularly in the C α-helix and the activation loop for all TKDs, suggesting that mulberroside A may alter the function of these enzymes. This study will expand our understanding of the dynamics of the TKDs and shed light on the anticancer potential of the polyphenolic compounds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Green campus universities: case studies on problems and prospects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sustainability is a crucial social issue. In recent years, many scholars have suggested that the issue should be tackled at universities because they act as leaders in education, research and innovation. Universities are in a good position to foster progressive action towards global issues within current and future generations. As universities seek to create sustainable campuses, the green campus approach can create opportunities for a cultural paradigm shift, where universities become global leaders in sustainability. There have been various studies related to sustainability issues that include how universities can seek to create sustainable campuses. However, there are some gaps in the research on the “green campus approach” as a way to create sustainable campuses. This paper intends to examine the problems and prospects of creating a green campus university.   Methods: Data collection was conducted using the qualitative method. Structured interviews and observations were conducted via visits to the selected case-study universities as well as panels and discussions with experts in respective ministry and government agencies. All collected data were transcribed before being analysed using the NVivo software and thematic coding.  Results: Most universities in Malaysia have plans toward sustainability and the green campus approach. The awareness of going green and creating sustainability on university campuses has gradually increased. A strategic framework is needed as a guideline for creating green campuses in the higher education setting of Malaysia.  Conclusions: This study offers new insights into creating green campus universities in Malaysia as a means to create sustainability in higher education settings. The study involved three of the oldest universities in Malaysia. Future research may expand into other universities in Malaysia or internationally.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Isolation and identification of fluoride sensitive and fluoride resistant Streptococcus mutans strains from dental carries of diabetic patients using conventional methods in Sudan. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental caries also known as cavities are the most predominant disease today. Streptococcus mutans can form a biofilm on the tooth surface, produce high levels of lactic acid following fermentation of dietary sugars, and are resistant to the adverse effects of low pH, properties which are essential for oral micro biota. The aim of this study was to isolate S. mutans and characterize their antimicrobial properties against sodium fluoride. Fresh dental caries samples were collected from diabetic patients. The isolates were identified based on their acidogenic, biochemical test, and antimicrobial properties. Methods The socio-demographic data collected through a structure designated questionnaire and the biological data collected through sterile cotton swabs. For analysis of data, Statistical Package for Social Sciences software, version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used. Results Only 32 of the 80 samples (40%) gave a positive growth for S. mutans on MSBA (mitis salivarius bacitracin agar). The sensitivity of the isolates against sodium fluoride was tested by preparing NaF of four different concentrations (80, 125, 250, and 500) mg\L. Fifty percent of isolates were found to be resistant to NaF at a concentration of 80 mg/L, while 28% were resistant to 125 mg/L NaF, 16%   to 250 mg/L and 3% to 500mg/L NaF. The majority of the participants were aged between 51–60 years (33%), were female (54%), had type II diabetes mellitus (64%), and the duration of their diabetes was less than five years (35%). Conclusions By using the information in this study, we were able to discover strains of S. mutans that are resistant to fluoride. This study can be used as an essential key to study the genetic mutation that occurred.
