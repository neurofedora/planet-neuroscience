	<p>Background: Perfectionism in adolescents can have both adaptive and maladaptive forms, with implications for mental health and school performance. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation in adolescents and to evaluate the efficacy of psychoeducational interventions. Methods: Two studies were conducted: (1) A cross-sectional study (n = 261) examined the correlations among perfectionism, mental health factors, and emotional regulation. (2) An experimental study (n = 115) evaluated the effects of psychoeducation on perfectionism and healthy habits compared with a control group. The measures included questionnaires on perfectionism, depression, anxiety, stress, and emotional regulation. Results: Study 1 found that maladaptive perfectionism was positively correlated with depression (r = 0.52, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.48, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), stress (r = 0.45, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and difficulties in emotional regulation (r = 0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Adaptive perfectionism was negatively correlated with deficits in emotional understanding (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.31, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Study 2 showed that psychoeducational interventions reduced maladaptive perfectionism (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;5.7, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.62) and depression levels (mean difference = &amp;amp;minus;3.2, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d = 0.38) but increased stress in the experimental groups. No significant changes were observed in adaptive perfectionism or the anxiety level. Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex relationships among perfectionism, mental health, and emotional regulation in adolescents. Targeted interventions can reduce maladaptive perfectionism and its associated negative effects. Further research is needed on the long-term outcomes and refinement of interventional strategies.</p>

                Xu et al. investigated the single-cell characteristics of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis and found that the pro-metastatic neutrophil cluster is enriched at the metastatic border. NFE2-driven neutrophil phenotypic polarization represents a critical pro-metastatic mechanism. TGF-β/SMAD3 activates NFE2, further promoting NET release at the invasive front by transcriptional regulation of PADI4.

                Intermittent fasting (IF) is generally associated with improved metabolism, but whether there are age-dependent limitations of IF needs to be explored. Matta et al. now demonstrate that while IF improved β cell function in old and middle-aged mice, long-term IF impaired β cell maturation and function in adolescent mice.

">Biased replay of aversive and uncertain outcomes underlies irrational decision making</a></h4>

              
                Humans often make irrational decisions when facing uncertain or aversive future events despite careful deliberation. How we make choices, including irrational ones, has been the object of extensive study both behaviourally and neurally and is the focus of influential behavioural economic theories. Yet, little is known about how these (irrational) decisions are carved out in the brain. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we show that the construction and outcome evaluation of irrational decisions involves rapid, sequential state reactivation, or "replay.". During deliberation, we show that forward replay is biased towards choice options with more negative and uncertain outcomes, with this bias further amplified immediately preceding irrational choice. Likewise, post-decision evaluation relates to replay in a choice-dependent manner. Following irrational choices, relief-like signals were evident as stronger backward replay of worse counterfactual options, while after rational decisions, regret-like signals appeared as stronger backward replay of better counterfactual options. Together, these findings suggest that neural replay shapes both the formation and reflection of irrational decisions, and poise replay as a candidate mechanism underlying pervasive decision biases in humans.

">Lipid-protecting disulfide bridges are the missing molecular link between ApoE4 and sporadic Alzheimers disease in humans</a></h4>

              
                As the principal lipid transporter in the human brain, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is tasked with the transport and protection of highly vulnerable lipids required to support and remodel neuronal membranes, in a process that is dependent on ApoE receptors. Human APOE allele variants that encode proteins differing only in the number of cysteine (Cys)-to-arginine (Arg) exchanges (ApoE2 [2 Cys], ApoE3 [1 Cys], ApoE4 [0 Cys]) comprise the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD); however, the specific molecular feature(s) and resultant mechanisms that underlie these isoform-dependent effects are unknown. One signature feature of Cys is the capacity to form disulfide (Cys-Cys) bridges, which are required to form disulfide bridge-linked dimers and multimers. Here we propose the overarching hypothesis that the super-ability (for ApoE2), intermediate ability (for ApoE3) or inability (for ApoE4) to form lipid-protecting intermolecular disulfide bridges, is the central molecular determinant accounting for the disparate effects of APOE alleles on AD risk and amyloid-{beta} and Tau pathologies in humans. We posit that presence and abundance of Cys in human ApoE3 and ApoE2 respectively, conceal and protect vulnerable lipids transported by ApoE from peroxidation by enabling formation of ApoE homo-dimers/multimers and heteromeric ApoE complexes such as ApoE-ApoJ and ApoE-ApoD. We thus propose that the inability to form intermolecular disulfide bridges makes ApoE4-containing lipoproteins uniquely vulnerable to peroxidation and its downstream consequences. Consistent with our model, we found that brain-enriched polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids induce disulfide-dependent dimerization and multimerization of ApoE3 and ApoE2 (but not ApoE4). By contrast, incubation with the artificial peroxidation-resistant lipid DMPC or cholesterol alone had minimal effects on dimerization. These novel concepts and findings are integrated into our unifying model implicating peroxidation of ApoE-containing lipoproteins, with consequent ApoE receptor-ligand disruption, as the initiating molecular events that ultimately lead to AD in humans.

">Lecanemab binds to transgenic mouse model-derived amyloid-β fibril structures resembling Alzheimer	's disease type-I, type-II and Arctic folds</a></h4>

              
                Lecanemab, an Alzheimer's disease US Food and Drug Administration approved monoclonal antibody was previously reported to have a high affinity against intermediately sized amyloid-{beta} aggregates. Subsequently, it was observed by immunogold labelling that lecanemab can also bind to human type-I amyloid-{beta} fibrils. Therefore, to determine whether lecanemab binds to amyloid-{beta} fibril structures other than type-I, we performed immunogold labelling on extracted amyloid-{beta} fibril preparations from six different Alzheimer's disease mouse models whose structures were previously solved by cryo-EM. Our results show that lecanemab exhibits high binding affinity to amyloid-{beta} fibril structures that have a flexible N-terminus in common, as it is the case for type-I, type-II and murine type-III amyloid-{beta} fibril polymorphs which resemble or are identical to human structures observed in sporadic and familial cases of Alzheimer's disease, including a case with the Arctic (E22G) mutation. In contrast, only weak, if any, lecanemab binding was observed for amyloid-{beta} fibril folds with a fixed and ordered N-terminus.

">Rescue of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory performance by Fingolimod (FTY720) in APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by correction in metabolism of sphingolipids, polyamines, and phospholipid saturation composition</a></h4>

              
                Previously, our metabolomic, transcriptomic, and genomic studies characterized the ceramide/sphingomyelin pathway as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, and we demonstrated that FTY720, a sphingosine-1-phospahate receptor modulator approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis, recovers synaptic plasticity and memory in APP/PS1 mice. To further investigate how FTY720 rescues the pathology, we performed metabolomic analysis in brain, plasma, and liver of trained APP/PS1 and wild-type mice. APP/PS1 mice showed area-specific brain disturbances in polyamines, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Most changes were completely or partially normalized in FTY720-treated subjects, indicating rebalancing the "sphingolipid rheostat", reactivating phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase pathway, and normalizing polyamine levels that support mitochondrial activity. Synaptic plasticity and memory were rescued, with spermidine synthesis in temporal cortex best corresponding to hippocampal CA3-CA1 plasticity normalization. FTY720 effects, also reflected in other pathways, are consistent with promotion of mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, and anti-inflammatory environment, while reducing pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signals.

">Microglial SIRT2 deficiency aggravates cognitive decline and amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While global SIRT2 inhibition has shown promise in reducing amyloid-beta pathology and cognitive deficits in different mouse models of AD, peripheral SIRT2 inhibition has been associated with adverse effects, such as increased inflammation. This suggests that targeted inhibition of specific cellular populations within the brain may represent a more precise and effective approach for the treatment of AD. To explore this hypothesis, we generated a conditional microglial SIRT2 knockout mouse model in the context of AD. Our results reveal that microglial SIRT2 reduction does not confer protective effects in the APP/PS1 model; rather, it aggravates cognitive decline, accelerates amyloid plaque deposition, and increases levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at early stages of AD pathology. Transcriptomic analysis further indicates that SIRT2-deficient microglia exhibit altered expression of genes associated with aging and synaptic dysfunction. This phenotype was accompanied by increased phagocytosis of synaptic elements and impaired long-term potentiation. These findings suggest that while SIRT2 inhibition in some contexts may be beneficial, targeted inhibition within microglia could accelerate AD progression, underscoring the need for cell-specific approaches when considering SIRT2 as a therapeutic target.

">Impact of meningioma and glioma on whole-brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Brain tumors, particularly meningiomas and gliomas, can profoundly affect neural function, yet their impact on brain dynamics remains incompletely understood. This study investigates alterations in normal brain function among meningioma and glioma patients by assessing dynamical complexity through the Intrinsic Ignition Framework. We analyzed resting-state fMRI data from 34 participants to quantify brain dynamics using intrinsic ignition and metastability metrics. Our results revealed distinct patterns of disruption: glioma patients showed significant reductions in both metrics compared to controls, indicating widespread network disturbances. In contrast, meningioma patients exhibited significant changes predominantly in regions with substantial tumor involvement. Resting-state network analysis demonstrated strong metastability and metastability/ignition correlations between regions in controls, which were slightly weakened in meningioma patients and severely disrupted in glioma patients. These findings highlight the differential impacts of gliomas and meningiomas on brain function, offering insights into their distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, these results show that brain dynamics metrics can be effective biomarkers for identifying disruptions in brain information transmission caused by tumors.

">Efficacy of functional connectome fingerprinting using tangent-space brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectomes (FCs) are estimations of brain region interaction derived from brain activity, often obtained from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging recordings. Quantifying the distance between FCs is important for understanding the relation between behaviour, disorders, disease, and changes in connectivity. Recently, tangent space projections, which account for the curvature of the mathematical space of FCs, have been proposed for calculating FC distances. We compare the efficacy of this approach relative to the traditional method in the context of subject identification using the Midnight Scan Club dataset, in order to study resting-state and task-based subject discriminability. The tangent space method is found to universally out-perform the traditional method. We also focus on the subject identification efficacy of subnetworks. Certain subnetworks are found to outperform others, a dichotomy which largely follows the `control' and `processing' categorization of resting state networks, and relates subnetwork flexibility with subject discriminability. Identification efficacy is also modulated by tasks, though certain subnetworks appear task independent. The uniquely long recordings of the dataset also allow for explorations of resource requirements for effective subject identification. The tangent space method is found to universally require less data, making it well suited when only short recordings are available.

">Post-movement beta rebound reflects strategic re-aiming during motor adaptation, but not re-aiming accuracy</a></h4>

              
                Motor adaptation results from several interacting learning mechanisms, including learning via cognitive strategies and implicit adaptation. While strategy-based and implicit learning can be dissociated at a behavioural level, their underlying systems-level physiology is poorly understood. A neural signal that undergoes pronounced changes during motor adaptation is the post-movement beta-rebound (PMBR). However, it is unclear how these changes relate to the specific learning mechanisms that contribute to motor adaptation. We measured electroencephalography (EEG) while healthy participants (N=27) performed reaching movements towards a target. In most trials, a cursor showed the veridical position of the unseen hand, however, for some reaches, the direction of the cursor was rotated relative to the position of the hand. Participants were informed that, once a rotation occurred, it could persist for a single trial (1x condition), or for two consecutive trial (2x condition). In the 2x condition, participants could therefore redirect the rotated cursor through the target in the second rotated trial by re-aiming, while they had to continue aiming at the target in the 1x condition. We observed a stronger decrease of PMBR following the first rotated reach in the 2x condition, compared to the 1x condition, despite similar kinematics. This corroborates our previous results that PMBR reflects strategic re-aiming (Korka et al., 2023). However, when we collapsed data from the two studies (total N=53), we found that the degree to which the PMBR decreases does not predict re-aiming accuracy. We discuss the role of PMBR in motor adaptation, including implications for clinical disorders.

">Cholinergic Modulation of Chandelier Cells via Heteromeric Nicotinic Receptors in Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a distinct subtype of GABAergic interneurons that form vertical arrays of presynaptic boutons targeting the axon initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal neurons (PNs). They are particularly abundant in prefrontal cortex, where cholinergic inputs modulate cognitive functions and shape ChC axonal development. However, the effects of the cholinergic system on ChC activity in the adult brain remain largely unexplored. Here, using a genetic intersectional strategy (VipR2-Pvalb-Ai65) in adult mice, we selectively labeled ChCs in the secondary motor cortex (M2). Immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology confirmed morphological and functional properties distinguishing them from basket cells. We found that these ChCs exhibit an inward current in response to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. Pharmacological blockade and fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that this effect is primarily mediated by heteromeric nAChRs containing {beta}2 subunits, with a smaller contribution from 3 subunits. Optogenetic stimulation of basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic axons evoked inward currents in ChCs, confirming a functional cholinergic drive. Furthermore, in vivo two-photon calcium imaging revealed a strong correlation between ChC activity and behavioral markers of arousal, including locomotion and pupil dilation. Importantly, the application of nicotinic receptor antagonists significantly diminished ChC activity during movement. Together, these results indicate that ChCs are modulated by cholinergic input via heteromeric nAChRs, emphasizing their importance in facilitating state-dependent cortical dynamics.

">Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 protects neurons from Sarm1-mediated neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                The Sarm1 NAD+ hydrolase drives neurodegeneration in many contexts, but how Sarm1 activity is regulated remains poorly defined. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we found loss of VHL suppressed Sarm1-mediated cellular degeneration. VHL normally promotes O2-dependent constitutive ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), but during hypoxia, HIF-1 is stabilized and regulates gene expression. We observed neuroprotection after depletion of VHL or other factors required for HIF-1 degradation, and expression of a non-ubiquitinated HIF-1 variant led to even stronger blockade of axon degeneration in mammals and Drosophila. Neuroprotection required HIF-1 DNA binding, prolonged expression, and resulted in broad gene expression changes. Unexpectedly, stabilized HIF-1 prevented the precipitous NAD+ loss driven by Sarm1 activation in neurons, despite NAD+ hydrolase activity being intrinsic to the Sarm1 TIR domain. Our work argues hypoxia inhibits Sarm1 activity through HIF-1 driven transcriptional changes, rendering neurons less sensitive to Sarm1-mediated neurodegeneration when in a hypoxic state.

">Fentanyl blockade of K+ channels contribute to Wooden Chest Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid widely used perioperatively and illicitly as a drug of abuse. It is well established that fentanyl acts as a -opioid receptor agonist, signaling through Gi/o intracellular pathways to inhibit electrical excitability, resulting in analgesia and respiratory depression. However, fentanyl uniquely also triggers muscle rigidity, including respiratory muscles, hindering the ability to execute central respiratory commands or to receive external resuscitation. This potentially lethal condition is termed Wooden Chest Syndrome (WCS), the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Here we show that fentanyl directly blocks a subset of EAG-class potassium channels. Our results also demonstrate that these channels are widely expressed in cervical spinal motoneurons, including those innervating the diaphragm. A significant fraction of these motoneurons is excited by fentanyl, concomitant with blockade of voltage-dependent non-inactivating K+ currents. In vivo electromyography revealed a persistent tonic component of diaphragmatic muscle activity elicited by fentanyl, but not morphine. Taken together our results identify a novel off-target mechanism for fentanyl action, independent of -opioid receptor activation, with a paradoxical excitatory effect that may underlie WCS. We anticipate these findings may inform the design of safer analgesics and generalize to other neuronal circuits implicated in fentanyl-related maladaptive behaviors.

                Nerve transfer surgery is a state-of-the-art surgical approach to restore hand and arm function in individuals living with tetraplegia, significantly impacting daily life. While nearly a third of all individuals with chronic SCI may benefit from this intervention, variability in outcomes can limit the functional impact. A bedside-to-bench approach was taken to address the variable response of tetraplegic individuals to nerve transfer surgery. We used a hierarchical multiple factor analysis to evaluate the effects of conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) on outcomes in a mouse model of nerve transfer to treat chronic cervical spinal cord injury. We found that CES of donor nerves one week prior to nerve transfer surgery enhanced anatomical and functional measures of innervation of targeted muscles. Furthermore, CES increased the rate of recovery of naturalistic behavior. While the model has some limitations due to the small size of the rodent, our results support the use of CES as an effective approach to improve outcomes in clinical nerve repair settings.

                Mechanisms that trigger A{beta} production in sporadic Alzheimer's disease are still obscure. We recently reported the expression of a human circular RNA (circA{beta}-a) encoded A{beta} peptide precursor variant (A{beta}175). Presently, we demonstrated that AAV9 virus-expressed circA{beta}-a gave rise to extensive extracellular A{beta} plaque depositions and microglial activation in mouse brain; this recapitulates critical pathogenic hallmarks within a sporadic AD mouse model. Specifically developed antibodies detected robust endogenous A{beta}175 expression in HEK293 cells and hNSC-derived human neurons, underscoring the potential of A{beta}175 as a salient A{beta} precursor. Furthermore, we detected high levels of A{beta}175 oligomers in young-adult human brains. In intermediate and old-age human brain samples, accumulation of soluble A{beta}175 pentamers was reduced and A{beta}175 oligomers were components of most insoluble A{beta} plaques in older human brain. We propose a causal relationship between human circA{beta}-a RNA expression, dysregulation of A{beta}175 oligomer processing/aggregation and A{beta} plaque accumulation in sporadic AD.

                Rationale: WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is a gene associated implicated in both neurologic and inflammatory diseases and is susceptible to environmental stressors. We hypothesize partial loss of Wwox function will result in increased sepsis severity and neuroinflammation. Methods: Wwox WT/P47T mice, generated by CRISPR/Cas9, and Wwox WT/WT mice were treated with intraperitoneal PBS vs LPS (10mg/kg) and euthanized 12 hours post-injection. Open Field Testing (OFT) and Murine Sepsis Severity Scores (MSS) were utilized to measure sickness behavior and sepsis severity, respectively. Brain tissue was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and PCR to measure neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Results: Wwox WT/P47T LPS mice demonstrated a more significant response to sepsis with an increase in sickness behavior, sepsis severity, gliosis, and apoptosis compared to Wwow WT/WT LPS littermates. Conclusions: Partial loss of Wwox function increases risk for severe sepsis and neuroinflammation. Given the susceptibility of WWOX to environmental stressors, this may be a target for future therapeutic interventions.

                Sleep entails significant changes in cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism. Yet, the way these processes evolve throughout wakefulness and sleep and their spatiotemporal dependence remain largely unknown. Here, by integrating a novel functional PET technique with simultaneous EEG-fMRI, we reveal a tightly coupled temporal progression of global hemodynamics and metabolism during the descent into NREM sleep, with large hemodynamic fluctuations emerging as global glucose metabolism declines, both of which track EEG arousal dynamics. Furthermore, we identify two distinct network patterns that emerge during NREM sleep: an oscillating, high-metabolism sensorimotor network remains active and dynamic, whereas hemodynamic and metabolic activity in the default-mode network is suppressed. These results elucidate how sleep diminishes awareness while preserving sensory responses, and uncover a complex, alternating balance of neuronal, hemodynamic, and metabolic dynamics in the sleeping brain. This work also demonstrates the potential of EEG-PET-MRI to explore neuro-hemo-metabolic dynamics underlying cognition and arousal in humans.

">Functional organization of the neonatal thalamus across development depicted by functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is a central component of the brain that is involved in a variety of functions, from sensory processing to high-order cognition. Its structure and function in the first weeks of extrauterine life, including its connections to different cortical and subcortical areas, have not yet been widely explored. Here, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 730 newborns from the developing Human Connectome Project to study the functional organization of the thalamus from 37 to 44 post-conceptual weeks. We introduce KNIT: K-means for Nuclei in Infant Thalamus. The framework employs a highly granular vector space of 40 features, each corresponding to functional connectivity to a brain region, using k-means clustering and uncertainty quantification through bootstrapping to delineate thalamic units. Although the different clusters showed common patterns of increased connectivity to the superior temporal gyrus, the parietal, and the frontal cortex, implying an expected decrease in specialization at that age, they also show some specificity. That is, a pulvinar unit was identified, similar to the adult thalamus. Ventrolateral motor and medial salience units were also highlighted. The latter appeared around 41 weeks of age, while the former showed at least from 37 weeks, but had a decrease in volume through age, replaced mostly by a dominant dorsal thalamic unit. We also observed an increase in clustering robustness and in hemispheric bilateral symmetry with age, suggesting more specialized functional units. We also found a burst in global thalamic connectivity around 41 weeks. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of this method in terms of granularity compared to the more conventional winner-takes-all approach.

">Postnatal reduction of eIF4E overexpression in D1-SPNs ameliorates KCNQ dysfunction, hyperexcitability and ASD-like behaviours.</a></h4>

              
                An imbalance between the direct and indirect pathways of the striatum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD, which corresponds with an increase in repetitive behaviours and hyperactivity. The ASD risk gene EIF4E promotes translation, and its overexpression in mice increases repetitive behaviours and hyperactivity. We used the eIF4E-transgenic mouse model of ASD to study cell-type specific disruptions in the direct and indirect pathways using fibre photometry, electrophysiology, conditional gene silencing, and behavioural analysis. We found that direct pathway SPNs activity increased during exploratory behaviour and identified D1-SPN hyperexcitability and reduced KCNQ channel function in striatal slices. Reduction of eIF4E specifically in the D1-SPNs of adult mice normalised KCNQ function, D1-SPN hyperexcitability and ameliorated repetitive and hyperactive behaviours. Our results highlight the critical role of eIF4E in ASD-associated motor behaviours, elucidate cell-specific mechanisms driving hyperactivity and provide new insight into potential therapeutic targets for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, this study underscores the translational potential of modulating protein synthesis pathways to address core motor symptoms in ASD.

">Differential regulation of brain-specific molecular pathways is the reason for curcumin adult life-phase specific DAergic neuroprotection: Insights from ALSS Drosophila model of Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                Curcumin (CU), a bioactive compound of turmeric, has been put forward as a golden molecule due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and anti-cancer ability, as proven by research conducted over the decade and more. Our laboratory, developed an adult life stage specific (ALSS) Drosophila model of sporadic Parkinson disease (PD), and for first time demonstrated that dopaminergic (DAergic) neuroprotective efficacy of curcumin is limited to health phase viz. adult-young life stage and is absent during transition phase viz. adult senior life stages when PD set in. This observation suggests the limitation of curcumin as a therapeutic agent for late-onset disorders like PD. Further, our laboratory also demonstrated that despite curcumin ability to sequester oxidative stress during both the adult life stages, neuroprotection and brain dopamine replenishment is granted only in health stages but not in a vulnerable transition stage, which prompted to put forward the hypothesis that the molecular target(s) of CU, may be absent or inadequate in the transition stage of aging brain. With this insight, the current study was implemented to analyse the life stage-specific differential regulation of multiple molecular players of neuro-integral pathways in brain of ALSS Drosophila model of PD with curcumin intervention. It is discovered that curcumin-mediated health phase-specific neuroprotection underlies the correction of an altered expression of 1. dFOXO, GADD45, Puc of Bsk-dFOXO stress response pathway, 2. Mfn2 of Mitochondrial dynamics 3. CncC, GCLC, Prx 2540 -1,2, Jafrac1, Prx3 of Phase II antioxidant defense system pathway. Further, it is discovered that significant aging-associated naturally altered expression of certain molecular targets exists, that may contribute to the limitation of curcumin DAergic neuroprotective efficacy during the adult-transition stage. This knowledge will help in developing altered therapeutic strategies for PD as molecular targets of curcumin are conserved among fly, mice and human.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sexual minority older adults (SMOAs) report greater subjective cognitive decline (SCD) than heterosexual older adults (HOAs). This study aimed to compare the impact of multiple psycho-social risk factors on objective and subjective cognitive decline in HOAs and SMOAs. Methods: Two samples of self-identified HOAs and SMOAs were selected from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Reliable change indices for episodic and semantic memory were created to assess cognitive decline. SCD was self-reported for memory and general cognition. Depressive symptoms, loneliness, marital status and socio-economic status were investigated as risk factors. Results: No between-group differences were found in cognitive decline. Higher depression was associated with greater SCD risk and worse semantic memory decline. The latter effect was stronger in SMOAs. The findings were largely replicated in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Poor mental health may represent the strongest driver of cognitive decline in SMOAs and to a greater extent than in HOAs.</p>

	<p>Background: Tramadol (TRA) is an opioid that is used to manage moderate to severe pain. Long-term use of TRA can lead to the development of opioid use disorder. Objectives: This study investigates the role of forced exercise in reducing TRA-seeking behavior. Methods: Adult male rats (240&amp;amp;ndash;260 g) were divided into five groups; the control group received vehicle injections, the TRA group received TRA (75 mg/kg, i.p) every other day for 8 days, and three TRA&amp;amp;ndash;exercise groups were forced to run on a treadmill (60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 2, 4, or 6 weeks prior to conditioning with TRA. A tramadol-conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure assessed TRA reinforcement, after which all rats were euthanized, tissue extracted, and mRNA expression for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1&amp;amp;beta;) determined in hippocampus (Hipp), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Results: TRA-seeking behavior was seen in the TRA group and the 6 weeks forced exercise group. By contrast, forced exercise for 2 or 4 weeks attenuated TRA-seeking behavior. This attenuation was associated with a significant increase in Bdnf mRNA expression in the Hipp and NAc, but not the PFC. Additionally, the TRA-induced elevations in Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression were reversed by all durations of exercise in Hipp. However, only 2 and 4 weeks, but not 6 weeks, of exercise reduced elevations in PFC and NAc Il-1&amp;amp;beta; expression. Conclusion: Forced exercise for 2 and 4 weeks attenuates TRA-seeking behavior partially through the regulation of Bdnf and Il-1&amp;amp;beta; mRNA expression.</p>

                <p>The subjective visual vertical (VV), the visually estimated direction of gravity, is essential for assessing vestibular function and visuospatial cognition. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying altered VV perception in stroke participants with unilateral spatial neglect (USN), specifically by examining their eye movement patterns during VV judgment tasks. Participants with USN demonstrated limited eye movement scanning along a rotating bar, often fixating on prominent ends, such as the top or bottom. This suggests a reflexive response to visually salient areas, potentially interfering with accurate VV perception. In contrast, participants without USN showed broader scanning around the center of the bar. Notably, participants with USN without frontal lobe lesions occasionally exhibited extended scanning that included the bar&rsquo;s center, which was associated with accurate VV judgments. These findings suggest that (1) a tendency to fixate on peripheral, prominent areas and (2) frontal lobe involvement in disengaging and redirecting spatial attention may influence VV perception in USN. Based on these results, targeted rehabilitation strategies that encourage individuals with USN to extend their visual scanning beyond prominent endpoints and include central areas could improve VV accuracy. This study highlights the specific eye movement behaviors contributing to VV misperception, emphasizing the importance of training that broadens scanning to improve VV perception effectively.</p>

                <p>A comprehensive analysis of everyday sound perception can be achieved using electroencephalography (EEG) with the concurrent acquisition of information about the environment. While extensive research has been dedicated to speech perception, the complexities of auditory perception within everyday environments, specifically the types of information and the key features to extract, remain less explored. Our study aims to systematically investigate the relevance of different feature categories: discrete sound-identity markers, general cognitive state information, and acoustic representations, including discrete sound onset, the envelope, and mel-spectrogram. Using continuous data analysis, we contrast different features in terms of their predictive power for unseen data and thus their distinct contributions to explaining neural data. For this, we analyze data from a complex audio-visual motor task using a naturalistic soundscape. The results demonstrated that the feature sets that explain the most neural variability were a combination of highly detailed acoustic features with a comprehensive description of specific sound onsets. Furthermore, it showed that established features can be applied to complex soundscapes. Crucially, the outcome hinged on excluding periods devoid of sound onsets in the analysis in the case of the discrete features. Our study highlights the importance to comprehensively describe the soundscape, using acoustic and non-acoustic aspects, to fully understand the dynamics of sound perception in complex situations. This approach can serve as a foundation for future studies aiming to investigate sound perception in natural settings.</p>

                <p>Alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure are commonly found in migraine patients. Here, we employ a longitudinal study of episodic migraine without aura using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate whether such WM microstructure alterations vary through the different phases of the pain cycle. Fourteen patients with episodic migraine without aura related with menstruation were scanned through four phases of their (spontaneous) migraine cycle (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal). Fifteen healthy controls were studied in the corresponding phases of the menstrual cycle. Multishell dMRI data were acquired and preprocessed to obtain maps of diffusion parameters reflecting WM microstructure. After a whole-brain analysis comparing patients with controls, a region-of-interest analysis was performed to determine whether the patients&rsquo; microstructural changes varied across the migraine cycle in specific WM tracts. Compared with controls, patients showed reduced axial diffusivity (AD) in several WM tracts across the whole brain in the interictal phase and increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in commissural fibers in the ictal phase. Interestingly, AD returned to baseline levels during peri-ictal phases in specific projection and association fibers. In contrast, FA values decreased in the ictal phase away from normal values in a few commissural and projection tracts. Widespread WM fiber tracts suffer structural variations across the migraine cycle, suggesting microstructural changes potentially associated with limbic and salience functional networks and highlighting the importance of the cycle phase in imaging studies of migraine.</p>

                <p>Psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are highly comorbid in people with epilepsy. However, the mechanisms mediating the shared pathophysiology are currently unknown. There is considerable evidence implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the network communication of anxiety and fear, a process demonstrated to involve parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. The loss of PV interneurons has been well described in the hippocampus of chronically epileptic mice and in postmortem human tissue of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We hypothesize that a loss of PV interneurons in the BLA may contribute to comorbid mood disorders in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model of TLE in mice, which exhibits profound behavioral deficits associated with chronic epilepsy. We demonstrate a loss of PV interneurons and dysfunction of the remaining PV interneurons in the BLA of chronically epileptic mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate altered principal neuron function and impaired coordination of BLA network and behavioral states in chronically epileptic mice. To determine whether the loss of PV interneurons contributes to these altered network and behavioral states, we partially ablated PV interneurons in the BLA by stereotaxically injecting AAV-Flex-DTA into the BLA of PV-Cre mice. Loss of PV interneurons in the BLA is sufficient to alter behavioral states, such as increasing avoidance behaviors and impairing fear learning. These data suggest that compromised inhibition in the BLA in chronically epileptic mice may contribute to behavioral deficits, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to comorbid anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy&ndash;aphasia syndrome (EAS) is a spectrum of childhood disorders that exhibit complex comorbidities that include epilepsy and the emergence of cognitive and language disorders. CNKSR2 is an X-linked gene in which mutations are linked to EAS. We previously demonstrated Cnksr2 knock-out (KO) mice model key phenotypes of EAS analogous to those present in clinical patients with mutations in the gene. Cnksr2 KO mice have increased seizures, impaired learning and memory, increased levels of anxiety, and loss of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). The intricate interplay between these diverse phenotypes at the brain regional and cell-type level remains unknown. Here, we leverage conditional deletion of the X-linked Cnksr2 in a neuronal cell-type manner in male mice to demonstrate that anxiety and impaired USVs track with its loss from excitatory neurons. Finally, we further narrow the essential role of Cnksr2 loss in USV deficits to excitatory neurons of the ACC, a region in mice recently implicated in USV production associated with specific emotional states or social contexts, such as mating calls, distress calls, or social bonding signals. Together, our results reveal Cnksr2-based mechanisms that underlie USV impairments that suggest communication impairments can be dissociated from seizures or anxiety. Furthermore, we highlight the cortical circuitry important for initiating USVs.</p>

                Aim To determine the influencing factors of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) perceived by North-African children/adolescents with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and their parents. Methods It was a cross sectional study conducted in Tunisia. A total of 116 patients ( ie ; 43 children and 73 adolescents) and their parents were included. The Arabic validated version of the Pediatric Generic Core Quality-of-Life Inventory 4.0-Scale (PedsQL4.0) was used to evaluate the HRQoL of children/adolescents as perceived by patients and parents. The dependent data were the patients’ self-report and the parents’ proxy-report of the PedsQL4.0 total scores, and the independent data were the patients and parents characteristics. Results Patients’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The combination of these factors explained 34.84% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Parents’ PedsQL4.0 total score was influenced significantly by lipodystrophy, siblings; body mass index (BMI), hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C. The combination of these factors explained 56.92% of the PedsQL4.0 total score variability. Conclusion T1DM patients self-reported HRQoL was influenced by siblings in the family > 2; lipodystrophy, and HbA1C. The parents’ proxy-report HRQoL was influenced by lipodystrophy, siblings, BMI, hypoglycemia episodes, and HbA1C.

                Introduction Recent reports indicate the emergence of community-acquired pneumonia associated with K64- Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Here, we identify the capsular types and sequence type of invasive and commensal K. pneumoniae isolates from Vietnam. Methods We included 93 K. pneumoniae isolates from patients hospitalized at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Hanoi between 2007 and 2011; and 110 commensal isolates from throat swabs from healthy volunteers living in rural and urban Hanoi in 2012. We determined sequence types (STs) by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and capsule typing for seven K types by PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion. Results The most common detected capsule types were K1 (39/203, 19.2%, mainly ST23) and K2 (31/203, 15.3%, multiple STs: ST65, ST86, ST380). We found significantly more K2 isolates among invasive in comparison to commensal isolates (22.6% vs 9%, p = 0.01) but no significant difference was observed between invasive and commensal K1 isolates (14.5% vs 24.7%, p = 0.075). K64 with varying sequence types were predominantly seen among invasive K. pneumoniae (8 vs. 3) and were isolated from sepsis and meningitis patients. Among K64 isolates, one was carbapenem-resistant with ST799. Conclusion Our study confirms that capsule type K64 K. pneumoniae is associated with community-acquired invasive infections in Vietnam. Research is needed to unravel the mechanisms of virulence of capsule type K64 in both community and hospital settings.

                Background Rehabilitation services are necessary for many people with disabilities to improve their functioning and be included in society. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services among people with disabilities in Chile in 2015. Methods This cross-sectional analysis of secondary data from Chile’s 2015 Second National Disability Study (ENDISC II) included people with disabilities aged ≥18 years. The dependent variable was the use of rehabilitation services in the previous year, and the exposure variables were sociodemographic and confounders. Poisson regression was used to determine associated factors, and prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. All results were weighted according to the ENDISC II complex sampling. Results A total of 2610 people with disabilities were included, and 19.1% used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. Educational level (PR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25–0.75), having a mental illness (PR 1.77; 95% CI 1.44–2.18), and caregiver assistance (PR 1.57; 95% CI 1.25–1.97) were factors associated with the use of rehabilitation services. Conclusions In 2015, one-fifth of people with disabilities in Chile used some rehabilitation services in the previous year. People with disabilities with lower educational levels were less likely to access these services. By contrast, people with mental illness and caregiver assistance were more likely to use rehabilitation services.

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring. Conclusion Ethiopian forests are home for various yeast species including the stress-tolerant wild yeasts. This study highlights the significant yeast diversity in Ethiopian forests, with potential applications in improving industrial fermentation processes that operate under stressful conditions.

                Background This study investigates chloride concentrations in tap water samples from Gimba city administration, using the argentometric method to assess water quality. Chloride levels are a key indicator of water treatment effectiveness, particularly the adequacy of chlorination, which is critical for preventing waterborne diseases. Methods Chloride concentrations in tap water samples from various locations in Gimba city administration, were determined using the argentometric titration method. Silver nitrate (AgNO₃) was employed as the titrant to precisely quantify chloride ions. The water samples were collected from different sites in Gimba, and chloride levels were measured to evaluate the adequacy of water treatment processes. Results The chloride concentrations across all samples ranged from 52.8 mg/L to 71.9 mg/L, well below the World Health Organization’s recommended limit for drinking water. Significant variation in chloride levels was observed, with Dembesh exhibiting the highest concentration and Medera the lowest. Conclusion The low chloride concentrations suggest insufficient chlorination at the sampling sites, which may compromise the effectiveness of water disinfection and contribute to the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the region. The study underscores the need for enhanced water treatment and disinfection practices in Gimba city to ensure safe drinking water and reduce health risks.

                Backgrounds Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health issue in Indonesia, ranking second globally in TB incidence in 2021. Diagnosing intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) is challenging due to its symptoms, which mimic other diseases, limited laboratory tests, and the need for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive laboratory panel for ITB using various biomarkers. Methods A cross-sectional study from November 2020 to December 2022 was carried out at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Central General Hospital. Laboratory parameters from 143 subjects were identified by Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis. The scoring system was developed based on the identified independent diagnostic parameters scored by regression coefficient β value and standard errors, with the cut-off value determined by the ROC curve. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system were determined using the ROC curve. Results Among 143 subjects, 22 were diagnosed with ITB and 121 Non-ITB (prevalence of 15.38%). This study was dominated by females (65.03%), with a ratio of 1.86: 1. The median age in this study was 41 years. The scoring system to differentiate ITB and Non-ITB consisted of 6 diagnostic parameters (referred to as the HEALTH scoring system) as follows: stool HBD-2 (1 and 0 points), ESR (1 and 0 points), blood ADA activity (1 and 0 points), Lymphocyte (0 and 1 point), stool TB PCR (2 and 0 points), and NLR (1 and 0 points). Subjects with scores ≥ 4 could be diagnosed as ITB. The sensitivity and specificity of the HEALTH scoring system were 68.18% and 95.04%, respectively. Conclusion This study developed and validated a laboratory panel called the HEALTH scoring system based on clinical biomarkers of stool HBD-2 level, ESR, blood ADA activity, lymphocytes, stool TB PCR, and NLR, which could be used to differentiate ITB from other gastrointestinal diseases.

                Background This study analyzed the nexus between rural household welfare and agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia using secondary data from the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey (ESS). The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in Ethiopia’s economy, contributing significantly to income, consumption, and employment. This research aims to analyze how adopting agricultural technologies such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation affects poverty and food insecurity among rural households. The research examined poverty and food insecurity levels in Ethiopia and investigates the impact of adopting agricultural technologies on rural household welfare. Methods We used both Descriptive and econometric methods, in which descriptive analysis has been used to assess poverty and food insecurity levels, and a seemingly unrelated bivariate and multivariate probit model applied to analyze the effect of agricultural technology adoption. Result From descriptive summary, it is noted that out of a total sample of the study, 47.61% (2322 out of 4877) are adopting agricultural technologies in many forms more than 70% of female-headed households are food secured and non-poor and 68% of male-headed households are food secured and nun poor. The findings from regression model indicate that access to irrigation, improved seeds, and fertilizers significantly reduces the likelihood of poverty and food insecurity among rural households. Conclusion Based on these results, policy recommendations include promoting agricultural technologies, enhancing access to credit, investing in agricultural extension services, diversifying livelihoods, improving education, and implementing targeted poverty alleviation programs. Further research is encouraged to explore the reasons behind insignificant variables and to identify additional factors affecting rural household welfare in Ethiopia.

                Background This study was designed to investigate the mediation effects of social empowerment (SE) in the relationship between perceived social support (PSS) and life satisfaction (LS) in women self-help group members. Also, this research attempted to understand the moderating effect of decision making (DM) and external communication (EC) on the relationship between the constructs. Methods To achieve the above objective, the primary data were collected from the self-help group women members by using an existing scale. In this survey, 333 participants who are members of self-help group completed the questionnaire and considered for the study. The study is non-experimental and survey-based, with no interventions or manipulations involved. In line with ethical guidelines, we obtained informed consent directly from each respondent before their participation. Conclusion The path coefficient values, t-statistics and P-Values confirmed the positive relationship between PSS->LS; PSS->SE & SE->LS in women self-group members. PLS structural equation modelling estimated by the bootstrap method revealed that SE partially mediates the relationship between PSS & LS. With regard to the interaction effect, the slope analysis and f2 effect size confirmed the moderating effect of EC in the relationship between PSS -> LS & SE -> LS.

                Background Sustainable modular dwelling design for rural areas should focus on creating healthy and economically accessible spaces, sensitive to local needs and integrating environmental, functional, sociological and technological aspects. Flexibility is essential to reduce the initial investment and allow future transformations, optimizing the recovery and reuse of materials. These houses must be adaptable, safe and have basic services, satisfying the needs and stages of families’ development. In Ecuador, poverty and energy inefficiency worsen the quality of life in rural areas. This project in the Cebadas parish proposes modular dwelling that applies bioclimatic and sustainable criteria, using local materials to improve habitability and promote the social and economic development of the community. Method The research approach is qualitative-quantitative. Qualitative, since it is necessary to identify the qualities of the sector, bibliographic exploration of guidelines and sustainable strategies. Quantitative, to evaluate the degree of affectation through a diagnosis of the study site and to provide efficient solutions that respond to the context and social reality. Results The spaces presented in the proposal respond to the spatial need for growth and expansion of the users of the sector, through 6 basic guidelines that this type of dwelling should have: Environment, Visual, Form, Function, Bioclimatic and Materials. Conclusions The flexible modular dwelling project for rural environments addresses complex housing needs, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability of an expandable module. It includes income generation with a duplex apartment, fosters communal and cultural life with public and commercial spaces, promotes tourism and rural development with landscape design and crops.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-100/v1?src=rss">Optimizing machine learning performance for medical imaging analyses in low-resource environments: The prospects of CNN-based Feature Extractors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Machine learning (ML) algorithms have generally enhanced the speed and accuracy of image-based diagnosis, and treatment strategy planning, compared to the traditional approach of interpreting medical images by experienced radiologists. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been particularly useful in this regard. However, training CNNs come with significant time and computational cost necessitating the development of efficient solutions for deploying CNNs in low-resource environments. This study investigates the use of pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors in medical imaging analyses and highlights the key considerations to be taken into account when implementing these extractors. Methods Eight medical imaging datasets covering several diseases (e.g. breast cancer, brain tumor and malaria) were used. Five ML algorithms (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forests and light gradient boosting machine) were implemented with three pre-trained CNN models (VGG-16, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet-50). These pre-trained models were deployed as feature extractors fed into the classifiers for image classification tasks. The performance of these classifiers was assessed using a ten-fold cross validation scheme with metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, Matthews’ correlation coefficient (MCC), precision, time and space complexities. Results From our experiments, we found a general improvement in ML models’ performance after feature extraction (FE). Of the three FE models tested,EfficientNet-B0 performed best in terms of predicitve performance i.e. accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, AUC-ROC, MCC, F1 score, and precision. However, VGG-16 had the best performance in terms of time and memory efficiency. Our results identify two conditions necessary for the optimal performance of the FE models; (i) balanced datasets - a set where classes or categories are represented in approximately equal proportions, (ii) big data sets - adequate number of objects for training and testing. Interestingly, the performance of the ML models did not correlate with the number of class labels i.e. the type of classification task whether binary or multi-class had no influence in the models’ performance. Of the five algorithms investigated, logistic regression benefitted the most from the adoption of the feature extractors. Conclusion Our results confirm that the use of CNNs as feature extractors offer an effective balance between high performance and computational efficiency, making them well-suited for use in low-resource environments.

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                <p>by Jiang Mao, Constantin A Rothkopf, Alan A Stocker</p>

Sensory neurons continually adapt their response characteristics according to recent stimulus history. However, it is unclear how such a reactive process can benefit the organism. Here, we test the hypothesis that adaptation actually acts proactively in the sense that it optimally adjusts sensory encoding for future stimuli. We first quantified human subjects’ ability to discriminate visual orientation under different adaptation conditions. Using an information theoretic analysis, we found that adaptation leads to a reallocation of coding resources such that encoding accuracy peaks at the mean orientation of the adaptor while total coding capacity remains constant. We then asked whether this characteristic change in encoding accuracy is predicted by the temporal statistics of natural visual input. Analyzing the retinal input of freely behaving human subjects showed that the distribution of local visual orientations in the retinal input stream indeed peaks at the mean orientation of the preceding input history (i.e., the adaptor). We further tested our hypothesis by analyzing the internal sensory representations of a recurrent neural network trained to predict the next frame of natural scene videos (PredNet). Simulating our human adaptation experiment with PredNet, we found that the network exhibited the same change in encoding accuracy as observed in human subjects. Taken together, our results suggest that adaptation-induced changes in encoding accuracy prepare the visual system for future stimuli.

                <p>by Natalie R. Davidson, Fan Zhang, Casey S. Greene</p>

While single-cell experiments provide deep cellular resolution within a single sample, some single-cell experiments are inherently more challenging than bulk experiments due to dissociation difficulties, cost, or limited tissue availability. This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses. We evaluated BuDDI’s performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples. In each experiment, BuDDI outperformed all other comparative methods and baselines. As more reference atlases are completed, BuDDI provides a path to combine these resources with bulk-profiled treatment or disease signatures to study perturbations, sex differences, or other factors at single-cell resolution.

                <p>Biallelic variants in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class G (<i>PIGG</i>) cause hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, and cerebellar features. We present 8 patients from 6 families with a childhood-onset motor neuropathy and neurophysiology demonstrating variable motor conduction block and temporal dispersion. All individuals had a childhood onset tremor, 5 of 8 had cerebellar involvement, and 6 of 8 had childhood febrile seizures. All individuals have biallelic <i>PIGG</i> variants, including the previously reported pathogenic variant Trp505*, plus 6 novel variants. Null enzyme activity is demonstrated via <i>PIGO</i>/<i>PIGG</i> double knockout system for Val339Gly and Gly19Glu, and residual activity for Trp505* due to read-through. Emm negative blood group status was confirmed in 1 family. <i>PIGG</i> should be considered in unsolved motor neuropathy. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:388–396</p>

                <p>Mutations in colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) result in CSF1R-related disorder (CSF1R-RD). Our previous study demonstrated a proteolytic generation of a soluble CSF1R (sCSF1R) that could potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker of CSF1R-RD. Herein, we observed that sCSF1R is released into peripheral serum as a highly glycosylated monomer in <i>Csf1r</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice that mimic the clinical symptoms of CSF1R-RD patients. Notably, we found that serum sCSF1R could distinguish CSF1R-RD cohorts from controls with high accuracy as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the advances in treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), unremitting neurodegeneration continues to drive disability and disease progression. Smoldering/slowly expanding lesions (SELs) and dysfunction of the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) are pathologic hallmarks of MS cortex and intricately tied to disability and neurodegeneration, respectively. We hypothesized that neuronal hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and is exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization of hnRNP A1) was examined in healthy control and MS brains using immunohistochemistry. MS cases were stratified by severity of hnRNP A1 pathology to examine the link between RBP dysfunction, demyelination, and neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that smoldering/SELs were only present within a subset of MS tissues characterized by elevated neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup>) in adjacent cortical gray matter. In contrast to healthy controls and MS with low hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>low</i>
</sup>), MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> showed elevated markers of neurodegeneration, including neuronal loss and injury, brain atrophy, axonal loss, and axon degeneration. Additionally, we discovered a subpopulation of morphologically intact neurons lacking expression of NeuN, a neuron-specific RBP, in cortical projection neurons in MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and may be exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS. The discovery of NeuN-negative neurons suggests that some cortical neurons may only be injured and not lost. By characterizing RBP pathology in MS cortex, this study has important implications for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, the substrate of disability and disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27105?af=R">A Prospective Multicenter Analysis of Mobile Stroke Unit Cost‐Effectiveness</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Given the high disease and cost burden of ischemic stroke, evaluating the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of new approaches to prevent and treat ischemic stroke is critical. Effective ischemic stroke management depends on timely administration of thrombolytics after stroke onset. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness associated with the use of mobile stroke units (MSUs) to expedite tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, as compared with standard management through emergency medical services (EMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study is a prospective, multicenter, alternating-week, cluster-controlled trial of MSU versus EMS. One-year and life-time cost-effectiveness analyses, using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) method, were performed from the perspective of CMS's Medicare. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using patient-reported EQ-5D-5L data were used as the effectiveness measure. Health care utilizations were converted to costs using average national Medicare reimbursements. ICERs excluding patients with pre-existing disability, and limited to stroke-related costs were also calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The first-year ICER for all tPA-eligible patients using total cost differences between MSU and EMS groups was $238,873/QALY; for patients without pre-existing disability was $61,199/QALY. The lifetime ICERs for all tPA-eligible patients and for those without pre-existing disability were $94,710 and $31,259/QALY, respectively. All ICERs were lower when restricted to stroke-related costs and were highly dependent on the number of patients treated per year in an MSU.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MSUs' cost-effectiveness is borderline if we consider total first-year costs and outcomes in all tPA-eligible patients. MSUs are cost-effective to highly cost-effective when calculations are based on patients without pre-existing disability, patients' lifetime horizon, stroke-related costs, and more patients treated per year in an MSU.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between developmental and premorbid body composition measurements and the risk of motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a cohort study in the UK Biobank to assess the association of developmental body metrics and premorbid body composition measures (using 28 measurements and 7 patterns of body composition) with the risk of MND. Among participants with longitudinal measures, we compared the changes in body composition over time between individuals who later developed MND and those who remained free of MND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 412,691 individuals included in this study, 549 people received an MND diagnosis during the follow-up visit. Higher birth weight was associated with an increased risk of MND among individuals born over 4 kg (hazard ratio [HR] per kg increase = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38–3.55), and taller adult height was associated with an increased risk of MND (HR per 5 cm increase = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17). We observed that measures of elevated fat mass were associated with a lower risk of MND more than 5 years before diagnosis. A higher “leg-dominant fat distribution” pattern was associated with an increased risk whereas higher “muscle strength” was associated with a reduced risk of MND 5 years before diagnosis. Longitudinal analyses indicated a faster decline in measures of fat mass and muscle strength, as well as a shift in fat distribution from arm to leg dominant, among individuals who later developed MND, compared with others.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Body composition at early and middle age may be indicative of the risk of MND development. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:259–269</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Previous studies have observed liver abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. This study aimed to investigate whether early signs of liver disease, measured by magnetic resonance imaging-derived iron-corrected T1-mapping (cT1), are risk factors for developing ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cT1 and proton density fat fraction were measured and automatically analyzed using LiverMultiScan® software. The Fibrosis-4 index was calculated using an established formula based on age and blood markers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between liver disease, liver biomarkers, and incident ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 533,707 individuals from UK Biobank, 24 ALS cases were identified among 28,328 participants with liver disease during the follow-up period. Among a total of 33,959 individuals with complete liver imaging data, 15 incident ALS cases were observed during a median follow-up period of 5.6 years. Individuals with liver disease had a higher risk of developing ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.35 (95% CI 4.47–12.09; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in cT1 was also associated with a higher risk of ALS. After adjusting for age, sex, Townsend deprivation index, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, body mass index, proton density fat fraction, Fibrosis-4, and metabolic syndrome, an increase in cT1 remained significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 1.79–5.55) per 1-SD increase. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these robust results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Liver disease activity, indicated by cT1, increases the risk of developing ALS, independent of metabolic syndrome, liver fat, or fibrosis. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:270–280</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively studied asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers, identifying those developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 56 asymptomatic family members (AFM) with a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation (AFM C9+), 132 non-carriers (AFM C9−), and 359 population-based controls. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cortical thickness, gyrification, and subcortical volumes longitudinally. Linear mixed-effects models on non-converting AFM C9+ scans (n = 107) created a reference for these measurements, establishing individual atrophy patterns. Atrophy patterns from presymptomatic phenoconverters (n = 10 scans) served as a template for group comparisons and similarity assessments. Similarity with phenoconverters was quantified using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for cortical and Kullback–Leibler similarity (KLS) for subcortical measures. Using longitudinal similarity assessments, we predicted when participants would reach the average similarity level of phenoconverters at their first post-onset scan.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five AFM C9+ converted to ALS or ALS-FTD. Up to 6 years before symptoms, these phenoconverters exhibited significant atrophy in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex, along with smaller thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala compared to other AFM C9+. Some non-converted AFM C9+ had high DSC and KLS, approaching values of phenoconverters, whereas others, along with AFM C9− and controls, had lower values. At age 80, we predicted 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 13.2–40.1%) of AFM C9+ and no AFM C9− would reach the same DSC as phenoconverters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Distinctive atrophy patterns are visible years before symptom onset on presymptomatic scans of phenoconverters. Combining baseline and follow-up similarity measures may serve as a promising imaging biomarker for identifying those at risk of ALS or ALS-FTD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:281–295</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in <i>ABCD1</i>, a peroxisomal gene. More than half of males with an <i>ABCD1</i> mutation develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cALD), but underlying mechanisms remain unknown and therapies are limited. We sought to develop and characterize a mouse model of cALD to facilitate study of disease mechanisms and therapy development.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used immunoassays and immunohistochemistry to assess novel (interleukin 18 [IL-18]) and established molecular markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue from cALD patients. We generated a cALD phenotype in <i>Abcd1-</i>knockout mice using a 2-hit method that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. We then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry to assess the fidelity of cALD molecular markers in the mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Human and mouse cALD lesions shared histologic features of myelin phagocytosis, myelin loss, abundant microglial activation, T and B-cell infiltration, and astrogliosis. Compared to wild-type controls, <i>Abcd1</i>-knockout mice displayed more cerebral demyelination, blood–brain barrier disruption, and perivascular immune cell infiltration. This enhanced inflammatory response was associated with higher levels of fibrin deposition, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury. IL-18 immunoreactivity co-localized with perivascular monocytes/macrophages in both human and mouse brain tissue. In cALD patients, CSF IL-18 levels correlated with MRI lesion severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest loss of <i>Abcd1</i> function in mice predisposes to more severe blood–brain barrier disruption, cerebral inflammation driven by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, demyelination, and axonal damage, replicating human cALD features. This novel mouse model could shed light on cALD mechanisms and accelerate cALD therapy development. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:296–312</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27119?af=R">Cost‐Effectiveness of Endovascular Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes. These results further support adaptation of systems of care to accommodate the expansion of thrombectomy eligibility to patients with large cores and maximize EVT benefits.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate versus placebo in a phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-period cross-over clinical trial in patients with isolated laryngeal dystonia (LD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2021, pausing during the COVID-19 pandemic, at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in 106 patients with alcohol-responsive (EtOH+) and alcohol-non-responsive (EtOH−) LD (53 to receive 1.5g of sodium oxybate first, 53 to receive matching placebo first). The primary outcome was a change from baseline in LD symptom severity 40 minutes after drug intake. Safety was based on vital signs, cognitive function, suicidality, daytime sleepiness, and adverse events. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to study procedures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to baseline, EtOH+ but not EtOH− patients had a statistically significant improvement in LD symptoms following sodium oxybate versus placebo (EtOH+: 98.75% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6–26.9; <i>p</i> = 0.008; EtOH−: 98.75% CI = −6.2 to 18.7; <i>p</i> = 0.42). Statistically significant minimum drug efficacy in EtOH+ patients was found at ≥16% symptom improvement (OR = 2.09; 98.75% CI = 0.75–5.80; <i>p</i> = 0.036), with an average of 40.81% benefits (98.75% CI = 34.7–48.6). Drug efficacy waned by 300 minutes after intake without a rebound. No changes were found in cognitive function, suicidality, or vital signs. Common adverse events included mild dizziness, nausea, and daytime sleepiness.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sodium oxybate showed clinically meaningful improvement of symptoms in EtOH+ LD patients, with acceptable tolerability. Sodium oxybate offers the first pathophysiologically relevant oral treatment for laryngeal dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:329–343</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27123?af=R">Sex Modifies the Severity and Outcome of Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The limited existing evidence on sex differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with spontaneous, non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) comes from small, single-center studies. Here, we performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials and 1 multi-ethnic observational study of ICH to investigate the impact of sex on ICH severity and outcome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria in our study were a neuroimaging-confirmed ICH. We evaluated whether sex was associated with ICH severity (hematoma volume and expansion) and poor functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale &gt;3) 3 or 6 months after the ICH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 4,812 ICH patients were evaluated (mean age 62, 40% female). Males with ICH were younger, more likely to be smokers and have diabetes, and less likely to be on anticoagulants (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In multivariable analyses, male sex was associated with non-lobar location (odds ratio [OR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.39–1.92]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), larger hemorrhages (beta: 0.16 [0.08–0.23]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and a higher risk of hematoma expansion (OR: 1.43 [1.20–1.71]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Despite the larger hemorrhage volume and higher risk of expansion, male sex was associated with a 24% lower risk of poor outcomes (OR: 0.76 [0.64–0.90]; <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to females, males with ICH have larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion. Despite the larger bleeds and higher risk of hematoma expansion, males with ICH have lower risk of poor outcomes. Our results suggest that the biology and clinical trajectory are different in females and males with ICH, supporting sex-specific research in this condition.

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excitotoxicity is a common hallmark of epilepsy and other neurological diseases associated with elevated extracellular glutamate levels. Thus, here, we studied the protective effects of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b>, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of glutamate uptake in epilepsy models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> was evaluated in a range of acute and chronic seizure models, while its adverse effect profile was assessed in a panel of standard tests in rodents. The effect of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on glutamate uptake was assessed in COS-7 cells expressing the transporter. WAY 213613, a selective competitive EAAT2 inhibitor, was used to probe the reversal of the enhanced glutamate uptake in the same transporter expression system. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses were used to study a potential influence of <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> on GLT-1 expression in mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> showed robust protection in a panel of animal models of seizures and epilepsy, including the maximal electroshock- and 6 Hz-induced seizures, corneal kindling, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, lamotrigine-resistant amygdala kindling, as well as seizures induced by pilocarpine or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Importantly, <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> displayed a favorable adverse effect profile in the rotarod, the minimal motor impairment, and the Irwin tests. <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> enhanced glutamate uptake in vitro and this effect was abolished by WAY 213613, while no influence on GLT-1 expression in vivo was observed after repeated treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, our results show that <b>(<i>R</i>)-AS-1</b> has favorable tolerability and provides robust preclinical efficacy against seizures. Thus, allosteric enhancement of EAAT2 function could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27129?af=R">Distinct Constructs Underlie Patient‐Reported and Performance‐Rated Outcomes after Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which capture patients' perspectives on the consequences of health and disease, are widely used in neurological care and research. However, it is unclear how PROMs relate to performance-rated impairments. Sociodemographic factors are known to affect PROMs. Direct damage to brain regions critical for self-awareness (i.e., parietal regions and the salience/ventral-attention network) may also impair self-report outcomes. This study examined the relationship between PROMs and performance-based measures in stroke survivors with arm motor impairments. We hypothesized that PROMs would be distinct from performance-based outcomes, influenced by sociodemographic factors, and linked to damage in brain circuits involved in self-perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed 54 stroke survivors using patient-reported and performance-rated measures at 4 timepoints. We used factor analysis to reveal the outcome battery's factorial structure. Linear regression examined the association between classes of measures and sociodemographics. Voxel-lesion-symptom-mapping, region-of-interest-based analysis, and voxel-lesion-network-mapping investigated the relationship between classes of outcomes and stroke-related injury.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Performance-based and patient-reported measures formed distinct factors, consistent across recovery phases. Higher education (β1 = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and income adequacy (β2 = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.05) were associated with patient-reported, but not performance-rated outcomes. Greater parietal lobe injury, irrespective of hemisphere, was associated with worse patient-reported outcomes; greater corticospinal tract injury related to worse performance-rated outcomes. Lesions with greater functional connectivity to the salience/ventral-attention network were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (<i>r</i> = −0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings reveal important differences between performance-rated and patient-reported outcomes, each with specific associated factors and anatomy post-stroke. Incorporating sociodemographic and neuroanatomic characteristics into neurorehabilitation strategies may inform and optimize patient outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:242–253</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The effects of seizure control on outcomes in persons with dementia (PWD) remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of seizure control on mortality, function, cognition, and mood among PWD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This longitudinal, multicenter study is based on 39 Alzheimer's disease centers (ADCs) in the United States from September 2005 to December 2021. PWD were grouped by seizure status into recurrent (seizures in the past year), remote (prior seizures but none in the past year), and no seizures (controls). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality among seizure groups. We used Weibull survival analysis to assess the mortality risks by seizure status after adjusting for age, sex, education, race, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, degree of cognitive impairment, dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation, brain trauma, stroke, Parkinson's disease, alcohol abuse, and depression. Cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating), function (physical dependence and nursing home residence), day-to-day activities (Functional Assessment Scores), and mood (Geriatric Depression Scale) were compared among seizure groups after adjusting for dementia duration and age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 26,501 participants, 374 (1.4%) had recurrent seizures and 510 (1.9%) had remote seizures. In multivariable survival analysis, recurrent seizures were associated with a higher mortality risk than remote and no seizures (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]; recurrent aHR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.51 to 2.12; remote aHR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.38). Median time-to-death for recurrent, remote, and no seizures was 2.4, 4.0, and 4.7 years, respectively. People with recurrent seizures had worse cognition, day-to-day function, and physical dependence than those with remote seizures and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PWD with poorly controlled recurrent seizures have worse mortality, functional, and cognitive outcomes than PWD with remote and no seizures. These findings underscore the need for timely identification and management of ongoing seizures in PWD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:358–368</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) in post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients across the adult lifespan.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional study of the first consecutive 200 PNP and 1,100 NNP patients evaluated at a Neuro-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinic between May 2020 and March 2023. Patients were divided into younger (18–44 years), middle-age (45–64 years), and older (65+ years) age groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals accounted for 142 of 200 (71%) of PNP and 995 of 1100 (90.5%) of NNP patients. Significant age-related differences in the frequencies of comorbidities and abnormal neurologic findings demonstrated higher prevalence in older patients. Conversely, 10 months from COVID-19 onset, we found significant age-related differences in Neuro-PASC symptoms indicating lower prevalence, and therefore, symptom burden, in older individuals. Moreover, there were significant age-related differences in subjective impression of fatigue (median [interquartile range (IQR)] patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] score: younger 64 [57–69], middle-age 63 [57–68], older 60.5 [50.8–68.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (median [IQR] PROMIS score: younger 57 [51–63], middle-age 56 [53–63], older 54 [46.8–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.002) in the NNP group, commensurate with higher impairment in quality of life (QoL) among younger patients. Finally, there were significant age-related differences in objective executive function (median [IQR] National Institutes of Health [NIH] toolbox score: younger 48 [35–63], middle-age 49 [38–63], older 54.5 [45–66.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.01), and working memory (median [IQR] NIH toolbox score: younger 47 [40–53], middle-age 50 [44–57], older 48 [43–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.0002) in NNP patients, with the worst performance coming from the younger group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals are disproportionally affected by Neuro-PASC regardless of acute COVID-19 severity. Although older people more frequently have abnormal neurologic findings and comorbidities, younger and middle-age patients suffer from a higher burden of Neuro-PASC symptoms and cognitive dysfunction contributing to decreased QoL. Neuro-PASC principally affects adults in their prime, contributing to profound public health and socioeconomic impacts warranting dedicated resources for prevention, diagnosis and interventions.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods Utilizing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires assessed anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships among these variables. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. While these findings are promising, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, and future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine these relationships over time. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Background The study analyzes the impact of public health spending on malnutrition among Peruvians, using data from the National Household Survey, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Ministry of Economy and Finance from 2010. -2020. Previous studies have revealed the existing relationship of health spending with the reduction of malnutrition. Methods A quantitative approach is considered, with an explanatory type of research using panel data methodology considering the bidimensionality of the data, which allows quantifying this effect for the Peruvian case using the National Household Survey, data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, as well as information from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the Transparency Portal of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the period 2010-2020. Results The results show that public expenditure on health has a negative relationship with malnutrition; the rural sector has a positive relationship with malnutrition given the limitations present for access to adequate food. Similarly, the unemployment rate shows a positive relationship with malnutrition, given that being unemployed leads to a higher cause of malnutrition in the population, and the gross domestic product has a negative relationship with malnutrition, given that greater economic growth produces an impact on reducing malnutrition, with the greatest impact being on the rural population and the gross domestic product. Conclusions In the analysis period 2010-2020 in Peru, based on the panel data analysis, the impact of public health expenditure on reducing malnutrition is observed in 10 departments, achieving a reduction in malnutrition; while in 14 departments, this indicator has not been reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-99/v1?src=rss">Predicting determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithm: Evidence from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Survey 2019 dataset [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer rev</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Globally, around 40% of women report unintended pregnancies, with approximately 214 million women in developing countries wanting to avoid pregnancy but not using any contraception. Modern contraceptives (MCs) are effective tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, controlling rapid population growth, and reducing fertility and maternal mortality rates, particularly in developing countries. Low use of contraceptives is responsible for the high fertility and maternal mortality rates in sub-Saharan African nations like Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to identify the determinants of modern contraceptive use among Ethiopian women of reproductive age using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methodology The study utilized secondary data from the 2019 Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Ethiopia survey, analyzing 8,837 samples. Preprocessing steps included data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and splitting the data, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing the algorithms. Six supervised ML algorithms were employed and assessed using confusion matrices, with information gain applied to identify critical attributes for predicting MC use. Results Only 24% of participants used modern contraceptives {95% CI (23.1%, 24.9%). Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (81.97%, 95% CI {79.06%, 82.7%}) and area under the ROC curve (76.63%), followed by logistic regression (80.52%) and support vector machines (80.41%). Key determinants of MC use included starting family planning at age 20 or older, being single, having partner approval, being the wife of the household head, age between 36–49 years, advice from healthcare providers, concerns about side effects, and having a household size of five or more. Conclusion and Recommendations The use of modern contraceptives among Ethiopian women remains low. Extreme gradient boosting proved most effective in predicting determinants of MC use. Improved counseling during ANC/PNC visits, promoting partner discussions on family planning, and addressing concerns about family size and contraceptive use are recommended strategies to enhance MC uptake.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27182?af=R">Clinical Relevance of ‘Cap’ and ‘Track’ Development after Recent Small Subcortical Infarct</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After a recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI), some patients develop perilesional or remote hyperintensities (‘caps/tracks’) to the index infarct on T2/FLAIR MRI. However, their clinical relevance remains unclear. We investigated the clinicoradiological correlates of ‘caps/tracks’, and their impact on long-term outcomes following RSSI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We identified participants with lacunar stroke and MRI-confirmed RSSI from 3 prospective studies. At baseline, we collected risk factors, RSSI characteristics, small vessel disease (SVD) features, and microstructural integrity on diffusion imaging. Over 1-year, we repeated MRI and recorded ‘caps/tracks’ blinded to other data. We evaluated predictors of ‘caps/tracks’, and their association with 1-year functional (modified Rankin Scale score ≥2), mobility (Timed Up-and-Go), cognitive outcomes (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score &lt;26), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (stroke/transient ischemic attack/incident infarct) using multivariable regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 185 participants, 93 (50.3%) developed ‘caps/tracks’ first detected at median 198 days after stroke. ‘Caps/tracks’ were independently predicted by baseline factors: larger RSSI, RSSI located in white matter, higher SVD score, and higher mean diffusivity in normal-appearing white matter (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}], 1.15 [1.07–1.25], 6.01 [2.80–13.57], 1.77 [1.31–2.44], 1.42 [1.01–2.03]). At 1 year, ‘cap/track’ formation was associated with worse functional outcome (OR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.28–8.22), slower gait speed (β: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.01–0.25), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.05–4.02), but not with cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>‘Caps/tracks’ after RSSI are associated with worse clinical outcomes, and may reflect vulnerability to progressive SVD-related injury. Reducing ‘caps/tracks’ may offer early efficacy markers in trials aiming to improve outcome after lacunar stroke. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95273">Unbiased identification of cell identity in dense mixed neural cultures</a></h4>

              
                Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology is revolutionizing cell biology. However, the variability between individual iPSC lines and the lack of efficient technology to comprehensively characterize iPSC-derived cell types hinder its adoption in routine preclinical screening settings. To facilitate the validation of iPSC-derived cell culture composition, we have implemented an imaging assay based on cell painting and convolutional neural networks to recognize cell types in dense and mixed cultures with high fidelity. We have benchmarked our approach using pure and mixed cultures of neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines and attained a classification accuracy above 96%. Through iterative data erosion, we found that inputs containing the nuclear region of interest and its close environment, allow achieving equally high classification accuracy as inputs containing the whole cell for semi-confluent cultures and preserved prediction accuracy even in very dense cultures. We then applied this regionally restricted cell profiling approach to evaluate the differentiation status of iPSC-derived neural cultures, by determining the ratio of postmitotic neurons and neural progenitors. We found that the cell-based prediction significantly outperformed an approach in which the population-level time in culture was used as a classification criterion (96% <i>vs</i> 86%, respectively). In mixed iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, microglia could be unequivocally discriminated from neurons, regardless of their reactivity state, and a tiered strategy allowed for further distinguishing activated from non-activated cell states, albeit with lower accuracy. Thus, morphological single-cell profiling provides a means to quantify cell composition in complex mixed neural cultures and holds promise for use in the quality control of iPSC-derived cell culture models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102440">Evaluating the transcriptional regulators of arterial gene expression via a catalogue of characterized arterial enhancers</a></h4>

              
                The establishment and growth of the arterial endothelium requires the coordinated expression of numerous genes. However, regulation of this process is not yet fully understood. Here, we combined <i>in silico</i> analysis with transgenic mice and zebrafish models to characterize arterial-specific enhancers associated with eight key arterial identity genes (<i>Acvrl1</i>/<i>Alk1</i>,<i> Cxcr4, Cxcl12, Efnb2, Gja4/Cx37, Gja5/Cx40</i>,<i> Nrp1</i> and <i>Unc5b)</i>. Next, to elucidate the regulatory pathways upstream of arterial gene transcription, we investigated the transcription factors binding each arterial enhancer compared to a similar assessment of non-arterial endothelial enhancers. These results found that binding of SOXF and ETS factors was a common occurrence at both arterial and pan-endothelial enhancers, suggesting neither are sufficient to direct arterial specificity. Conversely, FOX motifs independent of ETS motifs were over-represented at arterial enhancers. Further, MEF2 and RBPJ binding was enriched but not ubiquitous at arterial enhancers, potentially linked to specific patterns of behaviour within the arterial endothelium. Lastly, there was no shared or arterial-specific signature for WNT-associated TCF/LEF, TGFβ/BMP-associated SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3, shear stress-associated KLF4 or venous-enriched NR2F2. This cohort of well characterized and in vivo-verified enhancers can now provide a platform for future studies into the interaction of different transcriptional and signalling pathways with arterial gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102618">Realistic mossy fiber input patterns to unipolar brush cells evoke a continuum of temporal responses comprised of components mediated by different glutamate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex that receive mossy fiber (MF) inputs and excite granule cells. The UBC population responds to brief burst activation of MFs with a continuum of temporal transformations, but it is not known how UBCs transform the diverse range of MF input patterns that occur in vivo. Here, we use cell-attached recordings from UBCs in acute cerebellar slices to examine responses to MF firing patterns that are based on in vivo recordings. We find that MFs evoke a continuum of responses in the UBC population, mediated by three different types of glutamate receptors that each convey a specialized component. AMPARs transmit timing information for single stimuli at up to 5 spikes/s, and for very brief bursts. A combination of mGluR2/3s (inhibitory) and mGluR1s (excitatory) mediates a continuum of delayed, and broadened responses to longer bursts, and to sustained high frequency activation. Variability in the mGluR2/3 component controls the time course of the onset of firing, and variability in the mGluR1 component controls the duration of prolonged firing. We conclude that the combination of glutamate receptor types allows each UBC to simultaneously convey different aspects of MF firing. These findings establish that UBCs are highly flexible circuit elements that provide diverse temporal transformations that are well suited to contribute to specialized processing in different regions of the cerebellar cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95485">CausalXtract, a flexible pipeline to extract causal effects from live-cell time-lapse imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Live-cell microscopy routinely provides massive amounts of time-lapse images of complex cellular systems under various physiological or therapeutic conditions. However, this wealth of data remains difficult to interpret in terms of causal effects. Here, we describe CausalXtract, a flexible computational pipeline that discovers causal and possibly time-lagged effects from morphodynamic features and cell–cell interactions in live-cell imaging data. CausalXtract methodology combines network-based and information-based frameworks, which is shown to discover causal effects overlooked by classical Granger and Schreiber causality approaches. We showcase the use of CausalXtract to uncover novel causal effects in a tumor-on-chip cellular ecosystem under therapeutically relevant conditions. In particular, we find that cancer-associated fibroblasts directly inhibit cancer cell apoptosis, independently from anticancer treatment. CausalXtract uncovers also multiple antagonistic effects at different time delays. Hence, CausalXtract provides a unique computational tool to interpret live-cell imaging data for a range of fundamental and translational research applications.

                The specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling or metabolic cues, remains unresolved. Here, deletion of the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from forebrain neurons or arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in failure to maintain normal lactation-induced suppression of estrous cycles. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity and pulsatile LH secretion were increased in these mice, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulation and lactation. GCaMP fibre photometry of arcuate kisspeptin neurons revealed that the normal episodic activity of these neurons is rapidly suppressed in pregnancy and this was maintained throughout early lactation. Deletion of Prlr from arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in early reactivation of episodic activity of kisspeptin neurons prior to a premature return of reproductive cycles in early lactation. These observations show dynamic variation in arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity associated with the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation, and provide direct evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for suppressing fertility during lactation in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98409">Altering the redox status of Chlamydia trachomatis directly impacts its developmental cycle progression</a></h4>

              
                <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen with a unique developmental cycle. It differentiates between two functional and morphological forms: the elementary body (EB) and the reticulate body (RB). The signals that trigger differentiation from one form to the other are unknown. EBs and RBs have distinctive characteristics that distinguish them, including their size, infectivity, proteome, and transcriptome. Intriguingly, they also differ in their overall redox status as EBs are oxidized and RBs are reduced. We hypothesize that alterations in redox may serve as a trigger for secondary differentiation. To test this, we examined the function of the primary antioxidant enzyme alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C (AhpC), a well-known member of the peroxiredoxins family, in chlamydial growth and development. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that altering the expression of <i>ahpC</i> would modulate chlamydial redox status and trigger earlier or delayed secondary differentiation. Therefore, we created <i>ahpC</i> overexpression and knockdown strains. During <i>ahpC</i> knockdown, ROS levels were elevated, and the bacteria were sensitive to a broad set of peroxide stresses. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of EB-associated genes and concurrent higher production of EBs at an earlier time in the developmental cycle, indicating earlier secondary differentiation occurs under elevated oxidation conditions. In contrast, overexpression of AhpC created a resistant phenotype against oxidizing agents and delayed secondary differentiation. Together, these results indicate that redox potential is a critical factor in developmental cycle progression. For the first time, our study provides a mechanism of chlamydial secondary differentiation dependent on redox status.

">Electrophysiological resting-state signatures link polygenic scores to general intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Intelligence is associated with important life outcomes. Behavioral, genetic, structural, and functional brain correlates of intelligence have been studied for decades, but questions remain as to how genetics are related to trait expression and what intermediary role brain properties play. This study investigated these mediations in a representative sample of 434 individuals, comprising young and older adults. Polygenic scores (PGS) for intelligence were calculated. Resting-state EEG recordings were analyzed using graph theory quantifying functional connectivity across different frequencies. We tested whether global and local graph metrics like efficiency and clustering mediated the association between PGS and intelligence. PGS significantly predicted variance in intelligence and were related to frequency-specific graph metrics in areas predominantly located in parieto-frontal regions, which in turn were associated with intelligence. These findings, which are based on the first study linking PGS to intelligence using EEG-derived graph metrics, advance our understanding of the neurogenetics of intelligence.

">Behavioral investigation of allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps in human spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Spatial memory is a fundamental cognitive function that enables humans and other species to encode and recall the locations of items in their environments. Humans employ diverse strategies to support spatial memory, including the use of cognitive maps. Cognitive maps are mental representations of the environment that organize its content along two or more continuous dimensions. In allocentric cognitive maps, these dimensions form a Cartesian coordinate system referenced to the environment. In egocentric cognitive maps, the dimensions form a polar coordinate system centered on the subject. To better understand how humans employ allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps for spatial memory, we performed a behavioral study with a novel task designed to directly and explicitly assess both types of cognitive maps. During encoding periods, participants navigated through a virtual environment and encountered objects at different locations. During recall periods, participants aimed at remembering these locations in abstract allocentric and egocentric coordinate systems. Our results show that relationships between the objects and the environment, such as their distance to boundaries and corners, were associated with allocentric memory performance. Relationships between the objects and the participant, including their distance and orientation to the participant's starting position, were linked to egocentric memory performance. Spatial feedback during recall supported performance within allocentric and egocentric domains, but not across domains. These findings are compatible with the notion that allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps operate as (partially) independent systems for spatial memory, each specialized in processing specific types of spatial relationships.

">Astrocyte Ca2+ activity regulates node of Ranvier length in the white matter</a></h4>

              
                Nodes of Ranvier generate action potentials along myelinated axons, but it is unclear whether they can modulate neural circuit function. Computer modelling previously predicted that adjusting node length can control axonal conduction speed1, but it is unknown whether mechanisms controlling nodal structure operate in the healthy brain. Here, in brain slices and in intact white matter tracts of live mice, we found that nodes elongate and shorten, while an overall stable mean node length is maintained. Changes in node length were only detected in nodes that were flanked by compact myelin sheaths, and more motile nodes were observed as myelination progressed during development. In the developing brain, but not in adult mice, neuronal activity caused the nodes to elongate. This occurred via astrocyte Ca2+-mediated adenosine generation, targeting A2b receptors expressed in myelin sheaths which raised cyclic AMP levels in oligodendrocytes. This activated NKCC1 cotransporters present in the myelin of the paranodes and internodes, the expression of which was upregulated in the developing brain compared to adults. NKCC1 activation elevated the membrane conductance and reduced the length of internodal myelin sheaths. Thus, nodal dynamics may continuously tune information flow along myelinated axons and drive activity-dependent white matter plasticity.

">Associations between epilepsy-related polygenic risk and brain morphology in childhood</a></h4>

              
                Temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS) is associated with a complex genetic architecture, but the translation from genetic risk factors to brain vulnerability remains unclear. Here, we examined associations between epilepsy-related polygenic risk scores for HS (PRS-HS) and brain structure in a large sample of neurotypical children, and correlated these signatures with case-control findings in in multicentric cohorts of patients with TLE-HS. Imaging-genetic analyses revealed PRS-related cortical thinning in temporo-parietal and fronto-central regions, strongly anchored to distinct functional and structural network epicentres. Compared to disease-related effects derived from epilepsy case-control cohorts, structural correlates of PRS-HS mirrored atrophy and epicentre patterns in patients with TLE-HS. By identifying a potential pathway between genetic vulnerability and disease mechanisms, our findings provide new insights into the genetic underpinnings of structural alterations in TLE-HS and highlight potential imaging-genetic biomarkers for early risk stratification and personalized interventions.

">Maternal motivation overcomes innate fear via prefrontal switching dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Parental care is altruistic. In natural environments, parents are often faced with challenging environmental conditions, such as severe weather, complex terrain and predatory threats, and therefore need to overcome the fear of adverse conditions to protect and raise the offspring. Although a few studies have reported risk-taking maternal behaviors, it is unknown how maternal motivation and environmental threats are represented and integrated in neural circuits to resolve the conflict and dynamically drive behaviors. Here we report a novel risk-taking maternal behavior paradigm in a semi-naturalistic context, in which a female mouse has to overcome fear and jump off an elevated platform to retrieve pups outside a nest on the ground. We show that while fear of heights reduces the motivation to jump, the presence of pups dramatically facilitates overcoming such fear. A medial prefrontal-periaqueductal gray (mPFC-PAG) pathway is specifically required for the effect of pups on overcoming fear of height, and this circuit integrates conflicting cues about pup and height and encodes motivation to drive risk-taking jumping behaviors. In contrast to cued, fast and predictable reaction timing in typical structured tasks, behaviors in our paradigm are highly spontaneous, characterized by stochastic transitions between low-motivation and high-motivation states. Our data reveal that such spontaneity is shaped by the switching ramping dynamics of neural activity in the motivation-encoding dimension, rather than continuous ramping dynamics. Pup and height cues modulate the switching ramping dynamics to influence, but not immediately evoke behaviors. Together, we propose that the prefrontal-brainstem pathway plays vital roles in encoding altruistic motivation to overcome innate fear, and the switching ramping dynamics might represent a general mechanism that gives rise to spontaneous behaviors in naturalistic and conflicting conditions.

">Arc: a therapeutic hub for Alzheimer's disease.</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poised to reach epidemic levels as the world population ages. There is currently no treatment that halts this debilitating disease. Our recent finding that the memory gene Arc regulates the expression of many genes associated with the pathophysiology of AD sets the stage for a new therapeutic approach that is not structurally based on the amyloid hypothesis that has driven most research to date. Neuronal activity-dependent Arc expression is controlled by a chromatin-modification complex containing two enzymes: Tip60 and PHF8. Here, we show that small molecules targeting these proteins inhibit Arc expression. This finding sets the stage for a novel therapeutic approach to combat Alzheimer's disease. Targeting Arc opens a new frontier of "multi-target" therapy designed to simultaneously intervene in several aspects of the disease. Because of Arc's role in controlling the expression of multiple genes and pathways implicated in AD, it could serve as a therapeutic hub.

">Acute cortical stroke alters neural activity in the subthalamic nucleus, which correlates with motor disability in rats</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: We aimed to investigate the impact of acute cortical stroke (ACS) on neural activity in subthalamic nucleus (STN). We then examined the correlation between changes in STN activity and motor disability. Methods: Forty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were used. While rats were anesthetized, we inserted electrodes in STN and induced an ACS by creating photothrombotic lesion in ipsilateral motor cortex. Local field potentials were recorded before and after ACS. The motor behavior was assessed before and after ACS using single pellet reaching task. Results: Rats experienced significant motor disability after ACS. STN firing rate significantly decreased after ACS. Additionally, delta (0.5-4 Hz) and gamma (50-140 Hz) power significantly decreased after ACS. Furthermore, the decrease in delta mean power correlated with decreases in success rate (r =0.77, p =0.009) and first try success rate (r =0.69, p =0.028). The decreases in gamma mean power (r =0.68, p =0.029) and gamma peak power (r =0.74, p =0.015) correlated with the decrease in success rate. The decrease in gamma power significantly correlated with the decreased STN firing rate. However, decreased delta power exhibited no correlation with decreased gamma power. Interpretation: ACS causes abnormal STN activity, which correlated with motor disability. Post-stroke STN inhibition may partially compensate for ACS. However, it could also lead to pathological consequences. This STN abnormal activity may serve as a biomarker for motor disability severity after ACS. Furthermore, our findings may provide a possibility for developing neuromodulation strategies, allowing to mitigate post-stroke motor disability through modulating abnormal STN activity.

">Optical recordings of unitary synaptic connections reveal high and random local connectivity between CA3 pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of both sexes to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3078 tested CA3PC-CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC-CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.

                Glycation-induced oxidative stress underlies the numerous metabolic ravages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced glutathione levels in AD lead to increased oxidative stress, including glycation-induced pathology. Previously, we showed that the accumulation of reactive 1,2-dicarbonyls such as methylglyoxal, the major precursor of non-enzymatic glycation products, was reduced by the increased function of GSH-dependent glyoxalase-1 enzyme in the brain. In this two-pronged study, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an orally bioavailable prodrug of our lead glyoxalase substrate, pro-{psi}-GSH, for the first time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model. This prodrug delivers pharmacodynamically relevant brain concentrations of {psi}-GSH upon oral delivery. Chronic oral dosing of pro-{psi}-GSH effectively reverses the cognitive decline observed in the APP/PS1 mouse model. The prodrug successfully mirrors the robust effects of the parent drug i.e., reducing amyloid pathology, glycation stress, neuroinflammation, and the resultant neurodegeneration in these mice. We also report the first metabolomics study of such a treatment, which yields key biomarkers linked to the reversal of AD-related metabolic dysregulation. Collectively, this study establishes pro-{psi}-GSH as a viable, disease-modifying therapy for AD and paves the way for further preclinical advancement of such therapeutics. Metabolomic signatures identified could prove beneficial in the development of treatment-specific clinically translatable biomarkers.

">Comparison of TENS electrodes and textile electrodes for electrocutaneous warning</a></h4>

              
                Electrocutaneous stimulation can be employed to alert workers in potentially hazardous situations. To determine the feasibility of a novel textile electrode cuff in comparison to previously used TENS electrodes, two studies were conducted. In a study on n = 30 participants, perception, attention, muscle twitch, and intolerance thresholds as well as qualitative and spatial perceptions, were determined for eight pairs of electrodes circumferentially placed around the upper right arm for TENS and for textile electrodes. In a second study on n = 36 participants, these thresholds were also determined during vibration, and a warning signal pattern was presented during vibration. We found smaller perception thresholds for the textile electrodes in comparison to the TENS electrodes for all 8 electrode pairs and occasional differences for the attention and intolerance thresholds, which might be mainly explained by the varying electrode sizes due to the manual production process of the textile electrodes. Stimulation using textile electrodes within the cuff showed less frequent muscle twitches compared to TENS electrodes. Other qualitative and spatial perceptions appeared comparable. The perception, attention, and intolerance thresholds increased during vibration comparable to previous results with TENS electrodes. The feasibility of using the textile electrodes during vibration and for the application of a warning signal was successfully demonstrated. Occasional cases occurred where the transition impedance was too high while using the textile electrodes. Future studies will focus on electrode optimization to achieve a wearable solution with both low electrode-skin transition impedance and minimal muscle twitching.

">Cognitive enrichment preserves retrosplenial parvalbumin density and cognitive function in female 5xFAD mice</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: The rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) varies considerably from person to person. Numerous epidemiological studies point to the protective effects of cognitive, social, and physical enrichment as potential mediators of cognitive decline in AD; however, there is much debate as to the mechanism underlying these effects. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is one of the earliest brain regions with impaired functions during AD pathogenesis, and its activity is affected by cognitive, social, and physical stimulation. METHODS: In the current study, we use the 5xFAD mouse mode of AD to examine the impact of enriched housing conditions on cognitive function in AD and the viability of a particularly vulnerable cell population within the RSC - parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs). RESULTS: Enriched housing conditions improved cognitive performance in 5xFAD mice. These changes in cognitive performance coincided with restored functional connectivity of the RSC and preserved PV-IN density within this region. Along with preserved PV-IN density, there was an increase in the density of perineuronal nets (PNNs) across the RSC of 5xFAD mice housed in enriched conditions. Direct manipulation of PNNs revealed that these extracellular matrix structures protect PV-INs from amyloid toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results provide support for the PNN-mediated maintenance of PV-INs in the RSC as a potential mechanism mediating the protective effects of enrichment against cognitive decline in AD.

">Prior use-dependent plasticity triggers different individual corticomotor responses during persistent musculoskeletal pain</a></h4>

              
                Movement repetition is crucial for pain interventions. It facilitates the rehabilitation of motor patterns, the acquisition of motor skills and the genesis of adaptive use-dependent plasticity. However, the influence of prior motor experience and pre-existing use-dependent plasticity on pain severity and progression remains poorly investigated. This study investigated the effects of pre-existing use-dependent plasticity during the development of prolonged experimental musculoskeletal pain. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, corticospinal excitability was assessed by measuring the rest-motor thresholds (RMTs), motor-evoked potential (MEP), representational area of the motor map, volume, and center of gravity of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in musicians (n=19), a well-known ecological model of use-dependent plasticity, and in non-musicians (n=20). All participants attended three sessions (Day1, Day3, Day8). Prolonged pain for several days was induced by intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the right FDI muscle at the end of Day1. Compared to Day1, prolonged pain uniquely led to reduced motor map volume in non-musicians on Day3 (p=0.004), who also showed higher NGF-related pain intensity compared to musicians. The motor maps of musicians, which were already smaller in pain-free conditions (Day1) compared to non-musicians (p=0.021), remained non-significantly different across days. Notably, corticomotor responses (map volume, MEP amplitude, and RMTs) at Day1 were correlated to weekly and accumulated musical training. These findings demonstrate that pre-existing use-dependent plasticity associated with motor training may counteract the effects of prolonged pain in the motor system. Moreover, it confirms that prior motor experience acts as a source of individual variability to pain.

	<p>Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by early postural instability and gait dysfunction, with frequent falls. Rehabilitation is an important therapeutic approach for motor dysfunction in patients with PSP. However, no conclusions have yet been drawn regarding the beneficial effects of rehabilitation in PSP, including the optimal duration of rehabilitation and differences in treatment effects among PSP subtypes. Herein, we investigated the effects of short-term rehabilitation and separately analyzed the effects on patients with PSP-Richardson&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome (RS) and PSP-progressive gait freezing (PGF). Methods: The participants underwent several therapeutic exercise programs individualized for each participant, performed over 2 weeks. Analysis was performed on 25 patients with PSP-RS and eight with PSP-PGF. Results: Short-term rehabilitation improved the Berg Balance Scale score in both the PSP-RS and PSP-PGF groups, step length on the symptom-dominant side in PSP-RS, the coefficient of variation of step length on the symptom-dominant side, and the stance phase of the Symmetry Index in PSP-PGF. Conclusions: Overall, this 2-week short-term rehabilitation intervention was shown to have beneficial effects on balance in patients with PSP-RS and PSP-PGF.</p>

	<p>Background/Aim: Currently, there are limited evidence-based protocols for improving upper extremity (UE) motor function after stroke. The Keys protocol, a distributed form of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), delivers CIMT components in fewer hours per day over an extended period, fitting outpatient rehabilitation schedules and third-party payor models. This pilot study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the Keys protocol in enhancing UE capacity and performance poststroke. Methods: Ten adults with chronic stroke (&amp;amp;gt;6 months) participated in an 8-week intervention. The protocol included 22 supervised training sessions (1.5 h each): 4 days/week for 4 weeks, 2 days/week for weeks 5&amp;amp;ndash;6, and 1 day/week for weeks 7&amp;amp;ndash;8. Participants wore a restraint mitt on the less-affected UE during waking hours and used an adapted transfer package. Outcome measures included the Motor Activity Log (MAL), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), and Zung Depression Scale, assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment (4 weeks), and posttreatment. Results: Significant improvements were observed in SIS Strength, ADLs/IADLs, Mobility, and Hand Function domains, exceeding MCID thresholds. Memory and Communication domains improved significantly at the 3-month follow-up. WMFT performance times improved, with fewer incomplete tasks. MAL scores for Amount of Use and Quality of Movement increased across all time points. Depressive symptoms significantly decreased posttreatment. Conclusions: The Keys protocol effectively improves UE use, motor function, mood, and quality of life, with the greatest gains observed mid-intervention. These findings support its feasibility and potential for outpatient stroke rehabilitation (ClinicalTrials.gov Registration: NCT05311384).</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Loneliness is a heterogeneous phenomenon, generally defined as an emotional experience based on the perceived distance between an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s actual social relationships and those he or she would like to have. Adolescence is particularly vulnerable to loneliness because of the many changes in values, feelings, and emotions that characterize it. Among the aspects that may influence this feeling of discomfort, the literature identifies maladaptive personality and a dysfunctional response to traumatic events. Our study aims to identify the possible role that maladaptive personality traits and post-traumatic stress symptomatology in the form of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Disturbance in Self-Organization (DSO) may play in the perception of loneliness in adolescents: Methods: We identified a mediation model constructed through structural equation modeling (SEM) to test PTSD and DSO post-traumatic stress symptomatology as independent variables and maladaptive personality as a mediator in the relationship between these and perceptions of loneliness in a population of adolescents of both sexes, Italian high school students; Results: Our study identifies the significant role of PTSD and DSO symptomatology in influencing the state of loneliness, both directly and indirectly through maladaptive personality traits, which appear to exert a substantial influence on the perception of loneliness, potentially functioning as mediators in the relationship between the latter and PTSD/DSO symptomatology. Presumably, a maladaptive personality may complicate recovery from adverse and traumatic experiences by preventing the implementation of functional coping strategies and promoting dysfunctional responses. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of researchers and clinicians adequately considering different personality traits and the early identification of post-traumatic stress symptomatology. A focus on adolescents&amp;amp;rsquo; communication and interpersonal skills and their ability to respond effectively to stressful and traumatic events may prove useful in identifying more effective strategies for preventing and managing loneliness and related distress in adolescents.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study analyzed the effects of parachute jump stress on the executive functions and attention of cadets. Executive functions, which includes processes such as attentional control and cognitive flexibility, are crucial for soldiers, especially in situations requiring rapid decision-making. Parachute jumping, as an intense stressor, mobilizes cognitive resources, which can lead to short-term improvements in executive functions. Methods: A total of 64 cadets divided into control (N = 32) and experimental (N = 32) groups participated in the study. The experimental group performed a parachute jump and then took the Color Trails Test, assessed both before and after the jump. Results: The results showed significant improvements in executive functions, in particular, sustained and alternating attention, sequential information processing, and monitoring one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own behavior, suggesting a positive effect of stress on selected executive functions. Conclusions: The results indicate that intense, short-term stress can positively affect executive functions, although this effect may depend on the type of task and the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; experience of exposure to intense stressful stimuli. The study makes an important contribution to the design of future military training, considering the importance of mobilizing cognitive resources in response to short-term stress.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Charcot first described ALS in 1869, but the specific mechanisms that mediate the disease pathology are still not clear. Intense research efforts have provided insight into unique neuroanatomical regions, specific neuronal populations and genetic associations for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases; however, the experimental results also suggest a convergence of these events to common toxic pathways. We propose that common toxic pathways can be therapeutically targeted, and this intervention will be effective in slowing progression and improving patient quality of life. Here, we focus on understanding the role of IL6 trans-signaling in ALS disease processes. Methods: We leveraged unique mouse models of IL6 trans-signaling that we developed that recapitulate the production of active sIL6R in a genotypic and quantitative fashion observed in humans. Given that the SOD1 transgenic mouse is one of the most highly studied and characterized models of ALS, we bred SOD1G93A mice with IL6R trans-signaling mice to determine how enhanced trans-signaling influenced symptom onset and pathological processes, including neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation, glial activation and motoneuron (MN) survival. Results: The results indicate that in animals with enhanced trans-signaling, symptom onset and pathological processes were accelerated, suggesting a role in disease modification. Administration of an IL6R functional blocking antibody failed to alter accelerated symptom onset and disease progression. Conclusions: Future work to investigate the site-specific influence of enhanced IL6 trans-signaling and the tissue-specific bioavailability of potential therapeutics will be necessary to identify targets for precise therapeutic interventions that may limit disease progression in the 60% of ALS patients who inherit the common IL6R Asp358Ala variant.</p>

	<p>The assessment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia has advanced since the 2006 NIMH-MATRICS Consensus Statement, leading to the development of second-generation rating scales like the Brief Negative Symptom Scale and the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms. These scales address the limitations of first-generation tools, such as the inclusion of aspects that are not negative symptoms and the lack of assessment of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s internal experience. However, psychometric validation of these scales is still in progress, and they are not yet recommended by regulatory agencies, thus limiting their use in clinical trials and settings. Complementing these traditional methods, remote digital phenotyping offers a novel approach by leveraging smartphones and wearable technology to capture real-time, high-resolution clinical data. Despite the potential to overcome traditional assessment barriers, challenges remain in aligning these digital measures with clinical ratings and ensuring data security. Equally important is patient acceptance, as the success of remote digital phenotyping relies on the willingness of patients to use these technologies. This review provides a critical overview of both second-generation scales and remote digital phenotyping for assessing negative symptoms, highlighting future research needs.</p>

	<p>Background: Perinatal brain injury is a leading cause of developmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy. However, further work is needed to understand early brain development in the presence of brain injury. In this case report, we examine the longitudinal neuromotor development of a term infant following a significant loss of right-hemispheric brain tissue due to a unilateral ischemic stroke. Our analysis focuses on the integrity and development of the corticospinal tract (CST) from the lesioned hemisphere. This case provides a unique opportunity to evaluate CST development after loss of the majority of the motor cortex. Methods: Evaluations were conducted when the infant was 4 (Visit-1), 18 (Visit 2), and 25 (Visit 3) months old. Assessments included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the lesion and quantify CST structural integrity, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to evaluate CST functional circuitry, and neuromotor assessments. Results: At Visit 1, bilateral CSTs were identified through diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) despite an estimated loss of 92.7% (7.3% retained) of age-typical motor cortex from the right hemisphere. Both hemispheres exhibited bilateral motor-evoked potential in response to stimulation with spTMS, which remained when reassessed at Visits 2 and 3. Longitudinal MRI showed distinct developmental trajectories of CST integrity in each hemisphere, with the lesioned hemisphere exhibiting initial increases in integrity between Visits 1 and 2 followed by a decrease in integrity between Visits 2 and 3. The non-lesioned hemisphere showed increased integrity from Visit 1 to Visit 2, which remained stable at Visit 3. Motor assessments at all visits indicated a high risk of cerebral palsy. Conclusions: This report highlights the utility of MRI and spTMS in studying neuromotor development. The findings reveal preserved functional bilateral CST circuitry despite majority loss of the right-hemispheric motor cortex as well as distinct developmental trajectories in CST integrity between hemispheres. These results underscore the potential for neural plasticity after perinatal brain injury. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT05013736.</p>

	<p>The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been developed and edited by the World Health Organisation and represents the global standard for recording health information and causes of death. The ICD-11 is the eleventh revision and came into effect on 1 January 2022. Perceptual disturbances refer to abnormalities in the way sensory information is interpreted by the brain, leading to distortions in the perception of reality. These can manifest as distorted perceptions or as phantom perceptions and can occur in all sensory modalities as visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory tactile, vestibular, proprioceptory or interoceptory disturbances. There are similar brain mechanisms involved in the generation of these analogous perceptual disturbances and disorders, and they are treated with similar approaches. Perceptual disturbances are highly prevalent, with large variations across the different sensory modalities. They can be associated with significant suffering and cause a high socioeconomic burden. Perceptual disturbances can be symptoms of another disease or disease entities on their own. In the context of pain, this is reflected by the distinction between secondary pain (pain as a symptom of another underlying condition) and primary pain (a disease in its own right, rather than being a symptom of another underlying condition) in the ICD-11. Such a clear distinction is not found in an entirely consistent way across the various sensory modalities. By using the example of auditory phantom perceptions, we propose a framework for the classification of sensory disorders in alignment with the classification of pain in the ICD-11. The descriptions of the sensory disturbances should include (1) a causal aspect (primary versus secondary), (2) a temporal aspect (acute vs. chronic and persistent vs. intermittent), (3) a cognitive, emotional and autonomic interpretation aspect (=suffering) and (4) a social aspect (=disability). If the latter two aspects are present, we propose that the sensory disturbance is called a sensory disorder.</p>

                <p>Short-term motor adaptation to novel movement dynamics has been shown to involve at least two concurrent learning processes: a slow process that responds weakly to error but retains information well and a fast process that responds strongly to error but has poor retention. This modeling framework can explain several properties of motion-dependent motor adaptation (e.g., 24&nbsp;h retention). An important assumption of this computational framework is that learning is only based on the experienced movement error, and the effect of noise (either internally generated or externally applied) is not considered. We examined the respective error sensitivity by quantifying adaptation in three subject groups distinguished by the noise added to the motion-dependent perturbation. We assessed the feedforward adaptive changes in motor output and examined the adaptation rate, retention, and decay of learning. Applying a two-state modeling framework showed that the applied noise during training mainly affected the fast learning process, with the slow process largely unaffected; participants in the higher noise groups demonstrated a reduced force profile following training, but the decay rate across groups was similar, suggesting that the slow process was unimpaired across conditions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that noise significantly decreases motor adaptation, but this reduction may be due to its influence over specific learning mechanisms. Importantly, this may have implications for how the motor system compensates for random fluctuations, especially when affected by brain disorders that result in movement tremor (e.g., essential tremor).</p>

                <p>Epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, significantly impacts patient quality of life. Current classification methods focus primarily on clinical observations and electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, often overlooking the underlying dynamics driving seizures. This study uses surface EEG data to identify seizure transitions using a dynamical systems&ndash;based framework&mdash;the taxonomy of seizure dynamotypes&mdash;previously examined only in invasive data. We applied principal component and independent component (IC) analysis to surface EEG recordings from 1,177 seizures in 158 patients with focal epilepsy, decomposing the signals into ICs. The ICs were visually labeled for clear seizure transitions and bifurcation morphologies (BifMs), which were then examined using Bayesian multilevel modeling in the context of clinical factors. Our analysis reveals that certain onset bifurcations (saddle node on invariant circle and supercritical Hopf) are more prevalent during wakefulness compared with their reduced rate during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly NREM3. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of modeling approaches and suggest additional avenues to continue this exploration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of automating this classification process using machine learning, achieving high performance in identifying seizure-related ICs and classifying interspike interval changes. Our findings suggest that the noise in surface EEG may obscure certain BifMs, and we suggest technical improvements that could enhance detection accuracy. Expanding the dataset and incorporating long-term biological rhythms, such as circadian and multiday cycles, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of seizure dynamics and improve clinical decision-making.</p>

                Background Studies assessing sub-maximal aerobic capacity in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate sub-maximal aerobic capacity in CHB patients compared to apparently healthy participants (control-group). Methods A 6-min walk test was performed. The 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was recorded, along with heart-rate, oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, and dyspnea ( ie ; visual analogue scale) at rest (Rest) and at the end (End) of the test. Additionally, 6-min walk work (6MWW), “6MWD × body mass index (BMI), “6MWD × SpO2End”, and “estimated cardiorespiratory and muscular chain age” were calculated. Signs of physical intolerance were determined including abnormal 6MWD ( ie ; 6MWD < lower limit of normal), chronotropic insufficiency ( ie ; heart-rateEnd < 60% of maximal predicted heart-rate), high dyspnea ( ie ; dyspneaEnd > 5), and desaturation ( ie ; drop in SpO2 > 5 points). Results Compared to the control-group (n=28), the CHB-group (n=26) exhibited significantly lower 6MWD by 61 meters (13%), lower 6MWW by 5266 m.kg, lower “6MWD × BMI” by 1498 m.kg/m2, lower “6MWD × SpO2End” by 5650%, and lower heart-rateEnd by 26 bpm (12% predicted). The CHB-group included higher percentages of participants with chronotropic insufficiency (23.08% vs. 3.57% in the CG) and abnormal 6MWD (34.61% vs. 3.57% in the CG). CHB accelerated the aging of the “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” by 11 years. Conclusion Non-cirrhotic CHB may contribute to reduced submaximal aerobic capacity and acceleration of “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” aging. A regular physical activity program could be a valuable intervention to mitigate these effects.

                Background This study explores the influence of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices on consumer purchasing decisions in the fashion industry. It examines how corporate image and word-of-mouth (WOM) mediate the relationship between ESG practices and consumer trust, impacting purchase intent. Methods A structured questionnaire was distributed online to 393 participants aware of ESG practices, targeting Generation Z consumers. The survey assessed demographics, ESG awareness, brand image, WOM, and purchasing decisions using a Likert scale across five constructs: ESG Practices, Corporate Image, WOM, Trust, and Purchase Intention. Data were analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in IBM AMOS, following a two-step process: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for validation and path analysis for hypothesis testing. Results The findings indicate that ESG practices significantly enhance corporate image and positive WOM, which, in turn, foster consumer trust. Corporate image has a substantial impact on consumer trust (p < .001), while WOM also contributes to trust (p < .001). Trust was found to be a strong predictor of purchase intention, demonstrating the mediating role of corporate image and WOM between ESG practices and purchasing behavior. Conclusions ESG practices are critical in shaping consumer perceptions and fostering loyalty in the fashion sector. By building a trustworthy corporate image and encouraging positive WOM, fashion brands can effectively influence consumer purchasing decisions. This study highlights the competitive advantage of implementing ESG practices, particularly in appealing to Generation Z consumers who value sustainability and ethical business practices.

<p>Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster.

Baseline neural stress responses could not predict the anxiety trajectory during a particular stress phase.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anxiety and depression disorders show high prevalence rates, and stress is a significant risk factor for both. However, studies investigating the interplay between anxiety, depression, and stress regulation in the brain are scarce. The present manuscript included 124 law students from the LawSTRESS project. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and psychosocial stress was induced with the imaging stress paradigm Scan<i>STRESS</i>. Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activation in striatal and temporal clusters. A bifactor model of the HADS suggested a general factor characterized by tension, nervousness, and cheerlessness, which was associated with activation changes in a similar but more circumscribed cluster than anxiety. In the LawSTRESS project, the HADS was assessed at five sampling points (1 year, 3 months, 1 week prior exam, 1 week, and 1 month thereafter), and thus an exploratory trajectory analysis could be performed. It confirmed the relationship between anxiety scores and striatal stress responses at baseline but revealed no predictive value of the neural measure across the sampling points. Our results suggest that—in healthy young participants—neural acute psychosocial stress responses in striato-limbic structures are associated with anxiety, supporting the assumption that these regions are related to individual differences in vulnerability to stress-related disorders. A correlation with depression scores could not be found, and possible explanations are discussed.</p>

The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities.

                <p>by Lua Koenig, Biyu J. He</p>

Perceptual awareness results from an intricate interaction between external sensory input and the brain’s spontaneous activity. Pre-stimulus ongoing activity influencing conscious perception includes both brain oscillations in the alpha (7 to 14 Hz) and beta (14 to 30 Hz) frequency ranges and aperiodic activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range. However, whether brain oscillations and SCPs independently influence conscious perception or do so through shared mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question in 2 independent magnetoencephalography (MEG) data sets involving near-threshold visual perception tasks in humans using low-level (Gabor patches) and high-level (objects, faces, houses, animals) stimuli, respectively. We found that oscillatory power and large-scale SCP activity influence conscious perception through independent mechanisms that do not have shared variance. In addition, through mediation analysis, we show that pre-stimulus oscillatory power and SCP activity have different relations to pupil size—an index of arousal—in their influences on conscious perception. Together, these findings suggest that oscillatory power and SCPs independently contribute to perceptual awareness, with distinct relations to pupil-linked arousal.

                Background Chronic diseases are a significant health concern in Australia. Understanding community preferences for health screening services is vital for enhancing service delivery. We conducted a study to determine community preferences for health screening services for chronic diseases in Australia using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). This paper aims to present the development of the final DCE design using priors estimated from a survey. Methods A DCE was conducted in Australia. An online survey was administered to a general Australian population over 18. The final attribute list of five attributes with three levels each was designed. A D-efficient design with 30 pair-wise choice tasks was developed using a fractional factorial design. A pre-test was conducted to assess comprehension and understanding of the online DCE survey. The pilot survey aimed to compute priors (i.e. coefficients) associated with attributes. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the pilot DCE data. Results The survey included 30 choice tasks in three blocks, with 119 participants responding. The best DCE design was selected based on D-error, with a lower D-error indicating the most efficient design. The pilot survey results indicated a strong preference for highly accurate screening tests, with coefficients for 85% and 95% accuracy being positive. Coefficients estimated from the pilot survey were used as priors to design the DCE choice tasks for the main survey. The final DCE design showed a notable improvement in the attribute level overlap compared to the design used for the pilot survey. Conclusions A rigorous approach was taken to develop a DCE survey that could effectively determine the preferences of the community for health screening services. The resulting DCE design consisted of 30 choice tasks presented in pairs and was deemed efficient enough to gather comprehensive information in the final survey.

                Background This study investigates the impact of the 2008 constitutional change on Ecuadorians´ life satisfaction (developing country), based on the Sumak-Kawsay or “The good way of living” philosophy, with a particular focus on caring of people and mingas (community participation). Methods Through a repeated cross-sectional analysis of national survey data, this study compares the periods before (2007) and after (2014) the implementation of the 2008 constitution to examine how caring behaviors and mingas (community work) influence life satisfaction, using an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the role of this reform in shaping these effects. Results The findings reveal significant improvements in life satisfaction following the 2008’ reform, especially in the Eastern region, where community activities are prevalent, and poverty is most concentrated. These activities, including mingas, showed a positive association with an increase in life satisfaction, underscoring the role of public policies in improving public well-being. Conclusion This approach offers innovative empirical evidence on how social public policies that promote prosocial behaviors, such as solidarity and community participation, can create an environment encouraging to greater life satisfaction, particularly in less developed regions. It also underscores how social investment aimed at improving wealth distribution can positively influence collaborative behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27168?af=R">Diagnosing Epilepsy with Normal Interictal EEG Using Dynamic Network Models</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Whereas a scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is important for diagnosing epilepsy, a single routine EEG is limited in its diagnostic value. Only a small percentage of routine EEGs show interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and overall misdiagnosis rates of epilepsy are 20% to 30%. We aim to demonstrate how network properties in EEG recordings can be used to improve the speed and accuracy differentiating epilepsy from mimics, such as functional seizures – even in the absence of IEDs.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter study, we analyzed routine scalp EEGs from 218 patients with suspected epilepsy and normal initial EEGs. The patients’ diagnoses were later confirmed based on an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admission. About 46% ultimately being diagnosed with epilepsy and 54% with non-epileptic conditions. A logistic regression model was trained using spectral and network-derived EEG features to differentiate between epilepsy and non-epilepsy. Of the 218 patients, 90% were used for training and 10% were held out for testing. Within the training set, 10-fold cross validation was performed. The resulting tool was named “EpiScalp.”</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EpiScalp achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940, an accuracy of 0.904, a sensitivity of 0.835, and a specificity of 0.963 in classifying patients as having epilepsy or not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EpiScalp provides an accurate diagnostic aid from a single initial EEG recording, even in more challenging epilepsy cases with normal initial EEGs. This may represent a paradigm shift in epilepsy diagnosis by deriving an objective measure of epilepsy likelihood from previously uninformative EEGs. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons are a major class of electrophysiologically and morphologically distinct inhibitory cells in the mammalian neocortex. Transcriptomic data suggest that this class can be divided into multiple subtypes that are correlated with morpho-electric properties. At the same time, availability of transgenic tools to identify and record from SST neurons in awake, behaving mice has stimulated insights about their response properties and computational function. Neocortical SST neurons are regulated by sleep and arousal, attention, and novelty detection, and show marked response plasticity during learning. Recent studies suggest that subtype-specific analysis of SST neurons may be critical for understanding their complex roles in cortical function. In this review, we discuss and synthesize recent advances in understanding the diversity, circuit integration, and functional properties of this important group of GABAergic neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101943">Outer hair cells stir cochlear fluids</a></h4>

              
                We hypothesized that active outer hair cells drive cochlear fluid circulation. The hypothesis was tested by delivering the neurotoxin, kainic acid, to the intact round window of young gerbil cochleae while monitoring auditory responses in the cochlear nucleus. Sounds presented at a modest level significantly expedited kainic acid delivery. When outer-hair-cell motility was suppressed by salicylate, the facilitation effect was compromised. A low-frequency tone was more effective than broadband noise, especially for drug delivery to apical locations. Computational model simulations provided the physical basis for our observation, which incorporated solute diffusion, fluid advection, fluid–structure interaction, and outer-hair-cell motility. Active outer hair cells deformed the organ of Corti like a peristaltic tube to generate apically streaming flows along the tunnel of Corti and basally streaming flows along the scala tympani. Our measurements and simulations coherently suggest that active outer hair cells in the tail region of cochlear traveling waves drive cochlear fluid circulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100060">Crispant analysis in zebrafish as a tool for rapid functional screening of disease-causing genes for bone fragility</a></h4>

              
                Heritable fragile bone disorders (FBDs), ranging from multifactorial to rare monogenic conditions, are characterized by an elevated fracture risk. Validating causative genes and understanding their mechanisms remain challenging. We assessed a semi-high throughput zebrafish screening platform for rapid <i>in vivo</i> functional testing of candidate FBD genes. Six genes linked to severe recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and four associated with bone mineral density (BMD) from genome-wide association studies were analyzed using CRISPR/Cas9-based crispant screening in F0 mosaic founder zebrafish. Next-generation sequencing confirmed high indel efficiency (mean 88%), mimicking stable knock-out models. Skeletal phenotyping at 7, 14, and 90 days post-fertilization (dpf) using microscopy, Alizarin Red S staining, and microCT was performed. Larval crispants showed variable osteoblast and mineralization phenotypes, while adult crispants displayed consistent skeletal defects, including malformed neural and haemal arches, vertebral fractures and fusions, and altered bone volume and density. In addition, <i>aldh7a1</i> and <i>mbtps2</i> crispants experienced increased mortality due to severe skeletal deformities. RT-qPCR revealed differential expression of osteogenic markers <i>bglap</i> and <i>col1a1a</i>, highlighting their biomarker potential. Our results establish zebrafish crispant screening as a robust tool for FBD gene validation, combining skeletal and molecular analyses across developmental stages to uncover novel insights into gene functions in bone biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100922">Early and delayed STAT1-dependent responses drive local trained immunity of macrophages in the spleen</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell-type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100545">Discovery of a heparan sulfate binding domain in monkeypox virus H3 as an anti-poxviral drug target combining AI and MD simulations</a></h4>

              
                Viral adhesion to host cells is a critical step in infection for many viruses, including monkeypox virus (MPXV). In MPXV, the H3 protein mediates viral adhesion through its interaction with heparan sulfate (HS), yet the structural details of this interaction have remained elusive. Using AI-based structural prediction tools and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified a novel, positively charged α-helical domain in H3 that is essential for HS binding. This conserved domain, found across <i>orthopoxviruses</i>, was experimentally validated and shown to be critical for viral adhesion, making it an ideal target for antiviral drug development. Targeting this domain, we designed a protein inhibitor, which disrupted the H3-HS interaction, inhibited viral infection in vitro and viral replication in vivo, offering a promising antiviral candidate. Our findings reveal a novel therapeutic target of MPXV, demonstrating the potential of combination of AI-driven methods and MD simulations to accelerate antiviral drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99696">Encoding of cerebellar dentate neuron activity during visual attention in rhesus macaques</a></h4>

              
                The role of cerebellum in controlling eye movements is well established, but its contribution to more complex forms of visual behavior has remained elusive. To study cerebellar activity during visual attention we recorded extracellular activity of dentate nucleus (DN) neurons in two non-human primates (NHPs). NHPs were trained to read the direction indicated by a peripheral visual stimulus while maintaining fixation at the center, and report the direction of the cue by performing a saccadic eye movement into the same direction following a delay. We found that single-unit DN neurons modulated spiking activity over the entire time course of the task, and that their activity often bridged temporally separated intra-trial events, yet in a heterogeneous manner. To better understand the heterogeneous relationship between task structure, behavioral performance, and neural dynamics, we constructed a behavioral, an encoding, and a decoding model. Both NHPs showed different behavioral strategies, which influenced the performance. Activity of the DN neurons reflected the unique strategies, with the direction of the visual stimulus frequently being encoded long before an upcoming saccade. Moreover, the latency of the ramping activity of DN neurons following presentation of the visual stimulus was shorter in the better performing NHP. Labeling with the retrograde tracer Cholera Toxin B in the recording location in the DN indicated that these neurons predominantly receive inputs from Purkinje cells in the D1 and D2 zones of the lateral cerebellum as well as neurons of the principal olive and medial pons, all regions known to connect with neurons in the prefrontal cortex contributing to planning of saccades. Together, our results highlight that DN neurons can dynamically modulate their activity during a visual attention task, comprising not only sensorimotor but also cognitive attentional components.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101701">Exploration of the metabolomic mechanisms of postmenopausal hypertension induced by low estrogen state</a></h4>

              
                Estrogen significantly impacts women’s health, and postmenopausal hypertension is a common issue characterized by blood pressure fluctuations. Current control strategies for this condition are limited in efficacy, necessitating further research into the underlying mechanisms. Although metabolomics has been applied to study various diseases, its use in understanding postmenopausal hypertension is scarce. Therefore, an ovariectomized rat model was used to simulate postmenopausal conditions. Estrogen levels, blood pressure, and aortic tissue metabolomics were analyzed. Animal models were divided into Sham, OVX, and OVX +E groups. Serum estrogen levels, blood pressure measurements, and aortic tissue metabolomics analyses were performed using radioimmunoassay, UHPLC-Q-TOF, and bioinformatics techniques. Based on the above research content, we successfully established a correlation between low estrogen levels and postmenopausal hypertension in rats. Notable differences in blood pressure parameters and aortic tissue metabolites were observed across the experimental groups. Specifically, metabolites that were differentially expressed, particularly L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (L-AABA), showed potential as a biomarker for postmenopausal hypertension, potentially exerting a protective function through macrophage activation and vascular remodeling. Enrichment analysis revealed alterations in sugar metabolism pathways, such as the Warburg effect and glycolysis, indicating their involvement in postmenopausal hypertension. Overall, this current research provides insights into the metabolic changes associated with postmenopausal hypertension, highlighting the role of L-AABA and sugar metabolism reprogramming in aortic tissue. The findings suggest a potential link between low estrogen levels, macrophage function, and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal hypertension. Further investigations are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications for postmenopausal women.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97865">Target-agnostic identification of human antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum sexual forms reveals cross-stage recognition of glutamate-rich repeats</a></h4>

              
                Circulating sexual stages of <i>Plasmodium falciparum (Pf</i>) can be transmitted from humans to mosquitoes, thereby furthering the spread of malaria in the population. It is well established that antibodies can efficiently block parasite transmission. In search for naturally acquired antibodies targets on sexual stages, we established an efficient method for target-agnostic single B cell activation followed by high-throughput selection of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reactive to sexual stages of <i>Pf</i> in the form of gametes and gametocyte extracts. We isolated mAbs reactive against a range of <i>Pf</i> proteins including well-established targets Pfs48/45 and Pfs230. One mAb, B1E11K, was cross-reactive to various proteins containing glutamate-rich repetitive elements expressed at different stages of the parasite life cycle. A crystal structure of two B1E11K Fab domains in complex with its main antigen, RESA, expressed on asexual blood stages, showed binding of B1E11K to a repeating epitope motif in a head-to-head conformation engaging in affinity-matured homotypic interactions. Thus, this mode of recognition of <i>Pf</i> proteins, previously described only for Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), extends to other repeats expressed across various stages. The findings augment our understanding of immune-pathogen interactions to repeating elements of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite proteome and underscore the potential of the novel mAb identification method used to provide new insights into the natural humoral immune response against <i>Pf</i>.

	<p>Background: The integration of digital health technologies has transformed mental healthcare, particularly for young adults with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP). Digital interventions, such as telepsychiatry and mobile applications, address barriers like social stigma, restricted access to services, and the urgency of timely care. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed and APA PsycINFO. Included studies focused on randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and open studies of digital interventions for FEP rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria included meta-analyses, reviews, and irrelevant studies. Results: Smartphone applications like Horyzons-Canada facilitated peer support and symptom management, while tools such as My Journey 3 emphasized the need for better user engagement. Digital innovations, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and telepsychiatry, demonstrated improvements in recovery and treatment adherence. Discussion: Digital interventions significantly enhance the accessibility and quality of FEP care, supporting functional recovery and patient engagement. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies, user engagement strategies, and advanced analytics to develop personalized, scalable solutions.</p>

	<p>Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are transforming the study of movement disorders by providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms. This narrative review presents a comprehensive overview of their applications in this field, offering an updated perspective on their potential for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation. Emerging MRI modalities such as neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometry provide sensitive biomarkers that can detect early microstructural degeneration, iron deposition, and connectivity disruptions in key regions like the substantia nigra. These techniques enable earlier and more accurate differentiation of movement disorders, including Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body and frontotemporal dementia, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and dystonia. Furthermore, MRI provides objective metrics for tracking disease progression and assessing therapeutic efficacy, making it an indispensable tool in clinical trials. Despite these advances, the absence of standardized protocols limits their integration into routine clinical practice. Addressing this gap and incorporating these techniques more systematically could bring the field closer to leveraging advanced MRI for personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals with movement disorders.</p>

	<p>The global prevalence of sedentary lifestyles and the associated health risks, such as cardiovascular, metabolic and mental issues, is an epidemic worldwide problem, particularly in the university population. Background/Objectives: University students are particularly vulnerable because of academic pressure and lifestyle changes. Despite the well-known benefits of physical activity in reducing mental stress and improving physical and mental well-being, the literature lacks effective interventions and standardized protocols for this population. This study aims to investigate the state of the art in literature regarding the correlation between the use of physical activity as a means of prevention and intervention and the effects on university students&amp;amp;rsquo; stress and mental well-being. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA protocol for scoping reviews, targeting university population with specific terms. Results: The review analyzed 61 articles and identified a consistent positive correlation between physical activity and stress reduction. Interventions included yoga, tai chi, aerobic exercise and moderate- or high-intensity exercise. A lack of standardized protocols were also evident. Conclusions: Physical activity is an effective means for managing stress and improving mental well-being among university students. An integrated approach combining different forms of exercise and strategies to regulate emotions could provide very effective effects on the mental well-being of students. Universities should propose physical activity programs in several forms to enable students to choose the most appropriate one and keep them active.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The cerebellum is a common lesion site in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Physiologic and anatomic studies have identified a topographic organization of the cerebellum including functionally distinct motor and cognitive areas. In this study, a recent parcellation algorithm was applied to a sample of PwMS and healthy controls to examine the relationships among specific cerebellar regions, fall status, and common clinical measures of motor and cognitive functions. Methods: Thirty-one PwMS and twenty-nine age- and sex-matched controls underwent an MRI scan and motor and cognitive testing. The parcellation algorithm was applied to all images and divided the cerebellum into 28 regions. Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests were used to compare cerebellar volumes among PwMS and controls, and MS fallers and MS non-fallers. Relationships between cerebellar volumes and motor and cognitive function were evaluated using Spearman correlations. Results: PwMS performed significantly worse on functional measures compared to controls. We found significant differences in volumetric measures between PwMS and controls in the corpus medullare, lobules I&amp;amp;ndash;III, and lobule V. Volumetric differences seen between the PwMS and controls were primarily driven by the MS fallers. Finally, functional performance on motor and cognitive tasks was associated with cerebellar volumes. Conclusions: Using the parcellation tool, our results showed that the volumes of motor and cognitive lobules impact both motor and cognitive performance, and that functional performance and cerebellar volumes distinguishes the MS fallers from non-fallers. Future studies should explore the potential of cerebellar imaging to predict falls in PwMS.</p>

	<p>Background: The molecular biology of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (HD) has grown substantially, with pathological considerations extending to genetic modifiers, epigenetic changes, transcriptomics, the proteome, and the metabolome. The metabolome and proteome are especially intriguing in that they most directly reflect the functional state of the cellular environment, which may involve some combination of pathology as well as compensation. Methods: We assessed CSF proteomics from eight participants by their functional severity (TFC range 3&amp;amp;ndash;13), with 47 proteins having a minimum r-value of 0.7 and nominal p-values &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Results: Our exploratory data reveal correlations between progression and several processes including inflammation, ECM homeostasis and NAD+ metabolism. Conclusions: Consistently identified targets that correlate with phenotype or progression may have value, if validated, as enrichment tools in clinical trials and potentially as markers of therapeutic response.</p>
