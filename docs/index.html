              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17820">Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks can predict the surgery outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy surgery, particularly for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), remains a vital treatment option for patients with drug-resistant seizures. However, accurately predicting surgical outcomes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel biomarker derived from brain connectivity changes caused by TLE surgery, analyzed using hyperbolic graph embeddings, to predict surgical success. Using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 51 patients, we examined differences in structural connectivity networks associated to surgical outcomes. Our approach uniquely leveraged hyperbolic Poincare disk embeddings of pre- and post-surgery brain networks, successfully distinguishing patients with favorable outcomes from those with poor outcomes. Notably, the method identified regions in the contralateral hemisphere relative to the epileptogenic zone, whose connectivity patterns emerged as a potential biomarker for favorable surgical outcomes. To validate the model, we employed a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. These results underscore the predictive capability of our model and its effectiveness in individual outcome forecasting based on structural network changes. Our findings highlight the use of non-Euclidean hyperbolic graph embeddings to analyze brain networks, offering deeper insights into connectivity alterations in epilepsy, and advancing personalized prediction of surgical outcomes in TLE.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18258">The same but different: impact of animal facility sanitary status on a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gut-brain axis has emerged as a key player in the regulation of brain function and cognitive health. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been observed in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease and patients. Manipulating the composition of the gut microbiota enhances or delays neuropathology and cognitive deficits in mouse models. Accordingly, the health status of the animal facility may strongly influence these outcomes. In the present study, we longitudinally analysed the faecal microbiota composition and amyloid pathology of 5XFAD mice housed in a specific opportunistic pathogen-free (SOPF) and a conventional facility. The composition of the microbiota of 5XFAD mice after aging in conventional facility showed marked differences compared to WT littermates that were not observed when the mice were bred in SOPF facility.
  The development of amyloid pathology was also enhanced by conventional housing. We then transplanted faecal microbiota (FMT) from both sources into wild-type (WT) mice and measured memory performance, assessed in the novel object recognition test, in transplanted animals. Mice transplanted with microbiota from conventionally bred 5XFAD mice showed impaired memory performance, whereas FMT from mice housed in SOPF facility did not induce memory deficits in transplanted mice. Finally, 18 weeks of housing SOPF-born animals in a conventional facility resulted in the reappearance of specific microbiota compositions in 5XFAD vs WT mice. In conclusion, these results show a strong impact of housing conditions on microbiota-associated phenotypes and question the relevance of breeding preclinical models in specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities.

                arXiv:2412.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an analysis of sensorimotor rhythms using an advanced, optically-pumped magnetoencephalography (OPM-MEG) system - a novel and rapidly developing technology. We conducted real-movement and motor imagery experiments with nine participants across two distinct magnetically-shielded environments: one featuring an analog active suppression system and the other a digital implementation. Our findings demonstrate that, under optimal recording conditions, OPM sensors provide highly informative signals, suitable for use in practical motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. We further examine the feasibility of a portable, low-sensor-count OPM-based BCI under varied experimental setups, highlighting its potential for real-time control of external devices via user intentions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18115">Statistical physics of large-scale neural activity with loops</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.18115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As experiments advance to record from tens of thousands of neurons, statistical physics provides a framework for understanding how collective activity emerges from networks of fine-scale correlations. While modeling these populations is tractable in loop-free networks, neural circuitry inherently contains feedback loops of connectivity. Here, for a class of networks with loops, we present an exact solution to the maximum entropy problem that scales to very large systems. This solution provides direct access to information-theoretic measures like the entropy of the model and the information contained in correlations, which are usually inaccessible at large scales. In turn, this allows us to search for the optimal network of correlations that contains the maximum information about population activity. Applying these methods to 45 recordings of approximately 10,000 neurons in the mouse visual system, we demonstrate that our framework captures more information -- providing a better description of the population -- than existing methods without loops. For a given population, our models perform even better during visual stimulation than spontaneous activity; however, the inferred interactions overlap significantly, suggesting an underlying neural circuitry that remains consistent across stimuli. Generally, we construct an optimized framework for studying the statistical physics of large neural populations, with future applications extending to other biological networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18354">The Thousand Brains Project: A New Paradigm for Sensorimotor Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly in the last decade, driven primarily by progress in the scale of deep-learning systems. Despite these advances, the creation of intelligent systems that can operate effectively in diverse, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. In this white paper, we outline the Thousand Brains Project, an ongoing research effort to develop an alternative, complementary form of AI, derived from the operating principles of the neocortex. We present an early version of a thousand-brains system, a sensorimotor agent that is uniquely suited to quickly learn a wide range of tasks and eventually implement any capabilities the human neocortex has. Core to its design is the use of a repeating computational unit, the learning module, modeled on the cortical columns found in mammalian brains. Each learning module operates as a semi-independent unit that can model entire objects, represents information through spatially structured reference frames, and both estimates and is able to effect movement in the world. Learning is a quick, associative process, similar to Hebbian learning in the brain, and leverages inductive biases around the spatial structure of the world to enable rapid and continual learning. Multiple learning modules can interact with one another both hierarchically and non-hierarchically via a "cortical messaging protocol" (CMP), creating more abstract representations and supporting multimodal integration. We outline the key principles motivating the design of thousand-brains systems and provide details about the implementation of Monty, our first instantiation of such a system.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18445">Towards the Automatic Detection of Vection in Virtual Reality Using EEG</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.18445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vection, the visual illusion of self-motion, provides a strong marker of the VR user experience and plays an important role in both presence and cybersickness. Traditional measurements have been conducted using questionnaires, which exhibit inherent limitations due to their subjective nature and preventing real-time adjustments. Detecting vection in real time would allow VR systems to adapt to users' needs, improving comfort and minimizing negative effects like motion sickness. This paper investigates the presence of vection markers in electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals using evoked potentials (brain responses to external stimulations).
  We designed a VR experiment that induces vection using two conditions: (1) forward acceleration or (2) backward acceleration. We recorded both electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and gathered subjective reports on thirty (30) participants. We found an evoked potential of vection characterized by a positive peak around 600 ms (P600) after stimulus onset in the parietal region and a simultaneous negative peak in the frontal region. Our results also found participant variability in sensitivity to vection and cybersickness and EEG markers of acceleration across subjects. This result is promising for potential detection of vection using EEG and paves the way for future studies towards a better understanding of vection. It also provides insights into the functional role of the visual system and its integration with the vestibular system during motion-perception. It has the potential to help enhance VR user experience by qualifying users' perceived vection and adapting the VR environments accordingly.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17855">Foxtsage vs. Adam: Revolution or Evolution in Optimization?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization techniques are pivotal in neural network training, shaping both predictive performance and convergence efficiency. This study introduces Foxtsage, a novel hybrid optimisation approach that integrates the Hybrid FOX-TSA with Stochastic Gradient Descent for training Multi-Layer Perceptron models. The proposed Foxtsage method is benchmarked against the widely adopted Adam optimizer across multiple standard datasets, focusing on key performance metrics such as training loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational time. Experimental results demonstrate that Foxtsage achieves a 42.03% reduction in loss mean (Foxtsage: 9.508, Adam: 16.402) and a 42.19% improvement in loss standard deviation (Foxtsage: 20.86, Adam: 36.085), reflecting enhanced consistency and robustness. Modest improvements in accuracy mean (0.78%), precision mean (0.91%), recall mean (1.02%), and F1-score mean (0.89%) further underscore its predictive performance. However, these gains are accompanied by an increased computational cost, with a 330.87% rise in time mean (Foxtsage: 39.541 seconds, Adam: 9.177 seconds). By effectively combining the global search capabilities of FOX-TSA with the stability and adaptability of SGD, Foxtsage presents itself as a robust and viable alternative for neural network optimization tasks.

Abstract: The extensive development of the field of spiking neural networks has led to many areas of research that have a direct impact on people's lives. As the most bio-similar of all neural networks, spiking neural networks not only allow the solution of recognition and clustering problems (including dynamics), but also contribute to the growing knowledge of the human nervous system. Our analysis has shown that the hardware implementation is of great importance, since the specifics of the physical processes in the network cells affect their ability to simulate the neural activity of living neural tissue, the efficiency of certain stages of information processing, storage and transmission. This survey reviews existing hardware neuromorphic implementations of bio-inspired spiking networks in the "semiconductor", "superconductor" and "optical" domains. Special attention is given to the possibility of effective "hybrids" of different approaches

                arXiv:2412.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural associative memories are single layer perceptrons with fast synaptic learning typically storing discrete associations between pairs of neural activity patterns. Previous works have analyzed the optimal networks under naive Bayes assumptions of independent pattern components and heteroassociation, where the task is to learn associations from input to output patterns. Here I study the optimal Bayesian associative network for auto-association where input and output layers are identical. In particular, I compare performance to different variants of approximate Bayesian learning rules, like the BCPNN (Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network), and try to explain why sometimes the suboptimal learning rules achieve higher storage capacity than the (theoretically) optimal model. It turns out that performance can depend on subtle dependencies of input components violating the ``naive Bayes'' assumptions. This includes patterns with constant number of active units, iterative retrieval where patterns are repeatedly propagated through recurrent networks, and winners-take-all activation of the most probable units. Performance of all learning rules can improve significantly if they include a novel adaptive mechanism to estimate noise in iterative retrieval steps (ANE). The overall maximum storage capacity is achieved again by the Bayesian learning rule with ANE.

                arXiv:2412.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses theory in evolutionary multiobjective optimisation (EMO) and focuses on the role of crossover operators in many-objective optimisation. The advantages of using crossover are hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging far behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two objectives. We present a many-objective problem class together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the widely used NSGA-III to demonstrate that crossover can yield an exponential speedup on the runtime. In particular, this algorithm can find the Pareto set in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover it requires exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective optimisation demonstrating an exponential performance gap when using crossover for more than two objectives.

                arXiv:2412.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs), a special class of spiking neural networks, draw inspiration from the neocortex in utilizing spike-timings for information processing. Recent works proposed a microarchitecture framework and custom macro suite for designing highly energy-efficient application-specific TNNs. These recent works rely on manual hardware design, a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Further, there is no open-source functional simulation framework for TNNs. This paper introduces TNNGen, a pioneering effort towards the automated design of TNNs from PyTorch software models to post-layout netlists. TNNGen comprises a novel PyTorch functional simulator (for TNN modeling and application exploration) coupled with a Python-based hardware generator (for PyTorch-to-RTL and RTL-to-Layout conversions). Seven representative TNN designs for time-series signal clustering across diverse sensory modalities are simulated and their post-layout hardware complexity and design runtimes are assessed to demonstrate the effectiveness of TNNGen. We also highlight TNNGen's ability to accurately forecast silicon metrics without running hardware process flow.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19165">DelGrad: Exact event-based gradients in spiking networks for training delays and weights</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.19165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently rely on the timing of signals for representing and processing information. Incorporating trainable transmission delays, alongside synaptic weights, is crucial for shaping these temporal dynamics. While recent methods have shown the benefits of training delays and weights in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency, they rely on discrete time, approximate gradients, and full access to internal variables like membrane potentials. This limits their precision, efficiency, and suitability for neuromorphic hardware due to increased memory requirements and I/O bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, we propose DelGrad, an analytical, event-based method to compute exact loss gradients for both synaptic weights and delays. The inclusion of delays in the training process emerges naturally within our proposed formalism, enriching the model's search space with a temporal dimension. Moreover, DelGrad, grounded purely in spike timing, eliminates the need to track additional variables such as membrane potentials. To showcase this key advantage, we demonstrate the functionality and benefits of DelGrad on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic platform, by training SNNs in a chip-in-the-loop fashion. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the memory efficiency and accuracy benefits of adding delays to SNNs on noisy mixed-signal hardware. Additionally, these experiments also reveal the potential of delays for stabilizing networks against noise. DelGrad opens a new way for training SNNs with delays on neuromorphic hardware, which results in less number of required parameters, higher accuracy and ease of hardware training.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629">Graph Neural Networks Are Evolutionary Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic duality between graph neural networks (GNNs) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), bridging two traditionally distinct fields. Building on this insight, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel evolutionary algorithm that models individuals as nodes in a graph and leverages designed frequency-domain filters to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Through the use of these filters, GNE aggregates high-frequency (diversity-enhancing) and low-frequency (stability-promoting) information, transforming EAs into interpretable and tunable mechanisms in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on benchmark functions demonstrate that GNE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as GA, DE, CMA-ES, SDAES, and RL-SHADE, excelling in complex landscapes, optimal solution shifts, and noisy environments. Its robustness, adaptability, and superior convergence highlight its practical and theoretical value. Beyond optimization, GNE establishes a conceptual and mathematical foundation linking EAs and GNNs, offering new perspectives for both fields. Its framework encourages the development of task-adaptive filters and hybrid approaches for EAs, while its insights can inspire advances in GNNs, such as improved global information propagation and mitigation of oversmoothing. GNE's versatility extends to solving challenges in machine learning, including hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search, as well as real-world applications in engineering and operations research. By uniting the dynamics of EAs with the structural insights of GNNs, this work provides a foundation for interdisciplinary innovation, paving the way for scalable and interpretable solutions to complex optimization problems.

                arXiv:2408.14909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Known as low energy consumption networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained a lot of attention within the past decades. While SNNs are increasing competitive with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for vision tasks, they are rarely used for long sequence tasks, despite their intrinsic temporal dynamics. In this work, we develop spiking state space models (SpikingSSMs) for long sequence learning by leveraging on the sequence learning abilities of state space models (SSMs). Inspired by dendritic neuron structure, we hierarchically integrate neuronal dynamics with the original SSM block, meanwhile realizing sparse synaptic computation. Furthermore, to solve the conflict of event-driven neuronal dynamics with parallel computing, we propose a light-weight surrogate dynamic network which accurately predicts the after-reset membrane potential and compatible to learnable thresholds, enabling orders of acceleration in training speed compared with conventional iterative methods. On the long range arena benchmark task, SpikingSSM achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art SSMs meanwhile realizing on average 90\% of network sparsity. On language modeling, our network significantly surpasses existing spiking large language models (spikingLLMs) on the WikiText-103 dataset with only a third of the model size, demonstrating its potential as backbone architecture for low computation cost LLMs.

                arXiv:2411.10958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

                arXiv:2412.13541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.

                arXiv:2412.14522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CwA-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CwA-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

                The past decade has been marked by increased discussions on sustainability; some of the prominent accelerators being, mounting natural disasters, vocal climate activism, and the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interest has crossed over from deliberations in global summits to grassroots-level communication. Additionally, the literature points to the increasing usage of social media in the communication of sustainability with an increase of interest in this area among Asian researchers. This paper aims to understand the direction of sustainability communication and the usage of social media in the communication of sustainability, in the last decade (2013-2023), from an Asian perspective – researchers and respondents from Asia. A comprehensive search of the literature by Asian researchers on sustainability communication on social media in the past decade was conducted using the Scopus database. The studies were clustered around common directions and terminologies, basis an in-depth content analysis. Based on the analysis, the study presents prominent themes and the current direction of research in sustainability communication on social media. The studies analyzed in the scoping review affirm that sustainability communication on social media in Asia has substantial potential to improve the environmental awareness of the public and promote actual pro-environmental behavior both in terms of green purchase as well as conservation behavior. The review provides a holistic view of the recent trends and possible future directions for sustainability communication on social media.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 55.4% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 19.3% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.

                Background Death due to hanging is commonly seen. Sometime the ligature mark will be very prominent and in some cases it might not. In those cases, the post-mortem examination with its gross morphological findings and histopathological analysis, becomes significantly important. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the patterns of epidemiological, gross morphological, and histopathological features in hanging cases. Methods The study was conducted on 46 cases of hanging. Their sociodemographic features were collected. Gross morphological analysis of the ligature mark and various measurements were taken. Later tissue from the ligature mark was sent for histopathological analysis. Statistical analysis was performed on the collected parameters. Results Significant male preponderance was observed in hanging cases. The maximum number of cases of hanging were observed in the fourth decade of life. Daily wage workers were the most significantly affected population. Depression was cited as the cause of suicide in most cases. Carotid intimal tears and injuries to bony and cartilaginous structures were present in smaller numbers. Vital reaction was observed in all 46 cases. Classification of fwound vitality showed a correlation to known time since injury. Conclusion The results of the present study showed that socio-demographic factors play a significant role in the circumstances leading to suicidal deaths. Therefore, in reducing the burden of suicidal deaths, these factors must be addressed. To identify the cause of death as hanging analysis of various gross features and histopathology are very important and should be conducted carefully.

<p>Dipyridamole (DIP) improved Niemann Pick C1 disease (NPC1) mice motivation to perform the Erasmus Ladder test and preserved their recognition memory.

Our results demonstrated that DIP could represent a valuable therapeutic tool to be used in combination with other approved drugs in NPC.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Niemann Pick type C1 (NPC1) is a rare, fatal disorder characterized by endosomal lipid accumulation that leads to damage of both peripheral organs and central nervous system (cerebellum and hippocampus are especially affected). Currently, miglustat is the only approved drug for NPC1, thus the identification of new treatments is mandatory. We have previously demonstrated that the drug dipyridamole (DIP), an enhancer of adenosine signaling, can reduce the pathological phenotype in patient-derived fibroblasts. In this paper, we evaluated the <i>in vivo</i> effects of DIP in NPC1 mice. Male and female NPC1<sup>nih</sup> mice were treated with DIP 30 mg/kg i.p. from 28 to 64 days of age. Motor function was assessed by Erasmus Ladder test, hippocampal cognitive decline by Novel Object Recognition test and brain pathology by immunofluorescence and biochemical assays. Peripheral pathology was evaluated by analyzing lipid accumulation in spleen and liver (HP-TLC). In NPC1, mice DIP rescued recognition memory and increased hippocampal expression of calbindin. On the contrary, the drug was unable to improve motor function, cerebellar pathology and lipid accumulation in spleen and liver. Our results demonstrated that DIP selectively ameliorates the cognitive impairment in NPC1 mice. This drug could thus represent a valuable therapeutic tool to be used in combination with other treatments in NPC1.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99833">Accurate predictions of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity from comprehensive analysis</a></h4>

              
                An unprecedented amount of SARS-CoV-2 data has been accumulated compared with previous infectious diseases, enabling insights into its evolutionary process and more thorough analyses. This study investigates SARS-CoV-2 features as it evolved to evaluate its infectivity. We examined viral sequences and identified the polarity of amino acids in the receptor binding motif (RBM) region. We detected an increased frequency of amino acid substitutions to lysine (K) and arginine (R) in variants of concern (VOCs). As the virus evolved to Omicron, commonly occurring mutations became fixed components of the new viral sequence. Furthermore, at specific positions of VOCs, only one type of amino acid substitution and a notable absence of mutations at D467 were detected. We found that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages to the ACE2 receptor was impacted by amino acid substitutions. Based on our discoveries, we developed APESS, an evaluation model evaluating infectivity from biochemical and mutational properties. In silico evaluation using real-world sequences and in vitro viral entry assays validated the accuracy of APESS and our discoveries. Using Machine Learning, we predicted mutations that had the potential to become more prominent. We created AIVE, a web-based system, accessible at <a href="https://ai-ve.org">https://ai-ve.org</a> to provide infectivity measurements of mutations entered by users. Ultimately, we established a clear link between specific viral properties and increased infectivity, enhancing our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and enabling more accurate predictions of the virus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96312">A multisite validation of brain white matter pathways of resilience to chronic back pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic back pain (CBP) is a global health concern with significant societal and economic burden. While various predictors of back pain chronicity have been proposed, including demographic and psychosocial factors, neuroimaging studies have pointed to brain characteristics as predictors of CBP. However, large-scale, multisite validation of these predictors is currently lacking. In two independent longitudinal studies, we examined white matter diffusion imaging data and pain characteristics in patients with subacute back pain (SBP) over 6- and 12-month periods. Diffusion data from individuals with CBP and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed for comparison. Whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics analyses revealed that a cluster in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) tract had larger fractional anisotropy (FA) values in patients who recovered (SBPr) compared to those with persistent pain (SBPp), and predicted changes in pain severity. The SLF FA values accurately classified patients at baseline and follow-up in a third publicly available dataset (Area under the Receiver Operating Curve ~0.70). Notably, patients who recovered had FA values larger than those of HC suggesting a potential role of SLF integrity in resilience to CBP. Structural connectivity-based models also classified SBPp and SBPr patients from the three data sets (validation accuracy 67%). Our results validate the right SLF <i>as a robust predictor of CBP development, with potential for clinical translation</i>. Cognitive and behavioral processes dependent on the right SLF, such as proprioception and visuospatial attention, should be analyzed in subacute stages as they could prove important for back pain chronicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100205">Constitutively active receptor ADGRA3 signaling induces adipose thermogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The induction of adipose thermogenesis plays a critical role in maintaining body temperature and improving metabolic homeostasis to combat obesity. β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) is widely recognized as a canonical β-adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Nonetheless, the limited expression of β3-AR in human adipocytes restricts its clinical application. The objective of this study was to identify a GPCR that is highly expressed in human adipocytes and to explore its potential involvement in adipose thermogenesis. Our research findings have demonstrated that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3), an orphan GPCR, plays a significant role in adipose thermogenesis through its constitutively active effects. ADGRA3 exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes and mouse brown fat. Furthermore, the knockdown of <i>Adgra3</i> resulted in an exacerbated obese phenotype and a reduction in the expression of thermogenic markers in mice. Conversely, <i>Adgra3</i> overexpression activated the adipose thermogenic program and improved metabolic homeostasis in mice without exogenous ligand. We found that ADGRA3 facilitates the biogenesis of beige human or mouse adipocytes in vitro. Moreover, hesperetin was identified as a potential agonist of ADGRA3, capable of inducing adipocyte browning and ameliorating insulin resistance in mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the overexpression of constitutively active ADGRA3 or the activation of ADGRA3 by hesperetin can induce adipocyte browning by Gs-PKA-CREB axis. These findings indicate that the utilization of hesperetin and the selective overexpression of ADGRA3 in adipose tissue could serve as promising therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93749">Bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding</a></h4>

              
                Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely, experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain. Here, we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release (<i>SR</i>) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high <i>SR</i> synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101248">Gasdermin D-mediated neutrophil pyroptosis drives inflammation in psoriasis</a></h4>

              
                Psoriasis is a multifactorial immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Its pathogenesis involves abnormal accumulation of neutrophils and T-cell-related abnormalities. Pyroptosis is a type of regulated cell death associated with innate immunity, but its role in psoriasis is unclear. In this study, we found that <i>gasdermin D (GSDMD</i>) is higher in human psoriatic skin than that in normal skin, and in imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse skin, the expression of <i>Gsdmd</i> was most significantly altered in neutrophils and <i>Il1b</i> was also mainly expressed in neutrophils. Immunohistochemical staining of serial sections of skin lesions from psoriasis patients and healthy control also showed that GSDMD expression is higher in psoriasis lesion, especially in neutrophils. <i>Gsdmd</i> deficiency mitigates psoriasis-like inflammation in mice. GSDMD in neutrophils contributes to psoriasis-like inflammation, while <i>Gsdmd</i> depletion in neutrophils attenuates the development of skin inflammation in psoriasis and reduces the release of the inflammatory cytokines. We found that neutrophil pyroptosis is involved in and contributes to psoriasis inflammation, which provides new insights into the treatment of psoriasis by targeting neutrophil pyroptosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96344">The satiety hormone cholecystokinin gates reproduction in fish by controlling gonadotropin secretion</a></h4>

              
                Life histories of oviparous species dictate high metabolic investment in the process of gonadal development leading to ovulation. In vertebrates, these two distinct processes are controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), respectively. While it was suggested that a common secretagogue, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), oversees both functions, the generation of loss-of-function fish challenged this view. Here, we reveal that the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is the primary regulator of this axis in zebrafish. We found that FSH cells express a CCK receptor, and our findings demonstrate that mutating this receptor results in a severe hindrance to ovarian development. Additionally, it causes a complete shutdown of both gonadotropins secretion. Using in-vivo and ex-vivo calcium imaging of gonadotrophs, we show that GnRH predominantly activates LH cells, whereas FSH cells respond to CCK stimulation, designating CCK as the bona fide FSH secretagogue. These findings indicate that the control of gametogenesis in fish was placed under different neural circuits, that are gated by CCK.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93646">CaBP1 and 2 enable sustained CaV1.3 calcium currents and synaptic transmission in inner hair cells</a></h4>

              
                To encode continuous sound stimuli, the inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapses utilize calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs), which reduce the inactivation of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 calcium channels. Mutations in the <i>CABP2</i> gene underlie non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss DFNB93. Besides CaBP2, the structurally related CaBP1 is highly abundant in the IHCs. Here, we investigated how the two CaBPs cooperatively regulate IHC synaptic function. In <i>Cabp1/2</i> double-knockout mice, we find strongly enhanced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation, slowed recovery from inactivation and impaired sustained exocytosis. Already mild IHC activation further reduces the availability of channels to trigger synaptic transmission and may effectively silence synapses. Spontaneous and sound-evoked responses of spiral ganglion neurons in vivo are strikingly reduced and strongly depend on stimulation rates. Transgenic expression of CaBP2 leads to substantial recovery of IHC synaptic function and hearing sensitivity. We conclude that CaBP1 and 2 act together to suppress voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in order to support sufficient rate of exocytosis and enable fast, temporally precise and indefatigable sound encoding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89638">Improving PD-1 blockade plus chemotherapy for complete remission of lung cancer by nanoPDLIM2</a></h4>

              
                Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate <i>PDLIM2</i> genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers.

">Alternating hemiplegia of childhood associated mutations in Atp1a3 reveal diverse neurological alterations in mice.</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic variants in the neuronal Na+/K+ ATPase transmembrane ion transporter (ATP1A3) cause a spectrum of neurological disorders including alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). The most common de novo pathogenic variants in AHC are p.D801N (~40% of patients) and p.E815K (~25% of patients), which lead to early mortality by spontaneous death in mice. Nevertheless, knowledge of the development of clinically relevant neurological phenotypes without the obstacle of premature death, is critical for the identification of pathophysiological mechanisms and ultimately, for the testing of therapeutic strategies in disease models. Here, we used hybrid vigor attempting to mitigate the fragility of AHC mice and then, performed behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical, and molecular testing to comparatively analyze mice that carry either of two most common AHC patient observed variants in the Atp1a3 gene. Collectively, our data reveal the presence but also the differential impact of the p.D801N and p.E815 variants on disease relevant alterations such as spontaneous and stress-induced paroxysmal episodes, motor function, behavioral and neurophysiological activity, and neuroinflammation. Our alternate AHC mouse models with their phenotypic deficits open novel avenues for the investigation of disease biology and therapeutic testing for ATP1A3 research.

">Assessment of Contralateral Efferent Effects in Human Via ECochG</a></h4>

              
                Efferent projections from the brainstem to the inner ear are well-described anatomically and physiologically but their precise function remains debated. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) system and its reflex, the MOCR, have been particularly well studied. In animals, anatomical and physiological data are fine-grained and extensive and suggest an important role for the MOCR in anti-masking e.g. to improve the detection of tones in background noise. Extensive behavioral studies in human support this role, but direct linking of behavioral paradigms to the MOCR is challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining appropriate human neural measures. We developed a new approach in which mass potentials were recorded near the cochlea of normal hearing and awake human volunteers to increase the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, and examined whether broadband noise to the contralateral ear elicited MOCR anti-masking effects as reported in animals. Probing the mass potential to the onset of brief tones at 4 and 6 kHz, convincing anti-masking or suppressive effects consistent with the MOCR were not detected. We then changed the recording technique to examine the neural phase-locked contribution to the mass potential in response to long, low-frequency tones, and found that contralateral sound suppressed neural responses in a systematic and progressive manner. We followed up with psychophysical experiments in which we found that contralateral noise elevated detection threshold for tones up to 4 kHz. Our study provides a new way to study efferent effects in the human peripheral auditory system and shows that contralateral efferent effects are biased towards low frequencies.

">RiboTag-based RNA-Seq uncovers oligodendroglial lineage-specific inflammation in autoimmune encephalomyelitis</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are critical for neuronal support functions, including myelination and remyelination. Emerging evidence reveals their active roles in neuroinflammation, particularly in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study explores the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the early onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established MS model. Using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing in genetically modified Olig2-Cre RiboTag mice, we identified 1,556 upregulated and 683 downregulated genes in EAE OLCs. Enrichment analysis indicated heightened immune-related pathways, such as cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and antigen presentation, while downregulated genes were linked to neuronal development and myelination. Notably, OLCs expressed cytokines/chemokines, and their receptor, highlighting their active involvement in neuroinflammatory signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) signaling in OLCs exacerbates EAE pathology by enhancing antigen presentation and chemokine production, whereas interferon-beta (IFN-{beta}) signaling showed minimal impact. These findings provide novel insights into the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE and suggest therapeutic potential in targeting OLC-mediated neuroinflammation for MS and related disorders.

">Atypical Visual Selective Attention in Children with Dyslexia: Evidence from N2pc and PD</a></h4>

              
                Efficient visual attention is fundamental to the development of reading abilities. Previous studies have identified visual attention impairments in individuals with dyslexia, particularly in visual attention span and sluggish attention shifting. However, findings regarding basic visual selective attention remain controversial. To address this issue, the present study provides event-related potential (ERP) evidence to verify whether children with developmental dyslexia (DD) suffered from deficits in visual selective attention. A pop-out visual search task was used to examine visual attentional patterns to a lateral target in 66 children (33 children with DD and 33 typically developing (TD) children) using electroencephalography. Compared to TD children, children with DD showed a larger and prolonged P1 component, as well as a larger target-evoked N2pc component. The larger P1 amplitude was associated with lower reading fluency while the larger N2pc amplitude was associated with poor reading comprehension performance. Interestingly, the target-elicited N2pc was followed by positivity (PD component) in TD children but not in children with DD; however, the N2pc amplitude was correlated with the PD amplitude in children with DD. Children with DD show immature early attentional processing and may have an imbalance in the regulation of visual selective attention between attentional selection and suppression. Our findings provide ERP evidence for interpreting the underlying neural mechanism of visual selective attention in children with DD and may offer a new perspective for exploring the mechanism of visual attention deficits in dyslexia.

">Reactivation of reward representations associated with the reinforcement of behavior</a></h4>

              
                Reward-related representations are found distributed throughout many human subcortical and neocortical regions that support different neural processes. These representations get reinstated for different but related tasks. There is rising evidence that representations reactivate during learning to reinforce prior rewarding choices. However, there remains a critical lack of understanding for whether and how reactivations in humans can facilitate behavioral reinforcement. To investigate this, we recorded from the temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex with intracranial electrocorticography while human subjects learnt two-choice decisions across two different scenes. Crucially, subjects were able to straightforwardly reactivate knowledge gained in a prior scene to make decisions in the current scene, but only when the reward contingencies stayed the same between the two scenes. Using a Bayesian learner, we inferred reward expectation from choice behavior, and measured representations of these reward expectations in electrocorticography data. We found that the representations of reward expectation in the medial temporal lobe and orbitofrontal cortex were reactivated, only when the subjects could straightforwardly transfer knowledge between the two scenes. In the anterior temporal lobe, the reactivation of value representations increased as learning increased, suggesting an area of plasticity during learning. This work presents a novel framework for measuring the reinforcement, or reactivation, of representations from human electrophysiology during the reinforcement of behavior.

">Cell-specific delivery of GJB2 restores auditory function in mouse models of DFNB1 deafness and mediates appropriate expression in NHP cochlea</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the GJB2 gene cause the most common form of human hereditary hearing loss, known as DFNB1. GJB2 is expressed in two cell groups of the cochlea-epithelial cells of the organ of Corti and fibrocytes of the inner sulcus and lateral wall-but not by sensory hair cells or neurons. Attempts to treat mouse models of DFNB1 with AAV vectors mediating nonspecific Gjb2 expression have not substantially restored function, perhaps because inappropriate expression in hair cells and neurons could compromise their electrical activity. Here, we used genomic chromatin accessibility profiling to identify candidate gene regulatory elements (GREs) that could drive cell-type-specific expression of Gjb2 in the cochlea. HA-tagged GJB2, delivered to a conditional knockout model in an AAV vector with GRE control of expression, was localized to the appropriate cell types, prevented the cochlear degeneration observed in untreated knockout mice, and partially rescued hearing sensitivity. In a Gjb2 partial knockdown mouse model, such exogenous GJB2 prevented degeneration and completely restored hearing sensitivity. We tested control of expression by these GREs in nonhuman primate cochleas and found that vector-delivered human GJB2.HA was located in the appropriate cell types and caused little or no reduction in hearing sensitivity. Together, these findings suggest that GRE-mediated expression of GJB2 could prevent hearing loss in DFNB1 patients.

">A single Citrobacter rodentium infection in Pink1 knockout and wild type mice leads to regional blood-brain-barrier perturbation and glial activation without dopamine neuron axon terminal loss</a></h4>

              
                A growing body of research supports the hypothesis of links between immune system activation and the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). A recent study revealed that repeated gastrointestinal infection with Citrobacter rodentium can lead to PD-like motor dysfunction in Pink1 knockout (KO) mice and immune cell entry in the brain. With the objective of better understanding the mechanisms leading to immune attack of the brain in this model, we evaluated the hypothesis that such mild infections are sufficient to increase blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cause brain inflammation. Pink1 wild-type (WT) and KO mice were infected with Citrobacter rodentium and at day 13 and 26 post infection, we conducted gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify signs of BBB permeability changes. Quantification of MRI results provided evidence of increased blood-brain barrier permeability in both WT and Pink1 KO mice at 26 days after the infection in the striatum, dentate gyrus, somatosensory cortex, and thalamus. This was not accompanied by any change in global expression of tight-junction proteins or in markers of the integrity of the dopamine (DA) system in the striatum at both time points. However, chronic microglial activation was detected at day 26 post infection, accompanied by an elevation of the inflammatory mediators eotaxin, IFNgamma, CXCL9, IL-17 and MIP-2 in the striatum, accompanied by an elevation of IL-17 and CXCL1 in the serum of Pink1 KO mice. Neutrophil infiltration in the brain of infected mice was also noted at day 26 post infection, as revealed by immune cell profiling by flow cytometry. Finally, a bulk RNA-seq transcriptome analysis revealed that gene sets related to synaptic function were particularly influenced by the infection and that inflammation-related genes were upregulated by the infection in the Pink1 KO mice. Our results support the hypothesis that even after mild gastro-intestinal infection, increased BBB permeability could contribute to perturbations of brain homeostasis including altered expression of synaptic genes, increased microglial activation and the establishment of a chronic state of brain inflammation. Such perturbations could potentially act as a first hit for subsequent induction of PD pathology in the context of aging in genetically susceptible individuals.

">Attention field as a cognitive-behavioral marker for demarcating internet- but not smoking-addiction from reward</a></h4>

              
                Attentional effect (AE), attention profile (AP), and attention field (AF) have been studied extensively, however, their roles in addiction and demarcating addiction from rewards remain unclear. Using a modified Posner-paradigm with two types of pre-rewarded-cues (addiction-related and addiction-unrelated) and four groups (smoking-dependents, internet-dependents, and respective HCs), we found that both AEs and APs were independent of either cue type or group, while AFs were interactively modulated by the two. AFs of addiction-related cues were narrower than those of addiction-unrelated cues for internet-dependents, but not for either smoking-dependents or HCs; AFs of internet-dependents (not smoking-dependents) were narrower than those of HCs for addiction-related cues, but not for addiction-unrelated cues. Significantly, internet-dependents'reduced AFs can be simulated by the divisive-normalization computation, both of which closely tracked their addictive severities. Our findings identify a cognitive-behavioral marker for demarcating internet-addiction from rewarding, arguing against the notion that internet-addiction, or, more generally, non-substance-addiction, is ill-posed.

">Neural differences in conflict monitoring and stimulus expectancy processes in experienced meditators are likely driven by enhanced attention</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Mindfulness meditation has been linked to enhanced attention and executive function, likely resulting from practice-related effects on neural activity patterns. In this study, we used an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to examine brain responses related to conflict monitoring and attention in experienced mindfulness meditators to better understand key factors driving meditation-related effects. Methods: We measured electroencephalography-derived N2 and P3 ERPs reflecting conflict monitoring and attention processes from 35 meditators and 29 non-meditators across both an easy and a hard Go/Nogo task (50% Nogo and 25% Nogo stimuli, respectively). Results: Meditators displayed distinct neural activity patterns compared to non-meditators, with enhanced N2 responses in fronto-midline electrodes following hard Nogo trials (pFDR = 0.011, np2 = 0.111). The fronto-midline N2 ERP was also larger following Nogo trials than Go trials, in the harder task condition, and was related to correct responses. Meditators also exhibited a more frontally distributed P3 ERP in the easy task compared to the hard task, while non-meditators showed a more frontally distributed P3 ERP in the hard task (pFDR = 0.015, np2 = 0.079). Conclusions: Mindfulness meditation was associated with distinct topographical patterns of neural activity in the attention task, without corresponding increases in global neural activity amplitudes. These meditation-related effects appear to be driven by attention-specific mechanisms, despite the examined neural activity being associated with conflict monitoring and stimulus expectancy. Our findings suggest that the cognitive benefits of meditation may only emerge in tasks that actively engage targeted cognitive processes, such as sustained attention.

">APOE4 Increases Susceptibility to Amyloid, Accelerating Episodic Memory Decline</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with one copy of APOE4 exhibit greater amyloid-beta (A{beta}) deposition compared to noncarriers, an effect that is even more pronounced in APOE4 homozygotes. Interestingly, APOE4 carriers not only show more AD pathology but also experience more rapid cognitive decline, particularly in episodic memory. The underlying mechanisms driving this domain-specific vulnerability, however, remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether the accelerated decline in episodic memory among APOE4 carriers is due to increased A{beta} deposition or heightened susceptibility to A{beta}-related effects. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Initiative, we modeled amyloid duration, the estimated number of years an individual has been amyloid-positive, and its impact on cognitive trajectories. Our findings reveal that APOE4 is associated with more rapid episodic memory decline as a function of amyloid duration. This decline was dose-dependent, with APOE4 homozygotes declining more rapidly than heterozygotes, and it was consistently observed across multiple episodic memory tasks and measures. Importantly, this pattern was not observed in other cognitive domains, such as processing speed, executive function, visuospatial skills, language, or crystallized intelligence. These results suggest that cognitive trajectories in AD differ by APOE genotype, with APOE4 conferring increased vulnerability to hippocampal dysfunction early in the disease course. Future research should investigate whether these cognitive differences stem from distinct pathological cascades in APOE4 carriers.

                Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) leads to an extensive white matter damage associated with cognitive decline, yet the underlying damaging mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we established a positive correlation between plasma levels of serine proteinase elastase ELANE and periventricular white matter hyperintensity (PV-WMH) in a cohort of CSVD patients. In a CSVD murine model induced by bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS), upregulated ELANE was detected both in microglia and peripheral blood neutrophils. Genetic ELANE deficiency significantly alleviated oligodendrocyte loss, thereby reducing white matter lesions (WMLs) as well as ameliorating sensorimotor and cognitive impairments in BCAS mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that ELANE triggered time-dependent and dose-dependent oligodendrocyte lineage cell death. Bone marrow transplantation showed that ELANE from microglia and peripheral blood both contributed to WML development and BCAS-induced neurological deficits. Mechanistically, ELANE, accumulated by oligodendrocytes, cleaved the phosphodiesterase domain of 2,3-cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). Pharmacological inhibition of ELANE with Sivelestat reduced oligodendrocyte loss and WMLs leading to the restoration of white matter integrity and neurological improvements in BCAS mice. In post-mortem brain specimens of CSVD patients ELANE accumulated within WMLs being predominantly localized in microglia (and hence defined as microglial ELANE) rather than in the brain-infiltrating neutrophils. We therefore posit microglial ELANE as an instigator of whiter matter injury in CSVD and suggest its potential therapeutic relevance.

">The Restoration of Social Defects in Schizophrenic Mice by Plant Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a serious psychotic disorder caused by both individuals' genetic background and their living environment. However, how cognitive and negative symptoms can be treated is still a challenge since most anti-psychotic drugs are only effective for positive symptoms. Previous epidemic studies have demonstrated that plant exposure could decrease the risk of schizophrenia and shorten the length of psychiatric hospital admissions for patients. However, it is still unknown whether plant exposure could improve cognition-related defects in schizophrenia, with no related animal studies. In the present study, we first induced a schizophrenia mice model by giving mice long-term (2 weeks) injections of the antagonist of the NMDA receptor: MK801. We then raised the animals in environments containing plants (4 weeks) including Epipremnum aureum and rosemary, and tested their locomotive, anxious and social behaviors. We found that plant exposure did not change the locomotion behaviors of wild-type animals, but significantly reduced the schizophrenia-related social and anxious behaviors in the schizophrenic animals. In addition, we tested the expression of c-Fos in animals exposed to plants after social behavioral testing. We found that the deficits in c-Fos expression in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were partially rescued after plant exposure. These results indicate plant exposure will be a new tool to improve the clinical deficits of schizophrenia.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural oscillations are fundamental for brain function and govern various cognitive processes. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging advances offer the opportunity to study frequency-specific properties of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations at multiple frequency bands. However, most have focused on spontaneous brain activity in the resting state, leaving a gap in direct evidence regarding the specific activations of cognitive tasks across different frequency bands. We aim to address this gap by exploring the role of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations across multiple frequency bands in cognitive processes. We used task-functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 339 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project to map the activation patterns of performing seven cognitive tasks at multiple frequency bands (ie slow-1 to slow-6). Our findings revealed that different frequency bands are associated with distinct task-activation patterns. Specifically, slow-1/2/3 oscillations primarily contribute to local sensory information processing, while slow-4 is crucial for various fundamental cognitive functions. Slow-5 is involved in cognitive processes that require greater memory load, integrated cognitive processing, and attention maintenance. This underscores the importance of analyzing a broad frequency range to capture the full spectrum of cognitive function, highlighting the diverse roles of different frequency bands in brain activity, shedding light on the underlying mechanism of brain–behavior associations.</span>

Behaviorally, Menks et al. (2024) showed that grammaticality judgment task performance increased steadily from 8 to 15.4 yr, after which age had no further effect. We show in the current study that this age-related grammaticality judgment task performance was negatively related to cortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness in many clusters throughout the brain. Hippocampal volume was positively related to age-related grammaticality judgment task performance and L2 (English) vocabulary knowledge. Furthermore, we found that grammaticality judgment task performance, L2 grammar proficiency, and L2 vocabulary knowledge were positively related to gray matter maturation within parietal regions, overlapping with the functional MRI clusters that were reported previously in Menks et al. (2024) and which showed increased brain activation in relation to grammar learning. We propose that this overlap in functional and structural results indicates that brain maturation in parietal regions plays an important role in second language learning.</span>

We used functional magnetic resonance-based multivariate pattern analysis to identify such regions. Human participants (20 females, 12 males) watched videos of successful and failed attempts of actions with different goals involving two different object types. We found that the bilateral anterior inferior parietal lobe and the right ventral premotor cortex distinguished between object-specific action goals regardless of outcomes. The left anterior inferior parietal lobe encodes action goals regardless of both outcomes and object types. Our results provide insights into the neural basis of representing action goals and the different roles of frontoparietal and posterior temporal regions in action understanding.</span>

With voxel-wise encoding models, we probed the specificity of the compositional structure built during the production of each sentence, comparing an unstructured model of word meaning without relational information with a model that encodes abstract thematic relations and a model encoding event-specific relational structure. Whole-brain analyses revealed that sentence meaning at different levels of specificity was encoded in a large left frontal-parietal-temporal network. A comparison with semantic structures composed during the comprehension of the same sentences showed similarly distributed brain activity patterns. An ROI analysis over left fronto-temporal language parcels showed that event-specific relational structure above word-specific information was encoded in the left inferior frontal gyrus.

Generating cortical neurons in accurate numbers hinges on cell signaling orchestrated by primary cilia to coordinate the proliferation and differentiation of cortical stem cells.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Attention is a complex process involving various components such as alerting, orienting, and resolving conflicts. These components have been widely examined using the Attention Network Test (ANT), which has also been used to explore attentional decline associated with aging. However, discrepancies exist in the literature regarding which specific aspects of attention are most impacted by aging. These inconsistencies could be due to methodological issues such as group comparisons that may exaggerate differences between groups while flattening subtle variations within groups. Methods: To address this issue, we administered the ANT to 60 healthy participants aged between 62 and 90 years. Using a multivariate regression analysis, we examined whether increasing age was associated with changes in alerting, orienting, and conflict resolution, while controlling for overall performance in terms of both reaction times and accuracy. Results: The results showed a general and age-insensitive decline in two of the three attentional components: the alerting effect, which was abolished, and a large conflict effect, which was present regardless of age. In contrast, the orienting of spatial attention was found to linearly increase with increasing age. More focused analyses revealed that the ability to shift attention from the central (initial) to the peripheral (target) location slowed down as a function of age. Conclusions: These results suggest that aging is associated with a greater difficulty in disengaging endogenous attention from the central, uninformative cue to direct attention on task-relevant peripheral targets.</p>

	<p>Background: Anterior choroidal artery (AChoA) aneurysms pose a challenge for both endovascular and clipping procedures. The eloquent territory supplied by the parent vessel has limited collateralization and its compromise can lead to significant morbidity. This study aims to analyze the clinical outcomes and procedure-related complications of clipping and endovascular treatment of AChoA aneurysms to aid physician decision making. Methods: Thirty-two ruptured and unruptured AChoA aneurysms that underwent catheter angiography at a single neurovascular center between January 2000 and December 2023 were included. Either conservative management, clipping, and/or endovascular treatment were performed. Clinical outcomes and complications were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Twenty-four endovascular treatments and seven clipping procedures were included. Of the total 24 endovascular procedures, 46% were primary coiling, 25% were balloon-assisted coiling, 13% were flow diverting stent, 8% were combined balloon-assisted coiling and flow diverting stent, and 8% were combined balloon-assisted and stent-assisted coiling. There was no procedure-related mortality in both groups. No intra- or post-procedural ruptures/re-ruptures occurred during follow-up in both endovascular and clipping cohorts. AChoA territory infarcts occurred in 4% of the endovascular and 29% of the clipping cohorts. Other thromboembolic complications occurred in 4% of the endovascular cohort. The recurrence rate requiring retreatment was 12.5% for the endovascular and 43% for the clipping cohort. A favorable clinical outcome (mRS &amp;amp;le; 2) was 78% for the endovascular cohort and 67% for the clipping cohort. Conclusions: Endovascular and clipping outcomes align with prior studies, with endovascular showing a favorable safety profile. Both approaches are viable, though they present distinct risks and advantages.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This research investigates brain connectivity patterns in reaction to social and non-social stimuli within a virtual reality environment, emphasizing their impact on cognitive functions, specifically working memory. Methods: Employing the LEiDA framework with EEG data from 47 participants, I examined dynamic brain network states elicited by social avatars compared to non-social stick cues during a VR memory task. Through the integration of LEiDA with deep learning and graph theory analyses, unique connectivity patterns associated with cue type were discerned, underscoring the substantial influence of social cues on cognitive processes. LEiDA, conventionally utilized with fMRI, was creatively employed in EEG to detect swift alterations in brain network states, offering insights into cognitive processing dynamics. Results: The findings indicate distinct neural states for social and non-social cues; notably, social cues correlated with a unique brain state characterized by increased connectivity within self-referential and memory-processing networks, implying greater cognitive engagement. Moreover, deep learning attained approximately 99% accuracy in differentiating cue contexts, highlighting the efficacy of prominent eigenvectors from LEiDA in EEG analysis. Analysis of graph theory also uncovered structural network disparities, signifying enhanced integration in contexts involving social cues. Conclusions: This multi-method approach elucidates the dynamic influence of social cues on brain connectivity and cognition, establishing a basis for VR-based cognitive rehabilitation and immersive learning, wherein social signals may significantly enhance cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Background: The human sensorimotor system can naturally synchronize with environmental rhythms, such as light pulses or sound beats. Several studies showed that different styles and tempos of music, or other rhythmic stimuli, have an impact on physiological rhythms, including electrocortical brain activity, heart rate, and motor coordination. Such synchronization, also known as the &amp;amp;ldquo;entrainment effect&amp;amp;rdquo;, has been identified as a crucial mechanism impacting cognitive, motor, and affective functioning. Objectives: This review examines theoretical and empirical contributions to the literature on entrainment, with a particular focus on the physiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its role in cognitive, motor, and affective functions. We also address the inconsistent terminology used in the literature and evaluate the range of measurement approaches used to assess entrainment phenomena. Finally, we propose a definition of &amp;amp;ldquo;physiological entrainment&amp;amp;rdquo; that emphasizes its role as a fundamental mechanism that encompasses rhythmic interactions between the body and its environment, to support information processing across bodily systems and to sustain adaptive motor responses. Methods: We reviewed the recent literature through the lens of the &amp;amp;ldquo;embodied cognition&amp;amp;rdquo; framework, offering a unified perspective on the phenomenon of physiological entrainment. Results: Evidence from the current literature suggests that physiological entrainment produces measurable effects, especially on neural oscillations, heart rate variability, and motor synchronization. Eventually, such physiological changes can impact cognitive processing, affective functioning, and motor coordination. Conclusions: Physiological entrainment emerges as a fundamental mechanism underlying the mind&amp;amp;ndash;body connection. Entrainment-based interventions may be used to promote well-being by enhancing cognitive, motor, and affective functions, suggesting potential rehabilitative approaches to enhancing mental health.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive functions are a crucial part of daily living, especially for adults with Down syndrome (DS) who have a high likelihood of developing Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease in adulthood. In addition, adults with DS move slower and are not meeting the standard aerobic activity guidelines each week. The aim of this study was to examine if Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) would improve cognitive planning as measured by the Tower of London (TOL), set switching as measured by the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and spatial memory as measured by the Corsi Block Test in adults with DS as compared to self-paced cycling. Methods: Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of two interventions over eight weeks. (1) Thirteen older adults with DS completed the ACT intervention, which is stationary cycling with the assistance of a motor to maintain a cadence at least 35% greater than voluntary cycling. (2) Eleven older adults with DS completed voluntary cycling (VC). Results: Our results showed that cognitive planning as measured by total correct score in the TOL showed improvement for both ACT and VC after 8 weeks of exercise, F(1, 22) = 6.22, p = 0.021. There were no significant differences for spatial memory or set switching. Conclusions: We concluded that cycling exercise has a positive impact on cognitive function, especially problem solving in older adults with DS. Our results are discussed with respect to upregulation of neurotrophic factors that increase functioning in the prefrontal cortex that accompanies exercise and leads to improvements in cognitive planning which is essential to many activities of daily living and quality of life for older adults with DS.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The auditory middle-latency responses (AMLRs) assess central sensory processing beyond the brainstem and serve as a measure of sensory gating. They have clinical relevance in the diagnosis of neurological conditions. In this study, magnitude and habituation of the AMLRs were tested for sensitivity and specificity in classifying dizzy patients with vestibular migraine (VM) and post-concussive syndrome. Methods: Twenty-three healthy individuals, 12 concussion and 26 VM patients were recruited. AMLR were recorded performing five blocks of 200 binaural click-stimulations at 60 dB sensation level with a repetition rate of 6.1 Hz. Reduction in P0, Na and Pa magnitudes between blocks was measured. Group classifications were performed through logistic and multiple regression. Results: Among healthy subjects, a consistent P0 and Na habituation can be observed. Concussed subjects show control-like Na habituation, despite a lower magnitude, while P0 habituation was negligible. VM patients showed poor habituation for all waves. Regression analyses suggest that P0 and Na better distinguish healthy subjects from neurological patients, whereas Pa best distinguishes concussion from VM patients. Conclusions: The results support that AMLR habituation can contribute to unraveling different mechanisms of dizziness due to concussion compared to VM, providing insights that can complement routine diagnostic assessments.</p>

                Background The approach to estimating mandibular age has been widely used, although it has shown age estimation disparities in diverse populations, including Indians. Objective Our goal was to test the Demirjian 8-teeth approach utilizing orthopantomogram to estimate age reliably after incorporating the third molar. We also used Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations to estimate age estimation accuracy in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods The retrospective study included 196 people. Individuals were 8–24 years old. The left mandibular teeth were staged using an orthopantomographs utilizing the Demirjian 8-teeth approach. The Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression models determined dental age, and statistical methods compared dental age to chronological age. Results The gender breakdown was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. Gender did not significantly affect chronological mean age or estimated mean age (13.39±3.77 vs. 13.10±3.51, p = 0.583; 11.75±2.92 vs. 11.58±2.70, p = 0.674). Statistically substantial differences in chronological and estimated mean ages between male and female individuals (p<0.001). Out of the total participants, 31.6% had a difference in age of ±1 year, 30.6% had a difference of 1-2 years, and 37.8% had a difference of more than 2 years. Compared to chronological and estimated ages, these variations in age between males and females were not statistically significant (p=0.557). Conclusions The findings of this study support the use of Demirjian’s 8-teeth approach in the Saudi population residing in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, employing Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations.

                Abstract Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods A comprehensive scoping review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies from 2017 to 2024. Primary, English-language clinical trial involving pediatric patients were included without restrictions on surgical procedure, or outcomes. Data extraction was focused on sample sizes, PCL types, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 11 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies indicated metabolic benefits, with 7 out of 11 showing stabilized blood glucose and reduced hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, 5 studies associated PCL with reduced preoperative anxiety, agitation, and discomfort, including thirst and hunger. For stomach content, 5 studies showed PCL reduced gastric residual volume and improved pH. Postoperative findings were mixed: 4 studies found no significant difference in nausea and vomiting, while 2 suggested benefits. Length of hospital stay from 3 studies showed no clinical difference results. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery shows potential to stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and improve recovery. However, the evidence regarding outcomes such as length of hospital stay and postoperative complications remains inconsistent, indicating the need for further investigation.

                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                Background This study applied geographical standards (coverage distance) and demographic standards to investigate the capabilities of primary healthcare facilities to cover the largest area of the study area and the service area that can be accessed. This study was conducted to find out the sufficient number of primary healthcare (PHC) centers required to provide healthcare services to the entire community. Methods Data was obtained by applying geographic information system (GIS) techniques to analyze primary care facilities using the demographic and geographic standards for primary care facilities. Results PHC centers cover 79% of the study area according to the geographical standard. The study area needs 41 additional centers to cover the shortfall in service provision per the demographic and geographic standards. Conclusions A significant deficiency in the number of primary care centers found in the study area compared to the large population at the geographical and demographic standards level.

                <p>by Hyeontae Jo, Sung Woong Cho, Hyung Ju Hwang</p>

Differential equations are pivotal in modeling and understanding the dynamics of various systems, as they offer insights into their future states through parameter estimation fitted to time series data. In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). RCS data showed that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of RCS data over time, Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, and Bayesian-based methods, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method called Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD) that provides accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimizes the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, thereby demonstrating the ability of the proposed method in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions over a normal distribution. These results address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data. Therefore, EPD marks a significant advancement in accurately modeling systems with RCS data, realizing a deeper understanding of system dynamics and parameter variability.

Monitoring the spread of infectious disease is essential to design and adjust the interventions timely for the prevention of the epidemic outbreak and safeguarding the public health. The governments have generally adopted the incidence-based statistical method to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> and evaluate the transmission ability of epidemics. However, this method exhibits biases arising from the reported incidence data and assumes the generation interval distribution which is not available at the early stage of epidemic. Recent studies showed that the viral loads characterized by cycle threshold (Ct) of the infected populations evolving throughout the course of epidemic and providing a possibility to infer the epidemic trajectory. In this work, we propose the Cycle Threshold-based Transformer (Ct-Transformer) to estimate <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>. We find the supervised learning of Ct-Transformer outperforms the traditional incidence-based statistic and Ct-based <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> estimating methods, and more importantly Ct-Transformer is robustness to the detection resources. Further, we apply the proposed model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and obtain excellent fine-tuning performance, which attains comparable performance with the supervised Ct-Transformer, verified by both the synthetic and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that the Ct-based deep learning method can improve the real-time estimates of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, enabling more easily adapted to the track of the newly emerged epidemic.

The brain’s complex distributed dynamics are typically quantified using a limited set of manually selected statistical properties, leaving the possibility that alternative dynamical properties may outperform those reported for a given application. Here, we address this limitation by systematically comparing diverse, interpretable features of both intra-regional activity and inter-regional functional coupling from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, demonstrating our method using case–control comparisons of four neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings generally support the use of linear time-series analysis techniques for rs-fMRI case–control analyses, while also identifying new ways to quantify informative dynamical fMRI structures. While simple statistical representations of fMRI dynamics performed surprisingly well (e.g., properties within a single brain region), combining intra-regional properties with inter-regional coupling generally improved performance, underscoring the distributed, multifaceted changes to fMRI dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive, data-driven method introduced here enables systematic identification and interpretation of quantitative dynamical signatures of multivariate time-series data, with applicability beyond neuroimaging to diverse scientific problems involving complex time-varying systems.

Accurate estimates of the incidence of infectious diseases are key for the control of epidemics. However, healthcare systems are often unable to test the population exhaustively, especially when asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases are widespread; this leads to significant and systematic under-reporting of the real incidence. Here, we propose a machine learning approach to estimate the incidence of a pandemic in real-time, using reported cases and the overall test rate. In particular, we use Bayesian symbolic regression to automatically learn the closed-form mathematical models that most parsimoniously describe incidence. We develop and validate our models using COVID-19 incidence values for nine different countries, confirming their ability to accurately predict daily incidence. Remarkably, despite the differences in epidemic trajectories and dynamics across countries, we find that a single model for all countries offers a more parsimonious description and is more predictive of actual incidence compared to separate models for each country. Our results show the potential to accurately model incidence in real-time using closed-form mathematical models, providing a valuable tool for public health decision-makers.

                <p>by Juliana Chase, Liyu Xia, Lung-Hao Tai, Wan Chen Lin, Anne G. E. Collins, Linda Wilbrecht</p>

Computational modeling has revealed that human research participants use both rapid working memory (WM) and incremental reinforcement learning (RL) (RL+WM) to solve a simple instrumental learning task, relying on WM when the number of stimuli is small and supplementing with RL when the number of stimuli exceeds WM capacity. Inspired by this work, we examined which learning systems and strategies are used by adolescent and adult mice when they first acquire a conditional associative learning task. In a version of the human RL+WM task translated for rodents, mice were required to associate odor stimuli (from a set of 2 or 4 odors) with a left or right port to receive reward. Using logistic regression and computational models to analyze the first 200 trials per odor, we determined that mice used both incremental RL and stimulus-insensitive, one-back strategies to solve the task. While these one-back strategies may be a simple form of short-term or working memory, they did not approximate the boost to learning performance that has been observed in human participants using WM in a comparable task. Adolescent and adult mice also showed comparable performance, with no change in learning rate or softmax beta parameters with adolescent development and task experience. However, reliance on a one-back perseverative, win-stay strategy increased with development in males in both odor set sizes, but was not dependent on gonadal hormones. Our findings advance a simple conditional associative learning task and new models to enable the isolation and quantification of reinforcement learning alongside other strategies mice use while learning to associate stimuli with rewards within a single behavioral session. These data and methods can inform and aid comparative study of reinforcement learning across species.

                <p>by Armaan A. Abraham, Zhixin Cyrillus Tan, Priyanka Shrestha, Emily R. Bozich, Aaron S. Meyer</p>

Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody Fc species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties and then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which Fc properties can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data.

                <p>by Sarah E. Baum, Daniele M. Pelissari, Fernanda Dockhorn Costa, Luiza O. Harada, Mauro Sanchez, Patricia Bartholomay, Ted Cohen, Marcia C. Castro, Nicolas A. Menzies</p>

Effectively responding to drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) requires accurate and timely information on resistance levels and trends. In contexts where use of drug susceptibility testing has not been universal (i.e. not all patients are offered testing), surveillance for rifampicin-resistance—one of the core drugs in the TB treatment regimen—has relied on resource-intensive and infrequent nationally-representative prevalence surveys. The expanded availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) over the past decade has increased testing coverage in many settings. However, RDT data collected in the course of routine (but not universal) use may provide biased estimates of resistance if the subset of patients receiving RDTs is not representative of the overall cohort. Here, we developed a method that attempts to correct for non-random use of RDT testing in the context of routine TB diagnosis to recover unbiased estimates of resistance among new and previously treated TB cases. Specifically, we employed statistical corrections to model rifampicin resistance among TB notifications with observed Xpert MTB/RIF (a WHO-recommended RDT) results using a hierarchical generalized additive regression model, and then used model output to impute results for untested individuals. We applied this model to 2017–2023 case-level data on over 800,000 patients from Brazil. Modeled estimates of the prevalence of rifampicin resistance were substantially higher than naïve estimates, with estimated prevalence ranging between 28–44% higher for new cases and 2–17% higher for previously treated cases. Our estimates of RR-TB incidence were estimated with narrower uncertainty intervals relative to WHO estimates for the same time period, and were robust to alternative model specifications. Our approach provides a generalizable method to leverage routine RDT data to derive timely estimates of RR-TB prevalence among notified TB cases in settings where testing for TB drug resistance is not universal.

                <p>by Jiyoung Kang, Hae-Jeong Park</p>

Integrating multiscale, multimodal neuroimaging data is essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural circuits. However, this is challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between spatial coverage and resolution in each modality, necessitating a computational strategy that combines modality-specific information effectively. This study introduces a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) framework designed to address the challenge of combining partially observed, multiscale signals across a larger-scale neural circuit by employing a shared neural state model with modality-specific observation models. The proposed method achieves robust circuit inference by iteratively integrating parameter estimates from local microscale and global meso- or macroscale circuits, derived from signals across various scales and modalities. Parameters estimated from high-resolution data within specific regions inform global circuit estimation by constraining neural properties in unobserved regions, while large-scale circuit data help elucidate detailed local circuitry. Using a virtual ground truth system, we validated the method across diverse experimental settings, combining calcium imaging (CaI), voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI), and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals—each with distinct coverage and resolution. Our reciprocal and iterative parameter estimation approach markedly improves the accuracy of neural property and connectivity estimates compared to traditional one-step estimation methods. This iterative integration of local and global parameters presents a reliable approach to inferring extensive, complex neural circuits from partially observed, multimodal, and multiscale data, showcasing how information from different scales reciprocally enhances entire circuit parameter estimation.

                <p>by Kenneth Y. Wertheim, Robert Chisholm, Paul Richmond, Dawn Walker</p>

Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumour in children. Over half of all high-risk cases are expected to succumb to the disease even after chemotherapy, surgery, and immunotherapy. Although the importance of <i>MYCN</i> amplification in this disease is indisputable, the mechanistic details remain enigmatic. Here, we present a multicellular model of neuroblastoma comprising a continuous automaton, discrete cell agents, and a centre-based mechanical model, as well as the simulation results we obtained with it. The continuous automaton represents the tumour microenvironment as a grid-like structure, where each voxel is associated with continuous variables such as the oxygen level therein. Each discrete cell agent is defined by several attributes, including its cell cycle position, mutations, gene expression pattern, and more with behaviours such as cell cycling and cell death being stochastically dependent on these attributes. The centre-based mechanical model represents the properties of these agents as physical objects, describing how they repel each other as soft spheres. By implementing a stochastic simulation algorithm on modern GPUs, we simulated the dynamics of over one million neuroblastoma cells over a period of months. Specifically, we set up 1200 heterogeneous tumours and tracked the <i>MYCN</i>-amplified clone’s dynamics in each, revealed the conditions that favour its growth, and tested its responses to 5000 drug combinations. Our results are in agreement with those reported in the literature and add new insights into how the <i>MYCN</i>-amplified clone’s reproductive advantage in a tumour, its gene expression profile, the tumour’s other clones (with different mutations), and the tumour’s microenvironment are inter-related. Based on the results, we formulated a hypothesis, which argues that there are two distinct populations of neuroblastoma cells in the tumour; the p53 protein is pro-survival in one and pro-apoptosis in the other. It follows that alternating between inhibiting MDM2 to restore p53 activity and inhibiting ARF to attenuate p53 activity is a promising, if unorthodox, therapeutic strategy. The multicellular model has the advantages of modularity, high resolution, and scalability, making it a potential foundation for creating digital twins of neuroblastoma patients.

The baroreflex is one of the most important control mechanisms in the human cardiovascular system. This work utilises a closed-loop in silico model of baroreflex regulation, coupled to pulsatile mechanical models with (i) one heart chamber and 36-parameters and (ii) four chambers and 51 parameters. We perform the first global sensitivity analysis of these closed-loop systems which considers <i>both</i> cardiovascular and baroreflex parameters, and compare the models with their respective unregulated equivalents. Results show the reduced influence of regulated parameters compared to unregulated equivalents and that, in the physiological resting state, model outputs (pressures, heart rate, cardiac output etc.) are most sensitive to parasympathetic arc parameters. This work provides insight into the effects of regulation and model input parameter influence on clinical metrics, and constitutes a first step to understanding the role of regulation in models for personalised healthcare.

The development of a safe and efficacious vaccine that provides immunity against all four dengue virus serotypes is a priority, and a significant challenge for vaccine development has been defining and measuring serotype-specific outcomes and correlates of protection. The plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) is the gold standard assay for measuring serotype-specific antibodies, but this test cannot differentiate homotypic and heterotypic antibodies and characterising the infection history is challenging. To address this, we present an analysis of pre- and post-infection antibody titres measured using the PRNT, collected from a prospective cohort of Thai children. We applied four machine learning classifiers and multinomial logistic regression to the titre data to predict the infecting serotype. The models were validated against the true infecting serotype, identified using RT-PCR. Model performance was calculated using 100 bootstrap samples of the train and out-of-sample test sets. Our analysis showed that, on average, the greatest change in titre was against the infecting serotype. However, in 53.4% (109/204) of the subjects, the highest titre change did not correspond to the infecting serotype, including in 34.3% (11/35) of dengue-naïve individuals (although 8/11 of these seronegative individuals were seropositive to Japanese encephalitis virus prior to their infection). The highest post-infection titres of seropositive cases were more likely to match the serotype of the highest pre-infection titre than the infecting serotype, consistent with antigenic seniority or cross-reactive boosting of pre-infection titres. Despite these challenges, the best performing machine learning algorithm achieved 76.3% (95% CI 57.9–89.5%) accuracy on the out-of-sample test set in predicting the infecting serotype from PRNT data. Incorporating additional spatiotemporal data improved accuracy to 80.6% (95% CI 63.2–94.7%), while using only post-infection titres as predictor variables yielded an accuracy of 71.7% (95% CI 57.9–84.2%). These results show that machine learning classifiers can be used to overcome challenges in interpreting PRNT titres, making them useful tools in investigating dengue immune dynamics, infection history and identifying serotype-specific correlates of protection, which in turn can support the evaluation of clinical trial endpoints and vaccine development.

                <p>by Máté Mohácsi, Márk Patrik Török, Sára Sáray, Luca Tar, Gábor Farkas, Szabolcs Káli</p>

Finding optimal parameters for detailed neuronal models is a ubiquitous challenge in neuroscientific research. In recent years, manual model tuning has been gradually replaced by automated parameter search using a variety of different tools and methods. However, using most of these software tools and choosing the most appropriate algorithm for a given optimization task require substantial technical expertise, which prevents the majority of researchers from using these methods effectively. To address these issues, we developed a generic platform (called Neuroptimus) that allows users to set up neural parameter optimization tasks via a graphical interface, and to solve these tasks using a wide selection of state-of-the-art parameter search methods implemented by five different Python packages. Neuroptimus also offers several features to support more advanced usage, including the ability to run most algorithms in parallel, which allows it to take advantage of high-performance computing architectures. We used the common interface provided by Neuroptimus to conduct a detailed comparison of more than twenty different algorithms (and implementations) on six distinct benchmarks that represent typical scenarios in neuronal parameter search. We quantified the performance of the algorithms in terms of the best solutions found and in terms of convergence speed. We identified several algorithms, including covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization, that consistently, without any fine-tuning, found good solutions in all of our use cases. By contrast, some other algorithms including all local search methods provided good solutions only for the simplest use cases, and failed completely on more complex problems. We also demonstrate the versatility of Neuroptimus by applying it to an additional use case that involves tuning the parameters of a subcellular model of biochemical pathways. Finally, we created an online database that allows uploading, querying and analyzing the results of optimization runs performed by Neuroptimus, which enables all researchers to update and extend the current benchmarking study. The tools and analysis we provide should aid members of the neuroscience community to apply parameter search methods more effectively in their research.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite treatments which reduce relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS), many patients continue to experience progressive disability accumulation. MS is associated with metabolic disruptions and cerebral metabolic stress predisposes to tissue injury and possibly impaired remyelination. Additionally, myelin homeostasis is metabolically expensive and reliant on glycolysis. We investigated cerebral metabolic changes in MS and when in the disease course they occurred, and assessed their relationship with microstructural changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study used combined fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and oxygen, thereby quantifying glycolysis. Twelve healthy controls, 20 patients with relapsing MS, and 13 patients with non-relapsing MS were studied. Relapsing patients with MS were treatment naïve and scanned pre- and post-initiation of high efficacy disease modifying therapy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In normal appearing white matter, we observed increased glucose utilization and reduced oxygen utilization in newly diagnosed MS, consistent with increased glycolysis. Increased glycolysis was greater in patients with a longer disease duration course and higher disability. Among newly diagnosed patients, different treatments had differential impacts on glucose utilization. Last, whereas hypermetabolism within lesions was clearly associated with inflammation, no such relationship was found within normal appearing white matter.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Increased white matter glycolysis is a prominent feature of cerebral metabolism in MS. It begins early in the disease course, increases with disease duration and is independent of microstructural evidence of inflammation in normal appearing white matter. Optimization of the metabolic environment may be an important component of therapies designed to reduce progressive disability. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder traditionally characterized by the selective loss of medium spiny neurons in the basal ganglia. However, it has become apparent that white matter injury and oligodendrocyte dysfunction precede the degeneration of medium spiny neurons, garnering interest as a key pathogenic mechanism of HD. Oligodendrocytes are glial cells found within the central nervous system involved in the production of myelin and the myelination of axons. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath that wraps around axons, facilitating signal conduction and neuronal viability. The degeneration of myelin hinders effective communication and leaves neurons vulnerable to external damage and subsequent degeneration. Abnormalities in oligodendrocyte maturation have been established in the HD human brain, however, investigations into the underlying dysfunction of human oligodendrocytes in HD are limited. This review will detail the involvement of oligodendrocytes and white matter damage in HD. Recent developments in modeling human-specific oligodendrocyte pathology in HD will be discussed, with a particular focus on emerging somatic cell reprogramming approaches.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is traditionally considered a region dedicated to long-term memory, recent neuroimaging and intracranial recording evidence suggests that the MTL also contributes to certain aspects of visual short-term memory (VSTM), such as the quality or precision of retained VSTM content. This study aims to further investigate the MTL's role in VSTM precision through the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants underwent 1.5 mA offline tDCS over bilateral temporal lobes using left cathodal and right anodal electrodes, administered for either 20 min (active) or 0.5 min within a 20-min window (sham), in a counterbalanced design. As the electrical current passes through midbrain structures with this bilateral stimulation montage, prior behavioral and modeling evidence suggests that this tDCS protocol can modulate MTL functions. To confirm this and examine its impacts on VSTM, participants completed a VSTM color recall task immediately following tDCS, while undergoing a 20-min fMRI scan and a subsequent 7.5-min resting-state scan, during which they focused on a fixation cross. Behavioral results indicated that this tDCS protocol decreased VSTM precision without significantly affecting overall recall success. Furthermore, psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that tDCS over the temporal lobe modulated hippocampal-occipital functional connectivity during the VSTM task, despite no main effect on fMRI BOLD activity. Notably, this modulation was also observed during resting-state fMRI 15–20 min post-tDCS, with the magnitude of the effect correlating with participants' behavioral changes in VSTM precision across active and control conditions. Combined, these findings suggest that tDCS over the temporal lobe can modulate the intrinsic functional connectivity between the MTL and visual sensory areas, thereby affecting VSTM precision.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that inherited astrocyte dysfunction can be a primary trigger for epilepsy development; however, the available data are rather limited. In addition, astrocytes are considered as a perspective target for the design of novel and improvement of the existing antiepileptic therapy. Piracetam and related nootropic drugs are widely used in the therapy of various epileptic disorders, but detailed mechanisms of racetams action and, in particular, their effects on glial functions are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the functional state of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Krushinsky–Molodkina (KM) rats genetically prone to audiogenic seizures and compared the action of piracetam on the DG astrocytes in KM and normal Wistar rats. Wistar and naïve KM rats which received injections of saline (control) or piracetam (100 mg/kg) for 21 days were recruited in our studies. Comparative analysis of control Wistar and KM rats revealed genetically determined abnormalities in DG astrocytes of KM rats including an increased expression of NFIA but a decreased GFAP, ALDH1L1, EAATs, and glutamine synthetase (GS). Piracetam treatment normalized the expression of all studied markers, except NFIA, in KM rats, while in Wistar rats, it potentiated only GS and NFIA. The results suggested that the nootropic and antiepileptic effects of piracetam may be, at least partially, mediated by the modulation of astroglia functions. In addition, analysis of NFIA and GS colocalization revealed the novel pattern of astrocyte heterogeneity in the DG which was significantly altered in epileptic rats but corrected by piracetam.</p>

                The authors identified an open-prone PIEZO1-S2472E mutant and captured its partially flattened and intermediate open state. Combining structural analyses, MD simulations, and electrophysiological characterizations, they have revealed distinct structural features that define the closed, intermediate open, and inactivated states, providing novel insights into the gating mechanism of PIEZO channels.

                Chapman et al. generate a brain-wide atlas of supraspinal inputs to cervical V1 interneurons. Monosynaptic input arises from over two dozen brain regions, some of which preferentially innervate molecularly distinct V1 subsets. These results provide an anatomical foundation for understanding how the brain communicates with spinal interneurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94884">A novel human pluripotent stem cell gene activation system identifies IGFBP2 as a mediator in the production of haematopoietic progenitors in vitro</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge in the stem cell biology field is the ability to produce fully functional cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that are a valuable resource for cell therapy, drug screening, and disease modelling. Here, we developed a novel inducible CRISPR-mediated activation strategy (iCRISPRa) to drive the expression of multiple endogenous transcription factors (TFs) important for in vitro cell fate and differentiation of iPSCs to haematopoietic progenitor cells. This work has identified a key role for IGFBP2 in developing haematopoietic progenitors. We first identified nine candidate TFs that we predicted to be involved in blood cell emergence during development, then generated tagged gRNAs directed to the transcriptional start site of these TFs that could also be detected during single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). iCRISPRa activation of these endogenous TFs resulted in a significant expansion of arterial-fated endothelial cells expressing high levels of IGFBP2, and our analysis indicated that IGFBP2 is involved in the remodelling of metabolic activity during in vitro endothelial to haematopoietic transition. As well as providing fundamental new insights into the mechanisms of haematopoietic differentiation, the broader applicability of iCRISPRa provides a valuable tool for studying dynamic processes in development and for recapitulating abnormal phenotypes characterised by ectopic activation of specific endogenous gene expression in a wide range of systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93002">Clinical phenotypes in acute and chronic infarction explained through human ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulations</a></h4>

              
                Sudden death after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with electrophysiological heterogeneities and ionic current remodelling. Low ejection fraction (EF) is used in risk stratification, but its mechanistic links with pro-arrhythmic heterogeneities are unknown. We aim to provide mechanistic explanations of clinical phenotypes in acute and chronic MI, from ionic current remodelling to ECG and EF, using human electromechanical modelling and simulation to augment experimental and clinical investigations. A human ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulation framework is constructed and validated with rich experimental and clinical datasets, incorporating varying degrees of ionic current remodelling as reported in literature. In acute MI, T-wave inversion and Brugada phenocopy were explained by conduction abnormality and local action potential prolongation in the border zone. In chronic MI, upright tall T-waves highlight large repolarisation dispersion between the border and remote zones, which promoted ectopic propagation at fast pacing. Post-MI EF at resting heart rate was not sensitive to the extent of repolarisation heterogeneity and the risk of repolarisation abnormalities at fast pacing. T-wave and QT abnormalities are better indicators of repolarisation heterogeneities than EF in post-MI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97465">Genome concentration limits cell growth and modulates proteome composition in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Defining the cellular factors that drive growth rate and proteome composition is essential for understanding and manipulating cellular systems. In bacteria, ribosome concentration is known to be a constraining factor of cell growth rate, while gene concentration is usually assumed not to be limiting. Here, using single-molecule tracking, quantitative single-cell microscopy, and modeling, we show that genome dilution in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells arrested for DNA replication limits total RNA polymerase activity within physiological cell sizes across tested nutrient conditions. This rapid-onset limitation on bulk transcription results in sub-linear scaling of total active ribosomes with cell size and sub-exponential growth. Such downstream effects on bulk translation and cell growth are near-immediately detectable in a nutrient-rich medium, but delayed in nutrient-poor conditions, presumably due to cellular buffering activities. RNA sequencing and tandem-mass-tag mass spectrometry experiments further reveal that genome dilution remodels the relative abundance of mRNAs and proteins with cell size at a global level. Altogether, our findings indicate that chromosome concentration is a limiting factor of transcription and a global modulator of the transcriptome and proteome composition in <i>E. coli</i>. Experiments in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> and comparison with eukaryotic cell studies identify broadly conserved DNA concentration-dependent scaling principles of gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100260">The emergence of visual category representations in infants’ brains</a></h4>

              
                Organizing the continuous stream of visual input into categories like places or faces is important for everyday function and social interactions. However, it is unknown when neural representations of these and other visual categories emerge. Here, we used steady-state evoked potential electroencephalography to measure cortical responses in infants at 3–4 months, 4–6 months, 6–8 months, and 12–15 months, when they viewed controlled, gray-level images of faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars. We found that distinct responses to these categories emerge at different ages. Reliable brain responses to faces emerge first, at 4–6 months, followed by limbs and places around 6–8 months. Between 6 and 15 months response patterns become more distinct, such that a classifier can decode what an infant is looking at from their brain responses. These findings have important implications for assessing typical and atypical cortical development as they not only suggest that category representations are learned, but also that representations of categories that may have innate substrates emerge at different times during infancy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98441">Virus adaptation to heparan sulfate comes with capsid stability tradeoff</a></h4>

              
                Because of high mutation rates, viruses constantly adapt to new environments. When propagated in cell lines, certain viruses acquire positively charged amino acids on their surface proteins, enabling them to utilize negatively charged heparan sulfate (HS) as an attachment receptor. In this study, we used enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) as model and demonstrated that unlike the parental MP4 variant, the cell-adapted strong HS-binder MP4-97R/167G does not require acidification for uncoating and releases its genome in the neutral or weakly acidic environment of early endosomes. We experimentally confirmed that this pH-independent entry is not associated with the use of HS as an attachment receptor but rather with compromised capsid stability. We then extended these findings to another HS-dependent strain. In summary, our data indicate that acquisition of capsid mutations conferring affinity for HS come together with decreased capsid stability and allow EV-A71 to enter the cell via a pH-independent pathway. This pH-independent entry mechanism boosts viral replication in cell lines but may prove deleterious <i>in vivo</i>, especially for enteric viruses crossing the acidic gastric environment before reaching their primary replication site, the intestine. Our study thus provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying the <i>in vivo</i> attenuation of HS-binding EV-A71 strains. Not only are these viruses hindered in tissues rich in HS due to viral trapping, as generally accepted, but our research reveals that their diminished capsid stability further contributes to attenuation <i>in vivo</i>. This underscores the complex relationship between HS-binding, capsid stability, and viral fitness, where increased replication in cell lines coincides with attenuation in harsh in vivo environments like the gastrointestinal tract.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98900">Long non-coding RNA Malat1 fine-tunes bone homeostasis and repair by orchestrating cellular crosstalk and β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway</a></h4>

              
                The IncRNA <i>Malat1</i> was initially believed to be dispensable for physiology due to the lack of observable phenotypes in <i>Malat1</i> knockout (KO) mice. However, our study challenges this conclusion. We found that both <i>Malat1</i> KO and conditional KO mice in the osteoblast lineage exhibit significant osteoporosis. Mechanistically, <i>Malat1</i> acts as an intrinsic regulator in osteoblasts to promote osteogenesis. Interestingly, <i>Malat1</i> does not directly affect osteoclastogenesis but inhibits osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous manner in vivo via integrating crosstalk between multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes. Our findings substantiate the existence of a novel remodeling network in which <i>Malat1</i> serves as a central regulator by binding to β-catenin and functioning through the β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway in osteoblasts and chondrocytes. In pathological conditions, <i>Malat1</i> significantly promotes bone regeneration in fracture healing. Bone homeostasis and regeneration are crucial to well-being. Our discoveries establish a previous unrecognized paradigm model of <i>Malat1</i> function in the skeletal system, providing novel mechanistic insights into how a lncRNA integrates cellular crosstalk and molecular networks to fine tune tissue homeostasis, remodeling and repair.

                Speech production and perception involve complex neural dynamics in the human brain. Using magnetoencephalography, our study explores the interaction between cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connectivities during these processes. Our connectivity findings during speaking revealed a significant connection from the right cerebellum to the left temporal areas in low frequencies, which displayed an opposite trend in high frequencies. Notably, high-frequency connectivity was absent during the listening condition. These findings underscore the vital roles of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connections within the speech production and perception network. The results of our new study enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics of brain connectivity during speech processes, emphasizing the distinct frequency-based interactions between various brain regions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100086">The evolutionary modifications of a GoLoco motif in the AGS protein facilitate micromere formation in the sea urchin embryo</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary introduction of asymmetric cell division (ACD) into the developmental program facilitates the formation of a new cell type, contributing to developmental diversity and, eventually, species diversification. The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: an ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, activator of G-protein signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans. This raises the question of what evolutionary modifications of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms’ AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86194">Impairment of lipid homeostasis causes lysosomal accumulation of endogenous protein aggregates through ESCRT disruption</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregation increases during aging and is a pathological hallmark of many age-related diseases. Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) depends on a core network of factors directly influencing protein production, folding, trafficking, and degradation. Cellular proteostasis also depends on the overall composition of the proteome and numerous environmental variables. Modulating this cellular proteostasis state can influence the stability of multiple endogenous proteins, yet the factors contributing to this state remain incompletely characterized. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi screens to elucidate the modulators of proteostasis state in mammalian cells, using a fluorescent dye to monitor endogenous protein aggregation. These screens identified known components of the proteostasis network and uncovered a novel link between protein and lipid homeostasis. Increasing lipid uptake and/or disrupting lipid metabolism promotes the accumulation of sphingomyelins and cholesterol esters and drives the formation of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates at the lysosome. Proteome profiling of lysosomes revealed ESCRT accumulation, suggesting disruption of ESCRT disassembly, lysosomal membrane repair, and microautophagy. Lipid dysregulation leads to lysosomal membrane permeabilization but does not otherwise impact fundamental aspects of lysosomal and proteasomal functions. Together, these results demonstrate that lipid dysregulation disrupts ESCRT function and impairs proteostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92004">Basement membranes are crucial for proper olfactory placode shape, position and boundary with the brain, and for olfactory axon development</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent progress, the complex roles played by the extracellular matrix in development and disease are still far from being fully understood. Here, we took advantage of the zebrafish <i>sly</i> mutation which affects Laminin γ1, a major component of basement membranes, to explore its role in the development of the olfactory system. Following a detailed characterisation of Laminin distribution in the developing olfactory circuit, we analysed basement membrane integrity, olfactory placode and brain morphogenesis, and olfactory axon development in <i>sly</i> mutants, using a combination of immunochemistry, electron microscopy and quantitative live imaging of cell movements and axon behaviours. Our results point to an original and dual contribution of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in organising the border between the olfactory placode and the adjacent brain: they maintain placode shape and position in the face of major brain morphogenetic movements, they establish a robust physical barrier between the two tissues while at the same time allowing the local entry of the sensory axons into the brain and their navigation towards the olfactory bulb. This work thus identifies key roles of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in neuronal tissue morphogenesis and axon development in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97180">Base editing of Ptbp1 in neurons alleviates symptoms in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease caused by irreversible progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Recent studies have reported the successful conversion of astrocytes into DANs by repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which led to the rescue of motor symptoms in a chemically-induced mouse model of PD. However, follow-up studies have questioned the validity of this astrocyte-to-DAN conversion model. Here, we devised an adenine base editing strategy to downregulate PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons in a chemically-induced PD mouse model. While PTBP1 downregulation in astrocytes had no effect, PTBP1 downregulation in neurons of the striatum resulted in the expression of the DAN marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in non-dividing neurons, which was associated with an increase in striatal dopamine concentrations and a rescue of forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations. Phenotypic analysis using multiplexed iterative immunofluorescence imaging further revealed that most of these TH-positive cells co-expressed the dopaminergic marker DAT and the pan-neuronal marker NEUN, with the majority of these triple-positive cells being classified as mature GABAergic neurons. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of the observed markers and understand how the formation of these cells contributes to the rescue of spontaneous motor behaviors. Nevertheless, our findings support a model where downregulation of neuronal, but not astrocytic, PTBP1 can mitigate symptoms in PD mice.

">Spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG microstate networks over the first two years of life: A multi-cohort longitudinal study</a></h4>

              
                The first two years of life are marked by rapid development of large-scale brain networks that support emerging cognition and behavior. Magnetic-resonance approaches have revealed much about largescale networks in sleep, but very little is known about functional network dynamics in awake, behaving infants during this period of substantial development. Microstates are brief instances of distinct spatial topographies of largescale neural activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG) that offer a novel approach to studying whole-brain network dynamics at sub-second scale in awake infants by capturing their temporally coherent brain activity. While emerging literature is leveraging microstate dynamics in adults to understand mature largescale network function, developmental trajectories during networks rapid construction in infancy remain uncharacterized. In this study, we leveraged longitudinal resting-state EEG data from 854 infants across two geoculturally diverse cohorts to explore largescale network development through EEG microstates over the first two years of life. We provide evidence for conserved emergence of various network configurations (microstate classes A-G) through infancy across cohorts using data-driven clustering analyses. We also demonstrate significant longitudinal changes in microstate dynamics during this period, characterized by more numerous and more rapid transitions between largescale configurations, especially over early infancy. While patterns of sensory microstate development were largely consistent between cohorts, higher-order cognitive microstates showed context-specific developmental trends. Together these results provide novel insights into how large-scale brain networks functionally develop and organize across the first two years of life.

">Cytoplasmic expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 in radial glial progenitor cells modulates brain cortex development</a></h4>

              
                During nervous system development, the interplay between cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis is fundamental to achieve the correct timing for neuronal differentiation. However, the molecular players regulating this transition are poorly understood. Among these, the cell-cycle regulatory cyclins and their cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) play a pivotal role. In the present work we uncover an unknown function of cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) during cortex development which is independent of cell cycle regulation and that relies on its cytoplasmic localization and membrane association. We show that Ccnd1 is localized in the cytoplasm of the radial glial process (RGP) of neuron progenitors in different regions of the developing brain, including the cortex. Cytoplasmic Ccnd1 is enriched at the distal tip of the RGP, adjacent to the meningeal basement membrane, and overlaps with beta1-integrin at the plasma membrane. CCND1 knock-out animals show an abnormal cortical layering in which the distribution of Tbr2+ and Ctip2+ cells are affected without displaying proliferation defects. This is consistent with a cytoplasmic function of Ccnd1 as overexpression by in utero electroporation of a dominant negative Ccnd1, unable to activate Cdks, and targeted to the cytoplasmic membranes, reproduces some of these Tbr2 and Ctip2 defects. Finally, we provide evidence that cytoplasmic Ccnd1 affects neuron morphology and that it is required for the proper detachment of the RGP from the meningeal basement membrane by a mechanism involving the phosphorylation of the integrin effector protein paxillin. Hence, we propose that Ccnd1 has an important cytoplasmic function for cortical development independently of cell cycle regulation.

">Dissecting the functional heterogeneity of glutamatergic synapses with high-throughput optical physiology</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent reporters for glutamate release and postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling are essential tools for quantifying synapse functional heterogeneity across neurons and circuits. However, leveraging these probes for neuroscience requires scalable experimental frameworks. Here, we devised a high-throughput approach to efficiently collect and analyze hundreds of optical recordings of glutamate release activity at presynaptic boutons in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Boutons exhibited remarkable functional heterogeneity and could be separated into multiple functional classes based on their iGluSnFR3 responses to single action potentials, paired stimuli, and synaptic parameters derived from mean-variance analysis. Finally, we developed a novel all-optical assay of pre- and postsynaptic glutamatergic synapse function. We deployed iGluSnFR3 with a red-shifted, postsynaptically-targeted Ca2+ sensor, enabling direct imaging and analysis of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission at large numbers of dendritic spines. This work enables direct observation of the flow of information at single synapses and should speed detailed investigations of synaptic functional heterogeneity.

">Foveal action for the control of extrafoveal vision</a></h4>

              
                Microsaccades have been convincingly linked to extrafoveal covert attention shifts for more than two decades. However, the direction of causality between individual microsaccade generation and an alteration in both extrafoveal visual sensitivity and behavior remains debated: do microsaccades merely reflect, perhaps probabilistically, an altered extrafoveal sensitivity, or is the act of generating microsaccades sufficient to, on its own, modify such sensitivity? Using a novel exploitation of real-time retinal image stabilization, behavior, and neurophysiology in the superior colliculus, we show that exclusive experimental control over foveal oculomotor state is entirely sufficient to influence extrafoveal sensitivity. This happens for eccentricities as large as ~50 times those associated with microsaccades, and it also takes place in the absence of any differential attentional demands. Most importantly, such influence is mediated through well-known, classic pre- and post-saccadic visual processing changes. Thus, seemingly-innocuous subliminal eye movements do constitute an integral component of cognitive processes like attention.

">Collecting, detecting and handling non-wear intervals in longitudinal light exposure data</a></h4>

              
                In field studies using wearable light loggers, participants often need to remove the devices, resulting in non-wear intervals of varying and unknown duration. Accurate detection of these intervals is an essential step in data pre-processing pipelines. However, the limited reporting on whether and how non-wear information is collected and detected has hindered the development of effective data pre-processing strategies and automated detection algorithms. Here, we deploy a multi-modal approach to collect non-wear time during a longitudinal light exposure campaign and systematically compare non-wear detection strategies. Healthy participants (n=26; mean age 28{+/-}5 years, 14F) wore a near-corneal plane light logger for one week and reported non-wear events in three ways: pressing an "event marker" button on the light logger, placing it in a black bag, and using an app-based Wear log. Wear log entries were checked twice a day to ensure high data quality and used as ground truth for non-wear interval detection. Participants showed high adherence to the protocol, with non-wear time constituting 5.4{+/-}3.8% (mean{+/-}SD) of total participation time. Considering button presses, our results indicated that extending time windows beyond one minute improved their detection at the start and end of non-wear intervals, achieving identification in >85.4% of cases. To detect non-wear intervals based on black bag use, we applied an algorithm detecting clusters of low illuminance to our data and compared its performance to detecting clusters of low activity. Performance was higher for illuminance (F1=0.76) than activity (F1=0.52). Transition states between wear and non-wear emerged as a major source of misclassification, and we suggest that combining illuminance and activity data could enhance detection accuracy. Lastly, we compared light exposure metrics averaged across the week derived from three datasets: the full dataset, a dataset filtered for non-wear based on self-reports, and a dataset filtered for non-wear using the low illuminance clusters detection algorithm. The differences in light exposure metrics across these datasets were minimal. Our results highlight that while non-wear detection may be less critical in high-compliance cohorts, systematically collecting and detecting non-wear intervals is both feasible and important for ensuring robust data pre-processing.

">Using deep generative models for simultaneous representational and predictive modeling of brain and behavior: A graded supervised-to-unsupervised modeling framework.</a></h4>

              
                Research in cognitive neuroscience has increasingly used machine learning algorithms and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to model brain-behavior relationships. These algorithms typically fall into two main types: unsupervised or supervised. In cognitive neuroscience, most studies assume that brain states map to behavior in a linear, one-to-one fashion. If such mapping exists, unsupervised and supervised approaches should lead to converging conclusions. Conclusions diverge, however, when the mapping is more complex. Unfortunately, the ground truth of brain-behavior relationships is rarely, if ever, known in advance, leading to the possibility of incorrect conclusions when scientists use a modeling approach guided by a single set of assumptions that may not be justified. In this paper, we introduce a possible solution to this dilemma. We combine unsupervised and discriminative supervised models with a model comparison strategy, and apply this approach on simulated data where the ground truth brain-behavior relationships are known. The combined modeling approach learns a latent space that models the distribution of simulated brain states (similar to unsupervised approaches). At the same time, the latent space contains information that can be used to predict behavior, thereby contributing to brain-behavior characterizations (similar to supervised approaches). We use four simulated datasets that vary in the linearity and homogeneity of the brain-behavior relationship to compare the modeling results for each simulated dataset along a continuum from fully unsupervised to fully supervised. More importantly, we examine what happens to the latent space as a consequence of incorrect assumptions that applied to a dataset during modeling. We further show how our framework can model diverse brain-behavior relationships in a way that fully unsupervised v. fully supervised approaches do not, by comparing the modeling results for each simulated dataset along a continuum from fully unsupervised to fully supervised.

                Microglia dysregulation is implicated across a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, making their modulation a promising therapeutic target. Using PBMC-derived induced microglia-like cells (piMGLCs) in a scalable assay, we screened 489 CNS-penetrant compounds for modulation of microglial phagocytosis of human synaptosomes in a validated assay for microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. Compounds from the library that reduced phagocytosis by [&ge;]2 standard deviations across the library without cytotoxicity were validated in secondary screens, with 28 of them further confirmed to reduce phagocytosis by 50% or more. Image-based morphological measurements were calculated to measure the degree of ramified vs. amoeboid morphotype as an indicator of activation state. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling indicated divergent effects on cell signaling, metabolism, activation, and actin dynamics across confirmed compounds. In particular, multiple CNS-penetrant small molecules with prior FDA approval or demonstration of safety in vivo demonstrated modulatory effects on microglia. These potential disease-modifying agents represent high-priority candidates for repositioning studies in neurodevelopmental, neuroinflammatory, or neurodegenerative disorders.

">Auditory brainstem responses to speech-in-noise reflect selective attention, comprehension, and subjective listening effort</a></h4>

              
                The auditory brainstem plays a crucial role in speech-in-noise listening, refining numerous acoustic features such as pitch and spatial location under continual descending influence from cortex. However, the difficulty of characterizing brainstem activity during continuous speech listening has obscured its functional role in ecologically valid contexts - not only the effects of selective attention on neural responses, but also their impact on comprehension and listening effort. Here, we evaluate the role of the brainstem on speech-in-noise perception and selective attention using a continuous, speech-based stimulus with embedded chirps (Cheech) that rapidly and effectively evokes auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) while participants listen to short story narratives. The Cheech-modified stories were presented alone or in the presence of another spatially separated talker, and neural responses were measured throughout by EEG. Both word-level detection performance and narrative-level comprehension were evaluated, as well as subjective reports of listening effort. ABR wave V was modulated by the presence of a competing talker, selective attention for the target versus masker, and the talker gender. Additionally, faster wave V peak latencies and larger amplitudes were associated with identification of the target words embedded within the stories, while faster latencies additionally related to better comprehension question accuracy and lower subjective listening effort. Collectively, our results provide clear evidence for the influence of brainstem encoding processes on individual speech-listening behaviors, including the ability to selectively attend to and comprehend target speech in the presence of a competing talker.

">Cerebral perfusion and metabolic response of astrocytes and neurons during locomotion</a></h4>

              
                The hemodynamic response links neural oxidative metabolism changes to increased cerebral blood flow during brain activity. Although Roy and Sherrington introduced this concept over a century ago (1890), the exact cellular mechanisms remain unclear. This study demonstrates how local blood supply increases correlate with the metabolic response of individual brain cells during locomotion. Using Raman microspectroscopy, we observed an elevation in oxygen saturation levels (sO2) in cortical venules but not in arterioles, which were already near saturation. The increased sO2 in the venules was accompanied by vasodilation, indicating blood oversupply in the local brain area, a phenomenon known as functional hyperemia. We then analyzed the metabolic response of individual neurons and astrocytes to locomotion. In neurons, the levels of reduced cytochromes of c and b types [cyt c,b (Fe2+)] rapidly decreased at the onset of locomotion. This suggests an increase in the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (electron transport chain, ETC) in response to heightened energy demands in these cells. In contrast, because astrocytes rely less on oxidative phosphorylation for their energy metabolism than neurons, we did not observe an initial decrease in reduced cytochromes in these cells. However, as locomotion continued, the cyt c,b (Fe2+) levels steadily increased in both cell types. In neurons, this led to a slow recovery from the initial drop, while in astrocytes, the increase exceeded baseline levels. Consequently, we observed an overload of electrons in the astrocytic ETC. The distinct responses of astrocytic and neuronal mitochondria to locomotion may reflect differences in the organization of the ETC in the two cell types. Furthermore, astrocytes may shift to glycolysis under increased neuronal activity. This difference also resulted in hydrogen peroxide (H202) production in astrocytic mitochondria but not neuronal mitochondria. Since H202 is a signaling molecule critical for cognitive function in the brain, we speculate that astrocytic mitochondria act as signaling hubs during exercise.

">Emergence of Pre-movement Beta Activity with Stable Sensorimotor Predictions to Facilitate Motor Adjustments</a></h4>

              
                Daily, we adapt to perturbations to maintain efficient performance, especially when transitioning between environments with different features. Such an adaptative process relies on updating motor programs based on past errors, a process associated with beta oscillations (13-35 Hz). Yet, the spatio-temporal dynamics underlying the transition between different environments, and the updating of motor programs in response to specific environmental perturbations remain elusive. Here, we show for the first time that pre-movement beta activity in a cerebello-cortical network emerges as the features of a new environment and motor outcomes become more stable and predictable. Notably, the cerebellum and parietal cortex drive prefrontal activity near movement initiation to update these predictions. Using a single-trial approach, we reveal that pre-movement beta bursts predict the evolution of trial-by-trial motor adjustments within a stable environment. These findings demonstrate that pre-movement beta activity within cerebellar-cortical network encodes essential information for achieving efficient sensorimotor predictions following environmental changes.

">Critical Scaling of Novelty in the Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ability to detect unanticipated, novel events and rapidly relay this information across neural networks is fundamental to brain function, enabling the selection of appropriate behavioral responses. Here, we examine the transmission of holographically triggered action potentials in primary visual cortex of quietly resting mice, focusing on the dynamics of communication from pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that these novel action potentials, which are uncorrelated with preceding activity, exert a disproportionally large influence on neighboring neurons. Their influence scales robustly to an exponent between 0.2 and 0.3 relative to their number. Remarkably, even a small number of novel action potentials can engage a majority of the local network, achieving high decoding accuracy of the perturbation origin in the face of high trial-by-trial variability and ongoing activity characterized by scale-invariant, parabolic neuronal avalanches. This heightened susceptibility to small, local perturbations aligns with the behavior of complex systems exhibiting critical dynamics. Our findings reveal that scaling underpins the efficient communication of unanticipated action potentials, suggesting it is a fundamental mechanism for detecting and processing novel events in the brain. These results provide new insights into the neural basis of novelty detection and highlight the importance of critical dynamics in cortical network function.

">Grin2a Ablation Distinctly Reshapes PV+ and SST+ Interneuron circuits in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex to Amplify Gamma Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a debilitating mental health disorder marked by cognitive deficits, especially in executive functions, which are often resistant to treatment. The GRIN2A gene encodes the GluN2A subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Rare coding mutations in GRIN2A, such as protein-truncating variants, increase susceptibility to SCZ by ~20-fold. However, the effects on network dynamics and the function of GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) remain unclear. In this study, we use brain slices from Grin2a mutant mice to investigate inhibitory synaptic and oscillatory activity driven by parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) INs. Our findings reveal significant alterations in synaptic currents and inhibitory modulation arise from GluN2A deficiency. Specifically, both heterozygous and knockout Grin2a mutants exhibit impaired synaptic transmission and release properties of INs inputs, including changes in release probability and evoked quantal events to layer V pyramidal neurons. Genotype-dependent alterations were observed in the frequency, kinetics, and amplitude of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an increased density of PV+ and SST+ INs in the Grin2a mutants, consistent with an overall increase in inhibitory tone. Additionally, optogenetic stimulation revealed a dynamic shift for inducing gamma-band oscillations through PV+ INs. Overall, our study highlights the essential role of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors in modulating inhibitory tone and maintaining network stability in the mPFC of adult mice and elucidates a pathophysiological mechanism that might contribute to cognitive deficits often observed in SCZ patients.

">Investigating the Role of Glyoxalase 1 as a Therapeutic Target for Cocaine and Oxycodone Use Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Methylglyoxal (MG) is an endogenously produced non-enzymatic side product of glycolysis that acts as a partial agonist at GABAA receptors. MG that is metabolized by the enzyme glyoxalase-1 (GLO1). Inhibition of GLO1 increases methylglyoxal levels, and has been shown to modulate various behaviors, including decreasing seeking of cocaine-paired cues and ethanol consumption. The goal of these studies was to determine if GLO1 inhibition could alter cocaine- or oxycodone-induced locomotor activation and/or conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine or oxycodone. We used both pharmacological and genetic manipulations of GLO1 to address this question. Administration of the GLO1 inhibitor s-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG) did not alter the locomotor response to cocaine or oxycodone. Additionally, pBBG had no significant effect on place preference for cocaine or oxycodone. Genetic knockdown of Glo1, which is conceptually similar to pharmacological inhibition, did not have any significant effects on cocaine place preference, nor did Glo1 overexpression affect locomotor response to cocaine. In summary, our results show that neither pharmacological nor genetic manipulations of GLO1 influence locomotor response or CPP to cocaine or oxycodone.

">Network Segregation During Episodic Memory Shows Age-Invariant Relations with Memory Performance From 7 to 82 Years</a></h4>

              
                Lower episodic memory capability, as seen in development and aging compared with younger adulthood, may partly depend on lower brain network segregation. Here, our objective was twofold: (1) test this hypothesis using within- and between-network functional connectivity (FC) during episodic memory encoding and retrieval, in two independent samples (n=734, age 7-82 years). (2) Assess associations with age and the ability to predict memory comparing task-general FC and memory-modulated FC. In a multiverse-inspired approach, we performed tests across multiple analytic choices. Results showed that relationships differed based on these analytic choices, were often weak, and mainly present in the cohort with the most data. Significant relationships indicated that (i) memory-modulated FC predicted memory performance and associated with memory in an age-invariant manner. (ii) In line with the so-called neural dedifferentiation view, task-general FC showed lower segregation with higher age in adults which was associated with worse memory performance. In development, although there were only weak signs of a neural differentiation, that is, gradually higher segregation with higher age, we observed similar lower segregation-worse memory relationships. This age-invariant relationships between FC and episodic memory suggest that network segregation is pivotal for memory across the healthy lifespan.

">Balancing Act: A Neural Trade-Off Between Coherence and Creativity in Spontaneous Speech</a></h4>

              
                Effective communication involves a delicate balance between generating novel, engaging content and maintaining a coherent narrative. The neural mechanisms underlying this balance between coherence and creativity in discourse production remain unexplored. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between coherence and creativity in spontaneous speech, with a specific focus on the interaction among three key neural networks: the Default Mode Network, Multiple Demand Network, and the Semantic Control Network. To this end, we conducted a two-part analysis. At the behavioural level, we analysed speech samples produced in response to topic cues, computing measures of global coherence (indexing the degree of connectedness to the main topic) and Divergent Semantic Integration (DSI; reflecting the diversity of ideas incorporated in the narrative). Coherence and divergence in speech were negatively correlated, suggesting a trade-off between maintaining a coherent narrative structure and incorporating creative elements. At the neural level, higher global coherence was associated with greater activation in the Multiple Demand Network, emphasising its role in organising and sustaining logical flow in discourse production. In contrast, functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that higher DSI was related to greater coupling between the Default Mode and Multiple Demand Networks, suggesting that creative speech relies on a dynamic interplay between associative and executive processes. These results provide new insights into the cognitive and neural processes underpinning spontaneous speech production, highlighting the complex interplay between different brain networks in managing competing demands of being coherent and creative.

">Aggregation promoting sequences rather than phosphorylation are essential for Tau-mediated toxicity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Background: Disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies like Alzheimer's disease have targeted Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, as both pathological manifestations are implicated in Tau-mediated toxicity. However, the relative contributions of these pathology-linked changes to Tau neurotoxicity remain unclear. Methods: Leveraging the genetic tractability of Drosophila, we generated multiple inducible human Tau transgenes with altered phosphorylation status and/or aggregation propensity. Their individual and combined impact was tested in vivo by quantifying Tau accumulation and neurodegenerative phenotypes in the aging fly nervous system. Results: We report that phospho-mimicking Tau (hTau2N4RE14) induced profound neurodegeneration, supporting a neurotoxic role for phosphorylation. However, when we rendered hTau2N4RE14 aggregation incompetent, by deleting the 306VQIVYK311 motif in the microtubule-binding region, neurotoxicity was abolished. Moreover, a peptide inhibitor targeting this motif efficaciously reduced Tau toxicity in aging Drosophila. Conclusion: Neurodegeneration mediated by Tau hyperphosphorylation is gated via at least one aggregation-mediating motif on the protein. This highlights the primacy of blocking Tau aggregation in therapy, perhaps without the need to clear phosphorylated species.

">Cortical projection neurons with distinct axonal connectivity employ ribosomal complexes with distinct protein compositions</a></h4>

              
                Diverse subtypes of cortical projection neurons (PN) form long-range axonal projections that are responsible for distinct sensory, motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions. Translational control has been identified at multiple stages of PN development, but how translational regulation contributes to formation of distinct, subtype-specific long-range circuits is poorly understood. Ribosomal complexes (RCs) exhibit variations of their component proteins, with an increasing set of examples that confer specialized translational control. Here, we directly compare the protein compositions of RCs in vivo from two closely related cortical neuron subtypes-cortical output "subcerebral PN" (SCPN) and interhemispheric "callosal PN" (CPN)- during establishment of their distinct axonal connectivity. Using retrograde labeling of subtype-specific somata, purification by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, ribosome immunoprecipitation, and ultra-low-input mass spectrometry, we identify distinct protein compositions of RCs from these two subtypes. Strikingly, we identify 16 associated proteins reliably and exclusively detected only in RCs of SCPN. 10 of these proteins have known interaction with components of ribosomes; we further validated ribosome interaction with protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE), a candidate with roles in synaptogenesis. PRKCE and a subset of SCPN-specific candidate ribosome-associated proteins also exhibit enriched gene expression by SCPN. Together, these results indicate that ribosomal complexes exhibit subtype-specific protein composition in distinct subtypes of cortical projection neurons during development, and identify potential candidates for further investigation of function in translational regulation involved in subtype-specific circuit formation.

	<p>Background/Objectives:&amp;amp;nbsp;Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an obligate food-borne intracellular parasite, causes severe neuropathology by establishing a persistent infection in the host brain. We have previously shown that T. gondii infection induces severe neuropathology in the brain manifested by increased nitric oxide production, oxidative stress, glial activation/BBB damage, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine glia maturation factor-beta and induced apoptosis. Methods: The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the serum amyloid P (SAP) components, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), caspase 1 (Casp 1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;) and complement 3 (C3) gene expressions on the 10th, 20th and 30th days after infection with T. gondii in the neuroimmunopathogenesis of toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) in mouse brains by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The study also aimed to determine whether there was a correlation between the markers included in the study on these critical days, which had not previously been investigated. The mRNA expression levels of SAP components, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, Casp 1, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; and C3 were examined. Results: The most notable outcome of this investigation was the observation that SAP components exhibited a 13.9-fold increase on day 10 post-infection, followed by a rapid decline in the subsequent periods. In addition, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; expression increased 20-fold, while SAP components decreased 13-fold on day 20 after infection. Additionally, the TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, Casp 1 and NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B expression levels were consistently elevated to above normal levels at each time point. Conclusions: This study identified SAP components, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, Casp 1 and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; expressions as playing critical roles in TE neuroimmunopathogenesis. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate SAP components during the transition from acute systemic infection to early/medium chronic and chronic infection and to explore the relationship between SAP components and other nuclear factors/pro-cytokines.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent research has explored the presence of subthreshold autistic traits (ATs) in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), suggesting that these traits may contribute to the severity of BPD symptoms and increase the risk of other mental health issues, including suicidal behaviors. This study aims to investigate the relationship between ATs and affective symptoms, such as mood instability and suicidality, in people diagnosed with BPD. Methods: A total of 48 subjects with BPD were assessed with self-report questionnaires including the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), the mood spectrum self-report version (MOODS-SR) and the ruminative response scale (RRS). Results: Subjects with significant ATs scored higher than BPD subjects in all domains and in the total score of AdAS Spectrum, RRS, and MOODS-SR, as well as in the items investigating suicidality. RRS total score, its depression domain, and the MOODS-SR rhythmicity domain, as well as suicidality, were predictors of the presence of ATs. Conclusions: Our data confirm the relationship between the presence of clinically significant ATs and affective symptoms, ruminative thinking, and suicidality in patients with BPD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Military aviators can be exposed to extreme physiological stressors, including decompression stress, G-forces, as well as intermittent hypoxia and/or hyperoxia, which may contribute to neurobiological dysfunction/damage. This study aimed to investigate the levels of neurological biomarkers in military aviators to assess the potential risk of long-term brain injury and neurodegeneration. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 48 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) aviators and 48 non-aviator CAF controls. Plasma samples were analyzed for biomarkers of glial activation (GFAP), axonal damage (NF-L, pNF-H), oxidative stress (PRDX-6), and neurodegeneration (T-tau), along with S100b, NSE, and UCHL-1. The biomarker concentrations were quantified using multiplexed immunoassays. Results: The aviators exhibited significantly elevated levels of GFAP, NF-L, PRDX-6, and T-tau compared to the CAF controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), indicating increased glial activation, axonal injury, and oxidative stress. Trends toward higher levels of S100b, NSE, and UCHL-1 were observed but were not statistically significant. The elevated biomarker levels suggest cumulative brain damage, raising concerns about potential long-term neurological impairments. Conclusions: Military aviators are at increased risk for neurobiological injury, including glial and axonal damage, oxidative stress, and early neurodegeneration. These findings emphasize the importance of proactive monitoring and further research to understand the long-term impacts of high-altitude flight on brain health and to develop strategies for mitigating cognitive decline and neurodegenerative risks in this population.</p>

	<p>Radiation therapy is widely recognized as an efficacious modality for treating neoplasms located within the craniofacial region. Nevertheless, this approach is not devoid of risks, predominantly concerning potential harm to the neural structures. Adverse effects may encompass focal cerebral necrosis, cognitive function compromise, cerebrovascular pathology, spinal cord injury, and detriment to the neural fibers constituting the brachial plexus. With increasing survival rates among oncology patients, evaluating post-treatment quality of life has become crucial in assessing the benefits of radiation therapy. Consequently, it is imperative to investigate therapeutic strategies to mitigate cerebral complications from radiation exposure. Current management of radiation-induced cerebral damage involves corticosteroids and bevacizumab, with preclinical research on antioxidants and thalidomide. Despite these efforts, an optimal treatment remains elusive. Recent studies suggest the gut microbiota&amp;amp;rsquo;s involvement in neurologic pathologies. This review aims to discuss the causes and existing treatments for radiation-induced cerebral injury and explore gut microbiota modulation as a potential therapeutic strategy.</p>

In this study, 66 participants with normal cognition, 59 with subjective cognitive decline, 12 with mild cognitive impairment, and 11 with Alzheimer’s disease dementia were included in the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE) cohort. A regional asymmetry index, denoting the left–right asymmetry of β-amyloid plaques, was derived for each region based on the Anatomical Automatic Labeling atlas. The level of β-amyloid plaques in each region was compared among different clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease using the analysis of variance. An additional correlation analysis examined the relationship between each region of interest’s cognitive performance scores and asymmetry index values. We found that β-amyloid appears to be lateralized in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, there is a significant correlation between β-amyloid asymmetry in various brain regions and cognition. The observed Aβ lateralization could potentially be utilized as a neuroimaging biomarker throughout AD progression.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied both in research settings and clinically, notably in treating depression through the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). We have recently shown that transcranial alternating current stimulation of the dlPFC partially entrains muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) to the stimulus. We, therefore, aimed to further explore the sympathetic properties of the dlPFC, hypothesizing that single-pulse TMS could generate de novo MSNA bursts. Microneurography was performed on the right common peroneal nerve in 12 participants. TMS pulses were then delivered to the ipsilateral dlPFC at resting motor threshold (MT) of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and at powers 20 below, 10 below, 10% above, and 20% above MT. The MT and 10% above MT intensities were also used to stimulate the right motor cortex and shoulder. Comparisons between stimulus intensities at the same site and between sites at the same intensities revealed no differences in MSNA burst frequency, burst incidence, or single MSNA spikes. Most stimulus trains, however, showed reduced burst frequency and incidence from baseline, regardless of site. This suggests that the TMS itself was evoking arousal-based sympathoinhibition, independent of dlPFC influences. It seems the dlPFC is capable of modulating MSNA but cannot directly generate bursts.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Foreseeing the future outcomes is the art of decision-making. Substantial evidence shows that, during choice deliberation, the brain can retrieve prospective decision outcomes. However, decisions are seldom made in a vacuum. Context carries information that can radically affect the outcomes of a choice. Nevertheless, most investigations of retrieval processes examined decisions in isolation, disregarding the context in which they occur. Here, we studied how context shapes prospective outcome retrieval during deliberation. We designed a decision-making task where participants were presented with object–context pairs and made decisions which led to a certain outcome. We show during deliberation, likely outcomes were retrieved in transient patterns of neural activity, as early as 3 s before participants decided. The strength of prospective outcome retrieval explains participants’ behavioral efficiency, but only when context affects the decision outcome. Our results suggest context imparts strong constraints on retrieval processes and how neural representations are shaped during decision-making.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Anti-MAG polyneuropathy is a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathies, particularly MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) and Waldenstr&amp;amp;ouml;m macroglobulinemia. It is characterized by a subacute onset of distal sensory symptoms, with distal motor dysfunction typically appearing only in the later stages of the disease. The condition is caused by the presence of autoantibodies directed against myelin-associated glycoprotein, a structural protein of myelin. This leads to abnormalities in electrophysiological studies, such as markedly delayed distal latencies without conduction blocks or temporal dispersion of potentials. While rituximab (RTX) is the primary treatment, its efficacy is limited, with improvement seen in only 30&amp;amp;ndash;50% of patients. Recently, acute worsening of symptoms after RTX treatment has been increasingly reported. Methods: This systematic review compiles case reports and series from inception to June 2024 published on Scopus, PubMed or Cochrane, documenting acute exacerbations after RTX treatment in patients with anti-MAG polyneuropathy. Additionally, we present a case report from our institution that highlights this phenomenon. Results: We identified 13 clinical cases of acute deterioration in patients with anti-MAG polyneuropathy. Among these, eight patients (62%) achieved full recovery following additional treatment, while five patients (38%) did not return to their previous level of function. Plasmapheresis led to complete recovery in all four patients who received this intervention. Interestingly, many patients also experienced recovery after discontinuation of rituximab (RTX) treatment without the need for further therapeutic intervention. Conclusions: Acute clinical deterioration following RTX treatment in anti-MAG polyneuropathy is a possible occurrence. However, to date, no studies have assessed the true prevalence of this phenomenon. Further research is warranted to identify potential predictors of worsening following RTX treatment in this patient population.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders marked by challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. People with ASD may exhibit repetitive behaviors, unique ways of learning, and different ways of interacting with the world. The term &amp;amp;ldquo;spectrum&amp;amp;rdquo; reflects the wide variability in how ASD manifests in individuals, including differences in abilities, symptoms, and support needs, and conditions characterized by difficulties in social interactions, communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology, with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid. Previous studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation have shown promising results, suggesting nervous system susceptibility to electromagnetic fields, with evidence indicating that extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) treatment may modulate inflammatory responses through multiple pathways, including the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, and the enhancement of anti-inflammatory mediators. Methods: This pilot study included 20 children (ages 2&amp;amp;ndash;13) with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. A 15-week protocol involved ELF-EMF treatments using the SEQEX device, with specific day and night programs. Assessment was conducted through standardized pre- and post-treatment tests: Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-4, Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test-4, and Conner&amp;amp;rsquo;s 3GI. Results: Statistically significant improvements were observed in receptive language (PPVT-4: from 74.07 to 90.40, p = 0.002) and expressive language (EOWPVT-4: from 84.17 to 90.50, p = 0.041). Notable reductions, with statistical significance, were found in externalizing problems across both age groups (1.5&amp;amp;ndash;5 years: p = 0.028; 6&amp;amp;ndash;18 years: p = 0.027), with particular improvement in attention and behavioral problems. The results were observed over a short period of 15 weeks, therefore excluding the possibility of coincidental age-related gains, that would typically occur during a normal developmental timeframe. Parent evaluations showed significant reduction in ASD symptoms, particularly in the 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;5 years group (p = 0.046). Conclusions: ELF-EMF treatment demonstrated a high safety profile and efficacy in mitigating ASD-related symptoms. The observed improvements suggest both direct effects on central and autonomic nervous systems and indirect effects through inflammatory response modulation. Further studies are needed to confirm these promising results through broader demographics and randomized control designs.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive impairment poses a significant global health challenge, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and intervention. Traditional diagnostics like neuroimaging and clinical evaluations are often subjective, costly, and inaccessible, especially in resource-poor settings. Previous research has focused on speech analysis primarily conducted using English data, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. Methods: In this study, we present our results from the INTERSPEECH 2024 TAUKADIAL Challenge, where we aimed to automatically detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and predict cognitive scores for English and Chinese speakers (169 in total). Our approach leverages Whisper, a speech foundation model, to extract language-agnostic speech embeddings. We then utilize ensemble models to incorporate task-specific information. Results: Our model achieved unweighted average recall of 81.83% in an MCI classification task, and root mean squared error of 1.196 in cognitive score prediction task, which placed the model at the second and the first position, respectively, in the ranking for each task. Comparison between language-agnostic and language-specific models reveals the importance of capturing language-specific nuances for accurate cognitive impairment prediction. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of language-specific ensemble modeling with Whisper embeddings in enabling scalable, non-invasive cognitive health assessments of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, achieving state-of-the-art results in multilingual settings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent studies have investigated the effects of ketamine on fear memory in animals. However, it is unclear if ketamine might affect avoidance memory and emotional behaviors concomitantly. In this study, we compared the effects of (R,S)- and (S)-ketamine in modulating avoidance responses, and depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in stressed mice. Methods: Mice were previously exposed to inescapable footshock stress, and 24 h later, they were trained in the active avoidance task. (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-isomer was administered 1 h prior to re-exposition to the active avoidance task. Three hours after drug administration, mice were tested in the tail suspension, followed by the open field test. Results: Neither form of ketamine affected avoidance memory retrieval, while (S)-ketamine, and tangentially, (R,S) reduced avoidance responses during re-exposition to aversive stimulus. In the tail suspension test, (R,S)- and (S)-ketamine equally evoked antidepressant effects. In the open field test, the racemic mixture, but not (S)-ketamine, induced anxiolytic actions. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the therapeutic potential of ketamine for the treatment of stress-related disorders, with (R,S)-ketamine being more effective in simultaneously inducing antidepressant and anxiolytic responses and reducing avoidance responses in stressed mice.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) resting tremor is thought to be initiated in the basal ganglia and amplified in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Because stress worsens tremor, the noradrenergic system may play a role in amplifying tremor. We tested if and how propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces PD tremor and whether or not this effect is specific to stressful conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cross-over, double-blind intervention study, participants with PD resting tremor received propranolol (40 mg, single dose) or placebo (counter-balanced) on 2 different days. During both days, we assessed tremor severity (with accelerometry) and tremor-related brain activity (with functional magnetic resonance imaging), as well as heart rate and pupil diameter, while subjects performed a stressful cognitive load task that has been linked to the noradrenergic system. We tested for effects of drug (propranolol vs placebo) and stress (cognitive load vs rest) on tremor power and tremor-related brain activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 27 PD patients with prominent resting tremor. Tremor power significantly increased during cognitive load versus rest (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 13.8; <i>p</i> = 0.001; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.42) and decreased by propranolol versus placebo (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 6.4; <i>p</i> = 0.02; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.25), but there was no interaction. We observed task-related brain activity in a stress-sensitive cognitive control network and tremor power-related activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Propranolol significantly reduced tremor-related activity in the motor cortex compared to placebo (<i>F</i>[1,21] = 5.3; <i>p</i> = 0.03; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.20), irrespective of cognitive load.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that propranolol has a general, context-independent, tremor-reducing effect that may be implemented at the level of the primary motor cortex. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This article is my recollection of events surrounding the discovery of head direction (HD) cells by Jim Ranck in 1984 and the first journal publications 6 years later. Ranck first described the fundamental properties of HD cells qualitatively in a <i>Society for Neuroscience</i> abstract (1984) and in the proceedings to a conference. Ranck, however, was convinced by Bob Muller, a faculty colleague in the lab, to delay writing up Jim's discovery until they developed a two-spot video tracking system, which would enable proper quantitative analyses. The development of this system was complex and was still undergoing development when I arrived in the Brooklyn lab in 1986. By this time, Jim had begun to refocus his efforts on thinking about the relationship between space and manifolds and was no longer engaged in active research. It thus befell me (unintentionally) to complete the recordings of these fascinating cells. This endeavor involved recording additional HD cells with the new video tracking system, monitoring the cells' responses following a series of environmental manipulations, and performing quantitative analyses on the data. Throughout 1987, I recorded most of the cells that would form the basis for our 1990 papers published in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>. Along the way, there were many events and emotions: luck, excitement, humor, frustration, tutorials, unintended outcomes, and long-lasting friendships. I was guided and supported during this time by both Bob Muller and John Kubie, but remain forever grateful to Jim for this wonderful opportunity.</p>

                Poluben et al. show that prostate cancer cell resistance to an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist targeting the full-length AR (ARfl) is driven by an AR spice variant (ARv7) that functions independently of ARfl but requires adaptations associated with increased chromatin accessibility and is dependent on nuclear factor I transcription factors.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain networks describe the driving and synchronous relationships among multiple brain regions and can be used to identify different emotional states. However, methods for extracting interpretable structural features from brain networks are still lacking. In the current study, a novel deep learning structure comprising both an attention mechanism and a domain adversarial strategy is proposed to extract discriminant and interpretable features from brain networks. Specifically, the attention mechanism enhances the contribution of crucial rhythms and subnetworks for emotion recognition, whereas the domain-adversarial module improves the generalization performance of our proposed model for cross-subject tasks. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method for subject-independent emotion recognition tasks with the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) and the EEGs recorded in our laboratory. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of different emotions compared with commonly used methods such as domain adversarial neural networks. On the basis of the extracted network features, we also revealed crucial rhythms and subnetwork structures for emotion processing, which are consistent with those found in previous studies. Our proposed method not only improves the classification performance of brain networks but also provides a novel tool for revealing emotion processing mechanisms.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) is less investigated than the more common late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) despite its more aggressive course. A cortical signature of EOAD was recently proposed and may facilitate EOAD investigation. Here, we aimed to validate this proposed MRI biomarker of EOAD neurodegeneration in an Appalachian clinical cohort. We also compared differences in EOAD signature atrophy in participants with biomarker-positive EOAD, LOAD, early-onset non-AD pathologies, and cognitively normal individuals. Cortical thinning was reliably detected in eight of nine signature areas of persons with EOAD relative to cognitively normal individuals despite very early disease stage. Additionally, individuals with EOAD showed thinner cortex in most signature regions relative to those with early-onset non-AD pathologies. EOAD and LOAD showed similar cortical atrophy within most EOAD signature regions. Whole-brain vertex-wise cortical analyses supported these findings. Furthermore, signature cortical atrophy showed expected relationships with measures of global and specific cognitive and functional status. This investigation further validates and expands upon the recently defined EOAD signature and suggests its robustness within a rural population, even at early disease stage. Larger scale and longitudinal studies employing this marker of EOAD neurodegeneration are needed to further understand clinical effects and appropriate management of persons with EOAD.</span>

Using magnetic resonance imaging, we employed diffusion-weighted imaging and automated tract-segmentation to explore striato- and thalamo-cortical tract microstructure and volume differences between autistic (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 29) and typical comparison (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 33) adults (40 to 70 years old). Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and tract volumes were measured for 14 striato-cortical and 12 thalamo-cortical tract bundles. Data were examined using linear regressions for group by age effects and group plus age effects, and false discovery rate correction was applied. Following false discovery rate correction, volumes of thalamocortical tracts to premotor, pericentral, and parietal regions were significantly reduced in autism spectrum disorder compared to thalamo-cortical groups, but no group by age interactions were found. Uncorrected results suggested additional main effects of group and age might be present for both tract volume and mean diffusivity across multiple subcortico-cortical tracts.

	<p>Objectives: Growing evidence suggests a link between organophosphate insecticides and depression disorder. These chemicals are metabolized and subsequently expelled through the urinary tract. The present study aims to investigate whether dialkyl phosphate metabolites associate with depression score and severity among the general population. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). All urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites were quantitatively analyzed. The survey&amp;amp;rsquo;s complex design parameters and sampling weights were considered. Results: 3035 eligible individuals were included. The estimated prevalence of mild and major depression was 18.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.9&amp;amp;ndash;19.7%) and 9.9% (95% CI: 8.7&amp;amp;ndash;11.0%). For each incremental unit in the level of urinary dimethyl phosphate (DMP), individuals were found to have a higher depression score of 0.77 and a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.13) for mild depression and 2.75 (95% CI: 2.74&amp;amp;ndash;2.76) for major depression. Conclusions: Our findings indicate positive and independent associations between urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites and an elevated risk of depression among the general population.</p>

	<p>Background: Emotions play a crucial role in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s lives, profoundly affecting their cognition, decision-making, and interpersonal communication. Emotion recognition based on brain signals has become a significant challenge in the fields of affective computing and human-computer interaction. Methods: Addressing the issue of inaccurate feature extraction and low accuracy of existing deep learning models in emotion recognition, this paper proposes a multi-channel automatic classification model for emotion EEG signals named DACB, which is based on dual attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks. DACB extracts features in both temporal and spatial dimensions, incorporating not only convolutional neural networks but also SE attention mechanism modules for learning the importance of different channel features, thereby enhancing the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. DACB also introduces dot product attention mechanisms to learn the importance of spatial and temporal features, effectively improving the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s accuracy. Results: The accuracy of this method in single-shot validation tests on the SEED-IV and DREAMER (Valence-Arousal-Dominance three-classification) datasets is 99.96% and 87.52%, 90.06%, and 89.05%, respectively. In 10-fold cross-validation tests, the accuracy is 99.73% and 84.26%, 85.40%, and 85.02%, outperforming other models. Conclusions: This demonstrates that the DACB model achieves high accuracy in emotion classification tasks, demonstrating outstanding performance and generalization ability and providing new directions for future research in EEG signal recognition.</p>

	<p>Background: Eye movement research serves as a critical tool for assessing brain function, diagnosing neurological and psychiatric disorders, and understanding cognition and behavior. Sex differences have largely been under reported or ignored in neurological research. However, eye movement features provide biomarkers that are useful for disease classification with superior accuracy and robustness compared to previous classifiers for neurological diseases. Neurological diseases have a sex specificity, yet eye movement analysis has not been specific to our understanding of sex differences. Methods: The study involved subjects recruited from 804 sites equipped with RightEye Vision Systems, primarily located in optometry practices across the United States. Subjects completed six eye movement assessments: circular smooth pursuit (CSP), horizontal smooth pursuit (HSP), vertical smooth pursuit (VSP), horizontal saccades (HS), vertical saccades (VS), and fixation stability (FS). Eye movements were analyzed and classified in accordance with age and sex by multiple t-tests and linear regression models. Results: This study represented a large sample size of 23,557 subjects, with 11,871 males and 11,686 females representing ages from birth through 80 years of age. We observed statistically significant differences for all eye movement functions between males and females. Conclusions: We demonstrate that eye movements are sex-specific and offer normative data to compare sex-specific eye movement function by age. Novel baseline metrics can be compared to individual performance, regardless of sex. This study represents significant progress in linking eye movements with brain function and clinical syndromes, allowing researchers and clinicians to stratify individuals by age and sex.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Rodents provide a useful translational model of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors. Previously stressed animals exhibit physiological and behavioral stress responses that parallel those observed in anxious humans. Patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) present with a spectrum of debilitating anxiety symptoms that result from exposure to one or more traumatic events, with individuals exposed to early adverse experiences and women having increased vulnerability for diagnoses; however, the mechanisms of this increased vulnerability remain unknown. PTSD involves a complex network of highly interconnected brain regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Serotonin (5-HT) release into the BNST yields an increased expression of both fear and anxiety, specifically through 5-HT2C receptor signaling. The present experiment addressed whether 5-HT2C receptor signaling in the BNST is necessary for the acquisition of early-life stress (ELS)-induced enhancements in adult contextual fear learning. Methods: Rats received 0 or 15 footshocks on postnatal day 17, an established model of acute ELS (aELS) that yields enhanced adult fear learning. In adulthood, rats received bilateral infusions of a vehicle, a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist (RS-102221), or a 5-HT2C receptor agonist (MK-212) into the BNST 15 min prior to one-footshock contextual fear conditioning in a novel context. The next day, rats were returned to the fear-conditioning context to assess their fear memory (freezing). Results: Females demonstrated aELS-induced enhancement in contextual fear learning, while males did not. BNST infusions of RS-102221 reduced contextual fear conditioning, independent of aELS condition and sex. Infusions of MK-212 had no effect. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that serotonergic signaling through 5-HT2C receptors in the BNST contributes to contextual fear conditioning, but not aELS-induced stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL).</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal type of cancer, frequently presenting an unfavorable prognosis. The current treatment options for this neoplasia are still limited, highlighting the need for further research evaluating new drugs to treat GBM or to serve as an adjuvant to improve the efficiency of currently used therapies. In this sense, the inhibition of A2A receptors in the brain has presented a neuroprotective role for several diseases, such as neurodegenerative conditions, and it has been suggested as a possible pharmacological target in some types of cancer; thus, it also can be underscored as a potential target in GBM. Recently, Istradefylline (IST) was approved by the FDA for treating Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, representing a safe drug that acts through the inhibition of the A2A receptor, and it has also been suggested as an antineoplastic drug. Therefore, this work aims to explore the effects of A2A receptor inhibition as a therapy for GBM and assess the feasibility of this blockage occurring through the effects of IST.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) and anxiety disorders (ADs) are highly comorbid, a co-occurrence linked to worse clinical outcomes than either condition alone. While the neurobiological mechanisms involved in SUDs and anxiety disorders are intensively studied separately, the mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remain an emerging area of interest. This narrative review explores the neurobiological processes underlying this comorbidity, using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework to map disruptions in positive valence, negative valence, and cognitive systems across the three stages of the addiction cycle: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation. Anxiety and substance use play a reciprocal role at each stage of addiction, marked by significant psychosocial impairment and dysregulation in the brain. A more thorough understanding of the neural underpinnings involved in comorbid SUDs and anxiety disorders will contribute to more tailored and effective therapeutic interventions and assessments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/12/ENEURO.0495-23.2024?rss=1">Can Information About Stiffness Perception be Inferred from Action Signals Using Models?</a></h4>

              
                <p>We use sensory feedback to form our perception, and control our movements and forces (actions). There is an ongoing debate about the relation between perception and action, with evidence in both directions. For example, there are cases in which perceptual illusions affect action signals and cases where they do not. However, even when they do, it is unknown if perceptual information can be inferred from action signals alone. To answer this question, we utilized a perceptual illusion created by artificial tactile skin stretch, which increases stiffness perception, and affects grip force. We used data recorded in a stiffness discrimination task in which participants compared pairs of virtual objects, comprised of force and artificial skin stretch and indicated which they perceived as stiffer. We explored if models could predict the participants&rsquo; perceptual responses, and the increase in stiffness perception caused by the skin stretch, solely from their recorded action signals. That is, with no information provided about the stimuli. We found that participants&rsquo; perceptual augmentation could be predicted to an extent from their action signals alone. We predicted the average augmentation effect across participants, and a general trend of increased predicted perceptual augmentation for increased real perceptual augmentation. These results indicate that at least some perceptual information is present in action signals. Furthermore, of the action signals examined, grip force was necessary for predicting the augmentation effect, and a motion signal (e.g., position) was needed for predicting human-like perception, shedding light on what information may be presented in the different signals.</p>

                <p>by Roukayatou R. Ouedraogo, Hannah K. Sowers, Spencer R. Lynch, Nathan E. Hudson, Brittany E. Bannish</p>

Fibrinolysis, the plasmin-mediated degradation of the fibrin mesh that stabilizes blood clots, is an important physiological process, and understanding mechanisms underlying lysis is critical for improved stroke treatment. Experimentalists are now able to study lysis on the scale of single fibrin fibers, but mathematical models of lysis continue to focus mostly on fibrin network degradation. Experiments have shown that while some degradation occurs along the length of a fiber, ultimately the fiber is cleaved at a single location. We built a 2-dimensional stochastic model of a fibrin fiber cross-section that uses the Gillespie algorithm to study single fiber lysis initiated by plasmin. We simulated the model over a range of parameter values to learn about patterns and rates of single fiber lysis in various physiological conditions. We also used epifluorescent microscopy to measure the cleavage times of fibrin fibers with different apparent diameters. By comparing our model results to the laboratory experiments, we were able to: 1) suggest value ranges for unknown rate constants(namely that the degradation rate of fibrin by plasmin should be ≤ 10 s<sup>−1</sup> and that if plasmin crawls, the rate of crawling should be between 10 s<sup>−1</sup> and 60 s<sup>−1</sup>); 2) estimate the fraction of fibrin within a fiber cross-section that must be degraded for the fiber to cleave in two; and 3) propose that that fraction is higher in thinner fibers and lower in thicker fibers. Collectively, this information provides more details about how fibrin fibers degrade, which can be leveraged in the future for a better understanding of why fibrinolysis is impaired in certain disease states, and could inform intervention strategies.

                <p>by Kathrin Pabst, Evripidis Gkanias, Barbara Webb, Uwe Homberg, Dominik Endres</p>

Accurate navigation often requires the maintenance of a robust internal estimate of heading relative to external surroundings. We present a model for angular velocity integration in a desert locust heading circuit, applying concepts from early theoretical work on heading circuits in mammals to a novel biological context in insects. In contrast to similar models proposed for the fruit fly, this circuit model uses a single 360° heading direction representation and is updated by neuromodulatory angular velocity inputs. Our computational model was implemented using steady-state firing rate neurons with dynamical synapses. The circuit connectivity was constrained by biological data, and remaining degrees of freedom were optimised with a machine learning approach to yield physiologically plausible neuron activities. We demonstrate that the integration of heading and angular velocity in this circuit is robust to noise. The heading signal can be effectively used as input to an existing insect goal-directed steering circuit, adapted for outbound locomotion in a steady direction that resembles locust migration. Our study supports the possibility that similar computations for orientation may be implemented differently in the neural hardware of the fruit fly and the locust.

                <p>by Melvin Bérard, Laura Merlini, Sophie G. Martin</p>

Starvation, which is associated with inactivation of the growth-promoting TOR complex 1 (TORC1), is a strong environmental signal for cell differentiation. In the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, nitrogen starvation has distinct physiological consequences depending on the presence of mating partners. In their absence, cells enter quiescence, and TORC1 inactivation prolongs their life. In presence of compatible mates, TORC1 inactivation is essential for sexual differentiation. Gametes engage in paracrine pheromone signaling, grow towards each other, fuse to form the diploid zygote, and form resistant, haploid spore progenies. To understand the signaling changes in the proteome and phospho-proteome during sexual reproduction, we developed cell synchronization strategies and present (phospho-)proteomic data sets that dissect pheromone from starvation signals over the sexual differentiation and cell–cell fusion processes. Unexpectedly, these data sets reveal phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 during sexual development, which we establish requires TORC1 activity. We demonstrate that TORC1 is re-activated by pheromone signaling, in a manner that does not require autophagy. Mutants with low TORC1 re-activation exhibit compromised mating and poorly viable spores. Thus, while inactivated to initiate the mating process, TORC1 is reactivated by pheromone signaling in starved cells to support sexual reproduction.

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vasculitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

                Background Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects a significant proportion of the global population, posing a major public health challenge. In recent years, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mental health diagnosis has garnered increasing attention. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on AI-based approaches for depression diagnosis, identifying both advancements and gaps in the literature that can guide future studies. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted across leading research databases to identify relevant studies published up to July 2024. A combination of automated and manual filtering was employed to refine the initial set of records. Eligibility criteria were applied to ensure that only studies directly addressing the use of AI for depression diagnosis were included in the final analysis. Results The initial search yielded 1,179 records. Following a rigorous selection process, 145 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review. These studies represent a diverse array of AI techniques and data sources, with a predominant focus on supervised learning algorithms. The most common data sources were social networks, followed by clinical data integrated with psychological assessments. Conclusion The results highlight the growing interest in leveraging AI for depression diagnosis, particularly through the use of supervised learning methods. Social network data has emerged as the most frequently used data source, though clinical data combined with validated psychological tests remains a key area of focus. Despite these advancements, several challenges persist, including data availability and quality, which present opportunities for future research to improve diagnostic accuracy and generalizability.

                Background The Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy was a very strict policy for COVID-19 response in the Chinese mainland, with the overarching goal of preventing imported infections and domestic flare-ups. Policy and implications The dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy has long been criticized by European and American politicians for the issue of human rights. There are some points that need to be considered with regard to these criticisms: Firstly, the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy protected millions of Chinese people from death, the outcomes of China’s COVID-19 response demonstrated the correctness and suitability of the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy, and the policy benefited the world. Secondly, freedom and health were generally conflicted and extremely difficult to be compatible in the COVID-19 pandemic, and the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy indeed exhibited several advantages in the fight against COVID-19. Thirdly, China struggled to spare no effort to save lives all the time during the COVID-19 pandemic under the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. Recommendations Appropriate restrictions on freedom and human rights are justified to protect public health and prevent harm to others in the COVID-19 pandemic, and an important premise is that the implement of these restrictions are based on law. Conclusions In summary, it is biased to censure the Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy or abandonment of the Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy based on human rights, and the great achievement of the policy and China’s efforts to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic should not be ignored.

                Background ELIXIR is a pan-European public-funded research infrastructure dedicated to life science data. As such, it must demonstrate public value to its funders and stakeholders. We present methods to inventory research publications linked to ELIXIR that have received funding and support, as well as related citation metrics, used as performance metrics for these audiences. Methods To overcome challenges inherent in ELIXIR’s distributed structure, and the fact that those publishing ELIXIR-supported work are typically working part-time on ELIXIR matters, a semi-automated approach, consisting of text-mining followed by manual curation, is presented. A country-level case study (ELIXIR Italy) refines and expands the methods, notably by introducing more granularity in the curation process (e.g. considering all national-level grants, examining affiliations to report publication per institute) and by additionally looking at the scientific impact of the resources developed and operated by the Italian Node of ELIXIR. Results Overall, the methods described in this article have shown to: (1) be repeatable with acceptable levels of accuracy and consistency (notably across curators); (2) require reasonable effort in terms of curation of monthly ‘harvests’ of publications (obtained by text-mining); and (3) to be well-adapted to ELIXIR’s distributed nature. Conclusions Concrete examples are provided of downstream uses of the inventoried publications and their citations, both for ELIXIR as a whole and for the Italian case study. Limitations of the methods are discussed, particularly the challenges associated with using an ‘Open literature’ database (Europe PMC) for the text-mining, and the constraints related to curation capacity. The methods, along with the valuable lessons learned during their development, are sufficiently generic and pragmatic enough to be readily adapted by other similar research infrastructures.

                Background Rational prescription writing is an important skill to master during internship. This Quality Improvement (QI) project aimed to understand the state of prescription writing among interns posted in the Department of Psychiatry, analyze the causes responsible for errors in prescription writing and bring about a change in the current practice. Methods The MBBS interns are posted in the Department of Psychiatry for 15 days. During day 1 to day 5 of their posting, a pre intervention phase was conducted wherein prescriptions written by interns in the Department of Psychiatry were collected. The prescriptions were scored based on 14 criteria which were selected based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and Medical Council of India (MCI) ideal prescription format. During PDSA (Plan Do Study Act) Cycle 1, an educational handout was distributed to the interns containing the MCI ideal prescription format and WHO guidelines regarding prescription writing. The brochure was also verbally explained to the interns. From day 7 to day 15 of their posting, prescriptions written by the interns were collected. The prescriptions were scored using the same criteria. Results During the pre intervention phase the mean total score of prescriptions was 9.54 ± 1.003. There was a significant improvement in the mean total score to 10.26 ± 0.746. There was a 7.54% improvement. There was also a significant improvement in several individual criteria. Conclusions The first PDSA cycle was successful in improving the quality of prescription writing among interns posted in the Department of Psychiatry. There is a need to implement more PDSA cycles to improve the quality still further.

                Background Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a progressive neurovascular-degenerative condition without specific treatment that causes lacunar stroke, most intracerebral haemorrhage, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and several neuropsychiatric conditions. Objectives To conduct a rapid multi-stage scoping review to identify licensed interventions that could be repurposed for testing in cSVD at phase-3. Methods First, we screened preclinical studies of potential relevance to cSVD and used a drug dictionary to identify studies of potential interventions. Separately, we screened clinical studies of relevance to cSVD and VCI. Following merging, we removed drugs that were unsuitable or impractical to assess long-term in the UK. We then performed mini-meta-analyses for shortlisted interventions assessing effects on cognition and scored these for their relevance to cSVD. Results The preclinical review created a long-list of 1,757 deduplicated interventions. Those that were not available in the UK, not expensive or impractical to administer long-term were merged with 62 interventions identified from 75 relevant clinical studies to create a medium-list of 52 interventions. Focussed literature review short-listed ten interventions for review by an independent scientific advisory group; they ranked three as most suitable for immediate testing: metformin, tadalafil and isosorbide mononitrate. Conclusion This rapid review identified three interventions that are suitable for testing in a late phase-3 (platform) trial involving patients with cSVD. The approach could be improved with partial automation, text mining and generative pre-trained transformer approaches which would help manage the large data volumes. Further, our data-driven approach could be combined with genetic or other mechanistic methods to further de-risk future trials.

                ADNP is a multifunctional protein involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, and microtubule interaction, playing a critical role in brain development, with mutations linked to ADNP-Related Disorder. Here we have characterized seven ADNP commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

<p>The homeobox transcription factor Engrailed1 was crucial for the survival of PV neurons.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Homeobox transcription factor Engrailed1 (En1) is expressed in the ectoderm and mediates the establishment of retinotectal topography, but its role in eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation and visual function remains unclear. Parvalbumin (PV) neurons, which are widely distributed in the visual pathway, play a crucial role in visual development and function. In this study, we conditionally knocked out En1 gene in PV neurons and found an expansion of the ipsilateral eye projection, while no significant effects were observed in the contralateral eye projection. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the number of PV neurons in PV-Cre:En1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, accompanied by an increased level of cleaved caspase-3 in PV neurons. Furthermore, the genetic ablation of PV neurons in the retina through intraocular AAV-DIO-Caspase3 injection in PV-Cre mice was sufficient to disrupt retinogeniculate segregation. Finally, we observed that PV-Cre:En1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice exhibited enhanced visual depth perception in the visual cliff test. These results demonstrate that En1 in PV neurons participates in eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation through cell survival and regulates binocular vision.</p>

                Abstract The comorbidity due to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health problem, but its mechanism remains unclear. It is suspected that hyperglycemic alteration of the immune response to TB and the composition of the lung microbiota play an important role. This scoping review aimed to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by mapping evidence on the effect of hyperglycemia on physical health indicators, immune cell counts, cytokine levels, and the composition of lung microbiota in patients with the DM-TB comorbidity. A systematic search for research articles about the relationship between hyperglycemia and physical health, immune cells, and cytokine levels in humans was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus. Then, articles on the interactions between the immune cells, cytokines, and lung microbiota were identified through Google Scholar and Google search engines. Characteristics of the studies focusing on effects of hyperglycemia, the findings of the articles relevant to the research objectives, and strengths and weaknesses of the selected articles were charted in a data extraction tool. Twenty-one articles on the effects of hyperglycemia on immune mediators and health outcomes of patients with DM-TB were included. The evidence showed hyperglycemia to be associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes; altered counts and functioning of dendritic cells, monocytes, and CD4+ T cells; and changes in cytokine levels (mainly INF-γ, IL-17, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) in patients with DM-TB. The composition of the lung microbiota changed in correlation with changes in physical health outcomes, counts of immune cells, and cytokine levels. Thus, hyperglycemia, immune responses, and dysbiosis of the lung microbiota are integral in the pathogenesis of DM-TB and TB treatment outcomes. A prospective cohort study, especially in individuals with newly diagnosed DM versus known DM and concomitant latent TB versus active TB, is recommended to define causal relationships.

                Background Dental professionals are exposed to either high level of noise which often becomes annoying over a time, and it is largely related to turbines and suctions used during the procedure. We performed this study with an aim to know the need for efforts to reduce impact of noise on young. Methods The study group comprised of 102 dentists (53 males and 49 females) final year dental students, interns and board students of family dentistry, endodontics, prosthodontics was enrolled. The noise assessment device is switched on to know the base noise level in the clinics and to know hearing ability of the dentist through a pre – recorded verbal communication. When the dentist starts the procedure, the same verbal communication is re-introduced and based on his reaction the decibel level is increased to a point where he can understand it. The same is followed after the procedure. Results Using T – test the age and gender mean was assessed, while ANNOVA test was used to know the hearing impairment and its mean before, during and after procedure. We have found that there is an imminent increase of sound during the procedure and thereby associated impairment; which continues but to a lesser decibel level even after the procedure is completed for long time. Discussion and Conclusion We have highlighted few guidelines from various studies which range from reducing multiple turbine usage at a given point of treatment wherever possible to a recommendation to use ear plugs for those procedures related to high noise levels.

                Background This mixed-method action research study explores the impact of a gamified virtual learning tool on elementary students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) skills in English language acquisition. Despite the acknowledged importance of SRL in educational contexts, limited research exists on its development among young learners. The present study is one of the products of the academic unit project “Key Factors and Essential Elements for a Comprehensive Model of Bilingual Education: A Multidimensional Approach for Diverse Contexts and Areas of Knowledge” sponsored by the School of Education at Universidad de La Sabana, institution where the first author conducted her master’s studies, and the corresponding author is a professor and main researcher of the of the academic unit project. Method Six students aged 8-10 participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured observations and pre- and post-questionnaires. The tool was designed based on Zimmerman’s SRL model and included tasks structured through gamification elements. For the purpose of quantitative data analysis, descriptive statistics were used; as for qualitative data, thematic analysis was the chosen approach. Results The results revealed that guided use of the gamified tool significantly enhanced students’ use of SRL strategies, particularly in goal setting, monitoring progress, and reflecting on learning outcomes. Students demonstrated increased motivation, engagement, and confidence, although explicit instruction was required to maximize the tool’s benefits. The usability of the tool was rated positively, with participants highlighting its effectiveness for language learning and SRL skill development. Conclusions The study concludes that gamified virtual environments can effectively promote SRL skills in young language learners by fostering motivation and engagement. However, for optimal outcomes, such tools should be supplemented with explicit instruction in SRL strategies. This research contributes to understanding the integration of gamified tools in elementary education, highlighting their potential to develop foundational skills essential for lifelong learning.

                Drawing from historical accounts, cultural practices, archaeological discoveries, and indigenous technical knowledge, the research presents a critical review of varied aspects of the construction of the Konark temple and presents future research directions. To fulfill the purpose, documents were sourced from Scopus, Google Scholar, and ancient texts and palm leaves. Findings suggest the legacy of Narasimhadeva I, the Hindu monarch who remained undefeated during his reign, safeguarded the kingdom from encroaching Muslim rulers. The narrative highlights the bravery of a faithful elephant that revived the king on the battlefield. The Konark temple was built with the dual purpose of showcasing the glory of his victory and devotion to the Sun God. The ancient artisans’ knowledge, skills, and commitment were crucial in erecting this tallest temple structure. The investigation further illuminates the use of sea routes for transporting monumental stones, the ingenuity in laying the temple’s foundation, the selection of high-grade stones, the monumental task of lifting colossal stones, like the world’s heaviest stone hoisted to a height of about two hundred feet, the use of rust-resistant iron, and the application of advanced astronomical knowledge by ancient artisans. The study provides insights into ancient engineering ingenuity, encouraging further exploration of the enduring legacy of the Konark temple’s construction.

                Background The representation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is disproportionate to graduates from STEM fields. There is limited research addressing challenges facing women retention in STEM in the UAE. Methods A cross-sectional study using a validated questionnaire was conducted. A total of 165 participants were enrolled; 62% males and 35% females. Results More women believed there is gender inequality in STEM (47% versus 28%). 44% of female participants experienced gender inequality in their career. Men were significantly less likely to experience gender inequality (OR=0.06, 95% CI=0.02-0.16). Women reported lack of organizational emphasis on diversity and inclusion for promotion to leadership (44% versus 60%). Conclusion Data confirms gender-based preconceptions and biases in STEM fields. Institutional initiatives and policies to challenge stereotypes and promote gender equality are required. Governmental role is crucial in creating an inclusive environment for women scientists.

                Background/Purpose There are approximately 18.94 million visually impaired children worldwide, with 90% of them living in low-middle income countries. Research shows that visual impairment (VI) has a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of those affected. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how VI affects the daily activities of these children to develop management strategies that can help minimize its impact on their QoL. Therefore, qualitative research design was utilized to explore the perceived impact of VI on the daily activities of children living with VI. Methods Using a qualitative approach, purposive sampling was used to identify information-rich participants to partake in focus group discussions (FGDs) and address the aim of the study adequately. Identified data sources were divided into two groups: one with ‘experts’ who worked with children regularly, and another with school-going children aged 6-17 years, from three rural schools in Sekhukhune district, South Africa. The FGDs were guided by semi-structured interview questions. All sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, cleaned, coded, and analysed under ten domains, identified from the literature. Results A total of 477 statements and comments related to children’s vision were generated through the nine FGDs. Participants were nine experts working with children, and 49 children living with or without VI. Of the total number of statements, 60% (n = 287) were generated from FGDs with children, 63% (n = 299) were negative statements, and the remaining 19% (n = 92), and 18% (n = 86) were neutral and positive statements respectively. The most generated statements fell under the domains ‘Hobbies, Leisure and Sport’ 21% (n = 101), ‘Education’ 21% (n = 100), and ‘Psychological and Emotional’ 12.8% (n = 61). Conclusion This study offered comprehensive insights into the impact of VI on the daily activities of rural school-aged children and young people.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ground-breaking research of patient H.M. brought to light the importance of the hippocampus for our memories of everyday and special events. Three quarters of a century of intense neurobiological and neuropsychological research would follow as scientists sought to understand why the hippocampus is such an important memory structure in the brain. Navigating a career during this time required adaptive research strategies as new evidence emerged. Although exciting progress has been made, complex challenges remain.</p>
