              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Nuclear Factor I in neurons, glia and during the formation of Müller glia‐derived progenitor cells in avian, porcine and primate retinas</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The regenerative potential of Müller glia (MG) is extraordinary in fish, poor in chick and terrible in mammals. In the chick model, MG readily reprogram into proliferating Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), but neuronal differentiation is very limited. The factors that suppress the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick are slowly being revealed. Isoforms of Nuclear Factor I (NFI) are cell-intrinsic factors that limit neurogenic potential; these factors are required for the formation of MG in the developing mouse retina (Clark et al., 2019) and deletion of these factors reprograms MG into neuron-like cells in mature mouse retina (Hoang et al., 2020). Accordingly, we sought to characterize the patterns of expression NFIs in the developing, mature and damaged chick retina. In addition, we characterized patterns of expression of NFIs in the retinas of large mammals, pigs and monkeys. Using a combination of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunolabeling we probed for patterns of expression. In embryonic chick, levels of NFIs are very low in early E5 (embryonic day 5) retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), up-regulated in E8 RPCs, further up-regulated in differentiating MG at E12 and E15. NFIs are maintained in mature resting MG, microglia and neurons. Levels of NFIs are reduced in activated MG in retinas treated with NMDA and/or insulin+FGF2, and further down-regulated in proliferating MGPCs. However, levels of NFIs in MGPCs were significantly higher than those seen in RPCs. Immunolabeling for NFIA and NFIB closely matched patterns of expression revealed in different types of retinal neurons and glia, consistent with findings from scRNA-seq. In addition, we find expression of NFIA and NFIB through progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone at the far periphery of the retina. We find similar patterns of expression for NFIs in scRNA-seq databases for pig and monkey retinas. Patterns of expression of NFIA and NFIB were validated with immunofluorescence in pig and monkey retinas wherein these factors were predominantly detected in MG and a few types of inner retinal neurons. In summary, NFIA and NFIB are prominently expressed in developing chick retina and by mature neurons and glia in the retinas of chicks, pigs and monkeys. Although levels of NFIs are decreased in chick, in MGPCs these levels remain higher than those seen in neurogenic RPCs. We propose that the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick retina is suppressed by NFIs.</p>

                <p><b>Brain Sciences, Vol. 11, Pages 1459: Working on Cognitive Functions in a Fully Digitalized Multisensory Interactive Room: A New Approach for Intervention in Autism Spectrum Disorders</b></p>
	<p>Brain Sciences <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/11/1459">doi: 10.3390/brainsci11111459</a></p>

	<p>The feasibility of working on cognitive functions with children and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) inside Multisensory Interactive Rooms (MIRs) has been poorly investigated, even if sensory atypicalities are common in ASD and usual intervention rooms could represent a challenging sensory setting for patients with ASD. We hypothesized that the possibility to calibrate the sensory stimulation offered by this type of environment, able to promote a positive emotional state in patients with ASD, can consequently favor the interaction with the therapist and the motivation towards activities targeting cognitive functions. High- and low-functioning children and low-functioning adolescents/adults underwent five sessions in a fully digitalized MIR, working on sustained attention, selective attention, association, single inhibition, receptive communication, verbalization, and turn. We developed specific protocols calibrated for sensory stimulation and difficulty level based on the characteristics of the participants. We found statistically significant improvements in all functions, except association, in the children’s group. Therefore, a fully digitalized MIR seems suitable for intervention on cognitive functions in ASDs, but further investigations are needed to better address possible differences related to age and functioning level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The CKD.QLD data linkage framework: chronic kidney disease and health services utilisation in Queensland, Australia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common chronic diseases in the western world. In Australia, around 1.7 million Australians aged 18 years and over (about one in ten) have indicators of CKD, and 1.8 million hospitalisations were associated with CKD in 2017–18. There is currently very little understanding of the impact of CKD on health service utilisation and costs. Understanding the disease pathways of CKD and its effects on service utilisation and patient outcomes is essential to predicting the course of the disease in the future, its effects on health services utilisation and capacity to better manage the burden of premature deaths or the need for dialysis that results from CKD. We describe the establishment of a data linkage framework to study hospital admissions of CKD patients in the public renal services in the Australian state of Queensland, and its potential to advance understanding of their course and outcomes. Seven years of retrospective data (2011–2018) on hospital-based health services utilisation were provided by Queensland Health for all 7,341 patients who enrolled in the CKD.QLD Registry up to Jan 2019. The data were supplied from three datasets: the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection, the Queensland Registrar General deaths, and the Activity Based Funding Model Output data. In addition, data were supplied from two cohorts of de-identified patients admitted to hospital in the same interval (22,023 patients each), who were not in the CKD.QLD Registry, the first with CKD and the second without CKD as indicated by International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification. The comprehensive and multifaceted data via the data linkage will enable us to identify opportunities for efficiencies in management of patients with CKD and for interventions that improve their outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Post-pandemic e-learning: a pre-protocol to assess the integration of mobile VR and its effect on VARK learning styles [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an abrupt but accelerated shift to e-learning worldwide. Education in a post-pandemic world has to amalgamate the advantages of e-learning with important pedagogical goals associated with in-person teaching. Although various advanced technologies are present at our fingertips today, we are still unable to use their full potential in teaching and learning. In this regard, mobile VR technology is both cost-efficient, versatile and engaging for students. Developing countries have more smartphone users than developed countries, implying that developing countries, like Malaysia, should utilize mobile or cellphones more significantly. With that in mind, we propose here a pre-protocol to investigate learner motivation and levels of engagement for e-learning with smartphone-integrated VR, based on their VARK (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning styles. Proposed methodology: This study intends to use a minimum sample of 30 students from the same age group under the K-12 (particularly grade 9-12) belonging to STEM curriculum. The Google Cardboard VR set will be used as the prime technology for its affordability, easy build feature and variety of available vendors. A mixed-method (survey and activity log/tracking) for data collection is suggested to find the degree of engagement and motivation of the learners’ learning in the mobile VR-assisted e-learning context. The students will be taught a topic using the mobile VR and then be assessed through simple classroom quizzes to assess how well they grasped the concept. The data collected through activity logs (while teaching the topic in mobile VR) and questionnaires will be mapped to each individual learner and organized in a data repository. Further visualization, analysis and investigation will be performed using Smart PLS, Python or R language. Conclusions: The study aims to provide context for smartphone and software companies to develop technologies that could facilitate learner engagement during the post-pandemic state.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PEGS: An efficient tool for gene set enrichment within defined sets of genomic intervals [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Many biological studies of transcriptional control mechanisms produce lists of genes and non-coding genomic intervals from corresponding gene expression and epigenomic assays. In higher organisms, such as eukaryotes, genes may be regulated by distal elements, with these elements lying 10s–100s of kilobases away from a gene transcription start site. To gain insight into these distal regulatory mechanisms, it is important to determine comparative enrichment of genes of interest in relation to genomic regions of interest, and to be able to do so at a range of distances. Existing bioinformatics tools can annotate genomic regions to nearest known genes, or look for transcription factor binding sites in relation to gene transcription start sites. Here, we present PEGS (Peak set Enrichment in Gene Sets). This tool efficiently provides an exploratory analysis by calculating enrichment of multiple gene sets, associated with multiple non-coding elements (peak sets), at multiple genomic distances, and within topologically associated domains. We apply PEGS to gene sets derived from gene expression studies, and genomic intervals from corresponding ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq experiments to derive biologically meaningful results. We also demonstrate an extended application to tissue-specific gene sets and publicly available GWAS data, to find enrichment of sleep trait associated SNPs in relation to tissue-specific gene expression profiles.

                Background: Several studies have resulted in controversial data about the recurrence or new incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C who were treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).   Aim: This observational study aimed to assess the occurrence rate of HCC in patients who developed a sustained virological response (SVR).. METHOD:  A six-month prospective study was done at the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute [NHTMRI] in Cairo, Egypt on 150 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin. Patients were assigned into two groups according to their laboratory values to either receive sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (S/D/R) or receive only sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (S/D). The main outcome measure was the occurrence of HCC. Results: SVR-12 was 100%. 8.5% of patients developed HCC in the S/D/R group, while 0% in the S/D group. Conclusion:  New incidence or recurrence of HCC may occur in CHC genotype 4 cirrhotic patients receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (difficult to treat) although achieving SVR. The cause of HCC development in this study is cirrhosis, not the administered DAAs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 and the role of orofecal transmission: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are of key public health importance. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of some COVID-19 patients, suggesting the possibility that the virus could, in addition to droplet and fomite transmission, be transmitted via the orofecal route. Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO COVID-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings. Where necessary, authors are contacted for further details on the content of their articles. Results: We include searches up until 20 December 2020. We included 110 relevant studies: 76 primary observational studies or reports, and 35 reviews (one cohort study also included a review) examining the potential role of orofecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Of the observational studies, 37 were done in China. A total of 48 studies (n=9,081 patients) reported single cases, case series or cohort data on individuals with COVID-19 diagnosis or their contacts and 46 (96%) detected binary RT-PCR with 535 out of 1358 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 (average 39.4%). The results suggest a long duration of fecal shedding, often recorded after respiratory samples tested negative, and symptoms of gastrointestinal disease were reported in several studies. Twenty-nine studies reported finding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, river water or toilet areas. Six studies attempted viral culture from COVID-19 patients’ fecal samples: culture was successful in 3 of 6 studies, and one study demonstrated invasion of the virus into intestinal epithelial cells. Conclusions: Varied observational and mechanistic evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can infect and be shed from the gastrointestinal tract, including some data demonstrating viral culture in fecal samples. To fully assess these risks, quantitative data on infectious virus in these settings and infectious dose are needed.

                Bezoars are an undigested mass causing an intraluminal obstruction in children.  Pharmacobezoars are formed from medicines or their vehicle, considered as a less frequent type observed in children. Our objective is to report a relatively rare entity as a potential cause of intestinal obstruction in children.  Here we report a case of 13-year-old girl with a history of herbal medicine intake who presented with persistent vomiting and abdominal distension. She was diagnosed with acute intestinal obstruction and managed conservatively without any complications. The patient became stable within two days so was discharged home. We found that ineffective history could lead to a delay in diagnosis and management. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for pica and psychiatric disorders, especially in adolescent children.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Burst control: Synaptic conditions for burst generation in cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eilam Goldenberg Leleo, Idan Segev</p>

The output of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) is expressed by a train of single spikes with intermittent bursts of multiple spikes at high frequencies. The bursts are the result of nonlinear dendritic properties, including Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and NMDA spikes, that interact with the ~10,000 synapses impinging on the neuron’s dendrites. Output spike bursts are thought to implement key dendritic computations, such as coincidence detection of bottom-up inputs (arriving mostly at the basal tree) and top-down inputs (arriving mostly at the apical tree). In this study we used a detailed nonlinear model of L5PC receiving excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to explore the conditions for generating bursts and for modulating their properties. We established the excitatory input conditions on the basal versus the apical tree that favor burst and show that there are two distinct types of bursts. Bursts consisting of 3 or more spikes firing at < 200 Hz, which are generated by stronger excitatory input to the basal versus the apical tree, and bursts of ~2-spikes at ~250 Hz, generated by prominent apical tuft excitation. Localized and well-timed dendritic inhibition on the apical tree differentially modulates Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and NMDA spikes and, consequently, finely controls the burst output. Finally, we explored the implications of different burst classes and respective dendritic inhibition for regulating synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Spatial subsidies drive sweet spots of tropical marine biomass production</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Renato A. Morais, Alexandre C. Siqueira, Patrick F. Smallhorn-West, David R. Bellwood</p>

Spatial subsidies increase local productivity and boost consumer abundance beyond the limits imposed by local resources. In marine ecosystems, deeper water and open ocean subsidies promote animal aggregations and enhance biomass that is critical for human harvesting. However, the scale of this phenomenon in tropical marine systems remains unknown. Here, we integrate a detailed assessment of biomass production in 3 key locations, spanning a major biodiversity and abundance gradient, with an ocean-scale dataset of fish counts to predict the extent and magnitude of plankton subsidies to fishes on coral reefs. We show that planktivorous fish-mediated spatial subsidies are widespread across the Indian and Pacific oceans and drive local spikes in biomass production that can lead to extreme productivity, up to 30 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. Plankton subsidies form the basis of productivity “sweet spots” where planktivores provide more than 50% of the total fish production, more than all other trophic groups combined. These sweet spots operate at regional, site, and smaller local scales. By harvesting oceanic productivity, planktivores bypass spatial constraints imposed by local primary productivity, creating “oases” of tropical fish biomass that are accessible to humans.

<p>High quality 3D reconstructions of mitochondria were generated using serial TEM tomography images of axonal and presynaptic mitochondria, producing minimal distortion from the original images. The resulting in-silico representations were subsequently quantified by differential geometry methods in terms of curvatures, surface areas, volumes, and membrane motifs, all of which can alter the metabolic output of the organelle. These methods enable structural motifs to be identified across the sampled population, presenting useful information for future physiological modeling of neuronal mitochondria.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the highly dynamic metabolic landscape of a neuron, mitochondrial membrane architectures can provide critical insight into the unique energy balance of the cell. Current theoretical calculations of functional outputs like adenosine triphosphate and heat often represent mitochondria as idealized geometries, and therefore, can miscalculate the metabolic fluxes. To analyze mitochondrial morphology in neurons of mouse cerebellum neuropil, 3D tracings of complete synaptic and axonal mitochondria were constructed using a database of serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tomography images and converted to watertight meshes with minimal distortion of the original microscopy volumes with a granularity of 1.64 nanometer isotropic voxels. The resulting in-silico representations were subsequently quantified by differential geometry methods in terms of the mean and Gaussian curvatures, surface areas, volumes, and membrane motifs, all of which can alter the metabolic output of the organelle. Finally, we identify structural motifs present across this population of mitochondria, which may contribute to future modeling studies of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism in neurons.</p>

                Using in vivo two-photon imaging from the ventral surface of the brain, Roy et al. show that the systemic homeostatic challenge of acute salt loading evokes activity-dependent vasoconstrictions in the SON. This causes a hypoxic, pro-excitatory milieu, which induces positive feedback excitation of VP neuronal activity during the homeostatic challenge.

                Using three gene replacement strategies, Salinas-Luypaert et al. demonstrate that CENP-AK124ub is not essential for CENP-A function at centromeres. Thus, functional tags do not mask the role of K124 when it is mutated. These strategies can be employed to interrogate posttranslational modifications at the centromere and other cellular locations.

                Heterochromatin establishment requires distinct nucleation and spreading steps. Murawska et al. show that the conserved and essential histone chaperone FACT facilitates the heterochromatin spreading process by maintaining low heterochromatic histone turnover, which enables a productive H3K9 trimethylation step by the methyltransferase Clr4 in fission yeast.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The endocytic pathway taken by cationic substances requires Rab14 but not Rab5 and Rab7</a></h4>

              
                Cells can engulf material brought to acidic degradative vesicles marked with the Lamp1 protein. Trofimenko et al. identify an endocytic pathway moving cationic substances to Lamp1-positive vesicles that are non-acidic and probably nondegradative. This pathway requires Rab14, unlike classical endocytosis that is regulated by Rab5 and Rab7.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Quantal Ca2+ release mediated by very few IP3 receptors that rapidly inactivate allows graded responses to IP3</a></h4>

              
                Rossi et al. define mechanisms for IP3-evoked quantal Ca2+ release that reconcile response termination with undiminished sensitivity to further IP3 additions. They show that responses require very few IP3 receptors that rapidly open and then inactivate, allowing graded responses despite the ability of IP3 receptors to propagate regenerative Ca2+ signals.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">FARP1, ARHGEF39, and TIAM2 are essential receptor tyrosine kinase effectors for Rac1-dependent cell motility in human lung adenocarcinoma</a></h4>

              
                Cooke et al. identify FARP1, ARHGEF39, and TIAM2 as key drivers of motility signaling in lung adenocarcinoma cells in response to the stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors (EGFR, c-MET, AXL). These Rac-GEFs operate in a non-redundant manner by controlling distinctive aspects of ruffle dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Impaired glucocorticoid receptor expression in liver disrupts feeding-induced gene expression, glucose uptake, and glycogen storage</a></h4>

              
                Præstholm et al. show that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) controls a subset of temporally expressed genes in the liver. This includes many feeding-induced genes, such as Gck, encoding the glucokinase, a key enzyme in glucose metabolism. Acute GR disruption ultimately leads to reduced hepatic glucose uptake and storage.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Regulatory T cell differentiation is controlled by αKG-induced alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and lipid homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Matias et al. show that naive T cell differentiation to a suppressive Treg fate is attenuated by ectopic α-ketoglutarate. Alterations in the cell’s DNA methylation profile, associated with increased oxidative phosphorylation and lipidome-wide remodeling, results in an inflammatory Th1-like phenotype. Inhibition of triacylglyceride synthesis restores Treg differentiation, decreasing inflammatory gene expression.

                Hempelmann et al. analyze effects of anti-VSG nanobodies (Nbs) on African trypanosomes. Employing techniques spanning structural biology and cellular dynamics, they identify one Nb that binds with high affinity and causes molecular crowding, resulting in a perturbation of protein diffusion and cell motility with shedding of the surface coat.

                Recognition of non-self antigens, including gut microbiota, occurs through MHC class II genes found on specific immune cells. MHC class II is also present on intestinal epithelial cells. Stephens et al. show that its loss on epithelia affects microbiota and immune repertoire, and that MHC class II can be transferred from epithelia to underlying immune cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia ferroptosis is prevalent in neurodegenerative disease and regulated by SEC24B</a></h4>

              
                Iron dysregulation has been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinsons Disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). One prominent feature of affected brain regions are iron-loaded microglia, but how iron overload influences microglia physiology and disease response is poorly understood. Here we show that microglia are highly susceptible to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. In a tri-culture of human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, under ferroptosis-inducing conditions, microglia undergo a drastic shift in cell state, with increased ferritin levels, disrupted glutathione homeostasis, and altered cytokine signaling. Similar ferroptosis-associated signature (FAS) microglia were uncovered in PD, and the signature was also found in a large cohort of PD patient blood samples, raising the possibility that ferroptosis can be identified clinically. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen which revealed a novel regulator of ferroptosis, the vesicle trafficking gene SEC24B. A small molecule screen also nominated several candidates which blocked ferroptosis, some of which are already in clinical use. These data suggest that ferroptosis sits at the interface of cell death and inflammation, and inhibition of this process in microglia and other brain cells may provide new ways for treating neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple and Dissociable Effects of Sensory History on Working-Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                Behavioural reports of sensory information are biased by stimulus history. The nature and direction of such serial-dependence biases can differ between experimental settings - both attractive and repulsive biases towards previous stimuli have been observed. How and when these biases arise in the human brain remains largely unexplored. They could occur either via a change in sensory processing itself, post-perceptual maintenance or decision-making processes, or both. Here, we analysed behavioural and magnetoencephalographic data from a working-memory task in which participants were sequentially presented with two randomly oriented gratings, one of which was cued for recall at the end of the trial. Behavioural responses showed evidence for two distinct biases: 1) a within-trial repulsive bias away from the previously encoded orientation on the same trial, and 2) a between-trial attractive bias towards the task-relevant orientation on the previous trial. Multivariate classification of stimulus orientation revealed that neural representations during stimulus encoding were biased away from the previous grating orientation, regardless of whether we considered the within- or between-trial prior orientation - despite opposite effects on behaviour. These results suggest that repulsive biases occur at the level of sensory processing and can be overturned at post-perceptual stages to result in attractive biases in behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of upgrading acquisition-techniques and harmonization methods: A multi-modal MRI study with implications for longitudinal designs</a></h4>

              
                A downside of upgrading MRI acquisition sequences is the discontinuity of technological homogeneity of the MRI data. It hampers combining new and old datasets, especially in a longitudinal design. Characterizing upgrading effects on multiple brain parameters and examining the efficacy of harmonization methods are essential. This study investigated the upgrading effects on three structural parameters, including cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), cortical volume (CV), and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) collected from 64 healthy volunteers. We used two evaluation metrics, Cohen's d and classification accuracy, to quantify the effects. In classification analyses, we built classifiers for differentiating the protocols from brain parameters. We investigated the efficacy of three harmonization methods, including traveling subject (TS), TS-ComBat, and ComBat methods, and the sufficient number of participants for eliminating the effects on the evaluation metrics. Finally, we performed age prediction as an example to confirm that harmonization methods retained biological information. The results without harmonization methods revealed small to large mean Cohen's d values on brain parameters (CT:0.85, SA:0.66, CV:0.68, and rs-FC:0.24) with better classification accuracy (>92% accuracy). With harmonization methods, Cohen's d values approached zero. Classification performance reached the chance level with TS-based techniques when data from less than 26 participants were used for estimating the effects, while the Combat method required more participants. Furthermore, harmonization methods improved age prediction performance, except for the ComBat method. These results suggest that acquiring TS data is essential to preserve the continuity of MRI data.

                Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a severe X-linked intellectual and psychomotor disability disorder accompanied by abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) levels. AHDS is caused by inactivating mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), a specific TH transporter widely expressed in the central nervous system. MCT8 gene mutations cause impaired transport of TH across brain barriers, leading to insufficient neural TH supply. There is currently no successful therapy for the neurological symptoms. AAV9-based gene therapy is a promising approach to treat monogenic neurological disorders. Here, the potential of this approach was tested in the well-established double knockout (dKO) Mct8-/y; Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1c1 (Oatp1c1)-/- mouse model of AHDS, which displays disease-relevant neurological and TH phenotypes. Systemic intravenous delivery of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-MCT8 at a juvenile stage led to improved locomotor and cognitive function, as well as rescue of T3-brain content and T3-related gene expression. This preclinical study indicates that this gene therapy may improve the neurological symptoms of AHDS patients.

                Capturing individual differences in cognitive abilities is central to human neuroscience. Yet our ability to estimate cognitive abilities via brain MRI is still poor in both prediction and reliability. Our study tested if this inability was partly due to the over-reliance on 1) non-task MRI modalities and 2) single modalities. We directly compared predictive models comprising of different sets of MRI modalities (e.g., task vs. non-task). Using the Human Connectome Project (n=873 humans, 473 females, after exclusions), we integrated task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) across seven tasks along with other non-task MRI modalities (structural MRI, resting-state functional connectivity) via a machine-learning, stacking approach. The model integrating all modalities provided unprecedented prediction (r=.581) and excellent test-retest reliability (ICC>.75) in capturing general cognitive abilities. Importantly, comparing to the model integrating among non-task modalities (r=.367), integrating tfMRI across tasks led to significantly higher prediction (r=.544) while still providing excellent test-retest reliability (ICC>.75). The model integrating tfMRI across tasks was driven by areas in the frontoparietal network and by tasks that are cognition-related (working-memory, relational processing, and language). This result is consistent with the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence. Accordingly, our results sharply contradict the recently popular notion that tfMRI is not appropriate for capturing individual differences in cognition. Instead, our study suggests that tfMRI, when used appropriately (i.e., by drawing information across the whole brain and across tasks and by integrating with other modalities), provides predictive and reliable sources of information for individual differences in cognitive abilities, more so than non-task modalities.

                Understanding brain structure-function relationships, and their development and evolution, is central to neuroscience research. Here, we show that morphological differences in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a hub of functional brain networks, predict individual differences in macroanatomical, microstructural, and functional features of PCC. Manually labeling 4,319 sulci in 552 hemispheres, we discovered a consistently localized shallow cortical indentation (termed the inframarginal sulcus; ifrms) within PCC that is absent from neuroanatomical atlases, yet co-localized with a region within the cognitive control, but not default mode, network. Morphological analyses in humans and chimpanzees showed that unique properties of the ifrms differ across the lifespan and between hominoid species. Intriguingly, the consistency of the ifrms also debunks the uniqueness of the morphology of Einstein's PCC. These findings support a classic theory that shallow, tertiary sulci serve as landmarks in association cortices. They also beg the question: how many other cortical indentations have we missed?

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explaining heterogeneity in medial entorhinal cortex with task-driven neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) supports a wide range of navigational and memory related behaviors. Well-known experimental results have revealed specialized cell types in MEC --- e.g. grid, border, and head-direction cells --- whose highly stereotypical response profiles are suggestive of the role they might play in supporting MEC functionality. However, the majority of MEC neurons do not exhibit stereotypical firing patterns. How should the response profiles of these more "heterogeneous" cells be described, and how do they contribute to behavior? In this work, we took a computational approach to addressing these questions. We first performed a statistical analysis that shows that heterogeneous MEC cells are just as reliable in their response patterns as the more stereotypical cell types, suggesting that they have a coherent functional role. Next, we evaluated a spectrum of candidate models in terms of their ability to describe the response profiles of both stereotypical and heterogeneous MEC cells. We found that recently developed task-optimized neural network models are substantially better than traditional grid cell-centric models at matching most MEC neuronal response profiles --- including those of grid cells themselves --- despite not being explicitly trained for this purpose. Specific choices of network architecture (such as gated nonlinearities and an explicit intermediate place cell representation) have an important effect on the ability of the model to generalize to novel scenarios, with the best of these models closely approaching the noise ceiling of the data itself. We then performed "in-silica" experiments on this model to address questions involving the relative functional relevance of various cell types, finding that heterogeneous cells are likely to be just as involved in downstream functional outcomes (such as path integration) as grid and border cells. Finally, inspired by recent data showing that, going beyond their spatial response selectivity, MEC cells are also responsive to non-spatial rewards, we introduce a new MEC model that performs reward-modulated path integration. We find that this unified model matches neural recordings across all variable-reward conditions. Taken together, our results point toward a conceptually principled goal-driven modeling approach for moving future experimental and computational efforts beyond overly-simplistic single-cell stereotypes.

                Synapses in the brain exhibit cell-type-specific differences in basal synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we evaluated cell-type-specific differences in the composition of glutamatergic synapses, identifying Btbd11, as an inhibitory interneuron-specific synapse-enriched protein. Btbd11 is highly conserved across species and binds to core postsynaptic proteins including Psd-95. Intriguingly, we show that Btbd11 can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation when expressed with Psd-95, supporting the idea that the glutamatergic post synaptic density in synapses in inhibitory and excitatory neurons exist in a phase separated state. Knockout of Btbd11 from inhibitory interneurons decreased glutamatergic signaling onto parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Further, both in vitro and in vivo, we find that Btbd11 knockout disrupts network activity. At the behavioral level, Btbd11 knockout from interneurons sensitizes mice to pharmacologically induced hyperactivity following NMDA receptor antagonist challenge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha oscillations are involved in localizing touch on hand-held tools</a></h4>

              
                The sense of touch is not restricted to the body but can also extend to external objects. When we use a hand-held tool to contact an object, we feel the touch on the tool and not in the hand holding the tool. The ability to perceive touch on a tool actually extends along its entire surface, allowing the user to accurately localize where it is touched similarly as they would on their body. While the neural mechanisms underlying the ability to localize touch on the body have been largely investigated, those allowing to localize touch on a tool are still unknown. We aimed to fill this gap by recording the EEG signal of participants while they localized tactile stimuli on a hand-held rod. We focused on oscillatory activity in the alpha (7-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) range, as they have been previously linked to distinct spatial codes used to localize touch on the body. Beta activity reflects the mapping of touch in skin-based coordinates, whereas alpha activity reflects the mapping of touch in external space. We found that alpha activity was solely modulated by the location of tactile stimuli applied on a hand-held rod. Source reconstruction suggested that this alpha power modulation was localized in a network of fronto-parietal regions previously implicated in higher-order tactile and spatial processing. These findings are the first to implicate alpha oscillations in tool-extended sensing and suggest an important role for processing touch in external space when localizing touch on a tool.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consequences of endogenous and virally-induced hyperphosphorylated tau on behavior and cognition in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: The locus coeruleus (LC) is one of the earliest brain regions to accumulate hyperphosphorylated tau, but a lack of animal models that recapitulate this pathology has hampered our ability to understand its contributions to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective: We previously reported that TgF344-AD rats, which overexpress mutant human amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1, accumulate early endogenous hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC. Here, we used TgF344-AD rats and a wild-type (WT) human tau virus to interrogate the effects of endogenous hyperphosphorylated rat tau and human tau in the LC on AD-related neuropathology and behavior. Methods: Two-month old TgF344-AD and WT rats received bilateral LC infusions of WT human tau or mCherry control virus driven by the noradrenergic-specific PRSx8 promoter. Rats were subsequently assessed at 6 and 12 months for arousal (sleep latency), anxiety-like behavior (open field, elevated plus maze, novelty-suppressed feeding), passive coping (forced swim task), and learning and memory (Morris water maze and fear conditioning). Hippocampal microglia, astrocyte, and AD pathology were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Results: In general, the effects of age were more pronounced than genotype or treatment; older rats displayed greater hippocampal pathology, took longer to fall asleep, had reduced locomotor activity, floated more, and had impaired cognition compared to younger animals. TgF344-AD rats showed increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired learning and memory. The tau virus had negligible influence on most measures. Conclusion: Effects of hyperphosphorylated tau on AD-like neuropathology and behavioral symptoms were subtle. Further investigation of different forms of tau is warranted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct representation of cue-outcome association by D1 and D2 neurons in the olfactory striatum</a></h4>

              
                Positive and negative associations acquired through olfactory experience are thought to be especially strong and long-lasting. The conserved direct olfactory sensory input to the ventral striatal olfactory tubercle (OT) and its convergence with dense dopaminergic input to the OT could underlie this privileged form of associative memory, but how this process occurs is not well understood. We imaged the activity of the two canonical types of striatal neurons, expressing D1 or D2 type dopamine receptors, in the OT at cellular resolution while mice learned odor-outcome associations ranging from aversive to rewarding. D1 and D2 neurons both responded to rewarding and aversive odors. D1 neurons in the OT robustly and bidirectionally represented odor valence, responding similarly to odors predicting similar outcomes regardless of odor identity. This valence representation persisted even in the absence of an instrumental response to the odors and in the absence of the outcomes, indicating a true transformation of odor sensory information by D1 OT neurons. In contrast, D2 neuronal representation of the odor-outcome associations was weaker, contingent on an instrumental response by the mouse, and D2 neurons were more selective for odor identity than valence. Stimulus valence coding in the OT was not modality invariant, with separate sets of D1 neurons responding to odors and sounds predicting the same outcomes, suggesting that integration of multimodal valence information happens downstream of the OT. Our results point to distinct representation of identity and valence of odor stimuli by D1 and D2 neurons in the OT.

                The common marmoset has emerged as a key primate model in neuroscience. Marmosets are small in size, show great potential as transgenic models and exhibit complex behaviors. These advantages place the marmoset model in the critical gap between rodents and larger primates. Thus, it is necessary to develop technology that enables monitoring and manipulation of the neural circuits underlying the behavior of the marmoset. Here, we present a novel approach to record and optogenetically manipulate neural activity in the awake, behaving marmoset. Our design utilizes a light-weight, 3D printed titanium chamber that can house several high-density silicon probes for semi-chronic recordings, while enabling simultaneous optogenetic stimulation. Surgical procedures are streamlined via custom 3D printed guides and implantation holders. We demonstrate the application of our method by recording multi- and single-unit data from areas V1 and V6 with 192 channels simultaneously, and show for the first time that optogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in area V6 can influence behavior in a detection task. Together, the work presented here will support future studies investigating the neural basis of perception and behavior in the marmoset.

                The human cerebral cortex has tremendous cellular diversity and complex cellular organization that are essential for brain function. How different types of cells are organized and interact with each other in the human cortex, and how cellular organizations and interaction patterns vary across species are, however, unclear. Here, we performed spatially resolved single-cell expression profiling of 4,000 genes in human middle and superior temporal gyrus using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH). We identified >100 neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations with distinct transcriptional signatures, generated a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of these brain regions, and analyzed cell-cell interactions in a cell-type-specific manner. Comparison with the mouse cortex showed conservation in the laminar organization of cells and substantial divergence in cell-cell interactions between human and mouse. Notably, our data revealed a drastic increase in interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the human cortex, uncovered human-specific cell-cell interaction patterns, and identified potential ligand-receptor basis of microglia-neuron interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Silencing neuronal activity is required for developmental circuit remodeling</a></h4>

              
                Postnatal refinement of neuronal connectivity shapes the mature nervous system. Pruning of exuberant connections involves both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms, such as neuronal activity. While the role of neuronal activity in the plasticity of excitatory synapses has been extensively studied, the involvement of inhibition is less clear. Furthermore, the role of activity during stereotypic developmental remodeling, where competition is not as apparent, is not well understood. Here we use the Drosophila mushroom body as a model to show that regulated silencing of neuronal activity is required for developmental axon pruning of the {gamma}-Kenyon cells. We demonstrate that silencing neuronal activity is mechanistically achieved by cell autonomous expression of the inward rectifying potassium channel (irk1) combined with inhibition by the GABAergic APL neuron. These results support the Hebbian-like rule 'use it or lose it', where inhibition can destabilize connectivity and promote pruning while excitability stabilizes existing connections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combination of successor representation-based appetitive learning and individual representation-based aversive learning is a good strategy and can be implemented in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits</a></h4>

              
                While positive reward prediction errors (RPEs) and negative RPEs have equal impacts in the standard reinforcement learning, the brain appears to have distinct neural pathways for learning mainly from either positive or negative feedbacks, such as the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia (BG). Given that distinct pathways may receive inputs unevenly from different neural populations and/or regions, how states or actions are represented can differ between the pathways. We explored whether combined use of different representations, coupled with different learning rates from positive and negative RPEs, has computational benefits. We considered an agent equipped with two learning systems, each of which adopted individual representation (IR) or successor representation (SR) of states. With varying the combination of IR or SR and also the learning rates from positive and negative RPEs in each system, we examined how the agent performed in a certain dynamic reward environment. We found that combination of SR-based system learning mainly from positive RPEs and IR-based system learning mainly from negative RPEs outperformed the other combinations, including IR-only or SR-only cases and the cases where the two systems had the same ratios of positive- and negative-RPE-based learning rates. In the best combination case, both systems show activities of comparable magnitudes with opposite signs, consistent with suggested profiles of BG pathways. These results suggest that particularly combining different representations with appetitive and aversive learning could be an effective learning strategy in a certain dynamic reward environment, and it might actually be implemented in the cortico-BG circuits.

                The nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, is a relatively simple neural system model for measuring the efficiency of information transmission from sensory organ to muscle fiber. With the potential to measure this efficiency, a method is proposed to compare the organization of an idealized neural circuit with a logic gate design. This approach is useful for analysis of a neural circuit that is not tractable to a strictly biological model, and where the assumptions of a logic gate design have applicability. Also, included in the results is an abstract perspective of the electrical-specific synaptic network in the somatic system of the nematode worm.

                Spatially modulated neurons from the rat secondary visual cortex (V2) show grid-like firing patterns during freely foraging in open-field enclosures. However, the remapping of the V2 grid cells is not well understood. Here we report two classes of V2 grid cell populations with distinct remapping properties: one regular class with invariant grid field patterns, and the other bimodal class that has remapping induced by environmental manipulations such as changes in enclosure shape, size, orientation and lighting in a familiar environment. The bimodal V2 grid cell pattern remains stable regardless of the follow-up manipulations, but restores to the original firing pattern upon animal's re-entry into the familiar environment on the next day or from the novel environment. The bimodal V2 grid cells are modulated with theta frequency during the course of remapping and stabilize quickly. We also found conjunctive bistable V2 grid cells with invariant head directional tuning. Overall, our results suggest a new grid cell mechanism in V2 that is different from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid cells.

                Ultrasound has been shown to affect the function of both neurons and non-neuronal cells. However, the underlying molecular machinery has been poorly understood. Here, we show that at least two mechanosensitive proteins act in parallel to generate C. elegans behavioral responses to ultrasound stimuli. We first show that these animals generate reversals in response to a single 10 msec pulse from a 2.25 MHz ultrasound transducer. Next, we show that the pore-forming subunit of the mechanosensitive channel TRP-4, and a DEG/ENaC/ASIC ion channel MEC-4, are both required for this ultrasound-evoked reversal response. Further, the trp-4 mec-4 double mutant shows a stronger behavioral deficit compared to either single mutant. Finally, overexpressing TRP-4 in specific chemosensory neurons can rescue the ultrasound-triggered behavioral deficit in the mec-4 null mutant, suggesting that these two pathways act in parallel. Together, we demonstrate that multiple mechanosensitive proteins likely cooperate to transform ultrasound stimuli into behavioral changes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse operant control of different motor cortex populations during learning</a></h4>

              
                During motor learning, as well as during neuroprosthetic learning, animals learn to control motor cortex activity in order to generate behavior. Two different population of motor cortex neurons, intra-telencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons, convey the resulting cortical signals within and outside the telencephalon. Although a large amount of evidence demonstrates contrasting functional organization among both populations, it is unclear whether the brain can equally learn to control the activity of either class of motor cortex neurons. To answer this question, we used a Calcium imaging based brain-machine interface (CaBMI) and trained different groups of mice to modulate the activity of either IT or PT neurons in order to receive a reward. We found that animals learn to control PT neuron activity faster and better than IT neuron activity. Moreover, our findings show that the advantage of PT neurons is the result of characteristics inherent to this population as well as their local circuitry and cortical depth location. Taken together, our results suggest that motor cortex is optimized to control the activity of pyramidal track neurons, embedded deep in cortex, and relaying motor commands outside of the telencephalon.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multilevel neural gradients reflect transdiagnostic effects of major psychiatric conditions on cortical morphology</a></h4>

              
                It is increasingly recognized that multiple psychiatric conditions are underpinned by shared neural pathways, affecting similar brain systems. Here, we assessed i) shared dimensions of alterations in cortical morphology across six major psychiatric conditions (autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) and ii) carried out a multiscale neural contextualization, by cross-referencing shared anomalies against cortical myeloarchitecture and cytoarchitecture, as well as connectome and neurotransmitter organization. Pooling disease-related effects on MRI-based cortical thickness measures across six ENIGMA working groups, including a total of 28,546 participants (12,876 patients and 15,670 controls), we computed a shared disease dimension on cortical morphology using principal component analysis that described a sensory-fugal pattern with paralimbic regions showing the most consistent abnormalities across conditions. The shared disease dimension was closely related to cortical gradients of microstructure and intrinsic connectivity, as well as neurotransmitter systems, specifically serotonin and dopamine. Our findings embed the shared effects of major psychiatric conditions on brain structure in multiple scales of brain organization and may provide novel insights into neural mechanisms into transdiagnostic vulnerability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coherent theta oscillations in the cerebellum and supplementary motor area mediate visuomotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum and its interaction with cortical areas play a key role in our ability to flexibly adapt a motor program in response to sensory input. Current knowledge about specific neural mechanisms underlying the process of visuomotor adaptation is however lacking. Using a novel placement of EEG electrodes to record electric activity from the cerebellum, we studied local cerebellar activity, as well as its coupling with neocortical activity to obtain direct neurophysiological markers of visuomotor adaptation in humans. We found increased theta (4-8Hz) power in cerebellar as well as cortical electrodes, when subjects first encountered a visual perturbation. Theta power decreased as subjects adapted to the perturbation, and rebounded when the perturbation was suddenly removed. This effect was observed in two distinct locations: a cerebellar cluster and a central cluster, which were localized in left cerebellar crus I (lCB) and right supplementary motor area (rSMA) using linear constrained minimum variance beamforming. Importantly, we found that better adaptation was associated with increased theta power in left cerebellar electrodes and a right sensorimotor cortex electrode. Finally, increased rSMA -> lCB connectivity was significantly decreased with adaptation. These results demonstrate that: (1) cerebellar theta power is markedly modulated over the course of visuomotor adaptation and (2) theta oscillations could serve as a key mechanism for communication within a cortico-cerebellar loop.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible circuit mechanisms for context-dependent song sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Many sequenced behaviors, including locomotion, reaching, and vocalization, are patterned differently in different contexts, enabling animals to adjust to their current environments. However, how contextual information shapes neural activity to flexibly alter the patterning of actions is not yet understood. Prior work indicates such flexibility could be achieved via parallel motor circuits, with differing sensitivities to sensory context [1, 2, 3]; instead we demonstrate here how a single neural pathway operates in two different regimes dependent on recent sensory history. We leverage the Drosophila song production system [4] to investigate the neural mechanisms that support male song sequence generation in two contexts: near versus far from the female. While previous studies identified several song production neurons [5, 6, 7, 8], how these neurons are organized to mediate song patterning was unknown. We find that male flies sing 'simple' trains of only one syllable or mode far from the female but complex song sequences consisting of alternations between modes when near to her. We characterize the male song circuit from the brain to the ventral nerve cord (VNC), and find that the VNC song pre-motor circuit is shaped by two key computations: mutual inhibition and rebound excitability [9] between nodes driving the two modes of song. Weak sensory input to a direct brain-to-VNC excitatory pathway (via pC2 brain and pIP10 descending neurons) drives simple song far from the female. Strong sensory input to the same pathway enables complex song production via simultaneous recruitment of P1a neuron-mediated disinhibition of the VNC song pre-motor circuit. Thus, proximity to the female effectively unlocks motor circuit dynamics in the correct sensory context. We construct a compact circuit model to demonstrate that these few computations are sufficient to replicate natural context-dependent song dynamics. These results have broad implications for neural population-level models of context-dependent behavior [10] and highlight that canonical circuit motifs [11, 12, 13] can be combined in novel ways to enable circuit flexibility required for dynamic communication.

	<p>Facial expression is a key aspect in observational scales developed to improve pain assessment in individuals with cognitive impairments. Although these scales are used internationally in individuals with different types of cognitive impairments, it is not known whether observing facial expressions of pain might differ between regions or between different types of cognitive impairments. In a pilot study, facial responses to standardized experimental pressure pain were assessed among individuals with different types of cognitive impairments (dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Huntington’s disease, and intellectual disability) from different countries (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Israel, and Spain) and were analyzed using facial descriptors from the PAIC scale (Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition). We found high inter-rater reliability between observers from different countries. Moreover, facial responses to pain did not differ between individuals with dementia from different countries (Denmark, Germany, and Spain). However, the type of cognitive impairment had a significant impact; with individuals with intellectual disability (all being from Israel) showing the strongest facial responses. Our pilot data suggest that the country of origin does not strongly affect how pain is facially expressed or how facial responses are being scored. However, the type of cognitive impairment showed a clear effect in our pilot study, with elevated facial responses in individuals with intellectual disability.</p>

	<p>Anomia is the most frequent and pervasive symptom for people with aphasia (PWA). Phonological component analysis (PCA) is a therapy incorporating phonological cues to treat anomia. Investigations of neural correlates supporting improvements following PCA remain scarce. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) as a marker of therapy-induced neuroplasticity has been reported by our team. The present study explores the efficacy of PCA in French and associated therapy-induced neuroplasticity using whole-brain rsFC analysis. Ten PWA participated in a pre-/post-PCA fMRI study with cognitive linguistic assessments. PCA was delivered in French following the standard procedure. PCA led to significant improvement with trained and untrained items. PCA also led to changes in rsFC between distributed ROIs in the semantic network, visual network, and sub-cortical areas. Changes in rsFC can be interpreted within the frame of the visual and phonological nature of PCA. Behavioral and rsFC data changes associated with PCA in French highlight its efficacy and point to the importance of phonological and orthographic cues to consolidate the word-retrieval strategy, contributing to generalization to untrained words.</p>

	<p>Background: This is a retrospective study aimed at assessing the volumetric response, morbidity and failure rates of hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) for definitive focal management of limited brain metastasis. Methods: Patients managed with HFRT for unresected limited metastatic (≤10 lesions) brain disease were entered into an ethics-approved database. Included patients had been deemed unsuitable for surgical resection, and lesions managed with prior radiation therapy were excluded. HFRT was delivered using IMRT or VMAT with 25 Gy or 30 Gy in five fractions. Individual lesions had volumetric assessment performed at three timepoints. The primary endpoint was the change of volume from baseline (GTV0) to one month post-HFRT (GTV1) and to seven months post-HFRT (GTV7). Secondary endpoints were local failure, survival and rates of radiation necrosis. Results: One hundred and twenty-four patients with 233 lesions were managed with HFRT. Median follow-up was 23.5 months with 32 (25.8%) patients alive at censure. Median overall survival was 7.3 months with 36.3% survival at 12 months. Superior survival was predicted by smaller GTV0 (p = 0.003) and increased percentage of volumetric response (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Systemic therapy was delivered to 81.5% of patients. At one month post-HFRT, 206 metastases (88.4%) were available for assessment and at seven months post-HFRT, 118 metastases (50.6%) were available. Median metastasis volume at GTV0 was 1.6 cm3 (range: 0.1–19.1). At GTV1 and GTV7, this reduced to 0.7 cm3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and 0.3 cm3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), respectively, correlating to percentage reductions of 54.9% and 83.3%. No significant predictors of volumetric response following HFRT were identified. Local failure was identified in 4.3% of lesions and radiation necrosis in 3.9%. Conclusion: HFRT is an effective therapy for limited metastatic disease in the brain to maximise initial volumetric response whilst minimising toxicity.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, characterized by persisting symptoms up to 12 weeks after the acute illness, impairs numerous people’s physical and mental health. (2) Methods: 64 inpatients and 79 outpatients, aged under 55 years, with post-acute COVID-19, were evaluated by a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), mental health examination, Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire, post-COVID-19 functional status scale (PCFS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). (3) Results: all inpatients had mild/moderate pulmonary injury during acute COVID-19, in contrast to 37.97% of outpatients. Inpatients who reported an average of 5 persisting symptoms, had, predominantly, level 3 PCFS and a median QoL of 62, compared to outpatients, who reported an average of 3 symptoms, level 1 PCFS and a median QoL score of 70. Increased pulmonary artery pressure was detected in 28.11% of inpatients, compared to 17.72% of outpatients, while diastolic dysfunction was diagnosed in 28.12% of inpatients, in comparison with 20.25% of outpatients (p = 0.02). Abnormal systolic function was assessed in 9.37% of inpatients, and 7.58% of outpatients. According to the HADS depression subscale, 46.87% of inpatients and 27.84% of outpatients had clinical depression. Concomitantly, anxiety was detected in 34.37% of inpatients and 40.5% of outpatients (4) Conclusions: cardiovascular and mental health difficulties were frequently detected in patients with post-acute symptoms of COVID-19, which correlated with the number and intensity of persisting symptoms and reduced QoL scores.</p>

     alt="Secondary thalamic neuroinflammation after focal cortical stroke and traumatic injury mirrors corticothalamic functional connectivity"/>
<p>Focal cortical TBI or stroke in various cortical areas leads to gliosis in the functionally connected thalamocortical nuclei and of the <i>nucleus reticularis thalami</i> (nRT). The dotted line in the prefrontal cortex-injured section indicates that the top and bottom halves of the brain are sourced from different bregma positions in order to display cortical injury and relevant thalamic nuclei together.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While cortical injuries, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neocortical stroke, acutely disrupt the neocortex, most of their consequent disabilities reflect secondary injuries that develop over time. Thalamic neuroinflammation has been proposed to be a biomarker of cortical injury and of the long-term cognitive and neurological deficits that follow. However, the extent to which thalamic neuroinflammation depends on the type of cortical injury or its location remains unknown. Using two mouse models of focal neocortical injury that do not directly damage subcortical structures—controlled cortical impact and photothrombotic ischemic stroke—we found that chronic neuroinflammation in the thalamic region mirrors the functional connections with the injured cortex, and that sensory corticothalamic regions may be more likely to sustain long-term damage than nonsensory circuits. Currently, heterogeneous clinical outcomes complicate treatment. Understanding how thalamic inflammation depends on the injury site can aid in predicting features of subsequent deficits and lead to more effective, customized therapies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From spikes to intercellular waves: Tuning intercellular calcium signaling dynamics modulates organ size control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dharsan K. Soundarrajan, Francisco J. Huizar, Ramezan Paravitorghabeh, Trent Robinett, Jeremiah J. Zartman</p>

Information flow within and between cells depends significantly on calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling dynamics. However, the biophysical mechanisms that govern emergent patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling dynamics at the organ level remain elusive. Recent experimental studies in developing <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal discs demonstrate the emergence of four distinct patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity: Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, tissue-level Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, and a global “fluttering” state. Here, we used a combination of computational modeling and experimental approaches to identify two different populations of cells within tissues that are connected by gap junction proteins. We term these two subpopulations “initiator cells,” defined by elevated levels of Phospholipase C (PLC) activity, and “standby cells,” which exhibit baseline activity. We found that the type and strength of hormonal stimulation and extent of gap junctional communication jointly determine the predominate class of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activity. Further, single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes are stimulated by insulin, while intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves depend on Gαq activity. Our computational model successfully reproduces how the dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients varies during organ growth. Phenotypic analysis of perturbations to Gαq and insulin signaling support an integrated model of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a dynamic reporter of overall tissue growth. Further, we show that perturbations to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling tune the final size of organs. This work provides a platform to further study how organ size regulation emerges from the crosstalk between biochemical growth signals and heterogeneous cell signaling states.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical modelling of human P2X-mediated plasma membrane electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in microglia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alireza Poshtkohi, John Wade, Liam McDaid, Junxiu Liu, Mark Dallas, Angela Bithell</p>

Regulation of cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics is fundamental to microglial function. Temporal and spatial Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes are induced from a complicated signal transduction pathway linked to brain ionic homeostasis. In this paper, we develop a novel biophysical model of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) dynamics in human microglia and evaluate the contribution of purinergic receptors (P2XRs) to both intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> levels in response to agonist/ATP binding. This is the first comprehensive model that integrates P2XRs to predict intricate Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transient responses in microglia. Specifically, a novel compact biophysical model is proposed for the capture of whole-cell patch-clamp currents associated with P2X<sub>4</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, which is composed of only four state variables. The entire model shows that intricate intracellular ion dynamics arise from the coupled interaction between P2X<sub>4</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX), Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> leak channels. Both P2XRs are modelled as two separate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> conductance channels, where the stoichiometry is the removal of one Ca<sup>2+</sup> for the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. Two unique sets of model parameters were determined using an evolutionary algorithm to optimise fitting to experimental data for each of the receptors. This allows the proposed model to capture both human P2X<sub>7</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> data (hP2X<sub>7</sub> and hP2X<sub>4</sub>). The model architecture enables a high degree of simplicity, accuracy and predictability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> dynamics thus providing quantitative insights into different behaviours of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> which will guide future experimental research. Understanding the interactions between these receptors and other membrane-bound transporters provides a step forward in resolving the qualitative link between purinergic receptors and microglial physiology and their contribution to brain pathology.

Although much progress has been made to elucidate the critical biological processes involved in the maturation of young RBCs (reticulocytes) as well as removal of senescent RBCs in the spleen, the underlying mechanisms driving these processes are still obscure. Herein, we perform a computational study to simulate the passage of RBCs through interendothelial slits (IES) in the spleen at different stages of their lifespan and investigate the role of the spleen in facilitating the maturation of reticulocytes and in clearing the senescent RBCs. Our simulations reveal that at the beginning of the RBC life cycle, intracellular non-deformable particles in reticulocytes can be biomechanically expelled from the cell upon passage through IES, an insightful explanation of why this peculiar “pitting” process is spleen-specific. Our results also show that immature RBCs shed surface area by releasing vesicles after crossing IES and progressively acquire the biconcave shape of mature RBCs. These findings likely explain why RBCs from splenectomized patients are significantly larger than those from nonsplenectomized subjects. Finally, we show that at the end of their life span, senescent RBCs are not only retained by IES due to reduced deformability but also become susceptible to mechanical lysis under shear stress. This finding supports the recent hypothesis that transformation into a hemolyzed ghost is a prerequisite for phagocytosis of senescent RBCs. Altogether, our computational investigation illustrates critical biological processes in the spleen that cannot be observed <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro</i> and offer insights into the role of the spleen in the RBC physiology.

In biology, we are often confronted with information-rich, large-scale trajectory data, but exploring and communicating patterns in such data can be a cumbersome task. Ideally, the data should be wrapped with an interactive visualisation in one concise packet that makes it straightforward to create and test hypotheses collaboratively. To address these challenges, we have developed a tool, <i>linus</i>, which makes the process of exploring and sharing 3D trajectories as easy as browsing a website. We provide a python script that reads trajectory data, enriches them with additional features such as edge bundling or custom axes, and generates an interactive web-based visualisation that can be shared online. <i>linus</i> facilitates the collaborative discovery of patterns in complex trajectory data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Nonlinear visuoauditory integration in the mouse superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shinya Ito, Yufei Si, Alan M. Litke, David A. Feldheim</p>

Sensory information from different modalities is processed in parallel, and then integrated in associative brain areas to improve object identification and the interpretation of sensory experiences. The Superior Colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure that plays a critical role in integrating visual, auditory, and somatosensory input to assess saliency and promote action. Although the response properties of the individual SC neurons to visuoauditory stimuli have been characterized, little is known about the spatial and temporal dynamics of the integration at the population level. Here we recorded the response properties of SC neurons to spatially restricted visual and auditory stimuli using large-scale electrophysiology. We then created a general, population-level model that explains the spatial, temporal, and intensity requirements of stimuli needed for sensory integration. We found that the mouse SC contains topographically organized visual and auditory neurons that exhibit nonlinear multisensory integration. We show that nonlinear integration depends on properties of auditory but not visual stimuli. We also find that a heuristically derived nonlinear modulation function reveals conditions required for sensory integration that are consistent with previously proposed models of sensory integration such as spatial matching and the principle of inverse effectiveness.

                <p>by Tania Mendonca, Ana A. Jones, Jose M. Pozo, Sarah Baxendale, Tanya T. Whitfield, Alejandro F. Frangi</p>

A common feature of morphogenesis is the formation of three-dimensional structures from the folding of two-dimensional epithelial sheets, aided by cell shape changes at the cellular-level. Changes in cell shape must be studied in the context of cell-polarised biomechanical processes within the epithelial sheet. In epithelia with highly curved surfaces, finding single-cell alignment along a biological axis can be difficult to automate <i>in silico</i>. We present ‘Origami’, a MATLAB-based image analysis pipeline to compute direction-variant cell shape features along the epithelial apico-basal axis. Our automated method accurately computed direction vectors denoting the apico-basal axis in regions with opposing curvature in synthetic epithelia and fluorescence images of zebrafish embryos. As proof of concept, we identified different cell shape signatures in the developing zebrafish inner ear, where the epithelium deforms in opposite orientations to form different structures. Origami is designed to be user-friendly and is generally applicable to fluorescence images of curved epithelia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A gap-filling algorithm for prediction of metabolic interactions in microbial communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dafni Giannari, Cleo Hanchen Ho, Radhakrishnan Mahadevan</p>

The study of microbial communities and their interactions has attracted the interest of the scientific community, because of their potential for applications in biotechnology, ecology and medicine. The complexity of interspecies interactions, which are key for the macroscopic behavior of microbial communities, cannot be studied easily experimentally. For this reason, the modeling of microbial communities has begun to leverage the knowledge of established constraint-based methods, which have long been used for studying and analyzing the microbial metabolism of individual species based on genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of microorganisms. A main problem of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions is that they usually contain metabolic gaps due to genome misannotations and unknown enzyme functions. This problem is traditionally solved by using gap-filling algorithms that add biochemical reactions from external databases to the metabolic reconstruction, in order to restore model growth. However, gap-filling algorithms could evolve by taking into account metabolic interactions among species that coexist in microbial communities. In this work, a gap-filling method that resolves metabolic gaps at the community level was developed. The efficacy of the algorithm was tested by analyzing its ability to resolve metabolic gaps on a synthetic community of auxotrophic <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains. Subsequently, the algorithm was applied to resolve metabolic gaps and predict metabolic interactions in a community of <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, two species present in the human gut microbiota, and in an experimentally studied community of <i>Dehalobacter</i> and <i>Bacteroidales</i> species of the ACT-3 community. The community gap-filling method can facilitate the improvement of metabolic models and the identification of metabolic interactions that are difficult to identify experimentally in microbial communities.

To survive elevated temperatures, ectotherms adjust the fluidity of membranes by fine-tuning lipid desaturation levels in a process previously described to be cell autonomous. We have discovered that, in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, neuronal heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the conserved master regulator of the heat shock response (HSR), causes extensive fat remodeling in peripheral tissues. These changes include a decrease in fat desaturase and acid lipase expression in the intestine and a global shift in the saturation levels of plasma membrane’s phospholipids. The observed remodeling of plasma membrane is in line with ectothermic adaptive responses and gives worms a cumulative advantage to warm temperatures. We have determined that at least 6 TAX-2/TAX-4 cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated channel expressing sensory neurons, and transforming growth factor ß (TGF-β)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are required for signaling across tissues to modulate fat desaturation. We also find neuronal <i>hsf-1</i> is not only sufficient but also partially necessary to control the fat remodeling response and for survival at warm temperatures. This is the first study to show that a thermostat-based mechanism can cell nonautonomously coordinate membrane saturation and composition across tissues in a multicellular animal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Edge computing for Vehicle to Everything: a short review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications and services have sparked considerable interest as a potential component of future Intelligent Transportation Systems. V2X serves to organise communication and interaction between vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to pedestrians (V2P), and vehicle to networks (V2N). However, having multiple communication channels can generate a vast amount of data for processing and distribution. In addition, V2X services may be subject to performance requirements relating to dynamic handover and low latency communication channels. Good throughput, lower delay, and reliable packet delivery are the core requirements for V2X services.  Edge Computing (EC) may be a feasible option to address the challenge of dynamic handover and low latency to allow V2X information to be transmitted across vehicles. Currently, existing comparative studies do not cover the applicability of EC for V2X. This review explores EC approaches to determine the relevance for V2X communication and services. EC allows devices to carry out part or all of the data processing at the point where data is collected. The emphasis of this review is on several methods identified in the literature for implementing effective EC. We describe each method individually and compare them according to their applicability. The findings of this work indicate that most methods can simulate the EC positioning under predefined scenarios. These include the use of Mobile Edge Computing, Cloudlet, and Fog Computing. However, since most studies are carried out using simulation tools, there is a potential limitation in that crucial data in the search for EC positioning may be overlooked and ignored for bandwidth reduction. The EC approaches considered in this work are limited to the literature on the successful implementation of V2X communication and services. The outcome of this work could considerably help other researchers better characterise EC applicability for V2X communications and services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal diagnosis enables detection of any disease or disability of the fetus during the pregnancy of a woman. Parents whose fetus is found to have a serious disorder from antenatal testing may terminate the pregnancy if it is permitted by the law or continue with the pregnancy to term. However, the chance of terminating a pregnancy may be denied if there is prenatal negligence by the medical practitioner in terms of diagnosis or failure to advise on the test results correctly. The purpose of this research is to examine the possible legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Methods: This study adopts doctrinal legal research in which the researcher examines statutes and decided cases in Malaysia, the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore relating to abortion, wrongful birth and wrongful life claims, in order to determine the legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Results: In Malaysia, abortion following a prenatal diagnosis is only legally possible if the statutory criteria in the Penal Code are met. Abortion is illegal if it is not done for therapeutic purposes. A wrongful birth action brought by a woman who claims to be deprived of the opportunity to terminate her pregnancy may be successful in Malaysia, if it can be proven that a legal abortion could have been performed if not because of the prenatal negligence of the medical practitioner. However, a wrongful life action brought in the child’s name for being allowed to be born with a disability may not be viable since the claim could hardly be established and it is against the public policy. Conclusions: Theoretically, it is possible to bring a wrongful birth action resulted from negligence in prenatal diagnosis successfully in Malaysia, but the chance is relatively slim for wrongful life action.

                Background: FabB (3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 1) is part of the fatty acid synthesis II pathway found in bacteria and a potential target for antibiotics. The enzyme catalyses the Claisen condensation of malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein) with acyl-ACP via an acyl intermediate. Here, we report the crystal structure of the intermediate-mimicking Pseudomonas aeruginosa FabB (PaFabB) C161A variant. Methods: His-tagged PaFabB C161A was expressed in E.coli Rosetta DE3 pLysS cells, cleaved by TEV protease and purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Commercial screens were used to identify suitable crystallization conditions which were subsequently improved to obtain well diffracting crystals. Results: We developed a robust and efficient system for recombinant expression of PaFabB C161A. Conditions to obtain well diffracting crystals were established. The crystal structure of PaFabB C161A was solved by molecular replacement at 1.3 Å resolution. Conclusions: The PaFabB C161A crystal structure can be used as a template to facilitate the design of FabB inhibitors.

                Background: Vitamin D deficiency is seen more frequently in diabetic patients with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of data concerning prediabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy (PN). Therefore, we aimed to study the association of vitamin D deficiency with PN severity and to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on PN in prediabetics. Methods: A case-control study was conducted consisting of 89 prediabetic individuals with PN and a control group of prediabetics without PN, recruited from the outpatient department of the National Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Cairo, Egypt. All patients were screened for PN using clinical examination and Douleur Neuropathique 4 diagnostic questionnaire (DN4). Group A (with PN) was assessed for neuropathic severity using the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). In addition, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, ionized calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour post 75g glucose (2h-PPBG) and lipid profile were measured for both groups. Prediabetic patients with PN were given vitamin D3 200.000 IU IM monthly for three months. After three months, clinical assessment, DN4, SF-MPQ and all laboratory measures were repeated. Results: Vitamin D was not associated with the severity of PN patients. However, supplementation of vitamin D resulted in a highly significant improvement in glycemic parameters , p≤0.001. Interestingly, neuropathy score and severity before vitamin D supplementation were (6.4±1.6 and 28.3±7.2) and after became (2.5±0.9 and 17±6.3, p≤0.001). Conclusion: Correction of vitamin D deficiency in prediabetics with PN as well as hypovitaminosis D, improves glycemic parameters, PN score and severity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Frequency of anisometropia in children and adolescents [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Our objective was to estimate the frequency of anisometropia at various educational stages, from pre-school to 9th school year, studying its association with gender, study cycle and area of residence. Methods: 749 children and adolescents (from 3 to 16 years old) participated in this study, 46.7% girls and 42.7% living in a rural environment. The refraction was performed with a paediatric, open field autorefractometer (PlusOptix), without cycloplegic and under binocular conditions. Results: The frequency rate of anisometropia in the studied sample was 6.1%, varying from 2.9% in pre-school education to 9.4% in the 3rd study cycle. Myopic anisometropia was the most frequent and hyperopic and astigmatic anisometropia showed identical proportions of occurrence. No statistical evidence was found to state that the occurrence of anisometropia differs between genders or between areas of residence. Regarding the school cycle, a significant association was found with spherical equivalent anisometropia, with an increase in its frequency with school progress (p=0,012), with myopic anisometropia being the main contributor to this variation. Conclusions: The increase in workload for near tasks has been identified as a risk factor for the increase in myopia. This fact may be related to the increase in anisometropia with the educational stage, found in this study. The high rate of anisometropia found in adolescents (9.4%) as well as the progressive increase in this rate throughout school progress (from 2.9% to 9.4%) suggests the need to extend the detection strategies of this condition to beyond childhood.

                <p>We evaluated whether genetically elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with lower risk of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage (IA/SAH). We conducted a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Our primary analysis used the inverse-variance weighted method. In secondary analyses, we implemented the MR-PRESSO method, restricted our analysis to LDL-C–specific instruments, and performed multivariate MR. A 1-mmol/l increase in genetically instrumented LDL-C levels was associated with a 17% lower risk of IA/SAH (odds ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval = 0.73–0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.004). Results remained consistent in secondary and multivariate analyses (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Our results provide evidence for an inverse causal relationship between LDL-C levels and risk of IA/SAH.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modifications to the delivery of NHS face-to-face general practice consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in England [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In order to minimise transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, delivery of English general practice consultations was modified in March 2020 to enable the separation of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 from others. Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted face-to-face contact used only when clinically necessary. Face-to-face delivery modifications were decided locally and this study aimed to identify the different models used nationwide in spring/summer 2020. Methods: In June 2020, a survey was sent by email to the 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) responsible for planning and commissioning NHS health care services in England to identify the local organisation of face-to-face general practice consultations since March 2020. Results: All CCGs responded. Between March and July 2020, separation of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 (‘COVID-19 patients’) from others was achieved using the following models: zoned practices (used within 47% of CCGs), where COVID-19 and other patients were separated within their own practice; ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ hubs (used within 90% of CCGs), separate sites where COVID-19 or other patients registered at one of several collaborating practices were seen; ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ home visits (used within 70% of CCGs). For around half of CCGs, either all their GP practices used zoning, or all used hubs; in other CCGs, both models were used. Demand-led hub availability offered flexibility in some areas. Home visits were mainly used supplementally for patients unable to access other services, but in two CCGs, they were the main/only form of COVID-19 provision.  Conclusions: Varied, flexible ways of delivering face-to-face general practice consultations were identified.  Analysis of the modified delivery in terms of management of COVID-19 and other conditions, and other impacts on staff and patients, may both aid future pandemic management and identify beneficial elements for practice beyond this.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Public perception of NHS general practice during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In March 2020, the delivery of NHS general practice consultations was rapidly modified to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted models for face-to-face contact if clinically required. This study aimed to gain insight into public perception of these adaptations. Methods: Two online surveys were developed, and conducted in August and September 2020. Survey A, open to adults (>18 years) receiving the link to it, considered respondents’ perspectives on healthcare contacts since March 2020, and their understanding of the adapted delivery. Survey B, open to survey A respondents only, then considered how healthcare communication had been received and individual preferences for this. Survey participation was voluntary. Results: The perceptions of 150 members of the public were obtained. 105 had considered contacting general practice, although half avoided this or delayed doing so for longer than usual. While some patients did so ‘to help the NHS’, others experienced reduced access for reasons including concerns about telephone consultations and about COVID-19 safety. Some however reported benefitting from remote consultation availability and regular texts/emails from their practice. 68% (102/150) of respondents were unaware that patients with COVID-19 were seen separately from other patients during general practice appointments. 27% in survey B who had avoided or delayed contact said they would have felt more comfortable contacting general practice had they known this. Conclusions: Experience and use of the adapted general practice models varied. Some patients felt their access to healthcare was reduced, often due to technological requirements. For some who found attending face-to-face appointments difficult however, remote contact was advantageous. Most of those surveyed were unaware of the COVID-19 control measures in place during face-to-face general practice consultations. Assessment of adapted delivery model accessibility and clearer public messaging about the changes may help reduce inequalities.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess if SARS-CoV-2 causes a persistent central nervous system infection.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody index and SARS-CoV-2 RNA studied in cerebrospinal fluid following COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid was assessed between day 1-30 (n=12), between day 31-90 (n=8), or later than 90 days (post-COVID-19, n=20) of COVID-19 diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all patients, and in none of the 20 patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome intrathecally produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The absence of evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid argues against a persistent central nervous system infection as a cause of neurological or neuropsychiatric post-COVID-19 syndrome.</p>

                Closser et al. show that neuronal genes are associated with highly complex regulatory systems in expanded non-coding genomic domains. Neuronal enhancers are distributed broadly and utilized sparsely in cell-type- and cell-stage-specific patterns. Acquisition of new enhancers might be a fundamental process underlying the evolutionary increase in cellular complexity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">All-trans retinoic acid induces synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Previously we showed that the vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) induces synaptic plasticity in acute brain slices prepared from the mouse and human neocortex (Lenz et al., 2021). Depending on the brain region studied, distinct effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission have been reported. Here, we used intraperitoneal injections of atRA (10 mg/kg) in adult C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mouse fascia dentata—a brain region implicated in memory acquisition. No major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral hippocampus while a significant increase in both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies and synapse numbers were evident in the dorsal hippocampus 6 hr after atRA administration. The intrinsic properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells were not significantly different and hippocampal transcriptome analysis revealed no essential neuronal changes upon atRA treatment. In light of these findings, we tested for the metaplastic effects of atRA, that is, for its ability to modulate synaptic plasticity expression in the absence of major changes in baseline synaptic strength. Indeed, in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments demonstrated that systemic atRA treatment improves the ability of dentate granule cells to express LTP. The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, therefore, extending our previous results regarding the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our data show that atRA mediates synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Monitoring single-cell dynamics of entry into quiescence during an unperturbed lifecycle</a></h4>

              
                The life cycle of microorganisms is associated with dynamic metabolic transitions and complex cellular responses. In yeast, how metabolic signals control the progressive choreography of structural reorganizations observed in quiescent cells during a natural life cycle remains unclear. We have developed an integrated microfluidic device to address this question, enabling continuous single-cell tracking in a batch culture experiencing unperturbed nutrient exhaustion to unravel the coordination between metabolic and structural transitions within cells. Our technique reveals an abrupt fate divergence in the population, whereby a fraction of cells is unable to transition to respiratory metabolism and undergoes a reversible entry into a quiescence-like state leading to premature cell death. Further observations reveal that non-monotonous internal pH fluctuations in respiration-competent cells orchestrate the successive waves of protein super-assemblies formation that accompany the entry into a <i>bona fide</i> quiescent state. This ultimately leads to an abrupt cytosolic glass transition that occurs stochastically long after proliferation cessation. This new experimental framework provides a unique way to track single-cell fate dynamics over a long timescale in a population of cells that continuously modify their ecological niche.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Shu complex prevents mutagenesis and cytotoxicity of single-strand specific alkylation lesions</a></h4>

              
                Three-methyl cytosine (3meC) are toxic DNA lesions, blocking base pairing. Bacteria and humans, express members of the AlkB enzymes family, which directly remove 3meC. However, other organisms, including budding yeast, lack this class of enzymes. It remains an unanswered evolutionary question as to how yeast repairs 3meC, particularly in single-stranded DNA. The yeast Shu complex, a conserved homologous recombination factor, aids in preventing replication-associated mutagenesis from DNA base damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). We found that MMS-treated Shu complex-deficient cells, exhibit a genome-wide increase in A:T and G:C substitutions mutations. The G:C substitutions displayed transcriptional and replicational asymmetries consistent with mutations resulting from 3meC. Ectopic expression of a human AlkB homolog in Shu-deficient yeast rescues MMS-induced growth defects and increased mutagenesis. Thus, our work identifies a novel homologous recombination-based mechanism mediated by the Shu complex for coping with alkylation adducts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel, ataxic mouse model of Ataxia Telangiectasia caused by a clinically relevant nonsense mutation</a></h4>

              
                Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) and Ataxia with Ocular Apraxia Type 1 (AOA1) are devastating neurological disorders caused by null mutations in the genome stability genes, A-T mutated (<i>ATM</i>) and Aprataxin (<i>APTX</i>), respectively. Our mechanistic understanding and therapeutic repertoire for treating these disorders is severely lacking, in large part due to the failure of prior animal models with similar null mutations to recapitulate the characteristic loss of motor coordination (i.e., ataxia) and associated cerebellar defects. By increasing genotoxic stress through the insertion of null mutations in both the <i>Atm</i> (nonsense) and <i>Aptx </i>(knockout) genes in the same animal, we have generated a novel mouse model that for the first time develops a progressively severe ataxic phenotype associated with atrophy of the cerebellar molecular layer. We find biophysical properties of cerebellar Purkinje neurons are significantly perturbed (e.g., reduced membrane capacitance, lower action potential thresholds, etc.), while properties of synaptic inputs remain largely unchanged. These perturbations significantly alter Purkinje neuron neural activity, including a progressive reduction in spontaneous action potential firing frequency that correlates with both cerebellar atrophy and ataxia over the animal’s first year of life. Double mutant mice also exhibit a high predisposition to developing cancer (thymomas) and immune abnormalities (impaired early thymocyte development and T-cell maturation), symptoms characteristic of A-T. Lastly, by inserting a clinically relevant nonsense-type null mutation in <i>Atm</i>, we demonstrate that Small Molecule Read-Through (SMRT) compounds can restore ATM production, indicating their potential as a future A-T therapeutic.

                Plants develop new organs to adjust their bodies to dynamic changes in the environment. How independent organs achieve anisotropic shapes and polarities is poorly understood. To address this question, we constructed a mechano-biochemical model for <i>Arabidopsis</i> root meristem growth that integrates biologically plausible principles. Computer model simulations demonstrate how differential growth of neighboring tissues results in the initial symmetry-breaking leading to anisotropic root growth. Furthermore, the root growth feeds back on a polar transport network of the growth regulator auxin. Model, predictions are in close agreement with <i>in vivo</i> patterns of anisotropic growth, auxin distribution, and cell polarity, as well as several root phenotypes caused by chemical, mechanical, or genetic perturbations. Our study demonstrates that the combination of tissue mechanics and polar auxin transport organizes anisotropic root growth and cell polarities during organ outgrowth. Therefore, a mobile auxin signal transported through immobile cells drives polarity and growth mechanics to coordinate complex organ development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Synthesis of a comprehensive population code for contextual features in the awake sensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                How cortical circuits build representations of complex objects is poorly understood. Individual neurons must integrate broadly over space, yet simultaneously obtain sharp tuning to specific global stimulus features. Groups of neurons identifying different global features must then assemble into a population that forms a comprehensive code for these global stimulus properties. Although the logic for how single neurons summate over their spatial inputs has been well-explored in anesthetized animals, how large groups of neurons compose a flexible population code of higher order features in awake animals is not known. To address this question, we probed the integration and population coding of higher order stimuli in the somatosensory and visual cortices of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging across cortical layers. We developed a novel tactile stimulator that allowed the precise measurement of spatial summation even in actively whisking mice. Using this system, we found a sparse but comprehensive population code for higher order tactile features that depends on a heterogeneous and neuron-specific logic of spatial summation beyond the receptive field. Different somatosensory cortical neurons summed specific combinations of sensory inputs supra-linearly, but integrated other inputs sub-linearly, leading to selective responses to higher order features. Visual cortical populations employed a nearly identical scheme to generate a comprehensive population code for contextual stimuli. These results suggest that a heterogeneous logic of input-specific supra-linear summation may represent a widespread cortical mechanism for the synthesis of sparse higher order feature codes in neural populations. This may explain how the brain exploits the thalamocortical expansion of dimensionality to encode arbitrary complex features of sensory stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts is a developmental disorder of the gliovascular unit</a></h4>

              
                Absence of the astrocyte-specific membrane protein MLC1 is responsible for megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), a rare type of leukodystrophy characterized by early-onset macrocephaly and progressive white matter vacuolation that lead to ataxia, spasticity, and cognitive decline. During postnatal development (from P5 to P15 in the mouse), MLC1 forms a membrane complex with GlialCAM (another astrocytic transmembrane protein) at the junctions between perivascular astrocytic processes. Perivascular astrocytic processes along with blood vessels form the gliovascular unit. It was not previously known how MLC1 influences the physiology of the gliovascular unit. Here, using the <i>Mlc1</i> knock-out (KO) mouse model of MLC, we demonstrated that MLC1 controls the postnatal development and organization of perivascular astrocytic processes, vascular smooth muscle cell contractility, neurovascular coupling and intraparenchymal interstitial fluid clearance. Our data suggest that MLC is a developmental disorder of the gliovascular unit, and perivascular astrocytic processes and vascular smooth muscle cell maturation defects are primary events in the pathogenesis of MLC and therapeutic targets for this disease.

Of all cellular macromolecules, the bacterial proteome is by far the most important resource and its size is limited. Here, we investigated how the highly versatile 'knallgas' bacterium <i>Cupriavidus necator</i> reallocates protein resources when grown on different limiting substrates and with different growth rates. We determined protein quantity by mass spectrometry and estimated enzyme utilization by resource balance analysis modeling. We found that <i>C. necator</i> invests a large fraction of its proteome in functions that are hardly utilized. Of the enzymes that are utilized, many are present in excess abundance. One prominent example is the strong expression of CBB cycle genes such as Rubisco during growth on fructose. Modeling and mutant competition experiments suggest that CO<sub>2</sub>-reassimilation through Rubisco does not provide a fitness benefit for heterotrophic growth, but is rather an investment in readiness for autotrophy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Correct regionalisation of a tissue primordium is essential for coordinated morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                During organ development, tubular organs often form from flat epithelial primordia. In the placodes of the forming tubes of the salivary glands in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, we previously identified spatially defined cell behaviours of cell wedging, tilting and cell intercalation that are key to the initial stages of tube formation. Here we address what the requirements are that ensure the continuous formation of a narrow symmetrical tube from an initially asymmetrical primordium whilst overall tissue geometry is constantly changing. We are using live-imaging and quantitative methods to compare wild-type placodes and mutants that either show disrupted cell behaviours or an initial symmetrical placode organisation, with both resulting in severe impairment of the invagination. We find that early transcriptional patterning of key morphogenetic transcription factors drives the selective activation of downstream morphogenetic modules, such as GPCR signalling that activates apical-medial actomyosin activity to drive cell wedging at the future asymmetrically-placed invagination point. Over time, transcription of key factors expands across the rest of the placode and cells switch their behaviour from predominantly intercalating to predominantly apically constricting as their position approaches the invagination pit. Misplacement or enlargement of the initial invagination pit leads to early problems in cell behaviours that eventually result in a defective organ shape. Our work illustrates that the dynamic patterning of the expression of transcription factors and downstream morphogenetic effectors ensures positionally fixed areas of cell behaviour with regards to the invagination point. This patterning in combination with the asymmetric geometrical set-up ensures functional organ formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CA1 pyramidal cell diversity is rootedin the time of neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Cellular diversity supports the computational capacity and flexibility of cortical circuits. Accordingly, principal neurons at the CA1 output node of the murine hippocampus are increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous population. Their genes, molecular content, intrinsic morphophysiology, connectivity, and function seem to segregate along the main anatomical axes of the hippocampus. Since these axes reflect the temporal order of principal cell neurogenesis, we directly examined the relationship between birthdate and CA1 pyramidal neuron diversity, focusing on the ventral hippocampus. We used a genetic fate-mapping approach that allowed tagging three groups of age-matched principal neurons: pioneer, early- and late-born. Using a combination of neuroanatomy, slice physiology, connectivity tracing and cFos staining in mice, we show that birthdate is a strong predictor of CA1 principal cell diversity. We unravel a subpopulation of pioneer neurons recruited in familiar environments with remarkable positioning, morpho-physiological features, and connectivity. Therefore, despite the expected plasticity of hippocampal circuits, given their role in learning and memory, the diversity of their main components is also partly determined at the earliest steps of development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury alterations of corticotropin-releasing factor neuronal activity in the mouse hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mbTBI) is the most common cause of TBI in US service members and veterans. Those exposed to TBI are at greater risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders, and substance use disorders following TBI [1, 2]. Previously, we have demonstrated that mbTBI increases anxiety-like behaviors in mice and dysregulates the stress at the level of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). To expand on how mTBI may dysregulate the stress axis centrally, here PVN CRF neuronal activity was evaluated using whole cell-patch clamp recordings in hypothalamic slices from sham and mbTBI adult male CRF:tdTomato mice 7 days post-injury. We found that mbTBI generally did not affect the neuronal excitability and intrinsic membrane properties of PVN CRF neurons; this injury selectively increased the frequency of spontaneous neuronal firing of PVN CRF neurons localized to the dorsal PVN (dPVN) but not ventral PVN (vPVN). Consistently, mbTBI-induced dPVN CRF hyperactivity was associated with pre- and post-synaptic depression of spontaneous GABAergic transmission onto dPVN CRF neurons suggesting that mbTBI-induced GABAergic synaptic dysfunction may underlie dPVN CRF neuronal hyperactivity and increases in dPVN CRF signaling. The present results provide the first evidence for mbTBI-induced alterations in PVN CRF neuronal activity and GABAergic synaptic function that could mediate hypothalamic CRF dysregulation following mbTBI contributing to stress psychopathology associated with blast injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking neural activity from the same cells during the entire adult life of mice</a></h4>

              
                Recording the activity of the same neurons over the adult life of an animal is important to neuroscience research and biomedical applications. Current implantable devices cannot provide stable recording on this time scale. Here, we introduce a method to precisely implant nanoelectronics with an open, unfolded mesh structure across multiple brain regions in the mouse. The open mesh structure forms a stable interwoven structure with the neural network, preventing probe drifting and showing no immune response and neuron loss during the yearlong implantation. Using the implanted nanoelectronics, we can track single-unit action potentials from the same neurons over the entire adult life of mice. Leveraging the stable recordings, we build machine learning algorithms that enable automated spike sorting, noise rejection, stability validation, and generate pseudotime analysis, revealing aging-associated evolution of the single-neuron activities.
