              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14339">Exploring EEG Indicators to Evaluate Listening Difficulties in Noisy Environments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory processing difficulties involve challenges in understanding speech in noisy environments despite normal hearing. However, the neural mechanisms remain unclear, and standardized diagnostic criteria are lacking. This study examined neural indicators using EEG under realistic noisy conditions. Ten Japanese-speaking university students participated in auditory tasks, including a resting state, a lecture attention task with background noise, and a task requiring attention to background noise. The study analyzed the peak frequency and power of alpha waves, the long-range temporal correlation of alpha oscillations, and the absolute power of delta waves. Results showed a significant reduction in the power of alpha waves during the background noise attention task, suggesting increased cognitive load. In contrast, the peak frequency of alpha waves remained stable, indicating limited sensitivity to cognitive demand changes. Long-range temporal correlation increased under tasks requiring auditory attention, reflecting sustained attention-related neural dynamics, while the absolute power of delta waves showed no significant variation across tasks. Regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the power of alpha waves in noisy conditions and screening scores for auditory processing difficulties, suggesting its potential as a neural indicator.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14598">Learning From the Past with Cascading Eligibility Traces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals often receive information about errors and rewards after a significant delay. For example, there is typically a delay of tens to hundreds of milliseconds between motor actions and visual feedback. The standard approach to handling delays in models of synaptic plasticity is to use eligibility traces. However, standard eligibility traces that decay exponentially mix together any events that happen during the delay, presenting a problem for any credit assignment signal that occurs with a significant delay. Here, we show that eligibility traces formed by a state-space model, inspired by a cascade of biochemical reactions, can provide a temporally precise memory for handling credit assignment at arbitrary delays. We demonstrate that these cascading eligibility traces (CETs) work for credit assignment at behavioral time-scales, ranging from seconds to minutes. As well, we can use CETs to handle extremely slow retrograde signals, as have been found in retrograde axonal signaling. These results demonstrate that CETs can provide an excellent basis for modeling synaptic plasticity.

                arXiv:2506.14760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep is commonly studied through neurochemical, evolutionary, and behavioral frameworks, typically emphasizing circadian rhythms and energy conservation. However, these approaches do not fully explain a deeper biophysical question: why does sleep universally involve physical stillness, a lying posture, and disconnection from conscious control? This paper introduces a new hypothesis that sleep is not merely a biological function, but a state of vibrational synchronization between the human body and natural frequencies generated by the Earth. In this state, the body reduces its autonomous activity and aligns with external environmental rhythms, allowing for energy restoration, internal recalibration, and systemic reorganization. This perspective reframes life as a continuous process of internally driven vibration influenced by external physical fields. The proposed model offers new avenues for understanding aging, health, death, and consciousness.

                arXiv:2506.13835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silent speech decoding, which performs unvocalized human speech recognition from electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG), increases accessibility for speech-impaired humans. However, data collection is difficult and performed using varying experimental setups, making it nontrivial to collect a large, homogeneous dataset. In this study we introduce neural networks that can handle EEG/EMG with heterogeneous electrode placements and show strong performance in silent speech decoding via multi-task training on large-scale EEG/EMG datasets. We achieve improved word classification accuracy in both healthy participants (95.3%), and a speech-impaired patient (54.5%), substantially outperforming models trained on single-subject data (70.1% and 13.2%). Moreover, our models also show gains in cross-language calibration performance. This increase in accuracy suggests the feasibility of developing practical silent speech decoding systems, particularly for speech-impaired patients.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23394">Spatiotemporal Learning of Brain Dynamics from fMRI Using Frequency-Specific Multi-Band Attention for Cognitive and Psychiatric Applications</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.23394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain's complex nonlinear dynamics give rise to cognitive function remains a central challenge in neuroscience. While brain functional dynamics exhibits scale-free and multifractal properties across temporal scales, conventional neuroimaging analytics assume linearity and stationarity, failing to capture frequency-specific neural computations. Here, we introduce Multi-Band Brain Net (MBBN), the first transformer-based framework to explicitly model frequency-specific spatiotemporal brain dynamics from fMRI. MBBN integrates biologically-grounded frequency decomposition with multi-band self-attention mechanisms, enabling discovery of previously undetectable frequency-dependent network interactions. Trained on 49,673 individuals across three large-scale cohorts (UK Biobank, ABCD, ABIDE), MBBN sets a new state-of-the-art in predicting psychiatric and cognitive outcomes (depression, ADHD, ASD), showing particular strength in classification tasks with up to 52.5\% higher AUROC and provides a novel framework for predicting cognitive intelligence scores. Frequency-resolved analyses uncover disorder-specific signatures: in ADHD, high-frequency fronto-sensorimotor connectivity is attenuated and opercular somatosensory nodes emerge as dynamic hubs; in ASD, orbitofrontal-somatosensory circuits show focal high-frequency disruption together with enhanced ultra-low-frequency coupling between the temporo-parietal junction and prefrontal cortex. By integrating scale-aware neural dynamics with deep learning, MBBN delivers more accurate and interpretable biomarkers, opening avenues for precision psychiatry and developmental neuroscience.

                arXiv:2506.00854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

                arXiv:2506.13615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14138">NeuroCoreX: An Open-Source FPGA-Based Spiking Neural Network Emulator with On-Chip Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and dynamics of biological neuronal networks. Their event-driven nature enables them to achieve high energy efficiency, particularly when deployed on neuromorphic hardware platforms. Unlike conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which primarily rely on layered architectures, SNNs naturally support a wide range of connectivity patterns, from traditional layered structures to small-world graphs characterized by locally dense and globally sparse connections. In this work, we introduce NeuroCoreX, an FPGA-based emulator designed for the flexible co-design and testing of SNNs. NeuroCoreX supports all-to-all connectivity, providing the capability to implement diverse network topologies without architectural restrictions. It features a biologically motivated local learning mechanism based on Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP). The neuron model implemented within NeuroCoreX is the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, with current-based synapses facilitating spike integration and transmission . A Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) interface is provided for programming and configuring the network parameters, including neuron, synapse, and learning rule settings. Users interact with the emulator through a simple Python-based interface, streamlining SNN deployment from model design to hardware execution. NeuroCoreX is released as an open-source framework, aiming to accelerate research and development in energy-efficient, biologically inspired computing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14425">Is Selection All You Need in Differential Evolution?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Evolution (DE) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for black-box optimization problems. However, in modern DE implementations, a major challenge lies in the limited population diversity caused by the fixed population size enforced by the generational replacement. Population size is a critical control parameter that significantly affects DE performance. Larger populations inherently contain a more diverse set of individuals, thereby facilitating broader exploration of the search space. Conversely, when the maximum evaluation budgets is constrained, smaller populations focusing on a limited number of promising candidates may be more suitable. Many state-of-the-art DE variants incorporate an archive mechanism, in which a subset of discarded individuals is preserved in an archive during generation replacement and reused in mutation operations. However, maintaining what is essentially a secondary population via an archive introduces additional design considerations, such as policies for insertion, deletion, and appropriate sizing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DE framework called Unbounded Differential Evolution (UDE), which adds all generated candidates to the population without discarding any individual based on fitness. Unlike conventional DE, which removes inferior individuals during generational replacement, UDE eliminates replacement altogether, along with the associated complexities of archive management and dynamic population sizing. UDE represents a fundamentally new approach to DE, relying solely on selection mechanisms and enabling a more straightforward yet powerful search algorithm.

Nevertheless, training of these models with powerful gradient-based learning algorithms is mostly performed on standard digital hardware using Backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT has substantial limitations. It does not permit online training and its memory consumption scales linearly with the number of computation steps. In contrast, learning methods using forward propagation of gradients operate in an online manner with a memory consumption independent of the number of time steps. These methods enable SNNs to learn from continuous, infinite-length input sequences. Yet, slow execution speed on conventional hardware as well as inferior performance has hindered their widespread application. In this work, we introduce HYbrid PRopagation (HYPR) that combines the efficiency of parallelization with approximate online forward learning. Our algorithm yields high-throughput online learning through parallelization, paired with constant, i.e., sequence length independent, memory demands. HYPR enables parallelization of parameter update computation over the sub sequences for RSNNs consisting of almost arbitrary non-linear spiking neuron models. We apply HYPR to networks of spiking neurons with oscillatory subthreshold dynamics. We find that this type of neuron model is particularly well trainable by HYPR, resulting in an unprecedentedly low task performance gap between approximate forward gradient learning and BPTT.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.

                arXiv:2506.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique for foundation models. Recent work has highlighted an inherent asymmetry in the initialization of LoRA's low-rank factors, which has been present since its inception and was presumably derived experimentally. This paper focuses on providing a comprehensive theoretical characterization of asymmetric LoRA with frozen random factors. First, while existing research provides upper-bound generalization guarantees based on averages over multiple experiments, the behaviour of a single fine-tuning run with specific random factors remains an open question. We address this by investigating the concentration of the typical LoRA generalization gap around its mean. Our main upper bound reveals a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{r}}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$ with high probability for rank $r$ LoRAs trained on $N$ samples. Additionally, we also determine the fundamental limits in terms of sample efficiency, establishing a matching lower bound of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$. By more closely reflecting the practical scenario of a single fine-tuning run, our findings offer crucial insights into the reliability and practicality of asymmetric LoRA.

Abstract: Decoding human activity from EEG signals has long been a popular research topic. While recent studies have increasingly shifted focus from single-subject to cross-subject analysis, few have explored the model's ability to perform zero-shot predictions on EEG signals from previously unseen subjects. This research aims to investigate whether deep learning methods can capture subject-independent semantic information inherent in human EEG signals. Such insights are crucial for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, on one hand, they demonstrate the model's robustness against subject-specific temporal biases, and on the other, they significantly enhance the generalizability of downstream tasks. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as denoising agents to extract subject-independent semantic features from noisy EEG signals. Experimental results, including ablation studies, highlight the pivotal role of LLMs in decoding subject-independent semantic information from noisy EEG data. We hope our findings will contribute to advancing BCI research and assist both academia and industry in applying EEG signals to a broader range of applications.

Abstract: Effective search methods are crucial for improving the performance of deep generative models at test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time search method, Neural Genetic Search (NGS), which incorporates the evolutionary mechanism of genetic algorithms into the generation procedure of deep models. The core idea behind NGS is its crossover, which is defined as parent-conditioned generation using trained generative models. This approach offers a versatile and easy-to-implement search algorithm for deep generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of NGS through experiments across three distinct domains: routing problems, adversarial prompt generation for language models, and molecular design.

                arXiv:2503.08703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras provide superior temporal resolution, dynamic range, power efficiency, and pixel bandwidth. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally complement event data through discrete spike signals, making them ideal for event-based tracking. However, current approaches that combine Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and SNNs, along with suboptimal architectures, compromise energy efficiency and limit tracking performance. To address these limitations, we propose the first Transformer-based spike-driven tracking pipeline. Our Global Trajectory Prompt (GTP) method effectively captures global trajectory information and aggregates it with event streams into event images to enhance spatiotemporal representation. We then introduce SDTrack, a Transformer-based spike-driven tracker comprising a Spiking MetaFormer backbone and a simple tracking head that directly predicts normalized coordinates using spike signals. The framework is end-to-end, does not require data augmentation or post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the lowest parameter count and energy consumption across multiple event-based tracking benchmarks, establishing a solid baseline for future research in the field of neuromorphic vision.

                arXiv:2403.17328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.

                arXiv:2504.16005v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automatic prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p in accuracy. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.

                Background Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication that is effective in treating various seizure disorders. It is mostly metabolized by the liver, which increases the risk of PHT-induced hepatotoxicity. Aims This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in protecting the liver from phenytoin-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Materials and Methods Four sets of five rats male Wistar albino rats (Rattus norvegicus) used for this study was based on their availability, well-established physiology, and long history of use in pharmacological and toxicological studies each were used for analysis. Each of the four groups received different treatments: the control group received normal saline, one group received 200 mg/kg/day of NAC, another group received 5 mg/kg/day of phenytoin, and the fourth group received 200 mg/kg/day of both phenytoin and NAC. The treatments were administered orally by gavage for 45 days. Biochemical indicators (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total serum bilirubin (TSB)) were measured in serum after the animals were anaesthetized and the experiment ended. Histological analysis was performed on liver specimens. Results Our investigation showed that phenytoin significantly elevated liver enzymes and total serum bilirubin compared to the control and NAC groups. The concurrent administration of NAC and phenytoin led to a notable reduction in these biomarkers, excluding ALP levels. Moreover, the group that received NAC alone did not exhibit a significant increase in the levels of these biomarkers compared with the control group. The histopathological results were in agreement with the biochemical tests. Conclusion This study concluded that Concomitant administration of NAC and phenytoin lowered the risk of phenytoin-induced hepatotoxicity. Moreover, this study confirmed that NAC is relatively safe when administered for a relatively prolonged period.

                <p>In frequency tagging, visual stimulation at a frequency (F) of ~10&nbsp;Hz has long been known to generate the highest-amplitude response at<I> F </I>in the frequency domain over the human occipital cortex with electroencephalogram and other high temporal-resolution methods. Brain responses are indeed commonly assessed simply at<I> F</I> (i.e., the first harmonic = 1<I>F</I>), under the assumption that the response is represented at a single frequency, i.e., "steady-state" or approximately sinusoidal in terms of amplitude over time. This condition is met at stimulus presentation frequencies above ~4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz in the visual modality; consequently, frequency tagging has often been limited to F above this "floor." Here, we support a less-common perspective, that frequency-tagged responses do not need to be steady-state, such that slower F are valid. In this case, it has been shown that is not appropriate to measure nonsinusoidal responses at only <I>F</I> but that nonsinusoidal responses can still be analyzed simply and advantageously in the frequency domain through baseline-corrected amplitude summation across harmonics (<I>F</I> <I>+</I> 2<I>F</I> <I>+</I> 3<I>F</I>... = <I>F</I><SUB>s</SUB>). Critically, we demonstrate that although the highest-amplitude <I>F</I> response occurs at F = 10&nbsp;Hz, the highest-amplitude <I>F</I><SUB>s</SUB> response occurs at approximately F &lt; 4&nbsp;Hz. We use this example toward understanding the effect of stimulation frequency on response amplitude and discuss its caveats and limitations. We address what defines an "optimal" stimulation frequency (note: it may not always be the F yielding the highest-amplitude response) and reflect on considerations when choosing a stimulation frequency in different contexts.</p>

                Ethiopia encounters significant socio-cultural barriers to contraceptive use, affecting maternal health, poverty reduction, and women’s empowerment. With a fertility rate of 4.6 children per woman and only 25.9% of women of reproductive age intending to use contraceptives, significant challenges remain. This policy brief analyzes data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) and 2019 Mini-EDHS, revealing key barriers such as fatalistic beliefs, religious prohibitions, postpartum amenorrhea, and spousal opposition. Socioeconomic factors, including wealth, literacy, and urban residency, greatly influence contraceptive use. Multivariable and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses underscore the complex interplay of cultural norms, economic status, and individual autonomy in shaping contraceptive behavior. The result reveals both direct and indirect effects of socio-cultural factors such as fatalistic beliefs and religious prohibitions on contraceptive use. The findings of this brief provide direct policy relevance by identifying actionable pathways for engaging religious leaders, community influencers, and health workers in culturally responsive strategies to overcome socio-cultural barriers and improve contraceptive uptake. Findings recommend to enhance contraceptive uptake, the recommends culturally tailored education programs, such as community-led workshops, engaging religious leaders, and promoting male involvement strategies, alongside targeted interventions for underserved areas and strengthened healthcare systems to ensure equitable access.

                Background Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder caused by hyperglycemia, impaired insulin secretion, and insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk for cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive motor dual task blindfold training (CMDBT) forces the brain to process motor tasks in one of the four procedural memory centers: the basal ganglia, cerebellum, supplementary motor area, and premotor cortex. Hence, it helps improve cognition in patients with T2DM. Methods A randomized control study was conducted on 62 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pre-interventional measures were measured using the MoCA scale to assess cognition. The experimental group [n=31] underwent Cognitive motor dual task blindfold training, along with aerobic training. The control group [n=31] received conventional aerobic and resistance exercises. The subjects in both the groups received the intervention for 12 weeks. Post interventional outcomes were measured using the MoCA scale in subjects with T2DM. Results Statistical analysis of the data revealed that there was a significant improvement in cognitive function in experimental group A subjects, with a significant difference observed in group A compared to group B. The P value of MoCA was 0.0001 in experimental group A subjects. Conclusion Cognitive motor dual-task training (CMDTT) is more effective in increasing cognition in subjects with T2DM. Statistical analysis showed that group A (CMDTT) showed greater improvement in cognitive function than the control group.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a targeted manipulation of brain circuitry to treat neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Optimal DBS lead placement is essential for treatment efficacy. Current targeting practice is based on preoperative and intraoperative brain imaging, intraoperative electrophysiology, and stimulation mapping. Electrophysiological mapping using extracellular microelectrode recordings aids in identifying functional subdomains, anatomical boundaries, and disease-correlated physiology. The shape of single-unit action potentials may differ due to different biophysical properties between cell-types and brain regions. Here, we describe a technique to parameterize the structure and duration of sorted spike units using a novel algorithmic approach based on canonical response parameterization, and illustrate how it may be used on DBS microelectrode recordings. Isolated spike shapes are parameterized then compared using a spike similarity metric and grouped by hierarchical clustering. When spike morphology is associated with anatomy, we find regional clustering in the human globus pallidus. This method is widely applicable for spike removal and single-unit characterization and could be integrated into intraoperative array-based technologies to enhance targeting and clinical outcomes in DBS lead placement.

                <p>by Christine M. Lim, Michele Vendruscolo</p>

The protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network maintains the proteome in a functional state. Although this network has been comprehensively mapped, its perturbations in disease remain incompletely characterised. To address this problem, here we define the proteostasis signatures, which represent the characteristic patterns of change in the proteostasis network associated with disease. We performed a large-scale, pan-disease analysis across 32 human diseases spanning 7 disease types. We first identified unique proteostasis perturbations in specific disease states. We then uncovered distinctive signatures differentiating disease types, pointing to a range of proteostasis mechanisms in disease development. Next, we tracked the temporal evolution of proteostasis signatures, revealing shifts in proteostasis disruption over the course of disease progression. Finally, we demonstrated how smoking, a major risk factor for many diseases, impairs proteostasis in a manner similar to disease, potentially creating a predisposed environment for disease onset. These results illustrate the opportunities offered by the study of human diseases from the perspective of proteostasis signatures.

                <p>by Ximena León Du’Mottuchi, Nicole Creanza</p>

Oscine songbirds learn vocalizations that function in mate attraction and territory defense; sexual selection pressures on these learned songs could thus accelerate speciation. The Eastern and Spotted towhees are recently diverged sister species that now have partially overlapping ranges with evidence of some hybridization. Widespread community-science recordings of these species, including songs within their zone of overlap and from potential hybrids, enable us to investigate whether song differentiation might facilitate their reproductive isolation. Here, we quantify 16 song features to analyze geographic variation in Spotted and Eastern towhee songs and assess species-level differences. We then use several machine learning models to measure how accurately their songs can be classified by species. While no single song feature reliably distinguishes the two species, machine learning models classified songs with relatively high accuracy (random forest: 89.5%, deep learning: 90%, gradient boosting machine: 88%, convolutional neural network: 88%); interestingly, species classification was less accurate in their zone of overlap. Finally, our analysis of the limited publicly available genetic data from each species supports the hypothesis that the species are reproductively isolated. Together, our results suggest that small variations in multiple features may contribute to these sister species’ ability to recognize their species-specific songs.

                <p>by Michael Satchell, Edith Butel-Fry, Zahraa Noureddine, Alexis Simmons, Nicolette N. Ognjanovski, Sara J. Aton, Michal R. Zochowski</p>

Across vertebrate species, sleep consists of repeating cycles of NREM followed by REM. However, their respective functions, and their stereotypic cycling pattern are not well understood. Using a simplified biophysical network model, we investigate the potential role of cholinergic modulation, acting via the muscarinic receptors, on network dynamics and memory consolidation. We show that low and high cholinergic levels associated with NREM and REM sleep, respectively, may play critical, sequential roles in memory consolidation. The network dynamics that facilitate these roles arise through alteration of neural excitability and changes to network-wide excitatory/inhibitory balance. At low acetylcholine (ACh) levels, reduced activation of inhibitory neurons leads to network-wide disinhibition and bursts of synchronized activity led by engram neurons, driving recruitment of additional excitatory neurons into the engram. In contrast, at high ACh levels, increased network inhibition suppresses firing in all but the most strongly recruited excitatory neurons, pruning the expanded engram population. Together, these results provide a testable hypothesis regarding the role of sleep state-specific cholinergic modulation in the process of memory consolidation.

Characterizing cancer presents a delicate challenge as it involves deciphering complex biological interactions within the tumor’s microenvironment. Clinical trials often provide histology images and molecular profiling of tumors, which can help understand these interactions. Despite recent advances in representing multimodal data for weakly supervised tasks in the medical domain, achieving a coherent and interpretable fusion of whole slide images and multi-omics data is still a challenge. Each modality operates at distinct biological levels, introducing substantial correlations between and within data sources. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel deep-learning-based approach designed to represent multi-omics & histopathology data for precision medicine in a readily interpretable manner. While our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple test cases, it also deals with incomplete and missing data in a robust manner. It extracts various scores characterizing the activity of each modality and their interactions at the pathway and gene levels. The strength of our method lies in its capacity to unravel pathway activation through multimodal relationships and to extend enrichment analysis to spatial data for supervised tasks. We showcase its predictive capacity and interpretation scores by extensively exploring multiple TCGA datasets and validation cohorts. The method opens new perspectives in understanding the complex relationships between multimodal pathological genomic data in different cancer types and is publicly available on Github.

                <p>by Jiajia Ma, Tom J. Carney</p>

Successful initiation of animal development requires activation of the egg immediately prior to fusion of gamete pronuclei. In all taxa, this is initiated by waves of calcium transients which transverse across the egg. Calcium waves also occur at cleavage furrows during later blastula cytokinesis. Calcium is released from the endoplasmic reticulum through activation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors. Only a subset of the mechanisms employed to generate IP<sub>3</sub> during vertebrate egg activation are defined, with strong evidence that other critical mechanisms exist. Serine proteases have been long implicated in egg activation and fertilization. Here, we report that treatment of zebrafish eggs with serine protease inhibitors leads to defective calcium wave propagation and failed egg activation. We further show that mutation of zebrafish Protease-activated receptor 2a (Par2a) also results in severe disruption of egg activation, leading to failed chorion elevation and ooplasmic segregation. Milder <i>par2a</i> mutants progress further, but then show abnormal blastomere cleavage. We observed that <i>par2a</i> mutants show decreased amplitude and duration of calcium transients. Restoring Ca<sup>++</sup> or direct injection of IP<sub>3</sub> ligand rescues egg activation aborted by either serine protease inhibitor treatment or by mutation of Par2a. We thus show that serine protease activity is a critical regulator of IP<sub>3</sub> and subsequent calcium wave amplification during zebrafish egg activation, and link this to intracellular calcium release via the protease receptor, Par2a. This constitutes a novel signaling pathway critical for successful fertilization.

                Introduction India’s tribal population accounted for 8.6% of the country’s total population. Despite the advancements in healthcare that have occurred in recent decades, which have greatly improved disease prevention and treatment, certain marginalized and browbeaten tribal communities often encounter significant, yet unnoticed barriers when trying to access healthcare services, irrespective of the services and schemes available for them. Objective This study aimed to undermine the confronting and promoting factors that influence the utilization of healthcare services by a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in India. Methods An ethnographic fieldwork was undertaken to explore the factors contributing to the persistent and alarming decline in healthcare accessibility among a selected PVTG in the Udupi district, located in the coastal region of southern India. The study involved conducting eight in-depth interviews (IDIs) and three focus group discussions (FGDs) with representatives from the PVTG community, healthcare providers, and key informants associated with institutions delivering healthcare services to this marginalized group. Results Numerous barriers have been identified as significant determinants impeding the utilization of healthcare services and schemes by selected PVTG. These barriers encompass the lack of culturally sensitive care, discrimination faced by the community within healthcare establishments, centralized approach to service delivery, and limited collective capacity to advocate for services and schemes that are more inclusive and sustainable for their communities. Conclusions Although several influential factors are behind the resistance to utilizing healthcare services and schemes by the PVTG in Udupi district, culturally oriented care, absence of discrimination, decentralized service delivery, and their capacity for collective bargaining might enhance their utilization of healthcare services, and this would enable the improvement of the tribe’s overall well-being and health status.

                Mis-splicing of autophagy genes contributes to diverse pathologies including cancer. Mathavarajah et al. report that depletion of tumor suppressor and splicing kinase PRP4K leads to impaired autophagy through mis-splicing of CHMP4B/vps32 in human cells and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, species separated by at least 600 million years of evolution.

                Satb1 has a key role in T cell development and differentiation. In this study, Köhne et al. showed that deletion of Satb1 in naive CD4+ T cells inhibits TH17 cell development via alterations in IL-2/STAT5 signaling preventing TH17 cell-driven autoimmunity in vivo in the EAE and experimental colitis model.

                Dai et al. show that hyperexpanded CD8+ T cell clones emerge at alopecia areata onset and are sufficient to induce disease. Using single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing, they establish a causal link between clonal expansion and pathogenicity and demonstrate that depleting dominant clones prevents disease in a mouse model.

                Ribosome-targeting drugs are widely used in basic research and medicine, yet the conservation of their binding residues in bacterial ribosomes remains unknown. Here, Ekemezie et al. reveal extensive sequence divergence in ribosomal drug-binding sites across bacterial lineages, offering a resource for more optimized applications of ribosome-targeting drugs.

                Manjila et al. identify the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (EPd) as a distinct cortical subplate structure enriched with oxytocin receptors (Oxtrs). EPd-Oxtr neurons connect bidirectionally with olfactory and limbic regions. They exhibit high baseline activity that decreases with novel stimuli, suggesting a role in regulating internal states and processing environmental novelty.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 17 June 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60589-5">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-60589-5</a></p>The ultrastrong coupling regime in circuit QED allows to observe puzzling phenomena such as multiphoton exchanges between qubits and resonators. Here, the authors use two flux qubits ultrastrongly coupled to a common LC resonator to verify an earlier prediction of avoided crossing between a single photon state and a state with both of the qubits being excited.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105422">A contextual fear conditioning paradigm in head-fixed mice exploring virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is a classical laboratory task that tests associative memory formation and recall. Techniques such as multi-photon microscopy and holographic stimulation offer tremendous opportunities to understand the neural underpinnings of these memories. However, these techniques generally require animals to be head-fixed. Few paradigms examine contextual fear in head-fixed mice, and none use freezing—the most common measure of fear in freely moving animals—as the behavioral readout. To address this gap, we developed a CFC paradigm for head-fixed mice using virtual reality (VR). We designed an apparatus to deliver tail shocks while mice navigated a VR environment. We tested three versions of this paradigm and, in all of them, observed increased freezing, particularly on the first trial, in the shock-paired VR compared to a neutral one. These results demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be fear-conditioned in VR and exhibit context-specific freezing behavior. Additionally, using two-photon calcium imaging, we tracked large populations of hippocampal CA1 neurons before, during, and following CFC. As in freely moving mice, CA1 place cells remapped and developed narrower fields following fear conditioning. Thus, our approach enables new opportunities to study the neural mechanisms underlying the formation, recall, and extinction of contextual fear memories.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99337">Single-cell dissection of prognostic architecture and immunotherap response in Helicobacter pylori infection-associated gastric cancer</a></h4>

              
                Most of the human gastric cancer (GC) worldwide are ascribed to <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>infections, which have a detrimental effect on the immunotherapy’s efficacy. Comprehensively dissecting the key cell players and molecular pathways associated with cancer immunotherapies is critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies against <i>H. pylori</i> infection-associated human GC. We performed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome analysis of nine GC patients with current <i>H. pylori</i> infection (HpGC), three GC patients with previous <i>H. pylori</i> infection (ex-HpGC), six GC patients without <i>H. pylori</i> infection (non-HpGC), and six healthy controls (HC). We also investigated key cell players and molecular pathways associated with GC immunotherapy outcomes. We revealed the molecular heterogeneity of different cell components in GC, including epithelium, immune cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) at the single-cell level. The malignant epithelium of HpGC exhibited high expression level of inflammatory and epithelial–mesenchymal transition signature, HpGC and ex-HpGC were enriched with VEGFA+ angiogenic tumor-associated macrophages (Angio-TAM) and IL11+ inflammatory CAF (iCAF), characterized by high expression levels of NECTIN2 and VEGFA/B. Additionally, we found significant correlations between the abundance of iCAF with Angio-TAM and TIGIT+ suppressive T cells, and iCAF interacted with Angio-TAM through the VEGF and ANGPTL angiogenic pathways. We also developed an immune signature and angiogenic signature and demonstrated that the iCAF abundance and angiogenic signature could predict poor immunotherapy outcomes in GC. We revealed the transcriptome characteristics and heterogeneity of various cellular constituents of HpGC patients and demonstrated that a synergistic combination of immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic targeted therapy may be an effective therapeutic modality for HpGC patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91779">PI3Kα inhibition blocks osteochondroprogenitor specification and the hyper-inflammatory response to prevent heterotopic ossification</a></h4>

              
                Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs following mechanical trauma and burns, or congenitally in patients suffering from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Recently, we demonstrated that inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PI3Kα) may be a useful therapy for patients undergoing HO. In this study, using the already marketed BYL719/Alpelisib/Piqray drug, we have further confirmed these results, detailed the underlying mechanisms of action, and optimized the timing of the administration of BYL719. We found that BYL719 effectively prevents HO even when administered up to 3–7 days after injury. We demonstrate in cell cultures and in a mouse model of HO that the major actions of BYL719 are on-target effects through the inhibition of PI3Kα, without directly affecting ACVR1 or FOP-inducing ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> kinase activities. In vivo, we found that a lack of PI3Kα in progenitors at injury sites is sufficient to prevent HO. Moreover, time course assays in HO lesions demonstrate that BYL719 not only blocks osteochondroprogenitor specification but also reduces the inflammatory response. BYL719 inhibits the migration, proliferation, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and mast cells, suggesting that BYL719 hampers the hyper-inflammatory status of HO lesions. Altogether, these results highlight the potential of PI3Kα inhibition as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for HO.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100604">Glycolytic flux controls retinal progenitor cell differentiation via regulating Wnt signaling</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic pathways are remodeled in response to energy and other homeostatic demands and are dynamically regulated during embryonic development, suggesting a role in guiding cellular differentiation. Here, we show that glycolytic flux is required and sufficient to bias multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) to acquire a rod photoreceptor fate in the murine retina. In RPC-specific <i>Phosphatase and tensin homolog</i> conditional knockout (<i>Pten-</i>cKO) and RPC-specific conditional gain-of-function of dominant active PFKFB3 (cytoPFKFB3) mice, glycolytic gene expression and activity are elevated, correlating with precocious rod photoreceptor differentiation and outer segment (OS) maturation. Conversely, glycolytic inhibition in retinal explants suppresses RPC proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation, achieved either with 2-deoxy-<span class="small-caps">D</span>-glucose, a competitive inhibitor of glucose metabolism, by lowering media pH, which disables PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme, or by inhibiting lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporters, which lowers intracellular pH. Mechanistically, we show that Wnt signaling, the top-upregulated pathway in <i>Pten-</i>cKO retinas, is a glycolysis-dependent pathway. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of Wnt signaling by knocking-out <i>Ctnnb1</i>, encoding β-catenin, phenocopies glycolytic inhibition, suppressing RPC proliferation, photoreceptor differentiation, and OS maturation. Thus, developmental rewiring of glycolytic flux modulates Wnt signaling to drive rod photoreceptor differentiation and maturation, an instructive role that may be exploited therapeutically for cell replacement strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99650">Executioner caspase is proximal to Fasciclin 3 which facilitates non-lethal activation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons</a></h4>

              
                The nervous system undergoes functional modification independent of cell turnover. Caspase participates in reversible neuronal modulation via non-lethal activation. However, the mechanism that enables non-lethal activation remains unclear. Here, we analyzed proximal proteins of <i>Drosophila</i> executioner caspase in the adult brain using TurboID. We discovered that executioner caspase Drice is, as an inactive proform, proximal to cell membrane proteins, including a specific splicing isoform of cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 3 (Fas3), Fas3G. To investigate whether sequestration of executioner caspase to plasma membrane of axons is the mechanism for non-lethal activation, we developed a Gal4-Manipulated Area-Specific CaspaseTracker/CasExpress system for sensitive monitoring of caspase activity near the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that <i>Fas3G</i> overexpression promotes caspase activation in olfactory receptor neurons without killing them, by inducing expression of initiator caspase Dronc, which also comes close to Fas3G. Physiologically, <i>Fas3G</i> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation suppresses innate olfactory attraction behavior. Our findings suggest that subcellularly restricted caspase activation, defined by caspase-proximal proteins, is the mechanism for non-lethal activation, opening the methodological development of reversible modification of neuronal function via regulating caspase-proximal proteins.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In recent years, researchers have integrated the historically separate, reinforcement learning (RL), and evidence-accumulation-to-bound approaches to decision modeling. A particular outcome of these efforts has been the RL-DDM, a model that combines value learning through reinforcement with a diffusion decision model (DDM). While the RL-DDM is a conceptually elegant extension of the original DDM, it faces a similar problem to the DDM in that it does not scale well to decisions with more than two options. Furthermore, in its current form, the RL-DDM lacks flexibility when it comes to adapting to rapid, context-cued changes in the reward environment. The question of how to best extend combined RL and DDM models so they can handle multiple choices remains open. Moreover, it is currently unclear how these algorithmic solutions should map to neurophysical processes in the brain, particularly in relation to so-called go/no-go-type models of decision making in the basal ganglia. Here, we propose a solution that addresses these issues by combining a previously proposed decision model based on the multichoice sequential probability ratio test (MSPRT), with a dual-pathway model of decision threshold learning in the basal ganglia region of the brain. Our model learns decision thresholds to optimize the trade-off between time cost and the cost of errors and so efficiently allocates the amount of time for decision deliberation. In addition, the model is context dependent and hence flexible to changes to the speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) in the environment. Furthermore, the model reproduces the magnitude effect, a phenomenon seen experimentally in value-based decisions and is agnostic to the types of evidence and so can be used on perceptual decisions, value-based decisions, and other types of modeled evidence. The broader significance of the model is that it contributes to the active research area of how learning systems interact by linking the previously separate models of RL-DDM to dopaminergic models of motivation and risk taking in the basal ganglia, as well as scaling to multiple alternatives.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Memory is a complex process in the brain that involves the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of previously experienced stimuli. The brain is capable of rapidly forming memories of sensory input. However, applying the memory system to real-world data poses challenges in practical implementation. This article demonstrates that through the integration of sparse spike pattern encoding scheme population tempotron, and various spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rules, supported by bounded weights and biological mechanisms, it is possible to rapidly form stable neural assemblies of external sensory inputs in a spiking neural circuit model inspired by the hippocampal structure. The model employs neural ensemble module and competitive learning strategies that mimic the pattern separation mechanism of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) area to achieve nonoverlapping sparse coding. It also uses population tempotron and NMDA-(N-methyl-D-aspartate)mediated STDP to construct associative and episodic memories, analogous to the CA3 and CA1 regions. These memories are represented by strongly connected neural assemblies formed within just a few trials. Overall, this model offers a robust computational framework to accommodate rapid memory throughout the brain-wide memory process.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Collective neuronal activity in the brain synchronizes during rest and desynchronizes during active behaviors, influencing cognitive processes such as memory consolidation, knowledge abstraction, and creative thinking. These states involve significant modulation of inhibition, which alters the excitation–inhibition (EI) balance of synaptic inputs. However, the influence of the EI balance on collective neuronal oscillation remains only partially understood. In this study, we introduce the EI-Kuramoto model, a modified version of the Kuramoto model, in which oscillators are categorized into excitatory and inhibitory groups with four distinct interaction types: excitatory–excitatory, excitatory–inhibitory, inhibitory–excitatory, and inhibitory–inhibitory. Numerical simulations identify three dynamic states—synchronized, bistable, and desynchronized—that can be controlled by adjusting the strength of the four interaction types. Theoretical analysis further demonstrates that the balance among these interactions plays a critical role in determining the dynamic states. This study provides valuable insights into the role of EI balance in synchronizing coupled oscillators and neurons.</span>

">AAV gene therapy for GBA-PD and Gaucher Disease</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in GBA1, the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the most common risk factor for Parkinson's Disease (PD). GBA-PD patients are a well-defined genetic subpopulation of PD carrying heterozygous mutations in GBA1. Additionally, bi-allelic mutations in GBA1 cause Gaucher Disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder. Reduction or loss of GCase activity, a lysosomal enzyme leads to the accumulation of lipid substrates within lysosomes, disrupting lipid homeostasis and promoting cellular toxicity. Here, we report an AAV-mediated GBA1 replacement strategy to treat GD and GBA-PD by a one-time infusion via intravenous (GD Type 1) or intra-CSF (GBA-PD) route of administration. We engineered human GCase to be readily secretable to facilitate cross-correction across tissues. We developed CBE (conduritol beta-epoxide) induced lipid accumulation models both in mice and non-human primates (NHPs) to assess efficacy of our engineered constructs. Based on data across both species, we nominated AAV.GMU01 SS3-GBA1 as our lead candidate. SS3-GBA1 is robustly secreted, cross-corrects across cell types in the brain and promotes lipid clearance. By comparing human GCase levels in AAV-treated NHP brains to healthy human donor brain, we demonstrate that AAV.GMU01 SS3-GBA1 replenishes the GCase deficit seen in GBA-PD patients, thus, restoring GCase to near-physiological levels. Furthermore, intravenous dosing of SS3-GBA1 promotes lipid clearance across liver, spleen, bone marrow and muscle, key target tissues in GD Type 1. Importantly, AAV.GMU01 SS3-GBA1 is well-tolerated with no adverse findings. Collectively, our data establish a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Gaucher Disease and GBA-associated Parkinson's Disease with a single gene therapy product.

">Preclinical evaluation of CHDI-009R for quantification of mutant huntingtin aggregates</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT) that subsequently leads to aggregation of the mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. Thus, lowering mHTT is a key therapeutic approach used by several candidate therapeutics currently under investigation. Visualization of the efficiency of these therapeutics through in vivo mHTT quantification rises in importance. For positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mHTT aggregates, it is critical to characterize the in vivo kinetic profile of newly identified mHTT binders to assess their translational application. Here, we report the evaluation of [11C]CHDI-009R, a PET imaging radioligand with higher affinity and selectivity for mHTT aggregates than previously reported radioligands, in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175DN mouse model of HD wild-type (WT) littermates at 9 and 3 months of age. [11C]CHDI-009R displayed high stability in plasma and brain, which was reflected in brain kinetics as demonstrated by rapid uptake followed by relatively slow elimination. Kinetic modeling and volume of distribution VT (IDIF) indicated the radioligand's ability to quantify mHTT aggregation at 9 months of age with clear genotype differentiation (p<0.0001). [11C]CHDI-009R showed an excellent test-retest reliability in 9-month-old mice (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.62 - 0.79). A phenotypic difference in mHTT aggregates was also observed in 3-month-old mice in several brain structures (p<0.05) and was confirmed with [3H]CHDI-009R autoradiography. Overall, this study suggests [11C]CHDI-009R is a promising radioligand for the detection of cerebral mHTT aggregates in a mouse model of HD and supports its advance to clinical evaluation.

">High throughput machine learning pipeline to characterize larval zebrafish motor behavior</a></h4>

              
                Using machine learning, we developed models that rigorously detect and classify larval zebrafish spontaneous and stimulus-evoked behaviors in various well plate formats. Zebrafish are an ideal model system for investigating the neural substrates underlying behavior due to their simple nervous system and well-documented responses to environmental stimuli. To track movement, we utilized an 8 key point pose estimation model, allowing precise capture of zebrafish kinematics. Using this kinematic data, we trained two random forest classifiers in a semi-supervised learning framework to classify various discreet behavioral outputs including stationary, scoot, turn, acoustic-startle like behavior, and visual-startle like behavior. The classifiers were trained on a manually labeled dataset, and their accuracy was validated showing high precision. To validate our machine learning models, we analyzed behavioral outputs during various stimulus evoked responses and during spontaneous behavior. For additional validation, and to show the utility of our recording and analysis pipeline, we investigated the locomotor effects of several established drugs with well-defined impacts on neurophysiology. Here we show that machine learning model development, enabled by semi-supervised learning developed classification models, provide detailed insights into the behavioral phenotypes of zebrafish, offering a powerful, high throughput method for studying neural control of behavior.

">Noradrenaline and microglia maintain plasticity-rigidity balance to safeguard rapid emotional learning in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Balancing plasticity and rigidity is essential for brain function. While the neocortex typically shifts toward rigidity during development to preserve circuit integrity, certain forms of socially acquired emotional learning involve rapid remodeling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), raising the question of how such flexibility is achieved without compromising pre-existing representations. We found that activity-dependent dendritic spine enlargement is actively suppressed by microglia via a humoral factor in the adolescent mPFC. Noradrenaline lifted this suppression through cAMP signaling in microglia, permitting spine enlargement. Disruption of this noradrenaline-dependent pathway in the mPFC impaired the rapid acquisition of socially learned fear. Conversely, localized microglial ablation enhanced learning efficiency but disrupted emotional boundaries, inducing social fear learning to alter pain sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that noradrenaline and microglia regulate the plasticity-rigidity balance within an optimal range in the mPFC, enabling rapid social learning while safeguarding the functional segregation of emotional circuits.

">Alpha rhythm subharmonics underlie responsiveness to theta burst stimulation via calcium metaplasticity</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique to modulate brain activity, often used in treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) by targeting fronto-limbic circuitry. Despite its clinical utility, optimizing rTMS protocols remains challenging due to the complex and variable effects of stimulation parameter changes on synaptic plasticity. Oscillatory brain activity, measurable via Electroencephalography (EEG), serves as a biomarker for functional circuits and treatment response. To better understand the impact of rTMS on brain oscillations and connectivity, we used computational modeling of corticothalamic circuits to explore the mechanisms of stimulus-induced plasticity. We integrated calcium-dependent plasticity (CaDP) with Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) metaplasticity formulations in a neural population model of resting-state EEG. By varying protocol parameters, we simulated iTBS effects on spectral power, synaptic efficacy, and calcium concentrations. Our findings highlight a resonance between theta stimulation and individual resting-state alpha rhythms, enhancing incoming excitatory long-term depression (LTD) and inhibitory long-term potentiation (LTP), leading to corticothalamic feed-forward inhibition (FFI). Induced effects were encapsulated by a weakening of corticothalamic loops and enhancement of intrathalamic loops. This work offers a novel paradigm for individualizing iTBS treatments, provides insights into the neurophysiological basis of clinical responsiveness, and offers a framework with which to derive tailored protocols.

">Emergence of multifrequency activity in a laminar neural mass model</a></h4>

              
                Neural mass models (NMMs) aim to capture the principles underlying mesoscopic neural activity representing the average behavior of large neural populations in the brain. Recently, a biophysically grounded laminar NMM (LaNMM) has been proposed, capable of generating coupled slow and fast oscillations resulting from interactions between different cortical layers. This concurrent oscillatory activity provides a mechanistic framework for studying information processing mechanisms and various disease-related oscillatory dysfunctions. We show that this model can exhibit periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic oscillations. Additionally we demonstrate, through bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations, the emergence of rhythmic activity and various frequency couplings in the model, including delta-gamma, theta-gamma, and alpha-gamma couplings. We also examine how alterations linked with Alzheimer's disease impair the model's ability to display multifrequency activity. Furthermore, we show that the model remains robust when coupled to another neural mass. Together, our results offer a dynamical systems perspective of the laminar NMM model, thereby providing a foundation for future modeling studies and investigations into cognitive processes that depend on cross-frequency coupling.

">A confound-free method to manipulate pupil size in psychological experiments</a></h4>

              
                Those who study visual perception and visuo-spatial attention are increasingly paying interest to the ways in which these processes are influenced by the size of the pupil. However, this realm of research is complicated by the pupil's notorious susceptibility to confounders and difficulties in disentangling cause and effect. Recent studies have sought a solution in the exploitation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which trigger pupil constrictions upon detecting blue light. Experiments typically present stimuli against blue versus red backgrounds of equal perceived luminance, to effectuate systematically smaller pupils in the former than in the latter condition. Here we provide a further validation of this method, by testing a scenario of potential concern. Via retino-hypothalamic pathways, ipRGC activation modulates alertness and arousal. Blue and red backgrounds may therefore differentially impact behavior in addition to the pupil, potentially confounding inferences about the pupil's impact on cognition. This was investigated with an auditory task in which participants responded as quickly as possible to sequences of randomly timed beeps while looking at blue versus red displays. Each participant was tested with an easy and a difficult version of the auditory task. Results suggest that the ipRGC method is good to go: in the presence of effects of task difficulty on both pupil size and task performance, the display color exclusively influenced pupil size without affecting task performance.

">Minocycline treatment affects astrocyte - microglia - neuron interaction and functional compensation of motor deficits in rat model of combined fluorocitrate and 6-OHDA lesion and early Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Prolonged nervous system inflammation and glia activation are among hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. There are no therapies slowing pathology. Microglia and astrocytes are considered targets for disease modifying strategies. Nigrostriatal neurodegeneration causes locomotor dysfunction but at early stages can be compensated. Interaction between neurons, microglia and astrocytes could be essential for this functional adaptation and neuronal survival in long-term. The aim was to check how microglia activation inhibition affects neuron and astrocyte cell death caused by selective toxins and how it affects locomotion and potential for spontaneous functional compensation of motor deficits at the early stages of Parkinson's disease. In a rat model of fluorocitrate (FC)-induced astrocyte death and microglia activation combined with 6-OHDA selective dopaminergic system neurodegeneration we analyzed anti-inflammatory effect of minocycline on each of the cell type and on functional behavioral output. In result, reduced microglia activation by minocycline probably prevented part of astrocytes from FC-induced cell death. Microglia inhibition caused non-dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a group treated by both neurotoxins but still enhanced compensatory potential to functionally improve walking deficits caused by dopaminergic lesion. It seems that activation of microglia by dying astrocytes vs dying neurons induced varied mechanisms. Inhibition of strong microglia activation could be protective for astrocytes but microglia is also important for neuronal adaptation, therefore suppression of its activation perturbs structural rebuilding during progressive neurodegeneration affecting functional outcome. Understanding the relationship between neuronal death, astrocyte loss of function and microglial response could help to identify new, non-neuronal pharmacological target for healing various neurodegenerative diseases.

">Behavioural, biochemical and functional phenotyping of chronic exposure to chlordecone in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background. Chlordecone (CLD) is a persistent organochloride pesticide formerly used against banana weevil. It is detectable in blood samples from a large proportion of the population in the French Caribbean Islands. Several experimental studies have demonstrated acute neurotoxicity of CLD, but the effect of a subchronic exposure to CLD remains to be studied. Methods. Young adult male mice were injected intraperitoneally with 3 mg/kg CLD (n=34) or vehicle (n=22), twice a week, for eight weeks. Behavior, regional brain accumulation, and effects on the dopaminergic system were studied. In addition, functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) was used to probe the visual, somatosensory and dopaminergic pathways. Results. CLD was detected in all brain regions (5-15 mg/kg) after two-month exposure, without any marked impact on behavior (anxiety, motor coordination, memory). The dopaminergic system was mostly unaffected, despite slight decreases in the number of TH-positive neurons and the expression of VMAT2, quantified in a subset of animals. fUSi highlighted a decreased response to the visual stimulation in CLD-exposed animals, in contrast to the sensorimotor response, which was found unaltered. Conclusion. The two-month-long, systemic, exposure to an intermediate dose of CLD resulted in a mostly unaffected phenotype, with a normal behavior and a largely intact dopaminergic system. Interestingly, functional ultrasound imaging was able to detect an altered visual response, which has also been noted in Parkinson s disease. This study position functional ultrasound imaging as a promising technique to capture early signs of neurotoxicity, opening up opportunities for toxico-fUS in the field of neurotoxicology.

">Complement C3aR deletion does not attenuate neurodegeneration in a tauopathy model or alter acute inflammation-induced gene expression changes in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant activation of the classical complement pathway in the brain is implicated in contributing to synapse loss and neurodegeneration in various neurodegenerative conditions. Given that C3aR is a druggable target in the complement pathway, we evaluated the potential of C3aR KO to rescue neurodegeneration in a tauopathy model and neuroinflammatory responses in an acute endotoxemia model. We found that C3aR KO did not rescue tau pathology, microglia activation markers, neurodegeneration, or behavioral abnormalities in tauopathy model mice. While we found that endotoxemia resulted in numerous transcriptional changes including distinct alterations in subpopulations of microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, C3aR KO did not impact these alterations. Together, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of blocking the complement classical pathway in neurodegeneration models is likely independent of C3aR activation and raise questions about the rationale for therapeutically targeting C3aR for neurodegenerative disease.

">HIPPOCAMPAL THETA OSCILLATIONS DURING CONTROLLED SPEED RUNS ON A TREADMILL</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal theta (6-12 Hz) oscillations coordinate neural activity during spatial navigation and are strongly related to locomotion speed. However, recent research has yielded conflicting evidence on whether theta rhythms are primarily modulated by acceleration or instantaneous speed. Moreover, the role of movement transitions - at locomotion onset and offset - has often been overlooked, despite potentially involving distinct dynamics not explained by speed or acceleration alone. Previous studies have rarely controlled for locomotion timing and speed, limiting our ability to dissociate the contributions of speed, acceleration, and movement transitions. To address this, we used a computer-controlled treadmill to induce rat locomotion under three distinct conditions: (a) movement transitions, (b) steady running at constant speed, and (c) locomotion with continuous acceleration . This setup allowed precise spectral analysis of hippocampal theta oscillations across conditions. We found that treadmill-triggered movement transitions produced sustained increases in theta power and transient increases in theta frequency. Upon treadmill stop, theta power decreased slowly, whereas theta frequency dropped rapidly. Steady running elevated both theta power and frequency relative to rest. During constant-speed trials, both metrics increased with speed and remained stable over time. Notably, the acceleration rate itself had no effect on theta power or frequency. Instead, during accelerating trials, theta frequency increased progressively with instantaneous speed, underscoring speed as the primary modulator. In summary, our results show that movement transitions induce distinct, sustained changes in theta power and transient changes in theta frequency, while instantaneous speed - not acceleration - governs hippocampal theta frequency.

">Brain Representations of Natural Sound Statistics</a></h4>

              
                Natural sound textures, such as rain or crackling fire, are defined by time-averaged summary statistics that shape their perceptual identity. Variations in these statistics provide a controlled means to examine how the human brain processes complex auditory structure. In this study, we investigated how such statistics are represented along the ascending auditory pathway, within auditory cortex, and in high-level regions involved in natural pattern analysis. Using fMRI, we measured brain responses to synthetic sound textures in which higher-order statistical structure was systematically degraded while preserving the overall texture category. Participants listened to sounds with varying levels of naturalness, defined by their statistical fidelity to real-world textures, and performed a perceptual comparison task, judging whether two sequentially presented sounds matched in naturalness. We observed that increasing naturalness elicited stronger BOLD responses across bilateral auditory cortex for both reference and test sounds. Activity in medial temporal lobe regions, including the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, was modulated by naturalness in a position-dependent manner. The entorhinal cortex activity was modulated only during the test sound, suggesting a role in perceptual-mnemonic comparison. The hippocampal connectivity with the auditory cortex increased when reference textures were more degraded or less natural, indicating top-down inference under uncertainty. Together, these findings highlight the interplay between bottom-up encoding and memory-based mechanisms in supporting judgments of auditory realism based on summary statistics.

">Robust functional ultrasound imaging in the awake and behaving brain: a systematic framework for motion artifact removal</a></h4>

              
                Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a promising tool for studying brain activity in awake and behaving animals, offering insights into neural dynamics that are more naturalistic than those obtained under anesthesia. However, motion artifacts pose a significant challenge, introducing biases that can compromise the integrity of the data. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking of strategies for detecting and removing motion artifacts in transcranial fUSI acquisitions of awake mice. We evaluated 792 denoising strategies across four datasets, focusing on clutter filtering, scrubbing, frequency filtering, and confound regression methods. Our findings highlight the superior performance of adaptive clutter filtering and aCompCor confound regression in mitigating motion artifacts while preserving functional connectivity patterns. We also demonstrate that high-pass filtering is generally more effective than band-pass filtering in the presence of motion artifacts. Additionally, we show that with effective clutter filtering, scrubbing may become optional, which is particularly beneficial for experimental designs where motion correlates with conditions of interest. Based on these insights, we propose two optimized denoising paradigms tailored to different experimental constraints, providing practical recommendations for enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of fUSI data. Our findings challenge current practices in the field and have immediate practical implications for existing fUSI analysis workflows, paving the way for more sophisticated applications of fUSI in studying complex brain functions and dysfunctions in awake experimental paradigms.

">Alpha-synuclein overexpression without vocalization deficits in a mouse model of parkinsonism.</a></h4>

              
                Voice deficits are common in Parkinson disease (PD) and significantly impact quality of life by increasing stress, social isolation, and caregiver burden. However, despite this impact, there are currently no treatments that target the underlying pathophysiology of PD in the vocalization system. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of one possible underlying mechanism responsible for the complex voice deficits that exist in PD; overexpression of the protein alpha-synuclein. Results show that overexpression of alpha-synuclein, prior to the development of alpha-synuclein aggregate pathology, does not result in significant vocalization deficits. A small but statistically significant increase in the total number of complex vocalizations was found in mice overexpressing alpha-synuclein compared to wildtype mice, but there were no differences in complexity ratio or any of the other specific vocalization parameters tested. Results provide a critical foundational understanding of the impact of overexpression versus aggregation of alpha-synuclein on voice deficits in PD. Future work will focus on manipulation of alpha-synuclein aggregate pathology, and not overexpression alone, to reduce or eliminate the burden of PD specific voice disorders.

">SNCA-targeted epigenome therapy for Parkinsons disease alleviates pathological and behavioral perturbations in a mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) overexpression is implicated in Parkinsons disease (PD) pathogenesis, making SNCA downregulation a promising therapeutic strategy. We developed a SNCA-targeted epigenome therapy using an all-in-one lentiviral vector (LV) carrying deactivated CRISPR/(d)Cas9, gRNA targeted at SNCA-intron1, and either the catalytic domain of DNA-methyltransferase3A (DNMT3A), or a synthetic repressor molecule of Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)/ methyl CpG binding protein 2 transcription repression domain (MeCp2-TRD). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a new PD mouse model, generated with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying an engineered minigene comprised of the human (h)A53T-SNCA expressed via the human native regulatory region. Both therapeutic vectors reduced expression of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra (SN), with LV/dSaCas9- KRAB-MeCP2(TRD) demonstrating greater repression. LV/dSaCas9- KRAB-MeCP2(TRD) also significantly reduced pathological alpha-synuclein aggregation and phosphorylation (Ser129), and preserved tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the SN and the striatum. Behavioral analysis following LV/dSaCas9-KRAB-MeCP2(TRD) injection, showed significant improvement in motor deficits characteristic of our PD-mouse model. Safety assessments found normal blood counts, serum chemistry, and weights. Collectively, we provide in vivo proof-of-concept for our SNCA-targeted epigenome therapy in a PD-mouse model. Our results support the systems therapeutic potential for PD and related synucleinopathies and establish the foundation for further preclinical studies toward investigational new drug enablement.

">Meteorin resolves nociceptive hypersensitivity by reducing connexin-mediated coupling in satellite glial cells</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a persistent condition arising from injury to the nervous system, involves complex interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells, including satellite glial cells (SGCs) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In this study, we examined the glial-targeting effects of meteorin, a neurotrophic protein with gliogenic properties, using mouse models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Systemic meteorin administration reversed mechanical hypersensitivity across diverse neuropathic and inflammatory pain models, with therapeutic effects persisting beyond the treatment period. We identified SGCs as the principal site of meteorin expression and action in the DRG, where it selectively activated SGCs and altered their functional state. Proteomic profiling revealed meteorin-mediated downregulation of gap junction proteins in SGCs, particularly connexin 43, which was corroborated by immunohistochemical analyses. Functional assessments demonstrated that meteorin treatment normalized injury-induced increases in intercellular coupling between SGCs, establishing a mechanistic link between glial network modulation and pain resolution. These findings identify meteorin as a regulator of SGC communication through connexin-dependent mechanisms. The sustained therapeutic effects and multi-model efficacy highlight meteorin as a potential intervention for neuropathic pain while advancing our understanding of SGC plasticity in sensory processing.

">Global hypoperfusion leads to a mismatch in oxygen delivery and consumption in the cerebral watershed area</a></h4>

              
                Despite the pivotal role of pial collaterals in maintaining cerebral blood flow during focal brain ischemia, it is largely unexplored how the microvascular blood flow and oxygenation in the watershed "pial-collateral territory" differ from those in the territory supplied by the major arteries during chronic global hypoperfusion. To answer this question, we applied 2-photon microscopy and Doppler optical coherence tomography to investigate the changes in cerebral microvascular blood flow and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), induced by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). The measurements were performed in the somatosensory cortex that is supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and in the adjacent watershed area in the awake, head-restrained C57BL/6 mice, via the chronic cranial window. The results showed that the BCAS induced a larger decrease in capillary red blood cell (RBC) flux in the watershed area than in the MCA territory, especially in the subcortical white matter. Besides, PO2 in the pial collaterals was significantly lower than that in the upstream MCA segments under control conditions. However, the PO2 changes in the arteries and veins under global hypoperfusion displayed different trends in the two interrogated regions, resulting in a significant increase in oxygen extraction fraction in the watershed area. These findings suggest a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand in the watershed area due to global hypoperfusion and increased subcortical white matter vulnerability. We have also observed dilation of the pial collaterals after BCAS, which might suggest a compensatory mechanism to improve the blood flow in the watershed under hypoperfusion.

">Dorsal Striatum Parvalbumin interneurons translatome unveiled</a></h4>

              
                Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the dorsal striatum (DS) are fast-spiking GABAergic cells critical for feedforward inhibition and synaptic integration within basal ganglia circuits. Despite their well-characterized electrophysiological roles, their molecular identity remains incompletely defined. Using the Ribotag approach in Pvalb-Cre mice, we profiled the translatome of DS PV interneurons and identified over 2,700 transcripts significantly enriched (fold-change > 1.5) in this population. Our data validate established PV markers and reveal a distinct molecular signature of DS PV neurons compared to PV interneurons from the nucleus accumbens. Gene ontology analyses highlight prominent expression of genes related to extracellular matrix components, cell adhesion molecules, synaptic organization, ion channels, and neurotransmitter receptors, particularly those mediating glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. Notably, perineuronal net markers were robustly expressed in DS PV interneurons and confirmed by immunofluorescence. Transcriptomic analysis of DS PV neurons following repeated d-amphetamine exposure identified Gm20683 as the only differentially expressed transcript between treated groups. Furthermore, RNAseq analysis of mice subjected to an operant behavior paradigm with two types of food reward (high-palatable diet or standard chow) identified over 1,000 and 100 genes enriched in DS PV neurons from standard and high-palatable masters, respectively. These findings provide a comprehensive molecular profile of DS PV interneurons, distinguishing them from other striatal PV populations, and reveal specific gene expression changes associated with psychostimulant exposure and reward-driven behaviors. Our findings deepen insight into the molecular mechanisms of PV interneuron activity in striatal circuits and their potential roles in neuropsychiatric, motor and reward-related disorders.

">Image-Based Meta- and Mega-Analysis (IBMMA): A Unified Framework for Large-Scale, Multi-Site, Neuroimaging Data Analysis</a></h4>

              
                The increasing scale and complexity of high-dimensional neuroimaging datasets aggregated from multiple study sites present substantial analytic challenges, as existing statistical analysis tools struggle to handle missing voxel-data, suffer from limited computational speed and inefficient memory allocation, and are restricted in the types of statistical designs they are able to model. We introduce Image-Based Meta- & Mega-Analysis (IBMMA), a novel software package implemented in R and Python that provides a unified framework for analyzing diverse neuroimaging features, efficiently handles large-scale datasets through parallel processing, offers flexible statistical modeling options, and properly manages missing voxel-data commonly encountered in multi-site studies. IBMMA produced stronger effect sizes and revealed findings in brain regions that traditional software overlooked due to missing voxel-data resulting in gaps in brain coverage. IBMMA has the potential to accelerate discoveries in neuroscience and enhance the clinical utility of neuroimaging findings.

">Hemispheric Dissociation Revealed by Attentional Isolation and tRNS</a></h4>

              
                Prolonged sensory imbalance, induced by directing attention to one visual field, can paradoxically enhance performance in the opposite, non-attended visual field. This effect is likely driven by the brain's homeostatic mechanisms that regulate excitation and inhibition between hemispheres in homotopic attention processing regions. Here, we employed transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to modulate cortical excitability and probe its role in interhemispheric dynamics controlling visual attention. Specifically, we used a procedure called attentional isolation, where neurotypical participants covertly focused their visual attention in one hemifield (the attended visual field) for 30 minutes. Performance changes in both the unattended (opposite) visual field and the attended visual field were measured following this manipulation. We applied transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over the right or left frontoparietal cortex to modulate the excitability of one hemisphere relative to the other during attention isolation, probing the neural mechanisms underlying the observed contralateral performance shift. Our results showed improved performance in the previously unattended visual field following the attentional isolation period after sham stimulation. However, tRNS revealed a functional dissociation between the hemispheres: right hemisphere active stimulation abolished the performance improvement, while left hemisphere stimulation preserved it. These findings suggest distinct roles for the left and right hemispheres in modulating paradoxical visual performance shifts and may inform the development of novel neurorehabilitation strategies for clinical populations.

">Human Neural Synergy when combining Stevia with a Flavor Modifer and the Neural effects of Sucrose vs Stevia</a></h4>

              
                There is a drive to improve the acceptability of sweeteners like stevia by reducing their off-tastes. The main aim was to examine the synergistic neural effects of combining stevia with a flavor modifier and secondly to examine stevia vs. sucrose due to limited human neuroimaging data and concerns that sweeteners may be more addictive than sugar. In a within-subjects fMRI study, 34 healthy adults (Mean age = 25) tasted four conditions: stevia, stevia plus a flavor modifier, the modifier alone, and sucrose. We analyzed whole-brain responses and focused on regions of interest (ROIs) including the insula, postcentral gyrus, and hypothalamus (identified via meta-analysis of sweet taste processing), as well as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala due to their roles in reward and aversion. Stevia combined with the modifier evoked super-additive responses in the postcentral gyrus, parietal cortex, and occipital gyrus (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected). Compared to stevia alone, the stevia-modifier combination elicited reduced hypothalamic activity (p = 0.008) and the hypothalamus tracked pleasantness and mouth fullness only in this condition. The NAcc tracked mouth fullness more for the modified stevia than for stevia alone, and the amygdala tracked bitterness only in the plain stevia condition. Sucrose elicited higher postcentral gyrus activation than stevia (p = 0.01). We provide first evidence that combining stevia with a flavour modifier reveals synergistic neural activity associated with taste sensation, intensity and multisensory integration. Adding a modifier to stevia could increase unconscious desirability for stevia by masking its bitterness and increasing its mouth fullness.

">Metabolic resilience rules sex-specific pain recovery during hormonal aging: a multi-omics analysis of neuropathy in mice.</a></h4>

              
                Biological aging and sex interact to shape systemic metabolism, yet their role in chronic pain resolution remains unexplored. We hypothesized that metabolic resilience, the ability to flexibly switch fuel sources and maintain energy homeostasis, rules successful recovery from nerve injury in a sex-dependent manner during aging. In 12-month-old male and female mice, corresponding to the perimenopausal phase in females and the onset of hormonal decline in both sexes, we induced sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury and performed multi-omics profiling during Wallerian degeneration, a phase known to trigger long-term neurobiological remodeling. Aging females exhibited early activation of fatty acid oxidation, increased resting energy expenditure, upregulation of mitochondrial redox enzymes and circulating progesterone and corticosterone. Proteomic and metabolomic analysis revealed pentose phosphate pathway enrichment and gluconeogenesis, supporting redox balance and metabolic flexibility. Conversely, males displayed persistent glycolytic reliance, long-chain acylcarnitine accumulation, suppression of adiponectin and PPARgamma, indicating metabolic inflexibility. Longitudinal behavioral analysis revealed that aging females recovered earlier and more fully than aging males, reversing the pattern previously shown in our adult mouse study, where females developed persistent pain and males recovered rapidly. These patterns highlight a non-linear, sex-specific interaction between biological aging and injury response, where hormonal decline reprograms the metabolic trajectory and reshapes pain outcomes. Metabolic resilience governs sex-specific recovery following nerve injury by directing early systemic adaptations that precede and predict long-term pain trajectories. These results define mechanistically anchored, sex- and age-specific biomarkers, and propose preclinical targets for timely, personalized interventions in age-associated neuropathic pain.

                Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to Parkinson' disease (PD) pathogenesis, particularly affecting substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neurons. Here, we investigate how the R1441G mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a key genetic contributor to familial and sporadic PD, impacts mitochondrial function in midbrain DA neurons. Using a BAC transgenic mouse model overexpressing human LRRK2-R1441G, we crossed these mice with TH-mito-roGFP mice, enabling mitochondria-targeted redox imaging in DA neurons. The two-photon imaging of acute brain slices from 3-, 6-, and 10-month-old mice revealed a progressive elevated oxidative stress in SNc DA neurons and their striatal projections, accompanied with reduced respiratory complex activity and decline in mitochondrial health. Spatial transcriptomics via GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler identified molecular changes linked to dysregulated mitochondrial uncoupling protein function and calcium homeostasis. These findings demonstrate age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction in LRRK2-mutant SNc DA neurons, highlighting calcium channels and uncoupling proteins as potential therapeutic targets to slow PD progression.

">Transient recurrent dynamics shape representations in mice</a></h4>

              
                In the brain, different stimuli are represented by responses of a neural population. How is this representation reshaped over time by the dynamics of local recurrent circuits? We investigate this question in Neuropixels recordings of awake behaving mice and recurrent neural network models. We derive a mean-field theory that reduces the dynamics of complex networks to only three relevant dynamical quantities: the mean population activity and two overlaps that reflect the variability of responses within and across stimulus classes, respectively. This theory enables us to quantitatively explain experimental observables and reveals how the three quantities shape the separability of stimulus representations through a dynamic interplay. We measure the information transmitted from multiple stimuli to the responses with an optimally trained readout on the population signal. This reveals a trade-off between more information conveyed with an increasing number of stimuli, and stimuli becoming less separable due to their larger overlap in the finite-dimensional neuronal space. We find that the experimentally observed small population activity lies within a regime where information increases with the number of stimuli, sharply separated from a second regime in which information asymptotically converges to zero -- revealing a crucial advantage of sparse coding.

">Lysergic Acid Diethylamide extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Aging is modulated by nutrient-sensing pathways that integrate metabolic and hormonal cues to regulate growth, stress resilience, and lifespan. Caloric restriction (CR), a well-established intervention, extends longevity in diverse species primarily through inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a classic serotonergic psychedelic with emerging therapeutic applications, remains largely unexplored in the context of aging. Here, we show that LSD treatment significantly extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and reduces age-associated lipofuscin accumulation, indicative of delayed cellular aging. LSD reproduces several CR-like phenotypes, including decreased reproductive output and increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor PHA-4/FOXA, without affecting food intake. Moreover, LSD treatment reduces lipid stores and downregulates global protein synthesis, both hallmark signatures of TOR inhibition. These findings establish LSD as a modulator of evolutionarily conserved longevity pathways and suggest that psychedelic signaling can mimic a caloric restriction-like metabolic state, paving the way for the development of novel geroprotective strategies.

">Whole-body central processing of lateral line inputs encodes flow direction relative to the center-of-mass</a></h4>

              
                From shifting visual scenes to tactile deformations and fluid motion, animals must interpret patterns of sensory flow around their body to construct stable internal models and produce adaptive behavior. Understanding of how such transformations are encoded within the brain remains incomplete. To tackle this question, we leverage the lateral line of larval zebrafish as a tractable sensory system sensitive to fluid motion that is used to steer navigation, feed, and avoid predators. By presenting stimuli of either direction to neuromasts along the body, we used high-resolution calcium imaging to map hindbrain responses. Unexpectedly, our findings challenge the notion that central lateral line processing lacks topographic structure by revealing a simple yet powerful principle centered on a egocentric spatial framework: the direction and location of local flow motions are encoded in reference to the animals center-of-mass. This simple representation enables the brain to register complex flow patterns and provides a robust basis for subsequent behavioral action selection. MON neurons that encode flow toward the center-of-mass broadly project to form bilateral connections onto reticulospinal neurons that coordinate forward locomotion while MON neurons that encode flow away from the center-of-mass displayed a more selective and unilateral projection profile to command neurons for turns. Our discovery represents a shift from purely somatotopic encoding toward an integrative representation of axial position and directionality combined, revealing a novel principle of encoding spatio-directional cues in the hindbrain. This study advances our understanding of how complex mechanosensory inputs select appropriate motor outputs via simple egocentric neural maps in the hindbrain.

">Innervation and cargo-specific axonal transport impairments in FUS-ALS mice with gain and loss of function</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the RNA-binding protein FUS lead to nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic mislocalisation of the protein and cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using a novel FUS-ALS mouse model, we found that adult mutant mice develop loss of function transcriptomic alterations, along with aberrant cytoplasmic partitioning associated with translatome deficits. Neuromuscular junction innervation was selectively impaired in FUS-ALS females; however, reinnervation following sciatic nerve crush was equally perturbed in both sexes. Additionally, we observed cargo-specific axonal transport alterations, a process critical for neuronal maintenance. In vivo mitochondrial transport was impaired across FUS-ALS mice, whereas the transport of signalling endosomes was selectively disrupted in mutant females. Altogether, our findings identify broader and sex-dependent motor neuron dysfunction in FUS-ALS, emphasise the link between endosomal transport impairments and denervation in disease, and establish FUS-ALS mice as a valuable model for investigating early cellular impairments driving ALS pathology.

">The precision of attention controls attraction of population receptive fields</a></h4>

              
                We alter our sampling of visual space not only by where we direct our gaze but also by where and how we direct our attention. Attention attracts receptive fields toward the attended position, but our understanding of this process is limited. Here we show that the degree of this attraction towards the attended locus is dictated not just by the attended position, but also by the precision of attention. We manipulated attentional precision while using 7T fMRI to measure population receptive field (pRF) properties. Participants performed the same color-proportion detection task either focused at fixation (0.1{ring} radius) or distributed across the entire display (more than 5{ring} radius). We observed BOLD response amplitude increases as a function of the task, with selective increases in foveal pRFs for the focused attention task and vice versa for the distributed attention task. Furthermore, cortical spatial tuning changed as a function of attentional precision. Specifically, focused attention more strongly attracted pRFs towards the attended locus compared to distributed attention. This attraction also depended on the degree of overlap between a pRF and the attention field. A Gaussian attention field model with an offset on the attention field explained our results. Together, our observations indicate the spatial distribution of attention dictates the degree of its resampling of visual space.

">Developing a Sensory Representation of an Artificial Body Part</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory feedback is crucial for motor control, yet artificial limbs are thought to lack such feedback. We investigated whether the physical interaction of artificial limbs with the body generates informative sensory signals, and whether such naturally-mediated feedback can drive a distinct representation of an artificial limb. We examined the perceptual, neural and phenomenological bases of this "natural" somatosensory representation using an extra robotic digit ('Third Thumb'; Dani Clode Design), used for hand augmentation. We first compared the perceptual representation of naturally mediated somatosensory signals via the Third Thumb (D6) against state-of-the-art artificial touch feedback systems. Across material discrimination tasks, participants performed comparably, or outperformed, with "natural" feedback, demonstrating versatile and intuitive interpretation of natural sensory signals. To then study the emergence and refinement of D6's neural representation, we examined representational similarity patterns in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) using fMRI. Even with minimal motor experience to use D6, the brain immediately organised tactile input from D6 topographically relative to the hand, and distinctively from the palm (where it is attached). Following seven days of D6-biological hand collaboration motor training, this representation refined as it became more similar to the biological digits. This integration was also reflected in increased subjective somatosensory embodiment post-training. Our findings demonstrate that wearable devices naturally provide a powerful source of behaviourally-relevant feedback, which is immediately integrated with our hand representation. While such a representation is already accessible with minimal experience, motor training contributes to stronger integration and embodiment of the artificial device with our somatosensory body representation.

">The contribution of vestibular and proprioceptive signals to trunk stabilization varies between postural tasks and between walking speeds.</a></h4>

              
                Stabilizing the upright posture of the trunk relies on vestibular and proprioceptive afference. Previous studies found that the feedback responses to sensory afference vary between postures and tasks. We investigated whether and how vestibular and proprioceptive afference contribute to trunk stabilization during different postural tasks, and during walking at different speeds. Twelve healthy adults performed tasks in a random order: sitting, standing on the right foot or both feet, and treadmill walking at five speeds: 0.8, 2.0, 3.2, 4.3 and 5.5 km/h, while exposed to unilateral muscle vibration on the right paraspinal muscles at the level of the second lumbar vertebra, or to a step-like electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) with the anode behind the left ear. The mediolateral displacements of markers at the sixth thoracic level and sacrum in the global coordinate system were used to evaluate the responses to sensory stimulation. No significant responses to EVS at T6 and sacrum level were found in sitting and standing. Responses to muscle vibration were significant and differed between unipedal standing compared to sitting and bipedal standing. The latter suggests a different interpretation of the sensation of muscle lengthening in these postures. The magnitude of the responses to both stimuli increased from very slow speeds to moderate speeds. This may indicate that a different control strategy is adopted in walking at slow speeds compared to walking at faster speeds. From moderate to high speeds, the responses decreased, suggesting a decreased demand for feedback control at higher speeds.

                Background Traditional weaving professionals pull cloth manually during the handloom process, which can lead to several unnoticed musculoskeletal disorders. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate the effectiveness of cloth-pulling devices for Praewa silk weavers in Thailand. Methods An experimental trial was conducted using surface electromyography to evaluate weavers’ muscle activity, productivity and perceived satisfaction during the Praewa silk-pulling process while employing traditional cloth pulling, using a standard cloth-pulling device and using an ergonomic prototype cloth-pulling device. Results The results showed that the levels of muscle activity and hand activity with the prototype design were generally lower than those with traditional cloth pulling and with the standard cloth-pulling device (p < 0.01). There was a significant preference for the prototype, based on productivity and perceived satisfaction (p < 0.01). Conclusions The new cloth-pulling device was found to be applicable and acceptable among the weavers. Further research is needed to make appropriate revisions to the ergonomically designed tool based on ergonomic measurements of muscle activity and fatigue under field production conditions. Studies related to workstations and working conditions are needed in the weaving industry sector.

                <p>by Szilvia Barsi, Eszter Varga, Daniel Dimitrov, Julio Saez-Rodriguez, László Hunyady, Bence Szalai</p>

Intracellular signaling initiated from ligand-bound receptors plays a fundamental role in both physiological regulation and development of disease states, making receptors one of the most frequent drug targets. Systems level analysis of receptor activity can help to identify cell and disease type-specific receptor activity alterations. While several computational methods have been developed to analyze ligand-receptor interactions based on transcriptomics data, none of them focuses directly on the receptor side of these interactions. Also, most of the methods use directly the expression of ligands and receptors to infer active interaction, while co-expression of genes does not necessarily indicate functional interactions or activated state. To address these problems, we developed RIDDEN (Receptor actIvity Data Driven inferENce), a computational tool, which predicts receptor activities from the receptor-regulated gene expression profiles, and not from the expressions of ligand and receptor genes. We collected 14463 perturbation gene expression profiles for 229 different receptors. Using these data, we trained the RIDDEN model, which can effectively predict receptor activity for new bulk and single-cell transcriptomics datasets. We validated RIDDEN’s performance on independent <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> receptor perturbation data, showing that RIDDEN’s model weights correspond to known regulatory interactions between receptors and transcription factors, and that predicted receptor activities correlate with receptor and ligand expressions in <i>in vivo</i> datasets. We also show that RIDDEN can be used to identify mechanistic biomarkers in an immune checkpoint blockade-treated cancer patient cohort. RIDDEN, the largest transcriptomics-based receptor activity inference model, can be used to identify cell populations with altered receptor activity and, in turn, foster the study of cell-cell communication using transcriptomics data.

                <p>by Nao Yamamoto, Daniel T. Citron, Samuel M. Mwalili, Duncan K. Gathungu, Diego F. Cuadros, Anna Bershteyn</p>
Background <p>HIV hotspots, regions with higher prevalence than surrounding areas, are observed across Africa, yet their formation and persistence mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that random fluctuations during the early stages of the HIV epidemic (1978–1982), amplified by positive feedback between HIV incidence and prevalence, play a critical role in hotspot formation and persistence. To explore this, we applied a network-based HIV transmission model, focusing on randomness in the spatial structure of the epidemic.</p> Methods <p>We adapted a previously validated agent-based network HIV transmission model, EMOD-HIV, to simulate HIV spread in western Kenya communities. The model includes demographics, age-structured social networks, and HIV transmission, prevention, and treatment. We simulated 250 identical communities, introducing stochastic fluctuations in network structure and case importation. Outliers were defined as communities with prevalence > 1.5x the median, and persistence as meeting these criteria for >70% of 1980–2050. We systematically varied community size (1,000–10,000), importation timing (1978–1982), and importation patterns (spread over 1, 3, or 5 years), and calculated the proportion of outliers and persistent outliers.</p> Results <p>HIV prevalence outliers were more common in smaller communities: in 1990, 25.3% (uncertainty interval: 22.3%–28.2%) of 1,000-person communities vs. 9.1% (uncertainty interval: 6.9%–11.4%) of 10,000-person communities. By 2050, 21.6% of 1,000-person communities were persistent outliers, compared to none in larger communities. Autocorrelation of HIV prevalence was high (Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.801 [95% CI: 0.796–0.806] for 1,000-person communities), reflecting feedback that amplified early fluctuations.</p> Conclusions <p>Early random fluctuations contribute to the emergence and persistence of prevalence outliers, especially in smaller communities. Recognizing the role of randomness in prevalence outlier formation in these settings is crucial for refining HIV control strategies, as traditional methods may overlook these areas. Adaptive surveillance systems can enhance detection and intervention efforts for HIV and future pandemics.</p>

                <p>by Stephen Catterall, Thibaud Porphyre, Glenn Marion</p>

We introduce the inference for populations at risk (iPAR) framework which enables modelling and estimation of spatial disease dynamics in scenarios where the population at risk is unknown or poorly mapped. This framework addresses a gap in spatial infectious disease modelling approaches, with current methods typically requiring data on the spatial distribution of the population at risk. The principles for iPAR are demonstrated in the context of a susceptible-infected disease dynamics model coupled with Bayesian inference implemented via data-augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This implementation of iPAR is tested for a range of scenarios using simulated outbreak data. Results indicate that the method can effectively estimate key properties of disease spread from spatio-temporal case reports and make useful predictions of future spread. The method is then applied to a case study exploring the 2014–2019 Estonian outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in wild boar. Estimates of epidemiological parameters reveal evidence for long distance transmission, as well as disease control via reduction of the wild boar population in Estonia.

                <p>by Chris Scholes, Stephen Coombes, Alan R. Palmer, William S. Rhode, Rob Mill, Christian J. Sumner</p>

The dynamic fluctuations in the amplitude of sound, known as sound envelopes, are ubiquitous in natural sounds and convey information critical for the recognition of speech, and of sounds generally. We are perceptually most sensitive to slow modulations which are most common. However, previous studies of envelope coding in the brainstem found an under-representation of these slow, low-frequency, modulations. Specifically, the synchronization of spike times to the envelope was enhanced in some neuron types, forming channels specialized for envelope processing but tuned to a restricted range of fast, high-frequency, envelopes (200–500 Hz). Here, we show using a historical dataset from cats that previous analyses, which made strong assumptions about the neural code, underestimated the encoding of low-frequency envelopes. While some neurons encode envelope better than others, most encode a wide range of envelope frequencies, and represent slower envelope fluctuations most accurately in their precise patterns of spike times. Identification of envelope frequency from spike-timing was linked to reliability, and to the way that dynamics of spiking interacted with the time-varying envelope. In some of the best-performing neurons, temporally complex “mode-locked” spike patterns served to enhance envelope coding. A second long-standing contradiction was that neural envelope coding is degraded at high sound levels, whilst the perception of envelope is robust at a wide range of sound levels. We find that spike-time encoding of envelope shape becomes level-robust for small populations of neurons. These findings argue against feature-specific coding of envelopes in the brainstem, and for a distributed population spike-time code for which synchrony to the envelope is an incomplete description. This code is accurate for slow fluctuations and robust across sound level. Thus, precise spike-timing information in the brainstem is after-all aligned with the needs of communication and the perception of environmental sounds.

Mammalian oocytes are prone to chromosome segregation errors, which frequently lead into aneuploidy and pregnancy loss. A new study in PLOS Biology addresses the role of the Mad2/SGO2 complex in the control of separase activity in these cells during meiosis.

Separase plays an important role in cleaving cohesin complexes that hold chromosomes together during cell division. This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology showing that control of separase activity is accomplished by cyclin B/CDK1 and securin, and does not involve SGO2 as reported in somatic cells.

                Background Postoperative infectious pneumonia (PIP) is a common and serious complication following cardiothoracic surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve interventions, and thoracic oncologic procedures. It is associated with increased morbidity, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and healthcare burden. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies published between January 2021 and December 2023 were identified from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Eligible studies reported the incidence and/or perioperative risk factors for PIP with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was used for pooled estimates. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO 2025 CRD 420251057914. Available from https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251057914. Results Six high-quality cohort studies involving 4,392 patients were included. The pooled incidence of PIP was 14.8% (95% CI, 10.6%–19.2%). Incidence was highest after thoracic oncologic surgery (17.2%), followed by valve surgery (15.8%) and CABG (13.5%). Significant risk factors included prolonged mechanical ventilation >48 hours (OR: 3.46), age >70 years (OR: 2.71), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 2.95), cardiopulmonary bypass time >120 minutes (OR: 2.63), and left ventricular ejection fraction <40% (OR: 2.38). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 46%) with no publication bias. Conclusions PIP remains a major postoperative concern. Identification of key risk factors enables targeted preventive strategies—early extubation, pulmonary optimization, and standardized care pathways—to reduce PIP incidence and improve outcomes.

                Background The number of overweight people (BMI 25–29.9kg.m-2) in the world is increasing, which increases the risk of health problems and psychological difficulties. To reduce these risks, it is imperative to address unhealthy habits including food and exercise. This qualitative study aimed to explore the needs, perceptions, and preferences of overweight individuals on tailored exercise programs that incorporate educational videos. Methodology Forty Individuals between the age of 18-30 years with a BMI of 25-29.9kg.m-2 were included in the study using Purposive sampling from October 2023 to November 2023. Semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted for 45-60 minutes approximately among both active and inactive overweight individuals by a researcher trained in qualitative research. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was performed using inductive and deductive approaches to identify the recurrent patterns, themes, and insights in the transcribed interviews. Results 8 themes, such as lifestyle factors, exercise explorations, holistic wellbeing and 44 subthemes emerged from the analysis, helping to shed light on the needs, perceptions, and preferences that overweight individuals experience when it comes to their preference for a customized exercise program provided through educational video. The participants wanted personalized regimens that catered to their requirements and levels of fitness. Conclusion In summary, the findings emphasize the value of educational videos that are easy to use, visually appealing, and supported by science. These videos should emphasize technique, varying levels of difficulty, and brief sessions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-238/v3?src=rss">Relationship between the perception of oral health and the quality of life of hospital staff [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Hospital staff’s perception of oral health directly impacts their overall oral health-related well-being (OHRQoL) and their job performance. This study seeks to analyze the relationship between these two dimensions, providing information for designing strategies that promote a healthier work environment. Aim To determine the relationship between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and oral health perceptions in the staff of a level II-1 hospital located in northern Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, with a cross-sectional, applied, and correlational design. Seventy-two participants participated. The validated OHIP-14 and HU-DBI questionnaires were used, with reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, appropriate for ordinal variables, was used for data analysis. Results A statistically significant association was found between health-related quality of life and subjective perception of oral status (Rho = 0.391, p < 0.05), with an explained variance of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R-squared. The most frequently associated quality of life dimensions were physical disability (Rho = 0.319; p < 0.05) and social disability (Rho = 0.242; p < 0.05). Excellent quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while poor oral health was the most common (52.8%). Conclusion The findings show a significant relationship between self-perceived oral health and oral health-related quality of life in this group of professionals. Promoting oral health strategies tailored to the hospital setting is recommended to improve workplace well-being.

                Background The aim of this study was to observe and analyze vascular function in ‘prolonged sitting’, followed by a yoga asana routine and pranayama intervention. Participants in this study include those who work from desks in offices. The study required the participants to attend on three separate days at random, and they had to finish a computerized test on each day. On the first day, participants were required to complete a computer test while sitting still for four hours (with the exception of washroom breaks). The next day, they underwent a computerized test along with a pranayama intervention. Finally, on the last day, they underwent a computerized test along with a yoga asana intervention. At the start of the study and after two and four hours, we measured the diameter and velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Methods The study was a within-subjects prospective single-center trial conducted in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India, between September 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to do one of the following ‘activities’ over successive weeks: Week 1 – Prolonged sitting; Week 2 – Pranayama intervention; and Week 3 – Yoga asana intervention during prolonged sitting. The baseline and follow-up variables of pulse velocity, endothelial thickness, and shear rate were assessed for normality through a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Results Our sample included 11 participants with moderate physical activity, five with high physical activity and one with low physical activity. Yoga asana intervention comprised participants sitting continuously for four hours, with a yoga asana intervention being provided every hour, lasting for 10 minutes. Conclusions Yoga asana improves vascular functions in prolonged sitting conditions. This routine can promote the concept of interrupted sitting and ways to reduce it with efficient yoga asana practice without changing the work culture and provide better physical relief.

                Anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysms represent 23-40% of cerebral aneurysms and 12-15% of unruptured aneurysms, with a higher risk of rupture compared to other cerebral aneurysms. This case report presents a 56-year-old female admitted to a private hospital with acute headache and nausea, subsequently diagnosed with an ACOM aneurysm. The patient had no significant medical history, belonged to an intergenerational family, and maintained good mental health. Physical examination revealed a woman of thin frame (152 cm, 51 kg) with normal vital signs. Laboratory findings indicated low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dl), elevated sodium (19.1 mcg/dl), high creatinine (5.4 mcg), and elevated calcium (11.5 mcg/dl). Treatment included ondansetron, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium citrate, and alpha-blockers. The case highlights the importance of prompt intervention for ACOM aneurysms regardless of size, along with the necessity of comprehensive postoperative monitoring to detect complications such as bleeding and neurological impairments. Postoperative imaging is crucial to assess clipping effectiveness and monitor for potential complications.

                Digital access in urban settlements is a social determinant of urban health and a formidable element of advancing sustainable growth in our cities. Yet, it is also characterised by deep inequalities and capacity gaps that prevent us from delivering on the promise of step-change digital transformations for urban health. Whilst digital urban transformations are happening worldwide, most urban health investment in this space still fail to make an impact at scale. Reviewing key evidence and foundational issues as part of a collaboration with the World Health Organization, this essay stresses three key axes for effective intervention: 1) the development of novel sources of data, 2) the improvement of digital public infrastructures, and 3) the building of digital capacity at all levels of government and civil society. It identifies three priorities for evidence-based digital transformations in urban health: networking, financing, and review. These are underpinned by a cross-cutting call to step up multilevel commitments on digital transformations for urban health.

                Employability skills of vocational high school students are needed to prepare for a reliable, professional, and globally competitive world of work. The poor work skills of vocational high school students are influenced by many factors. This study analyzes the research trends and factors that influence vocational high employability. Type of literature study using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Data collection for 2020-2024 Work skills based on a search of Google Scholar, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases was conducted from October 25 to 31, 2024. VOSviewer application to analyze research trends. Search using keyword employability skills and vocational high school students. The selection process was conducted by inviting three authors to review articles. If an article does not meet the criteria, the solution is to invite other reviewers or experts to help complete it. Data analysis techniques include an identification stage with records from the database and continued filtering of data that meets the criteria and does not. Filtering stage with feasibility assessment Study Stage in Article Review. The results of the study identified 1016 articles, 311 articles, 39 articles, and 96 factors influencing work skills. Six dominant factors determine work skills: creativity (FI_1), communication skills (FI_2), adaptability (FI_3), problem-solving (FI_4), critical thinking (FI_5), and self-confidence (FI_6). The determining factors of work skills internationally are more dominant in self-confidence, adaptability, and communication skills, while in Indonesia, they are communication skills and creativity. A limitation of the data search process is the use of incomplete keywords. The contribution of this study is that six determining factors were used as considerations for the qualifications of student graduates in contextual and meaningful vocational learning.

                Accumulating evidence over several years suggests that microbial infections (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi) may play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this review, we discuss the reported associations between a variety of microbes and the development of AD, as well as potential causal relationships between infections and AD risk. Having evaluated the current state of knowledge, we make specific recommendations for what it would take to present definitive evidence that chronic infections play a causal role in AD pathogenesis.

                Dysregulated progranulin expression is robustly associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent research has been progressing toward a mechanistic understanding of the role of progranulin in CNS disease pathophysiology. In this review we describe the consequences of dysregulated progranulin expression in experimental and disease states. Collectively, these studies reveal that progranulin has diverse roles as a cell signaling molecule that regulates lysosomal function, immune processes, and growth. Given the functional and pathological implications of aberrant progranulin expression, we also summarize the mechanisms of progranulin regulation. We then highlight therapeutic strategies for progranulin upregulation. Ultimately, we explore the relationship between progranulin function and regulation with the goals of identifying key open questions and facilitating rational therapeutic development.

                Beyond image perception, light profoundly regulates physiological functions such as mood and metabolism through opsins in both ocular and extraocular tissues. This review examines how non-image-forming light sensing shapes mammalian physiology and explores its implications for human health.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92712">Predictive learning rules generate a cortical-like replay of probabilistic sensory experiences</a></h4>

              
                The brain is thought to construct an optimal internal model representing the probabilistic structure of the environment accurately. Evidence suggests that spontaneous brain activity gives such a model by cycling through activity patterns evoked by previous sensory experiences with the experienced probabilities. The brain’s spontaneous activity emerges from internally driven neural population dynamics. However, how cortical neural networks encode internal models into spontaneous activity is poorly understood. Recent computational and experimental studies suggest that a cortical neuron can implement complex computations, including predictive responses, through soma–dendrite interactions. Here, we show that a recurrent network of spiking neurons subject to the same predictive learning principle provides a novel mechanism to learn the spontaneous replay of probabilistic sensory experiences. In this network, the learning rules minimize probability mismatches between stimulus-evoked and internally driven activities in all excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This learning paradigm generates stimulus-specific cell assemblies that internally remember their activation probabilities using within-assembly recurrent connections. Our model contrasts previous models that encode the statistical structure of sensory experiences into Markovian transition patterns among cell assemblies. We demonstrate that the spontaneous activity of our model well replicates the behavioral biases of monkeys performing perceptual decision making. Our results suggest that interactions between intracellular processes and recurrent network dynamics are more crucial for learning cognitive behaviors than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91602">Stumpy forms are the predominant transmissible forms of Trypanosoma brucei</a></h4>

              
                Schuster et al<i>.</i> demonstrated that bloodstream slender forms of African trypanosomes are readily transmissible to young tsetse flies where they can complete their complex life cycle (Schuster et al., 2021). In their experimental conditions, a single slender parasite was sufficient for productive infection. Here, we compared the infectivity of slender and stumpy bloodstream forms in adult flies with a mature immune system, and without using any chemical compounds that would alter the insect immune response and/or promote the infection. After ingestion of slender forms, infected flies were observed only in 1 out of 24 batches of non-immunocompetent teneral flies and with a high number of parasites. In contrast, infected flies were detected in 75% (18/24) of the batches infected with stumpy parasites, and as few as 10 stumpy parasites produced mature infections in immune adult flies. We discuss that, although Schuster et al. have demonstrated the intrinsic capacity of slender form trypanosomes to infect young and naive tsetse flies, highlighting the remarkable plasticity and adaptability of these protists, this phenomenon is unlikely to significantly contribute to the epidemiology of African trypanosomiases. According to both experimental and field observations, stumpy forms appear to be the most adapted forms for African trypanosome transmission from the mammalian host to the tsetse fly vector in natural conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97036">Rate of brain aging associates with future executive function in Asian children and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Brain age has emerged as a powerful tool to understand neuroanatomical aging and its link to health outcomes like cognition. However, there remains a lack of studies investigating the rate of brain aging and its relationship to cognition. Furthermore, most brain age models are trained and tested on cross-sectional data from primarily Caucasian, adult participants. It is thus unclear how well these models generalize to non-Caucasian participants, especially children. Here, we tested a previously published deep learning model on Singaporean elderly participants (55−88 years old) and children (4−11 years old). We found that the model directly generalized to the elderly participants, but model finetuning was necessary for children. After finetuning, we found that the rate of change in brain age gap was associated with future executive function performance in both elderly participants and children. We further found that lateral ventricles and frontal areas contributed to brain age prediction in elderly participants, while white matter and posterior brain regions were more important in predicting brain age of children. Taken together, our results suggest that there is potential for generalizing brain age models to diverse populations. Moreover, the longitudinal change in brain age gap reflects developing and aging processes in the brain, relating to future cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106844">Targeted protein degradation by KLHDC2 ligands identified by high-throughput screening</a></h4>

              
                Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) enable the selective and sub-stoichiometric elimination of pathological proteins, yet only two E3 ligases are routinely used for this purpose. Here, we expand the repertoire of PROTAC-compatible E3 ligases by identifying a novel small molecule scaffold targeting the ubiquitin E3 ligase KLHDC2 using a fluorescence polarization-based high-throughput screen. We highlight the utility of this ligand with the synthesis of PROTACs capable of potently degrading BRD4 in cells. This work affords additional chemical matter for targeting KLHDC2 and suggests a practical approach for identifying novel E3 binders by high-throughput screening.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101391">Microglia are required for developmental specification of AgRP innervation in the hypothalamus of offspring exposed to maternal high-fat diet during lactation</a></h4>

              
                Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus respond to multiple metabolic signals and distribute neuroendocrine information to other brain regions such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), which plays a central role in metabolic homeostasis. Neural projections from AgRP neurons to the PVH form during the postnatal lactational period in mice and these projections are reduced in offspring of dams that consumed a high-fat diet (HFD) during lactation (MHFD-L). Here, we used immunohistochemistry to visualize microglial morphology in MHFD-L offspring and identified changes that were regionally localized to the PVH and appeared temporally restricted to the period when AgRP neurons innervate this region. In addition, axon labeling experiments revealed that microglia engulf AgRP terminals in the PVH, and that the density of AgRP innervation to the PVH in MHFD-L offspring may be dependent on microglia, because microglial depletion blocked the decrease in PVH AgRP innervation observed in MHFD-L offspring, as well as prevented the increased body weight exhibited at weaning. Together, these findings suggest that microglia are activated by exposure to MHFD-L and interact directly with AgRP axons during postnatal development to permanently alter innervation of the PVH, with implications for developmental programming of metabolic phenotype.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94391">Spectral decomposition unlocks ascidian morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Describing morphogenesis generally consists in aggregating the multiple high-resolution spatiotemporal processes involved into reproducible low-dimensional morphological processes consistent across individuals of the same species or group. In order to achieve this goal, biologists often have to submit movies issued from live imaging of developing embryos either to a qualitative analysis or to basic statistical analysis. These approaches, however, present noticeable drawbacks as they can be time consuming, hence unfit for scale, and often lack standardization and a firm foundation. In this work, we leverage the power of a continuum mechanics approach and flexibility of spectral decompositions to propose a standardized framework for automatic detection and timing of morphological processes. First, we quantify whole-embryo scale shape changes in developing ascidian embryos by statistically estimating the strain rate tensor field of its time-evolving surface without the requirement of cellular segmentation and tracking. We then apply to this data spectral decomposition in space using spherical harmonics and in time using wavelets transforms. These transformations result in the identification of the principal dynamical modes of ascidian embryogenesis and the automatic unveiling of its blueprint in the form of scalograms that tell the story of development in ascidian embryos.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91155">Morphology and ultrastructure of external sense organs of Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Sensory perception is the ability through which an organism is able to process sensory stimuli from the environment. This stimulus is transmitted from the peripheral sensory organs to the central nervous system, where it is interpreted. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae possess peripheral sense organs on their head, thoracic, and abdominal segments. These are specialized to receive diverse environmental information, such as olfactory, gustatory, temperature, or mechanosensory signals. In this work, we complete the description of the morphology of external larval sensilla and provide a comprehensive map of the ultrastructure of the different types of sensilla that comprise them. This was achieved by 3D electron microscopic analysis of partial and whole body volumes, which contain high-resolution and complete three-dimensional data of the anatomy of the sensilla and adjacent ganglia. Our analysis revealed three main types of sensilla on thoracic and abdominal segments: the papilla sensillum, the hair sensillum, and the knob sensillum. They occur solitary or organized in compound sensilla such as the thoracic keilin’s organ or the terminal sensory cones. We present a spatial map defining these sensilla by their position on thoracic and abdominal segments. Furthermore, we identify and name the sensilla at the larval head and the last fused abdominal segments. We show that mechanosensation dominates in the larval peripheral nervous system, as most sensilla have corresponding structural properties. The result of this work, the construction of a complete structural and neuronal map of the external larval sensilla, provides the basis for following molecular and functional studies to understand which sensory strategies the <i>Drosophila</i> larva employs to orient itself in its natural environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91387">Four individually identified paired dopamine neurons signal taste punishment in larval Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) play key roles in processing rewards and punishments across species. They evaluate sensory input, store memories, and update them based on relevance. To understand how individual DANs contribute to these functions, we studied <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, which have only about 120 DANs. Only eight of these project to the mushroom body (MB), a center for olfactory learning. These eight are divided into the pPAM and DL1 clusters, with four DANs each. We confirmed that pPAM neurons in the MB medial lobe encode sugar rewards. In the DL1 cluster, four neurons—DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1—each target different MB regions. Notably, optogenetic activation of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 can substitute for punishment. Additional methods (inhibition, calcium imaging, connectomics) show each DL1 DAN encodes a unique aspect of punishment, with DAN-g1 being pivotal for salt-based signals. Our findings reveal a clear division of labor among larval DL1 DANs for encoding punishment. The striking resemblance in the organizing principle of larval DANs with that of its adult counterpart and the mammalian basal ganglion suggests that there may be a limited number of efficient neural circuit solutions available to address more complex cognitive challenges in nature.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102676">CARD8 inflammasome activation during HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission</a></h4>

              
                Our previous work demonstrated that CARD8 detects HIV-1 infection by sensing the enzymatic activity of the HIV protease, resulting in CARD8-dependent inflammasome activation (Kulsuptrakul et al., 2023). CARD8 harbors a motif in its N-terminus that functions as a HIV protease substrate mimic, permitting innate immune recognition of HIV-1 protease activity, which when cleaved by HIV protease triggers CARD8 inflammasome activation. Here, we sought to understand CARD8 responses in the context of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission via a viral synapse. We observed that cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 between infected T cells and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages induces CARD8 inflammasome activation in a manner that is dependent on viral protease activity and largely independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, to further evaluate the viral determinants of CARD8 sensing, we tested a panel of HIV protease inhibitor-resistant clones to establish how variation in HIV protease affects CARD8 activation. We identified mutant HIV-1 proteases that differentially cleave and activate CARD8 compared to wildtype HIV-1, thus indicating that natural variation in HIV protease affects not only the cleavage of the viral Gag-Pol polyprotein but also likely impacts innate sensing and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96803">A common alteration in effort-based decision-making in apathy, anhedonia, and late circadian rhythm</a></h4>

              
                Motivational deficits are common in several brain disorders, and motivational syndromes like apathy and anhedonia predict worse outcomes. Disrupted effort-based decision-making may represent a neurobiological underpinning of motivational deficits, shared across neuropsychiatric disorders. We measured effort-based decision-making in 994 participants using a gamified online task, combined with computational modelling, and validated offline for test–retest reliability. In two pre-registered studies, we first replicated studies linking impaired effort-based decision-making to neuropsychiatric syndromes, taking both a transdiagnostic and a diagnostic-criteria approach. Next, testing participants with <i>early</i> and <i>late</i> circadian rhythms in the morning and evening, we find circadian rhythm interacts with time-of-testing to produce parallel effects on effort-based decision-making. Circadian rhythm may be an important variable in computational psychiatry, decreasing reliability or distorting results when left unaccounted for. Disentangling effects of neuropsychiatric syndromes and circadian rhythm on effort-based decision-making will be essential to understand motivational pathologies and to develop tailored clinical interventions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Auditory hypersensitivity is a well-established phenotype of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), but how it relates to neurobehavioral biomarkers remains poorly understood. To offer an integrated model, we propose a dual thalamic framework with hypo-lemniscal (LEM) and hyper-extralemniscal (EXLEM) thalamic models. Traditional FXS studies may have been conflating LEM and EXLEM systems, misrepresenting the origins of the hypersensitivity. We hypothesize that hyper-EXLEM pathology impacts FXS symptoms more. To test this hypothesis, we first review the dual thalamic systems and then demonstrate the hypo-LEM and hyper-EXLEM models in individuals with FXS. We use a 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ie LEM responses) paradigm with relatively long (1.5 to 3 s) stimulus and interstimulus intervals to evoke N1/P2 as Vertex Potentials (VPs, ie EXLEM responses) for onset and offset of the stimulus. We analyzed electroencephaogram (EEG) responses from 29 FXS and 33 healthy comparison individuals. Results showed lower intertrial coherence (ITC) in FXS, consistent with hypo-LEM predictions, and larger vertex potentials consistent with hyper-EXLEM predictions. Correlation analyses revealed that enhanced VPs classified FXS males more sensitively than ITC. These findings indicate that hyperreactivity of the EXLEM system is more dominantly related to FXS, which can provide a more accurate account for guiding diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</span>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27266?af=R">Midlife Steroid‐Binding Globulin Levels and In Vivo Neuroimaging Measures of Tau in Older Men and Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In men and women, sex steroid hormones have been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We aimed to investigate the influence of midlife testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels on later-life in vivo markers of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition in clinically healthy older men.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This time-lagged study includes participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation cohort. One hundred fifty-nine men (mean age<sub>PET-scan</sub> = 58 [±/9] years) underwent blood (hormones) collection in 2002 to 2005, and then a single Aβ <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET scan in 2016 to 2020. Linear regressions examined sex-stratified associations among total testosterone, and SHBG with Aβ-PET, and tau-PET after adjusting for age. Separate models examined the moderating effect of Aβ-PET and <i>APOE</i>ε4.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In men, the elevated SHBG level was associated with lower tau-PET in entorhinal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0005], <i>p</i> = 0.007), inferior temporal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.04), and rostral middle frontal regions (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.02). These findings were largely driven by <i>APOE</i>ε4 non-carriers. Testosterone levels were not associated with the Aβ-PET or tau-PET signal.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report a potential protective effect of SHBG levels on tau-PET burden in men. Higher levels of SHBG have been associated with lower risk of vascular-related comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, and is regulated by modifiable lifestyle factors. Given mounting evidence of a link between vascular injury and tauopathy in preclinical AD, our findings suggest an intriguing protective cardiovascular pathway for men against higher tau burden later in life.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Several lines of evidence implicate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in cognitive functions, in mood- and anxiety-related behaviors, and in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants. Augmenting α5-γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor function has shown neurotrophic effects in stress and aged models, but its impact on mouse AHN remains unknown. Adult male 129S6/SvEvTac mice (<i>n</i> = 30 total) were treated for 6 weeks with GL-II-73, an α5-GABAA-R-positive allosteric modulator (α5-PAM) [30 mg/kg, per os, (P.O.)] or fluoxetine, a prototypical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor known to increase AHN (18 mg/kg, P.O.). Proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) was assessed by the level of Ki67, a marker of dividing cells; survival of the young neurons was assessed by retention of the 5-Bromo-2´-Deoxyuridine (BrdU) nucleotide analog injected 2 weeks before sacrifice. Finally, maturation of young adult-born neurons was evaluated by measuring the fraction of BrdU-positive cells that are also DCX and/or NeuN-positive, capturing overall maturation and speed of maturation. Similarly to fluoxetine, a chronic treatment with GL-II-73 stimulated all stages of AHN, significantly increasing neuronal progenitor proliferation, survival of adult-born granule cells, and maturation of young neurons in the DG of the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with GL-II-73, a α5-GABAA-R-positive allosteric modulator, increased AHN, including cellular proliferation, survival, and maturation of newborn neurons, to levels comparable to fluoxetine.</p>

                Mitotic proteins are traditionally studied for their role in chromosome segregation during cell division. However, research increasingly highlights the important non-canonical roles of mitotic proteins beyond mitosis, particularly in the mammalian cerebral cortex. Alterations in the expression levels or mutations of mitotic proteins are increasingly linked to brain disorders such as primary microcephaly and Alzheimer’s disease. A central, unresolved question remains: how do mitotic proteins contribute to neuronal pathogenesis? Here, we review emerging literature on the non-canonical roles of mitotic proteins in mature neurons. Additionally, we discuss how these contribute to the complex mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We also discuss their potential for identifying therapeutic strategies and as biomarkers in brain pathologies.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Smartphones have become integral to daily life, and their overuse can lead to various maladaptive behaviors and decision-making patterns. This study investigated the neural and computational mechanisms underlying smartphone addiction, focusing on its impact on loss-aversion decision-making. We combined computational models, such as the Drift Diffusion Model, with a novel analytic approach, intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA). Behavioral results showed that higher smartphone addiction symptom (SAS) scores were correlated with reduced loss-aversion (lnλ), while the drift rate was positively associated with SAS. Furthermore, the drift rate mediated the relationship between SAS and lnλ. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that SAS was associated with increased gain-related activity in the occipital pole (OP) but decreased activity in the precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. Additionally, reduced activity was observed in the angular gyrus and superior temporal gyrus during loss processing. IS-RSA further identified brain activation patterns in the default mode network, frontoparietal network, visual network, and sensorimotor network, which corresponded to intersubject variations in SAS, particularly during gain processing but not during loss processing. These patterns were also observed when gains and losses were processed simultaneously. Mediation analyses indicated that brain activation strengths in the OP, precuneus, and MFG during gain processing mediated the relationship between SAS and lnλ and drift rate. Similar mediation effects were observed for intersubject variations in SAS and computational process patterns (eg decision threshold, drift rate, and nondecision time) within these networks. These findings provide novel insights into the neural and computational mechanisms of loss aversion in smartphone addiction, with implications for understanding cognitive biases and informing interventions for addictive behaviors.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two kinds of serious psychiatric disorders. Despite different diagnostic criteria, the patients have significant biologic and clinical overlaps, challenging for the early identification, diagnosis, intervention, and management of these two diseases. Given the limited research on interhemispheric functional connectivity (FC) differences between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, we included 38 schizophrenia patients, 34 bipolar disorder patients and 57 HCs from a publicly available fMRI dataset to investigate it across the whole brain by using voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Correlation analyses were also performed to examine the associations between VMHC values, clinical symptoms, and neuropsychological tests. Our findings revealed that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder shared the functional alteration in the insula, exhibiting decreased VMHC compared to HCs, but the specific regions differed: bipolar disorder demonstrated alternations in the inferior occipital gyrus, while schizophrenia showed changes in the postcentral gyrus. Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showed decreased VMHC relative to HCs. These alterations correlated with clinical symptoms, underscoring the importance of these brain regions in mental diseases. Our research provides new insights into the similarities and differences between the two diseases, suggesting that interhemispheric functional disconnection might critically contribute to the development and maintenance of these psychiatric disorders.</span>

                Background Uterine rupture (UR) remains a major cause of maternal morbidity, especially in low-resource settings. While typically detected during labor, some cases are clinically silent, discovered incidentally during imaging/surgery, highlighting a knowledge gap in risk assessment. In Tunisia, 1.5% of pregnancies involve UR, mostly scar-related. The study aim was to identify factors associated with the development of complete UR in cases that were incidentally found during pregnancy or delivery. Methods This was retrospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted over an eleven-year period, from January 2014 to December 2024, at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics department B, Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. Asymptomatic UR cases (complete/incomplete) were analysed to compare clinical profiles, identify risk factors, and assess maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results A total of 41 cases of asymptomatic UR were included, which accounted for an average of 50% of the UR cases. In a cohort comparing complete UR cases (N=27) and incomplete UR cases (N=14), significant differences in duration of pregnancy and labor were found. The mean gestational age was longer in the incomplete UR group (p=0.03), and the duration of labor was also significantly longer (p=0.006). No significant differences were observed in sociodemographic characteristics, quality of prenatal care, or complications such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. Nonsignificant factors included pregnancy interval, scars number and labor stagnation. The analysis showed two significant predictors of complete UR outcomes. Prolonged labor (>220 minutes) was strongly associated with increased odds of complete UR (OR=45.231, 95% CI=2.591-789.486, p=0.009) and lower maternal weight (<68 kg) correlated with reduced odds of incomplete UR (OR=0.033, 95% CI=0.001–0.837, p=0.039), suggesting a protective effect per kilogram decrease. Conclusion Findings redefine UR as part of a broader clinical spectrum, not just an acute complication, enabling tailored surveillance and improved prevention in high-risk pregnancies.

                Background Many graduates are unprepared for the workforce because of the abysmal increase in unemployment rates. While academics have tried to incorporate employable skills into curricula, graduates must understand social and humanitarian principles to meet globalization demands. This study investigated how service-learning influences the prosocial skills of economics undergraduate pre-service teachers and its impact on their future employment prospects. Method We adopted a mixed-method design of the sequential explanatory approach. A purposive random sampling technique was used to select 150 pre-service teachers (300 and 400 level) from five departments in the Faculty of Education at the University of Ibadan offering economics. A convenience sampling technique was used to sample 10 students for focus group discussions, who served as team leaders in service-learning courses. The Students’ Prosocial and Professional Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.79) and a Focus Group Discussion Guide were used for data collection. Quantitative data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and paired sample t-test at significance level of 0.05, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The mean scores for the constructs were communication skills (2.61), teamwork (2.45), empathy (2.35), culture (2.30) and social responsibility (2.50). The mean for communication skills increased significantly from 2.61 before the intervention to 3.35. The reduction in the standard deviation indicates that the communication skills of pre-service teachers have become more consistent and prominent (F=24.87), confirming the statistical significance of these improvements. Similar improvements were observed in teamwork skills, with the mean score rising from 2.62 before intervention to 3.36 and statistically significant (F=9.71). Conclusion The undergraduate students had low overall prosocial ability scores, indicating a lack of prosocial competencies essential for effective teaching and professional success in education. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the value of service learning and support its integration into teacher education programs through funding, resources, and institutional encouragement.

                Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease of high prevalence worldwide. It usually coexists with chondyslipidemia, obesity and hypertension and can present complications such as peripheral neuropathy and nephropathy. Method Retrospective cohort study of 441 patients with diabetes mellitus 2. Medical records were reviewed to obtain the variables under study. All patients of both sexes treated between July 2023 and November 2024 in a primary care hospital were included and patients on predialysis or dialysis, total or partial lower limb amputation, and sequelae of cerebrovascular disease were excluded. Logistic regression analysis was used. Results Among the signs of DN, anhidrosis and mycosis predominated in patients of both sexes, and among the symptoms, burning, prickling and leg pain when walking. The majority of patients with neuropathy are between 60 and 79 years of age, female, have hypertension, have a disease duration of 12.83 ± 8.73 years, Hb1Ac of 7.67% ±1.69, glucose of 153.93 ± 66.17 and hemoglobin of 12.98 ± 1.39. Most patients have CKD G1 and G2. The Chi-square test indicates only relationship between age group, sex and stages. In the quantitative analysis, the Krustall Wallis test indicates that there are significant differences in patient stages according to age, time of disease and HbA1c. Conclusions G1 and G2 stages, female sex and hypertension predominated in patients with CKD. The older the patient and the longer the time with diabetes, the higher the CKD stage. There is a relationship with age group, sex and CKD stages. Age < 79 years and the absence of hypertension are protective factors for the progression of CKD and male sex is considered a risk factor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-582/v1?src=rss">The Limits of AI in Understanding Emotions: Challenges in Bridging Human Experience and Machine Perception [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This article explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace the human factor in the analysis of emotions within financial decision-making contexts. The background of this study is as follows: growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence for text analysis, understanding its capacity to detect emotional patterns is particularly relevant in fields where emotional dynamics significantly influence behavior, such as trading. Method Our research method is based on a three-day trading experiment involving students, during which participants made decisions under conditions of uncertainty. At the end of the experiment, each participant wrote a free-form report describing their emotional experience. We applied four different Artificial Intelligence tools to analyze these texts and compared the results with those obtained through a traditional lexical analysis method. AI tools provided relatively consistent and coherent assessments of the general emotional tone in the texts. Results Our results suggest that they successfully identified dominant emotions such as fear, disappointment, and hope. However, the ability of Artificial Intelligence to detect more nuanced or mixed emotional states was limited. In contrast, traditional lexical analysis offered greater sensitivity to emotional complexity. Although both approaches converged on broad emotional tendencies, divergences appeared when addressing subtle or context-specific emotional shifts. Our findings suggest that AI can serve as a useful preliminary tool in the analysis of emotions in written texts, especially for identifying dominant patterns. Conclusion In conclusion, according to us, due to its limitations in detecting emotional nuances, Artificial Intelligence should be integrated into a hybrid analytical approach. Combining Artificial Intelligence with traditional or human-led analysis enhances both the precision and depth of interpretation. We argue that a hybrid model avoids the oversimplification of emotional data and better reflects the complexity of emotional dynamics in decision-making under uncertainty.

                The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) is a modulator of lipid metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCD1 plays in health and disease can provide novel insides in therapeutic targets, a process that would be facilitated by the availability of high-quality antibodies. Here we have characterized nine SCD1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                <p>by Ismael Jaras, Marcos E. Orchard, Pedro E. Maldonado, Rodrigo C. Vergara</p>

Understanding the intricate interplay between neural dynamics and metabolic constraints is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of the brain. Despite the significance of this relationship, specific details concerning the impact of metabolism on neuronal dynamics and neural network architecture remain elusive, creating a notable gap in the existing literature. This study employs an energy-dependent neuron and plasticity model to analyze the role of local metabolic constraints in shaping both the dynamics and structure of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Specifically, an energy-dependent version of the leaky integrate-and-fire model is utilized, along with a three-factor learning rule that incorporates postsynaptic available energy as the third factor. These models allow for fine-tuning sensitivity in the presence of energy imbalances. Analytical expressions predicting the network’s activity and structure are derived, and a fixed point analysis reveals the emergence of attractor states characterized by neuronal and synaptic sensitivity to energy imbalances. Analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations using an excitatory-inhibitory network. Furthermore, these simulations enable the study of SNN activity and structure under conditions simulating metabolic impairment. In conclusion, by employing energy-dependent models with adjustable sensitivity to energy imbalances, our study advances the understanding of how metabolic constraints shape SNN dynamics and structure. Moreover, in light of compelling evidence linking neuronal metabolic impairment to neurodegenerative diseases, the incorporation of local metabolic constraints into the investigation of neuronal network structure and activity opens an intriguing avenue for inspiring the development of therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012763">From experimental clues to theoretical modeling: Evolution associated with the membrane-takeover at an early stage of life</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wentao Ma, Chunwu Yu</p>

Modern cell membranes are primarily composed of phospholipids, while primitive cell membranes in the beginning of life are believed to have formed from simpler lipids (such as fatty acids) synthesized in the prebiotic environment. An attractive experimental study suggested that the corresponding “membrane-takeover” (as an evolutionary process) is likely to have occurred very early (e.g., in the RNA world) due to some simple physical effects, and might have subsequently triggered some other evolutionary processes. Here, via computer modeling on a system of RNA-based protocells, we convinced the plausibility of such a scenario and elaborated on relevant mechanisms. It is shown that in protocells with a fatty-acid membrane, because of the benefit of phospholipid content (i.e., stabilizing the membrane), a ribozyme favoring the synthesis of phospholipids may emerge; subsequently, due to the reduced membrane permeability on account of the phospholipid content, two other functional RNA species could arise: a ribozyme exploiting more fundamental materials (thus more permeable) for nucleotide synthesis and a species favoring across-membrane transportation. This case exemplifies a combination of experimental and theoretical efforts regarding early evolution, which may shed light on that notoriously complicated problem: the origin of life.
