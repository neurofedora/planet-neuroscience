In this paper, we propose theoretical methods to infer coupling strength and noise intensity simultaneously...

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review of the case findings, testing and management of COVID-19 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mass testing and adequate management are essential to terminate the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This testing is due to the possibility of unidentified cases, especially ones without COVID-19 related symptoms. This review aimed to examine the outcome of the existing studies on the ways of identifying COVID-19 cases, and determine the populations at risk, symptom and diagnostic test management of  COVID-19. Methods: The articles reviewed were scientific publications on the PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Scopus databases. The keywords used to obtain the data were COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and case detection, case management or diagnostic test. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Population, Intervention, Control and Outcomes (PICO) approaches. Results: A total of 21 articles from 13 countries met the inclusion criteria and were further analyzed qualitatively. However, 62% of the articles used a rapid antibody test for screening rather than a rapid antigen test. According to the rapid antigen test, 51.3% were positive, with men aged above 50 years recording the highest number of cases. Furthermore, 57.1% of patients were symptomatic, while diagnostic tests' sensitivity and specificity increased to 100% in 14 days after the onset. Conclusions:  Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  is recommended by the World Health Organization for detection of COVID-19. Suppose it is unavailable, the rapid antigen test is used as an alternative rather than the rapid antibody test. Diagnosis is expected to be confirmed using the PCR and serological assay to achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19, according to disease progression, gradual rapid tests can be used, such as rapid antigen in an earlier week and antibody tests confirmed by RT–PCR and serological assay in the second week of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Even-Skipped in Drosophila Larval Somatosensory Circuit Assembly</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Proper somatosensory circuit assembly is critical for processing somatosensory stimuli and for responding accordingly. In comparison to other sensory circuits (e.g., olfactory and visual), somatosensory circuits have unique anatomy and function. However, understanding of somatosensory circuit development lags far behind that of other sensory systems. For example, there are few identified transcription factors required for integration of interneurons into functional somatosensory circuits. Here, as a model, we examine one type of somatosensory interneuron, Even-skipped (Eve) expressing laterally placed interneurons (ELs) of the <I>Drosophila</I> larval nerve cord. Eve is a highly conserved, homeodomain transcription factor known to play a role in cell fate specification and neuronal axon guidance. Because marker genes are often functionally important in the cell types they define, we deleted <I>eve</I> expression specifically from EL interneurons. On the cell biological level, using single neuron labeling, we find <I>eve</I> plays several previously undescribed roles in refinement of neuron morphogenesis. Eve suppresses aberrant neurite branching, promotes axon elongation, and regulates dorsal-ventral dendrite position. On the circuit level, using optogenetics, calcium imaging, and behavioral analysis, we find <I>eve</I> expression is required in EL interneurons for the normal encoding of somatosensory stimuli and for normal mapping of outputs to behavior. We conclude that the <I>eve</I> gene product coordinately regulates multiple aspects of EL interneuron morphogenesis and is critically required to properly integrate EL interneurons into somatosensory circuits. Our data shed light on the genetic regulation of somatosensory circuit assembly.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The aging brain undergoes structural changes even in very healthy individuals. Quantifying these changes could help disentangle pathologic changes from those associated with the normal human aging process. Using longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 227 carefully selected healthy human cohort with age ranging from 50 to 80 years old at baseline scan, we quantified age-related volumetric changes in the brain of healthy human older adults. Longitudinally, the rates of tissue loss in total gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) were 2497.5 and 2579.8 mm<sup>3</sup> per year, respectively. Across the whole brain, the rates of GM decline varied with regions in the frontal and parietal lobes having faster rates of decline, whereas some regions in the occipital and temporal lobes appeared relatively preserved. In contrast, cross-sectional changes were mainly observed in the temporal-occipital regions. Similar longitudinal atrophic changes were also observed in subcortical regions including thalamus, hippocampus, putamen, and caudate, whereas the pallidum showed an increasing volume with age. Overall, regions maturing late in development (frontal, parietal) are more vulnerable to longitudinal decline, whereas those that fully mature in the early stage (temporal, occipital) are mainly affected by cross-sectional changes in healthy older cohort. This may suggest that, for a successful healthy aging, the former needs to be maximally developed at an earlier age to compensate for the longitudinal decline later in life and the latter to remain relatively preserved even in old age, consistent with both concepts of reserve and brain maintenance.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Parvalbumin (PV)-producing neurons are the largest subpopulation of cortical GABAergic interneurons, which mediate lateral, feedforward, and feedback inhibition in local circuits and modulate the activity of pyramidal neurons. Clarifying the specific connectivity between pyramidal and PV neurons is essential for understanding the role of PV neurons in local circuits. In the present study, we visualized somas and dendrites of PV neurons using transgenic mice in which PV neurons specifically express membrane-targeted GFP, and intracellularly labeled local axons of 26 pyramidal neurons in layers 2&ndash;6 in acute slices of the motor-associated cortex from transgenic mice. We mapped morphologically distribution of inputs from a pyramidal neuron to PV neurons based on contact sites (appositions) between the axons from an intracellularly filled pyramidal neuron and the dendrites of PV neurons. Layer 6 corticothalamic (CT)-like pyramidal neurons formed appositions to PV neurons at a significantly higher rate than other pyramidal neurons. The percentage of apposed varicosities to all the labeled varicosities of layer 6 CT-like neurons was 28%, and that of the other pyramidal neurons was 12&ndash;19%. Layer 6 CT-like neurons preferentially formed appositions with PV neurons in layers 5b&ndash;6, while other pyramidal neurons uniformly formed appositions with PV neurons in all layers. Furthermore, both layer 6 CT-like and corticocortical-like neurons more frequently formed compound appositions, where two or more appositions were located on a dendritic branch, than other pyramidal neurons. Layer 6 CT neurons may contribute to intracortical information processing through preferential connections with PV neurons in layers 5b&ndash;6.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chemical Signaling Regulates Axon Regeneration via the GPCR-Gq{alpha} Pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemical communication controls a wide range of behaviors via conserved signaling networks. Axon regeneration in response to injury is determined by the interaction between the extracellular environment and intrinsic growth potential. In this study, we investigated the role of chemical signaling in axon regeneration in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>. We find that the enzymes involved in ascaroside pheromone biosynthesis, ACOX-1.1, ACOX-1.2, and DAF-22, participate in axon regeneration by producing a dauer-inducing ascaroside, ascr#5. We demonstrate that the chemoreceptor genes, <I>srg-36</I> and <I>srg-37</I>, which encode G-protein-coupled receptors for ascr#5, are required for adult-specific axon regeneration. Furthermore, the activating mutation in <I>egl-30</I> encoding Gq&alpha; suppresses axon regeneration defective phenotype in <I>acox-1.1</I> and <I>srg-36 srg-37</I> mutants. Therefore, the ascaroside signaling system provides a unique example of a signaling molecule that regulates the regenerative pathway in the nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, axon regeneration is positively regulated by the EGL-30 Gq&alpha;&ndash;JNK MAP kinase cascade. However, it remains unclear what signals activate the EGL-30 pathway in axon regeneration. Here, we show that SRG-36 and SRG-37 act as upstream G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate EGL-30. <I>C. elegans</I> secretes a family of small-molecule pheromones called ascarosides, which serve various functions in chemical signaling. SRG-36 and SRG-37 are GPCRs for the dauer-inducing ascaroside ascr#5. Consistent with this, we found that ascr#5 activates the axon regeneration pathway via SRG-36/SRG-37 and EGL-30. Thus, ascaroside signaling promotes axon regeneration by activating the GPCR&ndash;Gq&alpha; pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Regulation of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Internalization and Synaptic AMPA Receptor Endocytosis by the Postsynaptic Protein Norbin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Group I mGluRs have diverse functions in some fundamental neuronal processes, including modulation of synaptic plasticity; and dysregulation of these receptors could lead to various neuropsychiatric disorders. Trafficking of Group I mGluRs plays critical roles in controlling the precise spatiotemporal localization and activity of these receptors, both of which contribute to proper downstream signaling. Using "molecular replacement" approach in hippocampal neurons derived from mice of both sexes, we demonstrate a critical role for the postsynaptic density protein Norbin in regulating the ligand-induced internalization of Group I mGluRs. We show that Norbin associates with protein kinase A (PKA) through its N-terminus and anchors mGluR5 through its C-terminus, both of which are necessary for the ligand-mediated endocytosis of mGluR5, a member of the Group I mGluR family. A point mutation (A687G) at the C-terminus of Norbin inhibits the binding of Norbin to mGluR5 and blocks mGluR5 endocytosis. Finally, we demonstrate an important mechanism by which Norbin regulates mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis in hippocampal neurons, a cellular correlate for mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity. Norbin, through its PKA-binding regions, recruits PKA to AMPARs on activation of mGluRs; and deletion of the PKA-binding regions of Norbin inhibits mGluR-triggered AMPAR endocytosis. We further report that Norbin is important specifically for the mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis, but not for NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis. Thus, this study unravels a novel role for Norbin in the internalization of mGluRs and mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis that can have clinical relevance to the function of Group I mGluRs in pathologic processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The postsynaptic protein Norbin interacts with mGluR5, and both of them have been implicated in disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, the mechanistic basis underlying the regulation of mGluRs by Norbin remains elusive. We have identified Norbin as an essential mediator of ligand-mediated endocytosis of Group I mGluRs. Mechanistically, Norbin N-terminus associates with protein kinase-A (PKA) and C-terminus binds to mGluR5 to coordinate receptor internalization. A point mutation NorA687G inhibits endocytosis by disrupting this interaction. Additionally, Norbin is critical for the recruitment of PKA to AMPARs on activation of Group I mGluRs that assists in mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis. Thus, Norbin has a dual function in the hippocampus: regulation of mGluR internalization and PKA-dependent modulation of mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis, a prerequisite for mGluR-mediated synaptic plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Involvement of Denervated Midbrain-Derived Factors in the Formation of Ectopic Cortico-Mesencephalic Projection after Hemispherectomy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal remodeling after brain injury is essential for functional recovery. After unilateral cortical lesion, axons from the intact cortex ectopically project to the denervated midbrain, but the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined gene expression profiles in denervated and intact mouse midbrains after hemispherectomy at early developmental stages using mice of either sex, when ectopic contralateral projection occurs robustly. The analysis showed that various axon growth-related genes were upregulated in the denervated midbrain, and most of these genes are reportedly expressed by glial cells. To identify the underlying molecules, the receptors for candidate upregulated molecules were knocked out in layer 5 projection neurons in the intact cortex, using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated method, and axonal projection from the knocked-out cortical neurons was examined after hemispherectomy. We found that the ectopic projection was significantly reduced when integrin subunit &beta; three or neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (also known as TrkB) was knocked out. Overall, the present study suggests that denervated midbrain-derived glial factors contribute to lesion-induced remodeling of the cortico-mesencephalic projection via these receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> After brain injury, compensatory neural circuits are established that contribute to functional recovery. However, little is known about the intrinsic mechanism that underlies the injury-induced remodeling. We found that after unilateral cortical ablation expression of axon-growth promoting factors is elevated in the denervated midbrain and is involved in the formation of ectopic axonal projection from the intact cortex. Evidence further demonstrated that these factors are expressed by astrocytes and microglia, which are activated in the denervated midbrain. Thus, our present study provides a new insight into the mechanism of lesion-induced axonal remodeling and further therapeutic strategies after brain injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Robo2 Drives Target-Selective Peripheral Nerve Regeneration in Response to Glia-Derived Signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral nerves are divided into multiple branches leading to divergent synaptic targets. This poses a remarkable challenge for regenerating axons as they select their original trajectory at nerve branch-points. Despite implications for functional regeneration, the molecular mechanisms underlying target selectivity are not well characterized. <I>Danio Rerio</I> (zebrafish) motor nerves are composed of a ventral and a dorsal branch that diverge at a choice-point, and we have previously shown that regenerating axons faithfully select their original branch and targets. Here we identify <I>robo2</I> as a key regulator of target-selective regeneration (sex of experimental subjects unknown). We demonstrate that <I>robo2</I> function in regenerating axons is required and sufficient to drive target-selective regeneration, and that <I>robo2</I> acts in response to glia located precisely where regenerating axons select the branch-specific trajectory to prevent and correct axonal errors. Combined, our results reveal a glia-derived mechanism that acts locally via axonal <I>robo2</I> to promote target-selective regeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite its relevance for functional recovery, the molecular mechanisms that direct regenerating peripheral nerve axons toward their original targets are not well defined. Zebrafish spinal motor nerves are composed of a dorsal and a ventral branch that diverge at a stereotyped nerve branch-point, providing a unique opportunity to decipher the molecular mechanisms critical for target-selective regeneration. Using a combination of live cell imaging and molecular-genetic manipulations, we demonstrate that the <I>robo2</I> guidance receptor is necessary and sufficient to promote target-selective regeneration. Moreover, we demonstrate that <I>robo2</I> is part of a genetic pathway that generates transient, spatially restricted, and tightly coordinated signaling events that direct axons of the dorsal nerve branch toward their original, pre-injury targets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distributed and Localized Dynamics Emerge in the Mouse Neocortex during Reach-to-Grasp Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>A long-standing question in systems neuroscience is to what extent task-relevant features of neocortical processing are localized or distributed. Coordinated activity across the neocortex has been recently shown to drive complex behavior in the mouse, while activity in selected areas is canonically associated with specific functions (e.g., movements in the case of the motor cortex). Reach-to-grasp (RtG) movements are known to be dependent on motor circuits of the neocortex; however, the global activity of the neocortex during these movements has been largely unexplored in the mouse. Here, we characterized, using wide-field calcium imaging, these neocortex-wide dynamics in mice of either sex engaging in an RtG task. We demonstrate that, beyond motor regions, several areas, such as the visual and the retrosplenial cortices, also increase their activity levels during successful RtGs, and homologous regions across the ipsilateral hemisphere are also involved. Functional connectivity among neocortical areas increases transiently around movement onset and decreases during movement. Despite this global phenomenon, neural activity levels correlate with kinematics measures of successful RtGs in sensorimotor areas only. Our findings establish that distributed and localized neocortical dynamics co-orchestrate efficient control of complex movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mammals rely on reaching and grasping movements for fine-scale interactions with the physical world. In the mouse, the motor cortex is critical for the execution of such behavior, yet little is known about the activity patterns across neocortical areas. Using the mesoscale-level networks as a model of cortical processing, we investigated the hypothesis that areas beyond the motor regions could participate in RtG planning and execution, and indeed a large network of areas is involved while performing RtGs. Movement kinematics correlates mostly with neural activity in sensorimotor areas. By demonstrating that distributed and localized neocortical dynamics for the execution of fine movements coexist in the mouse neocortex during RtG, we offer an unprecedented view on the neocortical correlates of mammalian motor control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brainstem Circuits Triggering Saccades and Fixation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Omnipause neurons (OPNs) in the nucleus raphe interpositus have tonic activity while the eyes are stationary ("fixation") but stop firing immediately before and during saccades. To locate the source of suppression, we analyzed synaptic inputs from the rostral and caudal superior colliculi (SCs) to OPNs by using intracellular recording and staining, and investigated pathways transmitting the inputs in anesthetized cats of both sexes. Electrophysiologically or morphologically identified OPNs received monosynaptic excitation from the rostral SCs with contralateral dominance, and received disynaptic inhibition from the caudal SCs with ipsilateral dominance. Cutting the tectoreticular tract transversely between the contralateral OPN and inhibitory burst neuron (IBN) regions eliminated inhibition from the caudal SCs, but not excitation from the rostral SCs in OPNs. In contrast, a midline section between IBN regions eliminated disynaptic inhibition in OPNs from the caudal SCs but did not affect the monosynaptic excitation from the rostral SCs. Stimulation of the contralateral IBN region evoked monosynaptic inhibition in OPNs, which was facilitated by preconditioning SC stimulation. Three-dimensional reconstruction of HRP-stained cells revealed that individual OPNs have axons that terminate in the opposite IBN area, while individual IBNs have axon collaterals to the opposite OPN area. These results show that there are differences in the neural circuit from the rostral and caudal SCs to the brainstem premotor circuitry and that IBNs suppress OPNs immediately before and during saccades. Thus, the IBNs, which are activated by caudal SC saccade neurons, shut down OPN firing and help to trigger saccades and suppress ("latch") OPN activity during saccades.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Saccades are the fastest eye movements to redirect gaze to an object of interest and bring its image on the fovea for fixation. Burst neurons (BNs) and omnipause neurons (OPNs) which behave reciprocally in the brainstem, are important for saccade generation and fixation. This study investigated unsolved important questions about where these neurons receive command signals and how they interact for initiating saccades from visual fixation. The results show that the rostral superior colliculi (SCs) excite OPNs monosynaptically for fixation, whereas the caudal SCs monosynaptically excite inhibitory BNs, which then directly inhibit OPNs for the initiation of saccades. This inhibition from the caudal SCs may account for the omnipause behavior of OPNs for initiation and maintenance of saccades in all directions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Taste Bud Connectome: Implications for Taste Information Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Taste buds contain multiple cell types, two of which mediate transduction of specific taste qualities: Type III cells transduce sour while Type II cells transduce either sweet, or bitter or umami. In order to discern the degree of interaction between different cell types and specificity of connectivity with the afferent nerve fibers (NFs), we employed serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (sbfSEM) through five circumvallate mouse taste buds. Points of contact between Type II and Type III cells are rare and lack morphologically identifiable synapses, suggesting that interaction between these cell types does not occur via synapses. Of the 127 NFs that make synaptic contacts with taste cells in the sampling volume, ~70% (<I>n</I> = 91) synapse with only one taste cell while 32 fibers synapse exclusively with multiple Type II cells or multiple Type III cells. Our data do not rule out multimodal fibers innervating Type II cells of separate taste qualities. Notably, four fibers (~3%) synapse with both Type II and Type III cells, forming both mitochondrial and vesicular synapses on the different cell types. Since Type II and Type III cells transduce different taste qualities, these dual connected fibers are not consistent with a absolute labeled-line encoding system. Further, our data reveal considerable variation in both the number of synapses per cell/nerve pair and the number of innervating NFs per taste cell, both of which likely have consequences for encoding taste quality and concentration. Finally, we identify a subset of Type II cells which may represent an immature stage.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Taste buds, the sensory end organs for the sense of taste, contain multiple types of sensory cells, with each responding to one of the primary tastes: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. In order to determine the degree of interaction between cell types and specificity of connectivity to afferent nerves, we employed serial blockface electron microscopy (EM) of mouse circumvallate taste buds. We find no synapses between cell types within the taste bud suggesting that any interactions are indirect. While the majority of nerve fibers (NFs) connect to a single type of taste cell, 3.1% of the fibers branch to receive input from taste cells of different specificities. Thus, taste cannot entirely be carried along NFs dedicated to single taste qualities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Threat and Bidirectional Valence Signaling in the Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

              
                <p>Appropriate responding to threat and reward is essential to survival. The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is known to support and organize reward behavior. The NAcc is also necessary to fully discriminate threat and safety cues. To directly reveal NAcc threat firing, we recorded single-unit activity from seven female rats undergoing pavlovian fear discrimination. Rats fully discriminated danger, uncertainty, and safety cues, and most NAcc neurons showed the greatest firing change to danger and uncertainty. Heterogeneity in cue and reward firing led us to identify distinct functional populations. One NAcc population signaled threat, specifically decreasing firing to danger and uncertainty cues. A separate population signaled Bidirectional Valence, decreasing firing to the danger cue (negative valence), but increasing firing to reward (positive valence). The results reveal the NAcc to be a source of threat information and a more general valence hub.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is synonymous with reward. Yet, anatomy, neurotoxic lesions, and optogenetic manipulation implicate the NAcc in threat. Here, we directly revealed NAcc threat firing by recording single-unit activity during multicue fear discrimination. Most cue-responsive NAcc neurons markedly altered firing to threat cues. Finer analyses revealed a NAcc population signaling threat, specifically decreasing firing to danger and uncertainty cues; and a NAcc population signaling Bidirectional Valence, increasing firing to reward but decreasing firing to the danger cue. The results reveal the NAcc to be a source of threat information and a valence hub.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Corticostriatal Suppression of Appetitive Pavlovian Conditioned Responding</a></h4>

              
                <p>The capacity to suppress learned responses is essential for animals to adapt in dynamic environments. Extinction is a process by which animals learn to suppress conditioned responding when an expected outcome is omitted. The infralimbic (IL) cortex to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) neural circuit is implicated in suppressing conditioned responding after extinction, especially in the context of operant cocaine-seeking behavior. However, the role of the IL-to-NAcS neural circuit in the extinction of responding to appetitive Pavlovian cues is unknown, and the psychological mechanisms involved in response suppression following extinction are unclear. We trained male Long Evans rats to associate a 10 s auditory conditioned stimulus (CS; 14 trials per session) with a sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.2 ml per CS) in a specific context, and then following extinction in a different context, precipitated a renewal of CS responding by presenting the CS alone in the original Pavlovian conditioning context. Unilateral, optogenetic stimulation of the IL-to-NAcS circuit selectively during CS trials suppressed renewal. In a separate experiment, IL-to-NAcS stimulation suppressed CS responding regardless of prior extinction and impaired extinction retrieval. Finally, IL-to-NAcS stimulation during the CS did not suppress the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioning but was required for the subsequent expression of CS responding. These results are consistent with multiple studies showing that the IL-to-NAcS neural circuit is involved in the suppression of operant cocaine-seeking, extending these findings to appetitive Pavlovian cues. The suppression of appetitive Pavlovian responding following IL-to-NAcS circuit stimulation, however, does not appear to be an extinction-dependent process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Extinction is a form of inhibitory learning through which animals learn to suppress conditioned responding in the face of nonreinforcement. We investigated the role of the IL cortex inputs to the NAcS in the extinction of responding to appetitive Pavlovian cues and the psychological mechanisms involved in response suppression following extinction. Using <I>in vivo</I> optogenetics, we found that stimulating the IL-to-NAcS neural circuit suppressed context-induced renewal of conditioned responding after extinction. In a separate experiment, stimulating the IL-to-NAcS circuit suppressed conditioned responding in an extinction-independent manner. These findings can be used by future research aimed at understanding how corticostriatal circuits contribute to behavioral flexibility and mental disorders that involve the suppression of learned behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Working Memory for Spatial Sequences: Developmental and Evolutionary Factors in Encoding Ordinal and Relational Structures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sequence learning is a ubiquitous facet of human and animal cognition. Here, using a common sequence reproduction task, we investigated whether and how the ordinal and relational structures linking consecutive elements are acquired by human adults, children, and macaque monkeys. While children and monkeys exhibited significantly lower precision than adults for spatial location and temporal order information, only monkeys appeared to exceedingly focus on the first item. Most importantly, only humans, regardless of age, spontaneously extracted the spatial relations between consecutive items and used a chunking strategy to compress sequences in working memory. Monkeys did not detect such relational structures, even after extensive training. Monkey behavior was captured by a conjunctive coding model, whereas a chunk-based conjunctive model explained more variance in humans. These age- and species-related differences are indicative of developmental and evolutionary mechanisms of sequence encoding and may provide novel insights into the uniquely human cognitive capacities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sequence learning, the ability to encode the order of discrete elements and their relationships presented within a sequence, is a ubiquitous facet of cognition among humans and animals. By exploring sequence-processing abilities at different human developmental stages and in nonhuman primates, we found that only humans, regardless of age, spontaneously extracted the spatial relations between consecutive items and used an internal language to compress sequences in working memory. The findings provided insights into understanding the origins of sequence capabilities in humans and how they evolve through development to identify the unique aspects of human cognitive capacity, which includes the comprehension, learning, and production of sequences, and perhaps, above all, language processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Category-Biased Neural Representations Form Spontaneously during Learning That Emphasizes Memory for Specific Instances</a></h4>

              
                <p>Category learning, learning to sort a set of stimuli into categories or groups, can induce category biases in perception such that items in the same category are perceived as more similar than items from different categories. To what degree category bias develops when learning goals emphasize individuation of each stimulus and whether the bias emerges spontaneously during learning itself rather than in response to task demands is unclear. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) during encoding to test for category biases in neural representations of individual stimuli during learning. Human participants (males and females) encountered face-blend stimuli with unique first names and shared family names that indicated category membership. Participants were instructed to learn the full name for each face. Neural pattern classification and pattern similarity analyses were used to track category information in the brain. Results showed that stimulus category could be decoded during encoding across many frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. Furthermore, two stimuli from the same category were represented more similarly in the prefrontal cortex than two stimuli from different categories equated for physical similarity. These findings illustrate that a mere presence of category label can bias neural representations spontaneously during encoding to emphasize category-relevant information, even in the absence of explicit categorization demands and when category-irrelevant information remains relevant for task goals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Entities belonging to the same category are perceived as being more similar than entities belonging to different categories. Here, we show that neural representations highlighting category-relevant information form spontaneously during encoding. Notably, the presence of a category label led to neural category bias although participants focused on remembering individual stimuli and category-irrelevant stimulus features remained important for explicit task goals. These results may inform our understanding of bias in general and suggest that bias may emerge when category information is present even when one's explicit focus is on individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Contribution of Granular and Agranular Subdivisions of the Retrosplenial Cortex to Remote Contextual Fear Memory Retrieval</a></h4>

              
                <p>The retrieval of recent and remote memories are thought to rely on distinct brain circuits and mechanisms. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is robustly activated during the retrieval of remotely acquired contextual fear memories (CFMs), but the contribution of particular subdivisions [granular (RSG) vs agranular retrosplenial area (RSA)] and the circuit mechanisms through which they interact to retrieve remote memories remain unexplored. In this study, using both anterograde and retrograde viral tracing approaches, we identified excitatory projections from layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the RSG to the CA1 stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare of the dorsal hippocampus and the superficial layers of the RSA in male mice. We found that chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of the RSG-to-CA1, but not the RSG-to-RSA, pathway selectively impairs the retrieval of remote CFMs. Collectively, our results uncover a specific role for the RSG in remote CFM recall and provide circuit evidence that RSG-mediated remote CFM retrieval relies on direct RSG-to-CA1 connectivity. The present study provides a better understanding of brain circuit mechanisms underlying the retrieval of remote CFMs and may help guide the development of therapeutic strategies to attenuate remote traumatic memories that lead to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The RSC is implicated in contextual information processing and remote recall. However, how different subdivisions of the RSC and circuit mechanisms through which they interact to underlie remote memory recall remain unexplored. This study shows that granular subdivision of the RSC and its input to hippocampal area CA1 contributes to the retrieval of remote contextual fear memories. Our results support the hypothesis that the RSC and hippocampus require each other to preserve fear memories and may provide a novel therapeutic avenue to attenuate remote traumatic memories in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reliability of Neural Entrainment in the Human Auditory System</a></h4>

              
                <p>Auditory stimuli are often rhythmic in nature. Brain activity synchronizes with auditory rhythms via neural entrainment, and entrainment seems to be beneficial for auditory perception. However, it is not clear to what extent neural entrainment in the auditory system is reliable over time, which is a necessary prerequisite for targeted intervention. The current study aimed to establish the reliability of neural entrainment over time and to predict individual differences in auditory perception from associated neural activity. Across two different sessions, human listeners (21 females, 17 males) detected silent gaps presented at different phase locations of a 2 Hz frequency-modulated (FM) noise while EEG activity was recorded. As expected, neural activity was entrained by the 2 Hz FM noise. Moreover, gap detection was sinusoidally modulated by the phase of the 2 Hz FM into which the gap fell. Critically, both the strength of neural entrainment as well as the modulation of performance by the stimulus rhythm were highly reliable over sessions. Moreover, gap detection was predictable from pregap neural 2 Hz phase and alpha amplitude. Our results demonstrate that neural entrainment in the auditory system and the resulting behavioral modulation are reliable over time, and both entrained delta and nonentrained alpha oscillatory activity contribute to near-threshold stimulus perception. The latter suggests that improving auditory perception might require simultaneously targeting entrained brain rhythms as well as the alpha rhythm.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural activity synchronizes to the rhythms in sounds via neural entrainment, which seems to be important for successful auditory perception. A natural hypothesis is that improving neural entrainment, for example, via brain stimulation, should benefit perception. However, the extent to which neural entrainment is reliable over time, a necessary prerequisite for targeted intervention, has not been established. Using electroencephalogram recordings, we demonstrate that both neural entrainment to FM sounds and stimulus-induced behavioral modulation are reliable over time. Moreover, moment-by-moment fluctuations in perception are best predicted by entrained delta phase and nonentrained alpha amplitude. This work suggests that improving auditory perception might require simultaneously targeting entrained brain rhythms as well as the alpha rhythm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Progressions of Neuronal Activity Changes Underlie the Formation and Consolidation of a Gustatory Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acquiring new memories is a multistage process. Numerous studies have convincingly demonstrated that initially acquired memories are labile and are stabilized only by later consolidation processes. These multiple phases of memory formation are known to involve modification of both cellular excitability and synaptic connectivity, which in turn change neuronal activity at both the single neuron and ensemble levels. However, the specific mapping between the known phases of memory and the changes in neuronal activity at different organizational levels&mdash;the single-neuron, population representations, and ensemble-state dynamics&mdash;remains unknown. Here we address this issue in the context of conditioned taste aversion learning by continuously tracking gustatory cortex neuronal taste responses in alert male and female rats during the 24 h following a taste&ndash;malaise pairing. We found that the progression of activity changes depends on the neuronal organizational level: whereas the population response changed continuously, the population mean response amplitude and the number of taste-responsive neurons only increased during the acquisition and consolidation phases. In addition, the known quickening of the ensemble-state dynamics associated with the faster rejection of harmful foods appeared only after consolidation. Overall, these results demonstrate how complex dynamics in the different representational levels of cortical activity underlie the formation and stabilization of memory within the cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memory formation is a multiphased process; early acquired memories are labile and consolidate to their stable forms over hours and days. The progression of memory is assumed to be supported by changes in neuronal activity, but the mapping between memory phases and neuronal activity changes remains elusive. Here we tracked cortical neuronal activity over 24 h as rats acquired and consolidated a taste&ndash;malaise association memory, and found specific differences between the progression at the single-neuron and populations levels. These results demonstrate how balanced changes on the single-neuron level lead to changes in the network-level representation and dynamics required for the stabilization of memories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Genetic Reduction of Mitochondria Complex I Subunits is Protective against Cisplatin-Induced Neurotoxicity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent side effect of widely used platinum-based anticancer agents. There are few predictable risk factors with which to identify susceptible patients. Effective preventive measures or treatments are not available. Here, we have used a model of CIPN in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> to identify genetic changes that confer resistance to cisplatin-induced neuronal damage but not in the rapidly dividing cells of the ovary. The <I>Drosophila</I> strain <I>attP40</I>, used as a genetic background for the creation of RNAi lines, is resistant to cisplatin damage compared with the similar <I>attP2</I> background strain. <I>attP40</I> flies have reduced mRNA expression of <I>ND-13A</I>, a component of the mitochondria electron transport chain complex I. Reduction of <I>ND-13A</I> via neuron-specific RNAi leads to resistance to the dose-dependent climbing deficiencies and neuronal apoptosis observed in control flies. These flies are also resistant to acute oxidative stress, suggesting a mechanism for resistance to cisplatin. The mitochondria of <I>attP40</I> flies function similarly to control <I>attP2</I> mitochondria under normal conditions. Mitochondria are damaged by cisplatin, leading to reduced activity, but <I>attP40</I> mitochondria are able to retain function and even increase basal respiration rates in response to this stress. This retained mitochondrial activity is likely mediated by Sirt1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1&alpha;, and is key to cisplatin resistance. Our findings represent the potential for both identification of susceptible patients and prevention of CIPN through the targeting of mitochondria.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a major, debilitating side effect of many platinum-based cancer drugs. There are few available screening tools to identify patients at risk, and there are no effective treatments. Here, we report a novel genetic change that confers resistance to cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity in a <I>Drosophila</I> model while preserving the toxic effect in rapidly dividing cells. This work has the potential to influence patient susceptibility testing and development of novel CIPN preventive treatments.</p>

                Background: Protein inadequacy is prevalent in developing countries because of the high consumption of starchy staple foods. Sago, as a staple food in Papua Province, was eaten with less protein. This study aimed to analyze the nutritional status of protein-energy in well-nourished adults of the moderately low protein in-take (MLP)-sago group compared to the sufficient protein intake (SP)-rice group, in lowland Mimika, Papua. Methods: This cross-sectional-analytic study was conducted on 50 participants. Twenty-four-hour food recall, body composition, albumin, and complete blood count were used to assess the nutritional status. Results: There were no differences in the body compositions and albumin levels between the MLP-sago and SP-rice groups. Multivariate linear regression showed that the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (β = -0.524, P = 0.007) was a predictive factor for albumin in the sago group, while in the rice group, hemoglobin (β = 0.354 P = 0.089) and white blood cell counts (β = 0.396, P = 0.059) were predictive factors. Conclusions: The MLP-sago and SP-rice groups exhibited no differences in the  body and visceral protein; however different predictors of albumin were found be- tween the groups, suggesting an adaptive mechanism in the MLP-sago group to  maintain normal albumin levels.

                Introduction: This paper discusses the ethical considerations involved in conducting qualitative non-therapeutic research on people suffering from obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), a topic covered in few, if any, prior studies. Methods: The study summarizes in depth the existing literature on ethical aspects of conducting qualitative and nursing research with psychiatric patients. It constructs an overview of the most important points that should be taken into account when conducting non-therapeutic qualitative research on individuals with this disorder. Results: This paper draws attention to three ethical considerations: (1) informed consent; (2) OCD sufferer’s competence to give consent; and (3) aspects of the relationship that arises between the researcher and participant. Conclusions: This paper argues that those with OCD remain capable of giving consent, notwithstanding the continuing debates around their cognitive condition. It also provides an informative overview of aspects concerning their competence and insight, and suggests precautions to be followed when conducting interviews, paying attention to several factors that may determine the nature of the interview. Keywords: qualitative research, non-therapeutic research, ethical considerations, obsessive–compulsive disorder.

                Background: Obesity is a serious condition because it is associated with other chronic diseases which affect the quality of life. In addition to problems associated with diet and exercise, recent research has found that pesticide exposure might be another important risk factor. The objective of this study was to determine the association between pesticide exposure and obesity among farmers in Nakhon Sawan and Phitsanulok province, Thailand.  Methods: This study was a population-based cross-sectional study. Data on pesticide use and obesity prevalence from 20,295 farmers aged 20 years and older were collected using an in-person interview questionnaire. The association was analysed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for its potential confounding factors.  Results: Obesity was found to be associated with pesticide use in the past. The risk of obesity was significantly predicted by types of pesticides, including insecticides (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.09-4.74), herbicides (OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.16-19.29), fungicides (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.37-3.44), rodenticides (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.59-3.99), and molluscicides (OR = 3.37, 95% CI 2.13-5.31). Among 35 surveyed individual pesticides, 24 were significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.00-3.06 to OR = 8.37, 95% CI 3.97-17.64), including herbicide butachlor, 17 insecticides (three carbamate insecticides, five organochlorine insecticides, and nine organophosphate insecticides), and six fungicides.  Conclusion: This study found obesity in farmers in Nakhon Sawan and Phitsanulok province, Thailand, to be associated with the long-term use of several types of pesticides. The issue should receive more public attention, and pesticide use should be strictly controlled.

                Background: Intensified efforts to improve tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are needed to meet global EndTB targets. Community health workers’ (CHWs) knowledge with respect to case finding is vital in tuberculosis elimination. This study aimed to determine the effect of tuberculosis training on the knowledge of community health workers in Nigeria. Methods: As part of a larger multicomponent intervention study, a randomised control trial was conducted with CHWs in 18 primary health care (PHC) clusters in Nigeria. The clusters were allocated to three arms: training and cash incentive (A), training only (B), and control (C) arms. Arms (A) and (B) received training on tuberculosis symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment while the control arm (C) did not receive training. Participants’ knowledge on tuberculosis was assessed using questionnaires administered pre- and post-intervention. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Descriptive data was presented in tables and bivariate data was analyzed using chi square. Statistical significance was set as P<0.05. Results: There was a significant increase in the total knowledge score (25.4%), knowledge of general symptoms (24.4%), prevention (22.6%) and diagnosis and treatment (30.0%) across all study arms post-intervention (p<0.0001). Compared with the control arm, the training arm (A) had a higher proportion of good total knowledge score (94.4%) and arm (B) had a lower proportion of good total knowledge score (83.1%) when compared to the control group (93.1%). These were, however, not statistically significant. Conclusions: An improvement in the CHWs’ knowledge of symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis was observed after a training intervention was done. Integration of routine tuberculosis training is recommended to improve tuberculosis case finding in high burden communities.

                Background: Physical activity, including aerobic exercise, is highly recommended for chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients to improve pain intensity and functional disability. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of different aerobic exercises to reduce pain intensity and functional disability in patients with CLBP. Methods: A computer-aided search was performed to find Randomised controlled Trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of different aerobic exercises in CLBP. Articles published between January 2007 to December 2020 were included in the review. Quality assessment using the PEDro scale, extraction of relevant information, and evaluation of outcomes were done by two reviewers independently. Results: A total of 17 studies were included that involved 1146 participants. Outcomes suggested that aerobic exercise combined with other interventions was more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Aerobic exercise with higher frequency (≥ 5 days/week) and longer duration (≥ 12 weeks) were effective to gain clinically significant (≥ 30%) improvements. Environment and using pedometer did not seem to influence the outcomes. Conclusions: Pain intensity and functional disability in CLBP patients can be minimized by prescribing aerobic exercise. However, to get better improvements, aerobic exercise should be done in combination with other interventions and at optimum frequency and duration. Further studies should emphasize examining the optimal doses and period of different aerobic exercises.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thunderstruck: The ACDC model of flexible sequences and rhythms in recurrent neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cristian Buc Calderon, Tom Verguts, Michael J. Frank</p>

Adaptive sequential behavior is a hallmark of human cognition. In particular, humans can learn to produce precise spatiotemporal sequences given a certain context. For instance, musicians can not only reproduce learned action sequences in a context-dependent manner, they can also quickly and flexibly reapply them in any desired tempo or rhythm without overwriting previous learning. Existing neural network models fail to account for these properties. We argue that this limitation emerges from the fact that sequence information (i.e., the position of the action) and timing (i.e., the moment of response execution) are typically stored in the same neural network weights. Here, we augment a biologically plausible recurrent neural network of cortical dynamics to include a basal ganglia-thalamic module which uses reinforcement learning to dynamically modulate action. This “associative cluster-dependent chain” (ACDC) model modularly stores sequence and timing information in distinct loci of the network. This feature increases computational power and allows ACDC to display a wide range of temporal properties (e.g., multiple sequences, temporal shifting, rescaling, and compositionality), while still accounting for several behavioral and neurophysiological empirical observations. Finally, we apply this ACDC network to show how it can learn the famous “Thunderstruck” song intro and then flexibly play it in a “bossa nova” rhythm without further training.

                <p>by Gabriela Canto-Encalada, Diego Tec-Campos, Juan D. Tibocha-Bonilla, Karsten Zengler, Alejandro Zepeda, Cristal Zuñiga</p>

The ammonia-oxidizing bacterium <i>Nitrosomonas europaea</i> has been widely recognized as an important player in the nitrogen cycle as well as one of the most abundant members in microbial communities for the treatment of industrial or sewage wastewater. Its natural metabolic versatility and extraordinary ability to degrade environmental pollutants (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene) enable it to thrive under various harsh environmental conditions. Constraint-based metabolic models constructed from genome sequences enable quantitative insight into the central and specialized metabolism within a target organism. These genome-scale models have been utilized to understand, optimize, and design new strategies for improved bioprocesses. Reduced modeling approaches have been used to elucidate <i>Nitrosomonas europaea</i> metabolism at a pathway level. However, genome-scale knowledge about the simultaneous oxidation of ammonia and pollutant metabolism of <i>N</i>. <i>europaea</i> remains limited. Here, we describe the reconstruction, manual curation, and validation of the genome-scale metabolic model for <i>N</i>. <i>europaea</i>, <i>i</i>GC535. This reconstruction is the most accurate metabolic model for a nitrifying organism to date, reaching an average prediction accuracy of over 90% under several growth conditions. The manually curated model can predict phenotypes under chemolithotrophic and chemolithoorganotrophic conditions while oxidating methane and wastewater pollutants. Calculated flux distributions under different trophic conditions show that several key pathways are affected by the type of carbon source available, including central carbon metabolism and energy production.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RNA length has a non-trivial effect in the stability of biomolecular condensates formed by RNA-binding proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ignacio Sanchez-Burgos, Jorge R. Espinosa, Jerelle A. Joseph, Rosana Collepardo-Guevara</p>

Biomolecular condensates formed via liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal organization of the cell material. Nucleic acids can act as critical modulators in the stability of these protein condensates. Here, we present a multiscale computational strategy, exploiting the advantages of both a sequence-dependent coarse-grained representation of proteins and a minimal coarse-grained model that describes proteins as patchy colloids, to unveil the role of RNA length in regulating the stability of RNA-binding protein (RBP) condensates. We find that for a constant nucleotide/protein ratio at which phase separation is enhanced, the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS), which can phase separate on its own—i.e., via homotypic interactions—only exhibits a mild dependency on the RNA strand length. In contrast, the 25-repeat proline-arginine peptide (PR<sub>25</sub>), which does not undergo LLPS on its own at physiological conditions but instead exhibits complex coacervation with RNA—i.e., via heterotypic interactions—shows a strong dependence on the length of the RNA strands. Our minimal patchy particle simulations, where we recapitulate the modulation of homotypic protein LLPS and complex coacervation by RNA length, suggest that the strikingly different effect of RNA length on homotypic LLPS versus complex coacervation is general. Phase separation is RNA-length dependent as long as the relative contribution of heterotypic interactions sustaining LLPS is comparable or higher than that stemming from protein homotypic interactions. Taken together, our results contribute to illuminate the intricate physicochemical mechanisms that influence the stability of RBP condensates through RNA inclusion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Global diversity and balancing selection of 23 leading Plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine antigens</a></h4>

Investigation of the diversity of malaria parasite antigens can help prioritize and validate them as vaccine candidates and identify the most common variants for inclusion in vaccine formulations. Studies of vaccine candidates of the most virulent human malaria parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, have focused on a handful of well-known antigens, while several others have never been studied. Here we examine the global diversity and population structure of leading vaccine candidate antigens of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> using the MalariaGEN Pf3K (version 5.1) resource, comprising more than 2600 genomes from 15 malaria endemic countries. A stringent variant calling pipeline was used to extract high quality antigen gene ‘haplotypes’ from the global dataset and a new R-package named <i>VaxPack</i> was used to streamline population genetic analyses. In addition, a newly developed algorithm that enables spatial averaging of selection pressure on 3D protein structures was applied to the dataset. We analysed the genes encoding 23 leading and novel candidate malaria vaccine antigens including <i>csp</i>, <i>trap</i>, <i>eba175</i>, <i>ama1</i>, <i>rh5</i>, and <i>CelTOS</i>. Our analysis shows that current malaria vaccine formulations are based on rare haplotypes and thus may have limited efficacy against natural parasite populations. High levels of diversity with evidence of balancing selection was detected for most of the erythrocytic and pre-erythrocytic antigens. Measures of natural selection were then mapped to 3D protein structures to predict targets of functional antibodies. For some antigens, geographical variation in the intensity and distribution of these signals on the 3D structure suggests adaptation to different human host or mosquito vector populations. This study provides an essential framework for the diversity of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> antigens to be considered in the design of the next generation of malaria vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The first report on detecting SARS-CoV-2 inside human fecal-oral bacteria: A case series on asymptomatic family members and a child with COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Many studies report the importance of using feces as source sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 symptoms but who are negative to oropharyngeal/ nasopharyngeal tests. Here, we report the case of an asymptomatic child whose family members had negative results with the rapid antigen nasopharyngeal swab tests. The 21-month-old child presented with fever, diarrhea, bilateral conjunctivitis, and conspicuous lacrimation. In this study, analysis for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples by using Luminex technology allowed accurate detection of the presence of the viral RNA in the feces of the child and of all her relatives, which thus resulted to be positive but asymptomatic. It is the first time that SARS-CoV-2- is observed inside human fecal-oral bacteria and outside a matrix resembling extracellular bacterial lysates, in agreement with a bacteriophage mechanism with the images obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), post-embedding immunogold, and by fluorescence microscope. In addition to the typical observations of respiratory symptoms, accurate evaluation of clinical gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, combined with efficient highly sensitive molecular testing on feces, represent an efficient approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and for providing the correct therapy in challenging COVID-19 cases, like the one here reported.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effectiveness of a sexual assault nurse examiner-grounding program (SANE-GP) on knowledge, skill and practice regarding sexual assault examination (SAE) among nurses working in a tertiary care hospital in Udupi district, India: A study protocol [versi</a></h4>

              
                The medico-legal care of victims of sexual assault is very challenging, and requires specific knowledge and skills. Professionals in the emergency departments of hospitals might not have specialised training in forensic science. Nurses have a very significant role in these settings, but they lack any formal forensic training. This study aims to develop a sexual assault nurse examiner-grounding program (SANE-GP) for Indian nurses to inculcate knowledge and skill regarding sexual assault examination. The study adopts a three-stage Delphi technique to develop the training module and uses a time-series design to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. A questionnaire on nurses’ knowledge on sexual assault examination (KQSANE-I) will be developed in phase-I and subsequently used in phase-II. The protocol of SANE-GP will help the medical community to implement the program across India. The implementation of SANE-GP can also help to start a sexual assault nurse examiner network.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Laboratory protocol for the digital multiplexed gene expression analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples using the NanoString nCounter system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper describes a laboratory protocol to perform the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay from nasopharyngeal swab samples.  It is urgently necessary to identify factors related to severe symptoms of respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in order to assess the possibility of establishing preventive or preliminary therapeutic measures and to plan the services to be provided on hospital admission. At present, the samples recommended for microbiological diagnosis are those taken from the upper and/or the lower respiratory tract.  The NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay is a method based on the direct digital detection of mRNA molecules by means of target-specific, colour-coded probe pairs, without the need for mRNA conversion to cDNA by reverse transcription or the amplification of the resulting cDNA by PCR. This platform includes advanced analysis tools that reduce the need for bioinformatics support and also offers reliable sensitivity, reproducibility, technical robustness and utility for clinical application, even in RNA samples of low RNA quality or concentration, such as paraffin-embedded samples. Although the protocols for the analysis of blood or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples are provided by the manufacturer, no corresponding protocol for the analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples has yet been established. Therefore, the approach we describe could be adopted to determine the expression of target genes in samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using the nCOUNTER technology.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution quantitatively supports a therapeutic role in COVID-19 at a minimum dose of 20 mg per day [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background.  Various in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits multiple variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic and multiple observational clinical studies have shown that patients receiving fluoxetine experienced clinical benefit by lowering the risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to conduct population pharmacokinetic dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 50% (EC50) and 90% (EC90) inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells. Methods.  Pharmacometric parameter estimates used in this study were obtained from the U.S. FDA website from a new drug application for fluoxetine hydrochloride. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine antidepressant doses (20 mg/day, 30 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 50 mg/day, and 60 mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough plasma level for the EC50 and EC90 SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. All analyses and graphing were conducted in the R. Results.  By day-10 at 20 mg/day 93.2% and 47% of the population will achieve the trough target plasma EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectively, which translates to a lung tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher EC50 (283.6 ng/ml [0.82 mM]) and EC90 (1390.1 ng/ml [4.02 mM]). Further, by day-10 at an ideal dose of 40 mg/day, 99% and 93% of patients will reach the trough EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectfully. Lastly, only a dose of 60 mg/day will reach the SARS-CoV-2 EC90 inhibitory concentration in the brain. Conclusion. Overall, with a minimum treatment period of 10-days and a minimum dose of 20 mg/day, this study corroborates in vitro studies reporting fluoxetine inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 titers and also multiple observational clinical studies showing therapeutic benefit of fluoxetine in COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of oxidative stress markers in Indonesian chronic kidney disease patients: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several aspects of chronic kidney disease (CKD) such as the incidence rate and mortality rate are concerning. Oxidative stress contributes to progression and mortality in patients with CKD; however, a specific correlation between several markers of oxidative stress and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in the Indonesian population has not been sufficiently described yet. Methods: This study was an analytic observational study with a sample of 56 patients with CKD in Universitas Airlangga Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, from December 2019 – March 2020. The markers for oxidative stress investigated were urinary 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). The correlations between each variable of oxidative stress and CKD were analyzed using Pearson analysis. Results: There was a positive correlation between 8-OHdG and eGFR (p=0.00, r=0.51); however, there was a negative correlation between 8-OHdG and ACR (p=0.025, r=-0.30). SDMA and eGFR showed a negative correlation (p=0.00, r=-0.648), while SDMA and ACR showed a positive correlation (p=0.03, r=0.349). ADMA showed a negative correlation with eGFR (p=0.00, r=-0.476). There were significantly decreased 8-OHdG but increased ADMA and SDMA as the CKD stage progressed (p=0.001, p=0.00, and p = 0.00, respectively). Higher urine 8-OHdG was detected in patients without history of hemodialysis, whereas ADMA and SDMA showed higher value in patients with hemodialysis (p=0.00, p=0.00, and p=0.004, respectively), patients with history of diabetes mellitus (DM) had higher mean 8-OHdG (p 0.000) yet lower serum ADMA and SDMA (p=0.004 and p=0.003, respectively). Conclusions: In patients with CKD in Indonesia, the markers for oxidative stress 8-OHdG, SDMA, and ADMA are correlated with eGFR and ACR levels. There were also significant difference in 8-OHdG, SDMA, and ADMA levels among CKD stages, between dialysis vs non dialysis, and DM vs non DM patients.

                Background: Bioinformatics is becoming an essential tool for the majority of biological and biomedical researchers. Although bioinformatics data is exploited by academic and industrial researchers, limited focus is on teaching this area to undergraduates, postgraduates and senior scientists. Many scientists are developing their own expertise without formal training and often without appreciating the source of the data they are reliant upon. Some universities do provide courses on a variety of bioinformatics resources and tools, a few also provide biocuration projects, during which students submit data to annotation resources. Methods: To assess the usefulness and enjoyability of annotation projects a survey was sent to University College London (UCL) students who have undertaken Gene Ontology biocuration projects. Results: Analysis of survey responses suggest that these projects provide students with an opportunity not only to learn about bioinformatics resources but also to improve their literature analysis, presentation and writing skills. Conclusion: Biocuration student projects provide valuable annotations as well as enabling students to develop a variety of skills relevant to their future careers. It is also hoped that, as future scientists, these students will critically assess their own manuscripts and ensure that these are written with the biocurators of the future in mind.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">International validation of the Erasmus GBS Respiratory Insufficiency Score</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to validate the Erasmus Guillain-Barré syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score in the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study cohort, and to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined data from the first 1,500 included patients, aged ≥6 years and not ventilated prior to study entry. Patients with a clinical variant or mild symptoms were also included. Outcome was mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Model performance was assessed regarding the discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and the calibration (observed versus predicted probability of mechanical ventilation), in the full cohort and in Europe/North America and Asia separately. We recalibrated the model to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the group of 1,023 eligible patients (Europe/North America n = 842, Asia n = 104, other n = 77), 104 (10%) required mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Area under the curve values were ≥ 0.80 for all validation subgroups. Mean observed proportions of mechanical ventilation were lower than predicted risks: full cohort 10% vs. 21%, Europe/North America 9% vs. 21% and Asia 17% vs. 23%. After recalibration, predicted risks for the full cohort and Europe/North America corresponded to observed proportions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This prospective, international, cohort study validated the Erasmus Guillain-Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score, and showed that the model can be used in the full spectrum of Guillain-Barré syndrome patients. In addition, a more accurate, region-specific version of the model was developed for patients from Europe/North America.</p>

                How do protein aggregates contribute to neurodegenerative disorders, and can they be therapeutically targeted? In this issue of Neuron, Stojkovska et al. (2022) show that aggregated α-synuclein disrupts ER and lysosomal function in Parkinson’s disease patient-derived neurons and that combined enhancement of multiple arms of the proteostasis network improves these defects.

                In this issue of Neuron, Chevée et al. (2022) performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings from claustrum neurons during a sensory selection task. They found that neural activity in the claustrum reflected future motor output rather than sensory inputs and that chemogenetic suppression of claustrum activity reduced motor impulsivity in this task.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cooperation among c-subunits of FoF1-ATP synthase in rotation-coupled proton translocation</a></h4>

              
                In F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase, proton translocation through F<sub>o</sub> drives rotation of the <i>c</i>-subunit oligomeric ring relative to the <i>a</i>-subunit. Recent studies suggest that in each step of the rotation, key glutamic acid residues in different <i>c</i>-subunits contribute to proton release to and proton uptake from the <i>a</i>-subunit. However, no studies have demonstrated cooperativity among <i>c</i>-subunits toward F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase activity. Here, we addressed this using <i>Bacillus</i> PS3 ATP synthase harboring a <i>c</i>-ring with various combinations of wild-type and <i>c</i>E56D, enabled by genetically fused single-chain <i>c</i>-ring. ATP synthesis and proton pump activities were decreased by a single <i>c</i>E56D mutation and further decreased by double <i>c</i>E56D mutations. Moreover, activity further decreased as the two mutation sites were separated, indicating cooperation among <i>c</i>-subunits. Similar results were obtained for proton transfer-coupled molecular simulations. The simulations revealed that prolonged proton uptake in mutated <i>c</i>-subunits is shared between two <i>c</i>-subunits, explaining the cooperation observed in biochemical assays.

                Pupil diameter is often treated as a noninvasive readout of activity in the locus coeruleus (LC). However, how accurately it can be used to index LC activity is not known. To address this question, we established a graded relationship between pupil size changes and LC spiking activity in mice, where pupil dilation increased monotonically with the number of LC spikes. However, this relationship exists with substantial variability such that pupil diameter can only be used to accurately predict a small fraction of LC activity on a moment-by-moment basis. In addition, pupil exhibited large session-to-session fluctuations in response to identical optical stimulation in the LC. The variations in the pupil–LC relationship were strongly correlated with decision bias-related behavioral variables. Together, our data show that substantial variability exists in an overall graded relationship between pupil diameter and LC activity, and further suggest that the pupil–LC relationship is dynamically modulated by brain states, supporting and extending our previous findings (Yang et al., 2021).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rolling circle RNA synthesis catalysed by RNA</a></h4>

              
                RNA-catalysed RNA replication is widely considered a key step in the emergence of life's first genetic system. However, RNA replication can be impeded by the extraordinary stability of duplex RNA products, which must be dissociated for re-initiation of the next replication cycle. Here we have explored rolling circle synthesis (RCS) as a potential solution to this strand separation problem. We observe sustained RCS by a triplet polymerase ribozyme beyond full-length circle synthesis with strand displacement yielding concatemeric RNA products. Furthermore, we show RCS of a circular Hammerhead ribozyme capable of self-cleavage and re-circularisation. Thus, all steps of a viroid-like RNA replication pathway can be catalysed by RNA alone. Finally, we explore potential RCS mechanisms by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate a progressive build-up of conformational strain upon RCS' with destabilisation of nascent strand 5'- and 3'-ends. Our results have implications for the emergence of RNA replication and for understanding the potential of RNA to support complex genetic processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Broca area homologue's asymmetry reflects gestural communication lateralisation in monkeys (Papio anubis)</a></h4>

              
                Manual gestures and speech recruit a common neural network, involving Broca's area in the left hemisphere. Such speech-gesture integration gave rise to theories on the critical role of manual gesturing in the origin of language. Within this evolutionary framework, research on gestural communication in our closer primate relatives has received renewed attention for investigating its potential language-like features. Here, using <i>in-vivo</i> anatomical MRI in 50 baboons, we found that communicative gesturing is related to Broca homologue's marker in monkeys, namely the ventral portion of the Inferior Arcuate sulcus (<i>IA sulcus</i>). In fact, both direction and degree of gestural communication's handedness - but not handedness for object manipulation - are associated and correlated with contralateral depth asymmetry at this exact <i>IA sulcus</i> portion. In other words, baboons that prefer to communicate with their right hand have a deeper left-than-right <i>IA sulcus</i>, than those preferring to communicate with their left hand and vice versa. Interestingly, in contrast to handedness for object manipulation, gestural communication's lateralisation is not associated to the <i>Central sulcus</i> depth asymmetry, suggesting a double dissociation of handedness' types between manipulative action and gestural communication. It is thus not excluded that this specific gestural lateralisation signature within the baboons' frontal cortex might reflect a phylogenetical continuity with language-related Broca lateralisation in humans.

                Engineered Genetic Incompatibility (EGI) is a method to create species-like barriers to sexual reproduction. It has applications in pest control that mimic Sterile Insect Technique when only EGI males are released. This can be facilitated by introducing conditional female-lethality to EGI strains to generate a sex-sorting incompatible male system (SSIMS). Here, we demonstrate a proof of concept by combining tetracycline-controlled female lethality constructs with a <i>pyramus</i>-targeting EGI line in the model insect <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We show that both functions (incompatibility and sex-sorting) are robustly maintained in the SSIMS line and that this approach is effective for population suppression in cage experiments. Further we show that SSIMS males remain competitive with wild-type males for reproduction with wild-type females, including at the level of sperm competition.

                Despite profound mechanistic insight into motor pattern generation, for asynchronous insect flight - the most prevalent form of flight employed by >600.000 species - architecture and function of the underlying central pattern generating (CPG) neural network remain elusive. Combining electro- and optophysiology, Drosophila genetics, and mathematical modelling, we uncover a miniaturized circuit solution of motoneurons interconnected by electrical synapses that, contrary to doctrine, serve to de-synchronize network activity. This minimal gap-junctional motoneuron network suffices to translate unpatterned premotor input into stereotyped firing sequences which are conserved across species and generate stable wingbeat power. Mechanistically, network de-synchronization requires weak electrical coupling in conjunction with specific postsynaptic excitability dynamics, revealing an unexpected, generic feature in the control of neural circuit dynamics by electrical synapses.

                As in the mammalian system, sleep in Drosophila is regulated by multiple brain regions. Among them, neurons projecting to the dorsal Fan-Shaped Body (dFB) have been intensively studied and the data suggest they play a critical role for in sleep regulation. The 23E10-GAL4 driver is the most widely used tool to label and manipulate dFB neurons. Multiple studies have reported that activation of 23E10-GAL4 neurons promotes sleep. However, anatomical analysis revealed that 23E10-GAL4 labels 23-30 dFB neurons in the Drosophila brain and many non-dFB neurons in the brain and in the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC), the fly equivalent of the spinal cord. To better understand the role of individual dFB neurons in sleep regulation, we undertook a Split-GAL4 screen to gain access to subsets of 23E10-GAL expressing cells. In this study, we report the discovery of two VNC cholinergic sleep-promoting neurons labeled by the 23E10-GAL4 driver.

                Electron microscopy-based connectomes provide important insights into how visual circuitry of fruit fly Drosophila computes various visual features, guiding and complementing behavioral and physiological studies. However, connectomic analyses of lobula, a putative center of object-like feature detection, remains underdeveloped, largely because of incomplete data on the inputs to the brain region. Here, we attempted to map the columnar inputs into the Drosophila lobula neuropil by performing connectivity- and morphology-based clustering on a densely reconstructed connectome dataset. While the dataset mostly lacked visual neuropils other than lobula, which would normally help identify inputs to lobula, our clustering analysis successfully extracted clusters of cells with homogeneous connectivity and morphology, likely representing genuine cell types. We were able to draw a correspondence between the resulting clusters and previously identified cell types, revealing previously undocumented connectivity between lobula input and output neurons. While future, more complete connectomic reconstructions are necessary to verify the results presented here, they can serve as a useful basis for formulating hypotheses on mechanisms of visual feature detection in lobula.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural network of superiority illusion predicts the level of dopamine in striatum</a></h4>

              
                In evaluating the personality attributes and performance of the self, people are inclined to view themselves superior to others, a phenomenon known as superiority illusion (SI). This illusive outlook pervades people's thoughts, creating hope for the future and promoting mental health. Although a specific cortico-striatal functional connectivity (FC) under dopaminergic modulation was previously shown to be implicated in SI, the underlying whole-brain mechanisms have remained unclarified. Herein, to reveal the neural network subserving individual's SI, we conducted a data-driven, machine-learning investigation to explore the resting-state FC network across the whole brain. Using the locally-acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 123), we identified a set of 15 FCs most informative in classifying individuals with higher- versus lower-than-average levels of SI in evaluating positive trait words (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.81). Among the 15 FCs, the contribution level to the classification was 11% by the previously-highlighted cortico-striatal FC alone, but 60% by the encompassing cortico-limbico-striatal network cluster. A newly-identified, cortico-thalamic FC and another FC cluster also demonstrated substantial contribution. The classification accuracy was generalized into an independent cohort (n = 36; AUC = 0.73). Importantly, using the same set of 15 FCs, we achieved prediction on an individual's level of striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability (Pearson correlation, r = 0.46, P = 0.005). This is the first successful identification of the whole-brain neural network that simultaneously predicts the behavioral manifestation and molecular underpinning of an essential psychological process that promotes well-being and mental health.

                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) visualizes brain structures at increasingly higher resolution and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as field strength increases. Yet, mapping the BOLD response to distinct neuronal processes continues to be challenging. Here, we performed 3T and 7T-fMRI analysis of motor-task activation and resting-state connectivity with adjusted SNR. We then applied graph theory to analyze resting-state neuronal networks detected by fMRI after a simple motor task. Despite adjusted SNR, 7T achieved a higher functional specificity of the BOLD response than 3T-fMRI. Following the motor task, 7T-fMRI therefore enabled the detection of an "offline replay" that was directly linked to brain regions associated with memory consolidation. These findings reveal how memory processing is initiated even after simple motor tasks and begins earlier than previously shown. Thus, the superior capability of 7T-fMRI to detect subtle functional dynamics promises to improve diagnostics and therapeutic assessment of neurological diseases.

                Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has accelerated human neuroscience by fostering the analysis of brain structure, function, and connectivity across multiple scales and in living brains. The richness and complexity of multimodal neuroimaging, however, demands processing methods to integrate information across modalities and different spatial scales. Here, we present micapipe, an open processing pipeline for BIDS-conform multimodal MRI datasets. micapipe can generate i) structural connectomes derived from diffusion tractography, ii) functional connectomes derived from resting-state signal correlations, iii) geodesic distance matrices that quantify cortico-cortical proximity, and iv) microstructural profile covariance matrices that assess inter-regional similarity in cortical myelin proxies. These matrices are routinely generated across established 18 cortical parcellations (100-1000 parcels), in addition to subcortical and cerebellar parcellations. Results are represented on three different surface spaces (native, conte69, fsaverage5), and outputs are BIDS-conform. Processed outputs can be quality controlled at the individual and group level. micapipe was tested on several datasets and is available at https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe, documented at https://micapipe.readthedocs.io/, and containerized as a BIDS App http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/. We hope that micapipe will foster robust and integrative studies of human brain microstructure, morphology, and connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human neural progenitors establish a diffusion barrier in the ER membrane during cell division</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetric segregation of cellular components regulates the fate and behavior of somatic stem cells. Similar to dividing budding yeast and precursor cells in C. elegans, it has been shown that mouse neural progenitors establish a diffusion barrier in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which has been associated with asymmetric partitioning of damaged proteins and cellular age. However, the existence of an ER-diffusion barrier in human cells remains unknown. Here we used fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) imaging to show that human embryonic stem cell (hESC)- and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells establish an ER-diffusion barrier during cell division. The human ER-diffusion barrier is regulated via Lamin-dependent mechanisms and is associated with asymmetric segregation of mono- and polyubiquitinated, damaged proteins. Further, forebrain regionalized organoids derived from hESCs were used to show the establishment of an ER-membrane diffusion barrier in more naturalistic tissues mimicking early steps of human brain development. Thus, the data provided here show that human neural progenitors establish a diffusion barrier during cell division in the membrane of the ER, which may allow for asymmetric segregation of cellular components, contributing to the fate and behavior of human neural progenitor cells.

                Human genetics has identified numerous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and other psychiatric disorders. However, the lack of standardized biological resources impedes understanding of the common pathophysiology of ASD. Here, using next-generation chromosome engineering based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we established a biological resource including 65 genetically modified mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines as genetic models of human SNVs and CNVs. To illustrate cell-type and CNV specific molecular features of ASD, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (37,397 cells in total), morphological, and physiological analyses using 12 representative cell lines with CNVs highly associated with ASD. These results uncover gene ontology (GO) terms, canonical pathways, upstream regulators, and related neuropsychiatric disorders in a cell-type and CNV specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabolic switch in the aging astrocyte evidenced via integrative approach comprising network and transcriptome analyses</a></h4>

              
                Central energy metabolism is a pivotal process dysregulated during brain aging. The neuron and the astrocyte form an extensive interconnected metabolic network that allows achieving the high energy demand required by the neuron to propagate information in the brain. While most of this energy is utilized to re-establish cation gradients in neurons and glial cells, which specific genes in the neuron-astrocyte metabolic network are essential for continuous neurotransmission and are responsible for cognitive decline during brain aging remains largely unknown. To identify these gene products, we used a novel approach to analyze the neuron-astrocyte metabolic network, integrating network flux (optimality) and structure (centrality) and determined how the contribution of each gene in the network affected its function. Genes with the highest optimality and centrality scores were termed hub genes. They were searched in astrocyte and neuron transcriptomic databases to identify differential hub genes, which were differentially expressed during neurotransmission or aging. The identified differential hub genes suggest that during brain aging: 1) The neuron suffers energetic deficit by substantial downregulation of Krebs cycle genes including mdh1 and mdh2 (malate-aspartate shuttle), while the astrocyte undergoes a metabolic switch from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, hampering the supply of lactate to the neuron; 2) Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation hub genes were downregulated, including hub gene dld, an integrative gene that encodes for a subunit in BCAA-, pyruvate- and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes; and 3) Increased ketone body synthesis in the neuron and augmented astrocytic utilization, in line with neuronal energy deficit in favor of astrocytes. Differential hub gene identification was robust and resulted in novel candidates for future pre-clinical studies targeting energy metabolism to prevent age-associated cognitive decline. Importantly, our approach narrows down the number of candidate genes identified in transcriptomic databases by two orders of magnitude. This method may be applied to other metabolic cellular models in future omics studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">JUN Regulation of Injury-induced Enhancers in Schwann Cells</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells play a critical role after peripheral nerve injury by clearing myelin debris, forming axon-guiding Bands of Bungner, and re-myelinating regenerating axons. Schwann cells undergo epigenomic remodeling to differentiate into a repair state that expresses unique genes, some of which are not expressed at other stages of Schwann cell development. We previously identified a set of enhancers that are activated in Schwann cells after nerve injury, and we determined if these enhancers are pre-programmed into the Schwann cell epigenome as poised enhancers prior to injury. Poised enhancers share many attributes of active enhancers, such as open chromatin, but are marked by repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) rather than H3K27ac. We find that most injury-induced enhancers are not marked as poised enhancers prior to injury indicating that injury-induced enhancers are not pre-programmed in the Schwann cell epigenome. Injury-induced enhancers are enriched with AP-1 binding motifs, and the c-JUN subunit of AP-1 had been shown to be critical to drive the transcriptional response of Schwann cells after injury. Using in vivo ChIP-seq analysis we find that c-JUN binds to a subset of injury-induced enhancers. To test the role of specific injury-induced enhancers, we focused on c-JUN-binding enhancers upstream of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) gene, which is only upregulated in repair Schwann cells compared to other stages of Schwann cell development. We confirm that c-JUN regulates these enhancers and also show that the enhancers are required for robust induction of the Shh gene after injury.

                Sodium present in NaCl is a fundamental nutrient required for many physiological processes. In animals including Drosophila low-salt concentrations induce attraction and high-salt concentrations evoke aversive behavior. Although high salt detection pathways have been studied in great details but mechanisms that regulate high salt consumption in animals are largely undetermined. We looked into the neural mechanisms of high NaCl consumption in adult Drosophila by which flies modify their acceptance of high salt as a function of diet where a long-term high-salt exposure increases taste sensitivity of pharyngeal LSO neurons and enhance high salt intake. Exposing flies to high NaCl diet for three days show decline in high salt aversion under starvation. Additionally, genetic suppression of LSO pharyngeal neurons in high NaCl fed flies inhibit excessive salt intake. We observed this modulation requires functional LSO neurons and a starvation state or dopamine. Multiple independent taste receptor neurons and pathways are involved in such a modulation. Silencing any one of multiple LSO neuronal types inhibits excessive salt intake. Our study suggests flies can adapt to the amount of salt ingested over several days, indicating the presence of a critical mechanism to reset the salt appetite and related neural circuits.

                Animals use prior experience to assign absolute (good or bad) and also relative (better or worse) value to new experience. These learned values guide appropriate later decision-making. While our understanding of how the dopaminergic system computes absolute value is relatively advanced, the mechanistic underpinnings of relative valuation are unclear. Here we reveal mechanisms of absolute and relative aversive valuation in Drosophila. Three types of punishment-sensitive dopaminergic neurons (DANs) drive intensity-scaled plasticity at their respective mushroom body output neuron (MBON) connections to code absolute aversive value. In contrast, by comparing current and previous aversive experiences the MBON-DAN network can code relative aversive value by recruiting a specific subtype of reward-coding DANs which assigns a better than value to the lesser of two aversive experiences. This study therefore provides an important functional consequence of having opposing populations of DANs and illustrates how these can operate together as a system within the MB network to code and compare sequential aversive experience to learn relative aversive value.

                Humans automatically infer higher-order relationships between events in the environment from their statistical co-occurrence, often without conscious awareness. Neural replay of task representations, which has been described as sampling from a learned transition structure of the environment, is a candidate mechanism by which the brain could use or even learn such relational information in the service of adaptive behavior. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling revealed that participants acquired multi-step transition knowledge through gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model, although half of participants did not indicate any knowledge about the sequential task structure. To investigate neural replay, we analyzed dynamics of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns during short pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task. Evidence for sequential replay consistent with the probabilistic task structure was found in occipito-temporal and sensorimotor cortices during short on-task intervals. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task, and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust deep learning object recognition models rely on low frequency information in natural images</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning models have difficulty generalizing to data outside of the distribution they were trained on. In particular, vision models are usually vulnerable to adversarial attacks or common corruptions, to which the human visual system is robust. Recent studies have found that regularizing machine learning models to favor brain like representations can improve model robustness, but it is unclear why. We hypothesize that the increased model robustness is partly due to the low spatial frequency preference inherited from the neural representation. We tested this simple hypothesis with several frequency oriented analyses, including the design and use of hybrid images to probe model frequency sensitivity directly. We also examined many other publicly available robust models that were trained on adversarial images or with data augmentation, and found that all these robust models showed a greater preference to low spatial frequency information. We show that preprocessing by blurring can serve as a defense mechanism against both adversarial attacks and common corruptions, further confirming our hypothesis and demonstrating the utility of low spatial frequency information in robust object recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Embodiment of Supernumerary Robotic Limbs in Virtual Reality</a></h4>

              
                The supernumerary robotic limb system expands the motor function of human users by adding extra artificially designed limbs. It is important for us to embody the system as if it is a part of one's own body and to maintain cognitive transparency in which the cognitive load is suppressed. Embodiment studies have been conducted with an expansion of bodily functions through a "substitution" and "extension". However, there have been few studies on the "addition" of supernumerary body parts. In this study, we developed a supernumerary robotic limb system that operates in a virtual environment, and then evaluated whether the extra limb can be regarded as a part of one's own body using a questionnaire and whether the perception of peripersonal space changes with a visuotactile crossmodal congruency task. We found that the participants can embody the extra-limbs after using the supernumerary robotic limb system. We also found a positive correlation between the perceptual change in the crossmodal congruency task and the subjective feeling that the number of one's arms had increased (supernumerary limb sensation). These results suggest that the addition of an extra body part may cause the participants to feel that they had acquired a new body part that differs from their original body part through a functional expansion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anatomical variability, multi-modal coordinate systems, and precision targeting in the marmoset brain</a></h4>

              
                Localising accurate brain regions needs careful evaluation in each experimental species due to their individual variability. However, the function and connectivity of brain areas is commonly studied using a single-subject cranial landmark-based stereotactic atlas in animal neuroscience. Here, we address this issue in a small primate, the common marmoset, which is increasingly widely used in systems neuroscience. We developed a non-invasive multi-modal neuroimaging-based targeting pipeline, which accounts for intersubject anatomical variability in cranial and cortical landmarks in marmosets. This methodology allowed creation of multi-modal templates (MarmosetRIKEN20) including head CT and brain MR images, embedded in coordinate systems of anterior and posterior commissures (AC-PC) and CIFTI grayordinates. We found that the horizontal plane of the stereotactic coordinate was significantly rotated in pitch relative to the AC-PC coordinate system (10 degrees, frontal downwards), and had a significant bias and uncertainty due to positioning procedures. We also found that many common cranial and brain landmarks (e.g., bregma, intraparietal sulcus) vary in location across subjects and are substantial relative to average marmoset cortical area dimensions. Combining the neuroimaging-based targeting pipeline with robot-guided surgery enabled proof-of-concept targeting of deep brain structures with an accuracy of 0.2 mm. Altogether, our findings demonstrate substantial intersubject variability in marmoset brain and cranial landmarks, implying that subject-specific neuroimaging-based localization is needed for precision targeting in marmosets. The population-based templates and atlases in grayordinates, created for the first time in marmoset monkeys, should help bridging between macroscale and microscale analyses.

                Polarisation vision is commonplace among invertebrates; however, most experiments focus on determining behavioural and/or neurophysiological responses to static polarised light sources rather than moving patterns of polarised light. To this end, we designed a polarisation stimulation device based on superimposing polarised and non-polarised images from two projectors, which can display moving patterns at frame rates exceeding invertebrate flicker fusion frequencies. A linear polariser fitted to one projector enables moving patterns of polarised light to be displayed, whilst the other projector contributes arbitrary intensities of non-polarised light to yield moving patterns with a defined polarisation and intensity contrast. To test the device, we measured receptive fields of polarisation sensitive Argynnis paphia butterfly photoreceptors for both non-polarised and polarised light. We then measured local motion sensitivities of the optic flow-sensitive lobula plate tangential cell H1 in Calliphora vicina blowflies under both polarised and non-polarised light, finding no polarisation sensitivity in this neuron.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GLMsingle: a toolbox for improving single-trial fMRI response estimates</a></h4>

              
                Advances in modern artificial intelligence (AI) have inspired a paradigm shift in human neuroscience, yielding large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets that provide high-resolution brain responses to tens of thousands of naturalistic visual stimuli. Because such experiments necessarily involve brief stimulus durations and few repetitions of each stimulus, achieving sufficient signal-to-noise ratio can be a major challenge. We address this challenge by introducing GLMsingle, a scalable, user-friendly toolbox available in MATLAB and Python that enables accurate estimation of single-trial fMRI responses (glmsingle.org). Requiring only fMRI time-series data and a design matrix as inputs, GLMsingle integrates three techniques for improving the accuracy of trial-wise general linear model (GLM) beta estimates. First, for each voxel, a custom hemodynamic response function (HRF) is identified from a library of candidate functions. Second, cross-validation is used to derive a set of noise regressors from voxels unrelated to the experimental paradigm. Third, to improve the stability of beta estimates for closely spaced trials, betas are regularized on a voxel-wise basis using ridge regression. Applying GLMsingle to the Natural Scenes Dataset and BOLD5000, we find that GLMsingle substantially improves the reliability of beta estimates across visually-responsive cortex in all subjects. Furthermore, these improvements translate into tangible benefits for higher-level analyses relevant to systems and cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, we demonstrate that GLMsingle: (i) improves the decorrelation of response estimates between trials that are nearby in time; (ii) enhances representational similarity between subjects both within and across datasets; and (iii) boosts one-versus-many decoding of visual stimuli. GLMsingle is a publicly available tool that can significantly improve the quality of past, present, and future neuroimaging datasets that sample brain activity across many experimental conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociable neural correlates of multisensory coherence and selective attention</a></h4>

              
                Previous work has demonstrated that performance in an auditory selective attention task can be enhanced or impaired, depending on whether a task-irrelevant visual stimulus is temporally coherent with a target auditory stream or with a competing distractor. However, it remains unclear how audiovisual (AV) temporal coherence and auditory selective attention interact at the neurophysiological level. Here, we measured neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed an auditory selective attention task, detecting deviants in a target audio stream. The amplitude envelope of the two competing auditory streams changed independently, while the radius of a visual disc was manipulated to control the audiovisual coherence. Analysis of the neural responses to the sound envelope demonstrated that auditory responses were enhanced independently of the attentional condition: both target and masker stream responses were enhanced when temporally coherent with the visual stimulus. In contrast, attention enhanced the event-related response (ERP) evoked by the transient deviants, independently of AV coherence. Finally, we identified a spatiotemporal component of the ERP, likely originating from the superior temporal gyrus and the frontoparietal network, in which both attention and coherence synergistically modulated ERP amplitude. These results provide evidence for dissociable neural signatures of bottom-up (coherence) and top-down (attention) effects in the AV object formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oscillations without cortex: Working memory modulates brainwaves in the endbrain of crows</a></h4>

              
                Complex cognition requires coordinated neuronal activity at the network level. In mammals, this coordination results in distinct dynamics of local field potentials (LFP) that have been central in many models of higher cognition. Because these models are based on mammalian data, they often implicitly assume a cortical organization. Higher associative regions of the brains of birds do not have cortical layering, yet these regions have neuronal single cell correlates of higher cognition that are very similar to those found in mammals. Here we recorded LFP in the avian equivalent of prefrontal cortex while crows performed a highly controlled and cognitively demanding working memory task, adapted from monkeys. To further ensure that recordings reflected only cognitive processes detached from motor related activities we trained and monitored the animals to keep their head still. We found signatures in local field potentials, modulated by working memory demands. Frequencies of a narrow gamma (30-59 Hz) and of the beta band (13-19 Hz) contained information about the location of the target items on screen and were modulated by working memory load. This indicates critical involvement of these bands in ongoing cognitive processing. We also observed bursts in the beta and gamma frequencies, similar to those observed in monkeys. Such bursts are a vital part of activity silent models of working memory. Thus, despite the lack of a cortical organization the avian associative pallium can create LFP signatures reminiscent to those in observed in primates. This points towards a critical cognitive function of oscillatory dynamics, evolved through convergence in species capable of complex cognition.

	<p>As the clinical trial landscape for patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) expands, consideration of associated ethical challenges and opportunities is of ever-increasing importance. Responsible conduct of research in the vulnerable population of persons with DoC, including those with coma, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS), minimally conscious state (MCS), covert cortical processing (CCP), and cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), demands proactive deliberation of unique ethical issues that may arise and the adoption of robust protections to safeguard patients, surrogates, and other key stakeholders. Here we identify and critically evaluate four central categories of ethical considerations in clinical trials involving participants with DoC: (1) autonomy, respect for persons and informed consent of individuals with liminal consciousness; (2) balancing unknown benefits and risks, especially considering the epistemological gap between behavior and consciousness that complicates ordinary ascription of subjective states; (3) disclosure to surrogates and clinical teams of investigational results pertaining to consciousness; and (4) justice considerations, including equitable access to clinical trial enrollment across communities and geographies. We outline guiding principles and research opportunities for clinicians, neuroethicists, and researchers engaged in DoC clinical trials to advance ethical study design and deployment in this complex yet crucial area of investigation.</p>

	<p>A previous investigation demonstrated differences between younger adult normal-hearing listeners and older adult hearing-impaired listeners in the perceived emotion of clear and conversational speech. Specifically, clear speech sounded angry more often than conversational speech for both groups, but the effect was smaller for the older listeners. These listener groups differed by two confounding factors, age (younger vs. older adults) and hearing status (normal vs. impaired). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the contributions of aging and hearing loss to the reduced perception of anger in older adults with hearing loss. We investigated perceived anger in clear and conversational speech in younger adults with and without a simulated age-related hearing loss, and in older adults with normal hearing. Younger adults with simulated hearing loss performed similarly to normal-hearing peers, while normal-hearing older adults performed similarly to hearing-impaired peers, suggesting that aging was the primary contributor to the decreased anger perception seen in previous work. These findings confirm reduced anger perception for older adults compared to younger adults, though the significant speaking style effect&amp;amp;mdash;regardless of age and hearing status&amp;amp;mdash;highlights the need to identify methods of producing clear speech that is emotionally neutral or positive.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in two distinct niches in the mammalian brain, the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the forebrain lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. They are thought to be molecularly distinct since V-SVZ NSCs produce inhibitory olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons and SGZ NSCs excitatory dentate granule neurons. Here, we have asked whether this is so by directly comparing V-SVZ and SGZ NSCs from embryogenesis to adulthood using single-cell transcriptional data. We show that the embryonic radial glial precursor (RP) parents of these two NSC populations are very similar, but differentially express a small cohort of genes involved in glutamatergic versus GABAergic neurogenesis. These different RPs then undergo a similar gradual transition to a dormant adult NSC state over the first three postnatal weeks. This dormancy state involves transcriptional shutdown of genes that maintain an active, proliferative, prodifferentiation state and induction of genes involved in sensing and regulating their niche environment. Moreover, when reactivated to generate adult-born progeny, both populations reacquire a development-like state and re-express proneurogenic genes. Thus, V-SVZ and SGZ NSCs share a common transcriptional state throughout their lifespans and transition into and out of dormancy via similar trajectories.</p>

                Background: Malaria in pregnancy leading to placental malaria. The main pathogenesis of the complex foetal implications in placental malaria is tissue hypoxia, due to sequestrations of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes in the placenta, but the pathomechanism of placental Plasmodium vivax infection have not been studied in detail.  Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key transcriptional mediator of the response to hypoxic conditions which interacts with the change and imbalances of many chemical mediators including angiogenic factors, leading to abnormality of foetal growth. Methods: This study was conducted cross sectionally in Maumere, Sikka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province, that previously known as one of malaria endemic area with high incidence of low birth weight (LBW) cases. In this study the peripheral and umbilical blood samples as well as placental tissues were collected from mother delivered their babies with LBW at the TC Hiller Regional Hospital. All of the blood samples were examined for the presence of parasites by microscopic and PCR technique, while the plasma levels of VEGF, PlGF, and VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α were determined using ELISA. The sequestration of infected erythrocytes and hemozoin were determined from placental histological slides and the expression of placenta angiogenic factors were observed by immunofluorescent technique.  Results: In this study there were 33 cases had complete data to be analysed. Of them, there were 19 diagnosed as vivax malaria and no one of falciparum malaria. There were significant differences of Δ 10th percentile growth curve of baby’s body weights and also all angiogenic factors in placental tissues {VEGF, PlGF, and VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α} between those infected and not infected cases (p<0.05), but not for VEGF and VEGFR-2 in the plasma. Conclusion: This study found Plasmodium vivax sequestration may cause LBW through the changes and imbalances of angiogenic factors leaded by HIF-1α.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elementary vectors and autocatalytic sets for resource allocation in next-generation models of cellular growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefan Müller, Diana Széliová, Jürgen Zanghellini</p>

Traditional (genome-scale) metabolic models of cellular growth involve an approximate biomass “reaction”, which specifies biomass composition in terms of precursor metabolites (such as amino acids and nucleotides). On the one hand, biomass composition is often not known exactly and may vary drastically between conditions and strains. On the other hand, the predictions of computational models crucially depend on biomass. Also elementary flux modes (EFMs), which generate the flux cone, depend on the biomass reaction. To better understand cellular phenotypes across growth conditions, we introduce and analyze new classes of elementary vectors for comprehensive (next-generation) metabolic models, involving explicit synthesis reactions for all macromolecules. Elementary growth modes (EGMs) are given by stoichiometry and generate the growth cone. Unlike EFMs, they are not support-minimal, in general, but cannot be decomposed “without cancellations”. In models with additional (capacity) constraints, elementary growth vectors (EGVs) generate a growth polyhedron and depend also on growth rate. However, EGMs/EGVs do not depend on the biomass composition. In fact, they cover all possible biomass compositions and can be seen as unbiased versions of elementary flux modes/vectors (EFMs/EFVs) used in traditional models. To relate the new concepts to other branches of theory, we consider autocatalytic sets of reactions. Further, we illustrate our results in a small model of a self-fabricating cell, involving glucose and ammonium uptake, amino acid and lipid synthesis, and the expression of all enzymes and the ribosome itself. In particular, we study the variation of biomass composition as a function of growth rate. In agreement with experimental data, low nitrogen uptake correlates with high carbon (lipid) storage.

Preprints allow researchers to make their findings available to the scientific community before they have undergone peer review. Studies on preprints within bioRxiv have been largely focused on article metadata and how often these preprints are downloaded, cited, published, and discussed online. A missing element that has yet to be examined is the language contained within the bioRxiv preprint repository. We sought to compare and contrast linguistic features within bioRxiv preprints to published biomedical text as a whole as this is an excellent opportunity to examine how peer review changes these documents. The most prevalent features that changed appear to be associated with typesetting and mentions of supporting information sections or additional files. In addition to text comparison, we created document embeddings derived from a preprint-trained word2vec model. We found that these embeddings are able to parse out different scientific approaches and concepts, link unannotated preprint–peer-reviewed article pairs, and identify journals that publish linguistically similar papers to a given preprint. We also used these embeddings to examine factors associated with the time elapsed between the posting of a first preprint and the appearance of a peer-reviewed publication. We found that preprints with more versions posted and more textual changes took longer to publish. Lastly, we constructed a web application (https://greenelab.github.io/preprint-similarity-search/) that allows users to identify which journals and articles that are most linguistically similar to a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint as well as observe where the preprint would be positioned within a published article landscape.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Tracking changes between preprint posting and journal publication during a pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Liam Brierley, Federico Nanni, Jessica K. Polka, Gautam Dey, Máté Pálfy, Nicholas Fraser, Jonathon Alexis Coates</p>

Amid the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, preprints in the biomedical sciences are being posted and accessed at unprecedented rates, drawing widespread attention from the general public, press, and policymakers for the first time. This phenomenon has sharpened long-standing questions about the reliability of information shared prior to journal peer review. Does the information shared in preprints typically withstand the scrutiny of peer review, or are conclusions likely to change in the version of record? We assessed preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv that had been posted and subsequently published in a journal through April 30, 2020, representing the initial phase of the pandemic response. We utilised a combination of automatic and manual annotations to quantify how an article changed between the preprinted and published version. We found that the total number of figure panels and tables changed little between preprint and published articles. Moreover, the conclusions of 7.2% of non-COVID-19–related and 17.2% of COVID-19–related abstracts undergo a discrete change by the time of publication, but the majority of these changes do not qualitatively change the conclusions of the paper.

                Background: Anaerobic organisms have been known to have an association with dental infections, bacteremia, endocarditis and soft tissue infections. However, anaerobic isolation from bone and joint infections are relatively rare. Sparse literature has been found on reports of anaerobic osteomyelitis. There is no literature reported on anaerobic osteomyelitis complicating Tuberculosis of spine. Case Report: We report two cases of tuberculosis of spine complicated by aerobic and anerobic infections. The first is a case of a young female who presented with chronic lower backache and fever. Examination revealed a lumbar scoliosis with paraspinal tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed lumbar spondylodiscitis with multiple abscesses. There were air-fluid levels noted in the abscesses. The pus sent for CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test) was positive. Further the cultures also grew Escherichia coli (aerobic) Bacteroids fragilis and Peptoniphilus asachrolyticus (anaerobic) organisms. She improved with a course of intravenous antibiotics and decompression surgery. The second case is a middle aged man who presented with chronic neck pain and fever. Examination revealed kyphosis of the neck with spasm of the neck muscles and midline tenderness. MRI showed C4-5 cervical spondylodiscitis with parapharyngeal collections showing air-fluid levels. The pus culture showed Streptococcus constellatus (aerobic) and  Prevotella sps. (anaerobic). The CBNAAT report was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and cervical decompression. Conclusion: Though tubercular vertebral osteomyelitis (TVO) is usually a diagnosis in itself, it should not hinder us from considering secondary infections (both aerobic and anaerobic) complicating the osteomyelitis. Further, the presence of air-fluid levels on imaging studies and the presence of foul smell during operative exploration of the spine must arouse the suspicion of an anaerobic co-infection. Isolation and treatment of these organisms are crucial as they may hamper the clinical outcome of the primary TVO.

                Abstract Background: Asparaginases are common chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a single or combinational therapy. Accompanying hepatotoxicity makes its use in elderly patients with pre-conditions, as obesity or other hepatopathies, difficult. Various hepatoprotective compounds like, L-carnitine, are discussed to ameliorate the induced hepatotoxicity. Methods: Here we aimed to establish a mouse model to study the effect of asparaginases (L-asparaginase and Oncaspar) and L-carnitine on Western-diet-induced hepatosteatosis in mice. Dose-escalation studies were performed to analyze asparaginases induced hepatotoxicity in C57BL/6 mice with normal or fatty livers. Subsequently, the effect of L-carnitine to improve the induced toxicity was tested. Results: Our results showed mild-to-moderate hepatotoxic effects while the Western-diet induced a higher degree of vacuolization and hepatocyte damage in liver tissue. Testing of L-carnitine in the established models did not show any protective effect on the toxicity or impairment of the efficacy of asparaginases. Conclusion: The here established models were able to demonstrate the asparaginase-induced hepatotoxic effects which were enhanced by the Western-diet. However, to test potential ameliorating drugs, the models might need some improvements.

The accumulation of heavy metals in C. racemosa has a wide impact on the food chain in aquatic ecosystems and humans because this alga is a consumptive commodity.   Methods: Sampling of C. racemosa was carried out at seven sites on Bintan Island, Indonesia covering the eastern (Teluk Bakau, Beralas Pasir, Malang Rapat), northern (Berakit and Pengudang), western (Sakera), and southern parts (Tg. Siambang). Sampling was carried out during different monsoons, and heavy metals in water and sediment samples were measured to determine the heavy metal concentration. Heavy metals were analyzed by a spectrophotometric method using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.   Results: The results showed that heavy metal concentrations fluctuate according to changes in the wind season, which carry currents and spread pollutants into the water. The concentration of metal in the water is also from anthropogenic activities. The heavy metal content of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) in C. racemosa is high in locations close to settlements. Meanwhile, in seawater samples, Fe and Zn metals have the highest concentrations compared to others.  Conclusions: Ex-bauxite mines are a source of Fe and Zn metal contamination in the environment, especially at Tg. Siambang. The levels of these heavy metals in the sediment are also high, as surface particle deposits accumulate at the bottom of the sediment. In general, the levels of heavy metals Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe, and Zn increase in the northern monsoon because the dynamics of the water transport greater heavy metal pollution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unprecedented early-summer heat stress and forecast of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, 2021-2022 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is predicted to undergo its sixth mass coral bleaching event during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2021-2022. Coral bleaching-level heat stress over the GBR is forecast to start earlier than any previous year in the satellite record (1985-present). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) near real-time satellite-based heat stress products were used to investigate early-summer sea surface temperature (SST) and heat stress conditions on the GBR during late 2021. As of 14 December 2021, values of instantaneous heat stress (Coral Bleaching HotSpots) and accumulated heat stress over a 12-week running window (Degree Heating Weeks) on the GBR were unprecedented in the satellite record. Further, 89% of GBR satellite reef pixels for this date in 2021 had a positive seven-day SST trend of greater than 0.2 degrees Celsius/week. Background temperatures (the minimum temperature over the previous 29 days) were alarmingly high, with 87% of GBR reef pixels on 14 December 2021 being greater than the maximum SST over that same 29-day period for any year from 1985-2020. The GBR is starting the 2021-2022 summer season with more accumulated heat than ever before, which could have disastrous consequences for the health, recovery, and future of this critical reef system.

                Jovanovic and colleagues report that social signal processing in primate prefrontal cortex during traditional, head-restrained paradigms is not representative of the analogous process in natural communication. These findings suggest that some facets of primate social brain function can only be elucidated in the contexts in which they occur naturally.

                Rurak et al. show sex differences in cortical astroglial cells during early postnatal development, whereby male mice reach a mature state earlier than female mice. The sex differences are implicated in critical developmental functions including cell cycle, the construction of neuronal networks, and synapses.

                Sun et al. reveal a critical role for Zic5 in regulating the differentiation of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and rod photoreceptor layer by interacting and stabilizing Gli3, which functions predominantly as a repressor for the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway during Xenopus development.

Amacrine cell migration, neurite retraction, and synapse localization require different sets of motifs in the intracellular domain, with a prominent role for recruitment of the WRC.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Inhibition, but not excitation, recovers from partial cone loss with greater spatiotemporal integration, synapse density, and frequency</a></h4>

              
                Lee et al. find partial cone loss triggers inhibition, but not excitation, to increase spatiotemporal integration, recover contrast gain, and increase synaptic release onto retinal ganglion cells. Natural images filtered by cone-loss receptive fields perceptually match those of controls. Thus, inhibition compensates for fewer cones to potentially preserve perception.

                Bonfim-Melo et al. show that apical extrusion is the epithelial response to sporadic pyroptotic events. In contrast to apoptosis, pyroptosis causes a transient local increase in monolayer permeability that is corrected by rapid lamellipodial responses from the neighbors, rather than their contractility

                Contrasting with sugar-protein interactions, Spillings et al. describe a specific, non-electrostatic sugar-sugar interaction facilitating HIV and host cell attachment, which involves oligomannose, previously thought to function as a shield. Many human viruses possess oligomannose-enriched glycan shields, suggesting that sugar-mediated interactions may be a general principle for initial viral attachment

                The evolutionary conservation of antibody bivalency remains incompletely understood. Sahin et al. demonstrate that antibody-mediated inhibition of virion release is key to in vivo protection. Moreover, they find bivalent but not engineered monovalent antibodies inhibit virion release independently of Fc gamma receptors and control virus infection in Fc gamma receptor-deficient mice.

                Genomic regions transcribed frequently are threatened by formation of R-loops containing fragile single-stranded DNA. Yasuhara et al. reveal that RAP80 suppresses digestion of R-loops formed upon DNA double-strand break and promotes an accurate type of repair mechanism, thereby preventing genomic abnormalities in the important part of the genome.
