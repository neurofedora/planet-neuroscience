	<p>Metals&amp;amp;mdash;especially iron, copper and manganese&amp;amp;mdash;are important elements of brain functions and development. Metal-dysregulation homeostasis is associated with brain-structure damage to the motor, cognitive and emotional systems, and leads to neurodegenerative processes. There is more and more evidence that specialized cognitive and motor exercises can enhance brain function and attenuate neurodegeneration in mechanisms, such as improving neuroplasticity by altering the synaptic structure and function in many brain regions. Psychological and physical methods of rehabilitation are now becoming increasingly important, as pharmacological treatments for movement, cognitive and emotional symptoms are limited. The present study describes physical and cognitive rehabilitation methods of patients associated with metal-induced neurotoxicity such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and Wilson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. In our review, we describe physical (e.g., virtual-reality environments, robotic-assists training) and psychological (cognitive training, cognitive stimulation, neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based therapies) methods, significantly improving the quality of life and independence of patients associated with storage diseases. Storage diseases are a diverse group of hereditary metabolic defects characterized by the abnormal cumulation of storage material in cells. This topic is being addressed due to the fact that rehabilitation plays a vital role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately so far there are no specific guidelines concerning physiotherapy in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in regards to duration of exercise, type of exercise and intensity, as well as frequency of exercise. This is in part due to the variety of symptoms of these diseases and the various levels of disease progression. This further proves the need for more research to be carried out on the role of exercise in neurodegenerative disorder treatment.</p>

	<p>Verbs are central to the syntactic structure of sentences, and, thus, important for learning one&amp;amp;rsquo;s native language. This study examined how children visually inspect events as they hear, and do not hear, a new verb. Specifically, there is evidence that children may focus on the agent of the action (Maguire et al., 2008; Childers et al., 2017) or may prioritize attention to the action being performed (e.g., Behrend, 1990); to date, little evidence is available. This study used an eye tracker to track 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds&amp;amp;rsquo; looking to the agent (i.e., face) vs. action (i.e., hands) while viewing events linked to a new verb as well as distractor events. A Tobii X30 eye tracker recorded children&amp;amp;rsquo;s fixations to AOIs (head/face and hands) as they watched three target events and two distractor events in different orders during the learning phase, and pointed to one of two events in two test trials. This was repeated for a second novel verb. Pointing results show that children in all age groups were able to learn and extend the new verbs to new events at test. Additionally, across age groups, when viewing target events, children increased their looking to the hands (where the action is taking place) as those trials progressed and decreased their looking to the agents&amp;amp;rsquo; face, which is less informative for learning a new verb&amp;amp;rsquo;s meaning. In contrast, when viewing distractor events, children decreased their looking to hands over trials and maintained their attention to the face. In summary, children&amp;amp;rsquo;s visual attention to agents&amp;amp;rsquo; faces and hands differed depending on whether the events cooccurred with the new verb. These results are important as this is the first study to show this pattern of visual attention during verb learning, and, thus, these results help reveal underlying attentional strategies children may use when learning verbs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Morphology of an Inhibitory Retinal Interneuron Enables Simultaneous Local and Global Synaptic Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amacrine cells, inhibitory interneurons of the retina, feature synaptic inputs and outputs in close proximity throughout their dendritic trees, making them notable exceptions to prototypical somato-dendritic integration with output transmitted via axonal action potentials. The extent of dendritic compartmentalization in amacrine cells with widely differing dendritic tree morphology, however, is largely unexplored. Combining compartmental modeling, dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, targeted microiontophoresis and multielectrode patch-clamp recording (voltage and current clamp, capacitance measurement of exocytosis), we investigated integration in the AII amacrine cell, a narrow-field electrically coupled interneuron that participates in multiple, distinct microcircuits. Physiological experiments were performed with <I>in vitro</I> slices prepared from retinas of both male and female rats. We found that the morphology of the AII enables simultaneous local and global integration of inputs targeted to different dendritic regions. Local integration occurs within spatially restricted dendritic subunits and narrow time windows and is largely unaffected by the strength of electrical coupling. In contrast, global integration across the dendritic tree occurs over longer time periods and is markedly influenced by the strength of electrical coupling. These integrative properties enable AII amacrines to combine local control of synaptic plasticity with location-independent global integration. Dynamic inhibitory control of dendritic subunits is likely to be of general importance for amacrine cells, including cells with small dendritic trees, as well as for inhibitory interneurons in other regions of the CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our understanding of synaptic integration is based on the prototypical morphology of a neuron with multiple dendrites and a single axon at opposing ends of a cell body. Many neurons, notably retinal amacrine cells, are exceptions to this arrangement, and display input and output synapses interspersed along their dendritic branches. In the large dendritic trees of some amacrine cells, such arrangements can give rise to multiple computational subunits. Other amacrine cells, with small dendritic trees, have been assumed to operate as single computational units. Here, we report the surprising result that despite a small dendritic tree, the AII amacrine cell simultaneously performs local integration of synaptic inputs (over smaller dendritic subregions) and global integration across the entire cell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KCTD8 and KCTD12 Facilitate Axonal Expression of GABAB Receptors in Habenula Cholinergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors in habenula cholinergic neurons mediate strong presynaptic excitation and control aversive memory expression. K<sup>+</sup> channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) proteins are key interacting partners of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors; it remains unclear whether and how KCTDs contribute to GABA<SUB>B</SUB> excitatory signaling. Here, we show that KCTD8 and KCTD12 in these neurons facilitate the GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors expression in axonal terminals and contribute to presynaptic excitation by GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors. Genetically knocking out <I>KCTD8/12/16</I> or <I>KCTD8/12</I>, but not other combinations of the three <I>KCTD</I> isoforms, substantially reduced GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors&ndash;mediated potentiation of glutamate release and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in response to axonal stimulation, whereas they had no effect on GABA<SUB>B</SUB>-mediated inhibition in the somata of cholinergic neurons within the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway in mice of either sex. The physiological phenotypes were associated with a significant decrease in the GABA<SUB>B</SUB> expression within the axonal terminals but not the somata. Overexpressing either KCTD8 or KCTD12 in the <I>KCTD8/12/16</I> triple knock-out mice reversed the changes in axonal GABA<SUB>B</SUB> expression and presynaptic excitation. In mice lacking the KCTDs, aversion-predicting cues produced stronger neuronal activation in the interpeduncular nucleus, and the infusion of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> agonist in this nucleus produced a weaker effect on fear extinction. Collectively, our results reveal isoform-specific roles of KCTD proteins in enriching the axonal expression of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors, facilitating their presynaptic signaling, and modulating aversion-related memory processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors represent the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, but they mediate strong presynaptic excitation in the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway and modulate aversion memory expression. KCTD proteins are integral constituents of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors. By analyzing the physiological, neuroanatomical, and behavioral phenotypes of multiple KCTD knock-out mouse lines, we show that KCTD8 and KCTD12 facilitate the axonal expression and hence presynaptic excitation of GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors in habenula cholinergic neurons and control cued-aversion memory formation and expression in the habenulo&ndash;interpeduncular pathway. These results expand the physiological and behavioral functions of KCTDs in modulating the brain neural circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stabilization of Spine Synaptopodin by mGluR1 Is Required for mGluR-LTD</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dendritic spines, actin-rich protrusions forming the postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses, undergo activity-dependent molecular and structural remodeling. Activation of Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) by synaptic or pharmacological stimulation, induces LTD, but whether this is accompanied with spine elimination remains unresolved. A subset of telencephalic mushroom spines contains the spine apparatus (SA), an enigmatic organelle composed of stacks of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whose formation depends on the expression of the actin-bundling protein Synaptopodin. Allocation of Synaptopodin to spines appears governed by cell-intrinsic mechanisms as the relative frequency of spines harboring Synaptopodin is conserved <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I>. Here we show that expression of Synaptopodin/SA in spines is required for induction of mGluR-LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of male mice. Post-mGluR-LTD, mushroom spines lacking Synaptopodin/SA are selectively lost, whereas spines harboring it are preserved. This process, dependent on activation of mGluR1 but not mGluR5, is conserved in mature mouse neurons and rat neurons of both sexes. Mechanistically, we find that mGluR1 supports physical retention of Synaptopodin within excitatory spine synapses during LTD while triggering lysosome-dependent degradation of the protein residing in dendritic shafts. Together, these results reveal a cellular mechanism, dependent on mGluR1, which enables selective preservation of stronger spines containing Synaptopodin/SA while eliminating weaker ones and potentially countering spurious strengthening by <I>de novo</I> recruitment of Synaptopodin. Overall, our results identify spines with Synaptopodin/SA as the locus of mGluR-LTD and underscore the importance of the molecular microanatomy of spines in synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long-term changes in functional synaptic strength are associated with modification of synaptic connectivity through stabilization or elimination of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic locus of excitatory synapses. How heterogeneous spine microanatomy instructs spine remodeling after long-term synaptic depression (LTD) remains unclear. Metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and mGluR5 induce a form of LTD critical to circuit function in physiological and disease conditions. Our results identify spines containing the protein Synaptopodin, which enables local assembly of a spine apparatus, as the locus of expression of mGluR-LTD and demonstrate a specific role of mGluR1 in promoting selective loss after mGluR-LTD of mature dendritic spines lacking Synaptopodin/spine apparatus. These findings highlight the fundamental contribution of spine microanatomy in selectively enabling functional and structural plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Daam2 Regulates Myelin Structure and the Oligodendrocyte Actin Cytoskeleton through Rac1 and Gelsolin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Myelin is essential to neuronal health and CNS function, and oligodendrocytes (OLs) undergo a complex process of cytoskeletal remodeling to form compact myelin sheaths. We previously discovered that a formin protein, Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2 (Daam2), suppresses OL differentiation through Wnt signaling; however, its role in cytoskeletal control remains unknown. To investigate this, we used OL-specific Daam2 conditional knockout (Daam2 cKO) mice of either sex and found myelin decompaction during an active period of myelination in postnatal development and motor coordination deficits in adulthood. Using primary OL cultures, we found Daam2-depleted OLs showed morphologic dysregulation during differentiation, suggesting that Daam2 regulates the OL cytoskeleton. <I>In vivo</I> screening identified the actin regulators Rac1 and Gelsolin as possible effectors in Daam2-deficient OL cytoskeletal regulation. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function (LOF) experiments in primary OLs, we found that Rac1 and Gelsolin operate downstream of Daam2 in OL differentiation, with Gelsolin and Daam2 promoting and inhibiting membrane spreading during late differentiation, respectively. <I>In vivo</I> experiments using Daam2 cKO mice revealed increased protein levels of Gelsolin in the developing white matter with no change in RNA levels, suggesting that Daam2 acts in a posttranslational manner to suppress Gelsolin levels. <I>In vitro</I> biochemical studies show Daam2 induces Gelsolin ubiquitination and degradation in OLs. Together, our studies show Daam2 is essential for formation of functional myelin through modulation of Gelsolin levels to regulate the OL cytoskeleton. These findings further demonstrate the critical role of cytoskeletal dynamics in myelination and reveal novel avenues for treatment of a variety of white matter diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Proper myelin formation is essential to CNS function, and oligodendrocytes (OLs) require extensive changes in the actin cytoskeleton to form myelin sheaths. Here, we show that the formin protein Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2 (Daam2) is necessary for myelin compaction during development and motor learning in adulthood. Further, we demonstrate that Daam2 regulates OL differentiation and morphology through actin regulators Rac1 and Gelsolin. Lastly, we find that Daam2 may control myelin compaction by modulating the ubiquitination and degradation of Gelsolin through recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. These findings reveal novel pathways for regulating myelin structure and function during white matter development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contralateral Limb Specificity for Movement Preparation in the Parietal Reach Region</a></h4>

              
                <p>The canonical view of motor control is that distal musculature is controlled primarily by the contralateral cerebral hemisphere; unilateral brain lesions typically affect contralateral but not ipsilateral musculature. Contralateral-only limb deficits following a unilateral lesion suggest but do not prove that control is strictly contralateral: the loss of a contribution of the lesioned hemisphere to the control of the ipsilesional limb could be masked by the intact contralateral drive from the nonlesioned hemisphere. To distinguish between these possibilities, we serially inactivated the parietal reach region, comprising the posterior portion of medial intraparietal area, the anterior portion of V6a, and portions of the lateral occipital parietal area, in each hemisphere of 2 monkeys (23 experimental sessions, 46 injections total) to evaluate parietal reach region's contribution to the contralateral reaching deficits observed following lateralized brain lesions. Following unilateral inactivation, reach reaction times with the contralesional limb were slowed compared with matched blocks of control behavioral data; there was no effect of unilateral inactivation on the reaction time of either ipsilesional limb reaches or saccadic eye movements. Following bilateral inactivation, reaching was slowed in both limbs, with an effect size in each no different from that produced by unilateral inactivation. These findings indicate contralateral organization of reach preparation in posterior parietal cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Unilateral brain lesions typically affect contralateral but not ipsilateral musculature. Contralateral-only limb deficits following a unilateral lesion suggest but do not prove that control is strictly contralateral: the loss of a contribution of the lesioned hemisphere to the control of the ipsilesional limb could be masked by the intact contralateral drive from the nonlesioned hemisphere. Unilateral lesions cannot distinguish between contralateral and bilateral control, but bilateral lesions can. Here we show similar movement initiation deficits after combined unilateral and bilateral inactivation of the parietal reach region, indicating contralateral organization of reach preparation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Transient Coupling between Infragranular and Subplate Layers to Layer 1 Neurons Before Ear Opening and throughout the Critical Period Depends on Peripheral Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical layer 1 (L1) contains a diverse population of interneurons that can modulate processing in superficial cortical layers, but the intracortical sources of synaptic input to these neurons and how these inputs change over development and with sensory experience is unknown. We here investigated the changing intracortical connectivity to L1 in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of mice of both sexes in <I>in vitro</I> slices across development using laser-scanning photostimulation. Before postnatal day (P)10, L1 cells receive excitatory input from within L1, L2/3, L4, and L5/6 as well as from subplate. Excitatory inputs from all layers increase, especially from L4, and peak during P10&ndash;P16, around the peak of the critical period for tonotopy. Inhibitory inputs followed a similar pattern. Functional circuit diversity in L1 emerges after P16. In adults, L1 neurons receive ascending inputs from L2/3 and L5/6, but only few inputs from L4. The transient hyperconnectivity from deep layers but not L2/3 is absent in deaf mice. Our results demonstrate that deep excitatory and superficial inhibitory circuits are tightly linked in early development and might provide a functional scaffold for the layers in between. These results suggest that early thalamically driven spontaneous and sensory activity in subplate can be relayed to L1 from the earliest ages on and shape L1 connectivity from deep layers. Our results also reveal a period of high transient columnar hyperconnectivity after ear opening coinciding with the critical period, suggesting that circuits originating in deep layers might play a key role in this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> L1 contains a diverse population of interneurons that can modulate processing in superficial cortical layers but the sources of synaptic input to these neurons and how these inputs change over development is unknown. We found that during the critical period a large fraction of excitatory inputs to L1 originated in L5/6 and the cortical subplate. This hyperconnectivity is absent in deaf mice. Our results directly demonstrate that deep excitatory and superficial inhibitory circuits are tightly linked in early development and might provide a functional scaffold for the layers in between.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">TRPV1-Lineage Somatosensory Fibers Communicate with Taste Neurons in the Mouse Parabrachial Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Trigeminal neurons convey somatosensory information from craniofacial tissues. In mouse brain, ascending projections from medullary trigeminal neurons arrive at taste neurons in the parabrachial (PB) nucleus, suggesting that taste neurons participate in somatosensory processing. However, the cell types that support this convergence were undefined. Using Cre-directed optogenetics and <I>in vivo</I> neurophysiology in anesthetized mice of both sexes, here we studied whether transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-lineage nociceptive and thermosensory fibers are primary neurons that drive trigeminal circuits reaching PB taste cells. We monitored spiking activity in individual PB neurons during photoexcitation of the terminals of TRPV1-lineage fibers arriving at the dorsal trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which relays orofacial somatosensory messages to the PB area. We also recorded PB neural responses to oral delivery of taste, chemesthetic, and thermal stimuli. We found that optical excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers elicited responses in traditionally defined taste neurons in lateral PB nuclei. The tuning of neurons across diverse tastes associated with their sensitivity to TRPV1-lineage fiber stimulation, which only sparingly engaged neurons oriented to preferred tastes like sucrose. Moreover, neurons responsive to photostimulation of TRPV1-lineage afferents showed strong responses to temperature including noxious heat, which predominantly excited PB bitter taste cells. Multivariate and machine learning analyses revealed the PB confluence of TRPV1-lineage signals with taste captured sensory valence information shared across aversive gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. Our results reveal that TRPV1-lineage fibers, which have defined roles in thermosensation and pain, communicate with PB taste neurons. This multisensory convergence supports dependencies between gustatory and somatosensory hedonic representations in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The parabrachial (PB) nucleus participates in autonomic and integrative neural processing for diverse sensory modalities. We recently found in mice that trigeminal neurons supplying craniofacial somatosensation project to PB neurons sensitive to tastes. Here, we show that trigeminal projections to PB gustatory cells are driven by a genetic class of thermosensory and nociceptive fiber. Input from these fibers was associated with PB neural sensitivity to aversive oral temperatures and tastes and supported a multimodal neural representation of sensory valence across gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. These results reveal gustation and somatosensation to be only components of a larger PB code that captures sensory value. Defining this circuit has implications for understanding the neural representation of taste, temperature, and also pain-related phenomena.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dopamine Release in Nucleus Accumbens Is under Tonic Inhibition by Adenosine A1 Receptors Regulated by Astrocytic ENT1 and Dysregulated by Ethanol</a></h4>

              
                <p>Striatal adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB> receptor (A<SUB>1</SUB>R) activation can inhibit dopamine release. A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs on other striatal neurons are activated by an adenosine tone that is limited by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that is enriched on astrocytes and is ethanol sensitive. We explored whether dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core is under tonic inhibition by A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs, and is regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and ethanol. In <I>ex vivo</I> striatal slices from male and female mice, A<SUB>1</SUB>R agonists inhibited dopamine release evoked electrically or optogenetically and detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, most strongly for lower stimulation frequencies and pulse numbers, thereby enhancing the activity-dependent contrast of dopamine release. Conversely, A<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonists reduced activity-dependent contrast but enhanced evoked dopamine release levels, even for single optogenetic pulses indicating an underlying tonic inhibition. The ENT1 inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine reduced dopamine release and promoted A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition, and, conversely, virally mediated astrocytic overexpression of ENT1 enhanced dopamine release and relieved A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition. By imaging the genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine sensor [GPCR-activation based (GRAB)-Ado], we identified a striatal extracellular adenosine tone that was elevated by the ENT1 inhibitor and sensitive to gliotoxin fluorocitrate. Finally, we identified that ethanol (50 m<scp>m</scp>) promoted A<SUB>1</SUB>R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, through diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. Together, these data reveal that dopamine output dynamics are gated by a striatal adenosine tone, limiting amplitude but promoting contrast, regulated by ENT1, and promoted by ethanol. These data add to the diverse mechanisms through which ethanol modulates striatal dopamine, and to emerging datasets supporting astrocytic transporters as important regulators of striatal function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine axons in the mammalian striatum are emerging as strategic sites where neuromodulators can powerfully influence dopamine output in health and disease. We found that ambient levels of the neuromodulator adenosine tonically inhibit dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core via adenosine A<SUB>1</SUB> receptors (A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs), to a variable level that promotes the contrast in dopamine signals released by different frequencies of activity. We reveal that the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) on astrocytes limits this tonic inhibition, and that ethanol promotes it by diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. These findings support the hypotheses that A<SUB>1</SUB>Rs on dopamine axons inhibit dopamine release and, furthermore, that astrocytes perform important roles in setting the level of striatal dopamine output, in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Out of Rhythm: Compromised Precision of Theta-Gamma Coupling Impairs Associative Memory in Old Age</a></h4>

              
                <p>Episodic memory declines with advancing adult age. This decline is particularly pronounced when associations between items and their contexts need to be formed. According to theories of neural communication, the precise coupling of gamma power to the phase of the theta rhythm supports associative memory formation. To investigate whether age differences in associative memory are related to compromised theta-gamma coupling, we took EEG recordings during the encoding phase of an item-context association task. Fifty-eight younger (33 females) and 55 older (24 females) adults studied pictures of objects superimposed on background scenes. In a recognition test, objects were presented on old or new backgrounds, and participants responded if they had seen (1) the object and (2) the object/scene pair. Theta-gamma coupling supported pair memory formation in both age groups. Whereas pair memory was associated with coupling closer to the peak of the theta rhythm, item-only memory was associated with a deviation in phase angle relative to pair memory. Furthermore, a stable relation between coupling phase and pair memory performance demonstrated that coupling closer to the peak is beneficial for associative memory. Critically, older adults' lower pair memory was accompanied by a shift in coupling phase relative to that of younger adults. In concert, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that decrements in the temporal precision with which gamma power is coupled to a specific theta phase underlie the decline of associative memory in normal cognitive aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> According to prominent theories of neural communication, the precise coordination of oscillatory activity enables the formation of associative memories. We propose that normal cognitive aging impairs associative memory formation by compromising the temporal precision of neural communication. We show that the coupling of high-frequency gamma power to low-frequency theta phase supports associative memory formation in both younger and older adults, with coupling closer to the theta peak benefitting memory performance. However, compared with younger adults, the coupling phase angle is shifted in time and is more variable in the older adults. We conclude that alterations in the precise timing of theta-gamma coupling contribute to adult age differences in associative memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Retrieval-Related Anterior Shift Is Moderated by Age and Correlates with Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent research suggests that episodic memory is associated with systematic differences in the localization of neural activity observed during memory encoding and retrieval. The retrieval-related anterior shift is a phenomenon whereby the retrieval of a stimulus event (e.g., a scene image) is associated with a peak neural response which is localized more anteriorly than the response elicited when the stimulus is experienced directly. Here, we examine whether the magnitude of the anterior shift (i.e., the distance between encoding- and retrieval-related response peaks) is moderated by age, and also whether the shift is associated with memory performance. Younger and older human subjects of both sexes underwent fMRI as they completed encoding and retrieval tasks on word-face and word-scene pairs. We localized peak scene and face selectivity for each individual participant within the face-selective precuneus and in three scene-selective (parahippocampal place area [PPA], medial place area, occipital place area) ROIs. In line with recent findings, we identified an anterior shift in the PPA and occipital place area in both age groups and, in older adults only, in the medial place area and precuneus also. Of importance, the magnitude of the anterior shift was larger in older than in younger adults. The shift within the PPA exhibited an age-invariant across-participant negative correlation with source memory performance, such that a smaller displacement between encoding- and retrieval-related neural activity was associated with better performance. These findings provide novel insights into the functional significance of the anterior shift, especially in relation to memory decline in older age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive aging is associated with reduced ability to retrieve precise details of previously experienced events. The retrieval-related anterior shift is a phenomenon in which category-selective cortical activity at retrieval is localized anterior to the peak activity at encoding. The shift is thought to reflect a bias at retrieval in favor of semantic and abstract information at the expense of low-level perceptual detail. Here, we report that the anterior shift is exaggerated in older relative to younger adults, and we demonstrate that a larger shift in the parahippocampal place area is associated with poorer memory performance. These findings suggest that the shift is sensitive to increasing age and that it is moderated by the quality and content of the retrieved episode.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sleep-Dependent Facilitation of Visual Perceptual Learning Is Consistent with a Learning-Dependent Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>How sleep leads to offline performance gains in learning remains controversial. A use-dependent model assumes that sleep processing leading to performance gains occurs based on general cortical usage during wakefulness, whereas a learning-dependent model assumes that this processing is specific to learning. Here, we found evidence that supports a learning-dependent model in visual perceptual learning (VPL) in humans (both sexes). First, we measured the strength of spontaneous oscillations during sleep after two training conditions that required the same amount of training or visual cortical usage; one generated VPL (learning condition), while the other did not (interference condition). During a post-training nap, slow-wave activity (SWA) and sigma activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and theta activity during REM sleep were source localized to the early visual areas using retinotopic mapping. Inconsistent with a use-dependent model, only in the learning condition, sigma and theta activity, not SWA, increased in a trained region-specific manner and correlated with performance gains. Second, we investigated the roles of occipital sigma and theta activity during sleep. Occipital sigma activity during NREM sleep was significantly correlated with performance gains in presleep learning; however, occipital theta activity during REM sleep was correlated with presleep learning stabilization, shown as resilience to interference from postsleep learning in a trained region-specific manner. Occipital SWA was not associated with offline performance gains or stabilization. These results demonstrate that sleep processing leading to performance gains is learning dependent in VPL and involves occipital sigma and theta activity during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present study shows strong evidence that could help resolve the long-standing controversy surrounding sleep processing that strengthens learning (performance gains). There are two conflicting models. A use-dependent model assumes that sleep processing leading to performance gains occurs because of general cortical usage during wakefulness, whereas a learning-dependent model assumes that processing occurs specifically for learning. Using visual perceptual learning and interference paradigms, we found that processing did not take place after general cortical usage. Moreover, sigma activity during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and theta activity during REM sleep in occipital areas were found to be involved in processing, which is consistent with the learning-dependent model and not the use-dependent model. These results support the learning-dependent model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Brain Selectively Tunes to Unfamiliar Voices during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain continues to respond selectively to environmental stimuli during sleep. However, the functional role of such responses, and whether they reflect information processing or rather sensory inhibition, is not fully understood. Here, we present 17 human sleepers (14 females) with their own name and two unfamiliar first names, spoken by either a familiar voice (FV) or an unfamiliar voice (UFV), while recording polysomnography during a full night of sleep. We detect K-complexes, sleep spindles, and microarousals, and assess event-related and frequency responses as well as intertrial phase synchronization to the different stimuli presented during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We show that UFVs evoke more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. When both stimuli evoke a K-complex, we observe larger evoked potentials, more precise time-locking of brain responses in the delta band (1&ndash;4 Hz), and stronger activity in the high frequency (&gt;16 Hz) range, in response to UFVs relative to FVs. Crucially, these differences in brain responses disappear completely when no K-complexes are evoked by the auditory stimuli. Our findings highlight discrepancies in brain responses to auditory stimuli based on their relevance to the sleeper and propose a key role for K-complexes in the modulation of sensory processing during sleep. We argue that such content-specific, dynamic reactivity to external sensory information enables the brain to enter a sentinel processing mode in which it engages in the important internal processes that are ongoing during sleep while still maintaining the ability to process vital external sensory information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous research has shown that sensory processing continues during sleep. Here, we studied the capacity of the sleeping brain to extract and process relevant sensory information. We presented sleepers with their own names and unfamiliar names spoken by either an FV or a UFV. During NREM sleep, UFVs elicited more K-complexes and microarousals than FVs. By contrasting stimuli that evoked K-complexes, we demonstrate that UFVs evoked larger, more synchronized brain responses as well as stronger power at high frequencies (&gt;16 Hz) relative to FVs. These differences in brain responses disappeared when no K-complexes were evoked. Our results suggest a pivotal role for K-complexes in the selective processing of relevant information during NREM sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Integrating Reward Information for Prospective Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Value-based decision-making is often studied in a static context, where participants decide which option to select from those currently available. However, everyday life often involves an additional dimension: deciding when to select to maximize reward. Recent evidence suggests that agents track the latent reward of an option, updating changes in their latent reward estimate, to achieve appropriate selection timing (latent reward tracking). However, this strategy can be difficult to distinguish from one in which the optimal selection time is estimated in advance, allowing an agent to wait a predetermined amount of time before selecting, without needing to monitor an option's latent reward (distance-to-goal tracking). Here, we show that these strategies can in principle be dissociated. Human brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), while female and male participants performed a novel decision task. Participants were shown an option and decided when to select it, as its latent reward changed from trial-to-trial. While the latent reward was uncued, it could be estimated using cued information about the option's starting value and value growth rate. We then used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to assess whether EEG signals more closely resembled latent reward tracking or distance-to-goal tracking. This approach successfully dissociated the strategies in this task. Starting value and growth rate were translated into a distance-to-goal signal, far in advance of selecting the option. Latent reward could not be independently decoded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using high temporal resolution neural recordings to identify internally computed decision variables in the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reward-seeking behavior involves acting at the right time. However, the external world does not always tell us when an action is most rewarding, necessitating internal representations that guide action timing. Specifying this internal neural representation is challenging because it might stem from a variety of strategies, many of which make similar predictions about brain activity. This study used a novel approach to test whether alternative strategies could be dissociated in principle. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we were able to distinguish between candidate internal representations for selection timing. This shows how pattern analysis methods can be used to measure latent decision information in noninvasive neural data.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Anti-Inflammatory Agent Bindarit Attenuates the Impairment of Neural Development through Suppression of Microglial Activation in a Neonatal Hydrocephalus Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neonatal hydrocephalus presents with various degrees of neuroinflammation and long-term neurologic deficits in surgically treated patients, provoking a need for additional medical treatment. We previously reported elevated neuroinflammation and severe periventricular white matter damage in the <I>progressive hydrocephalus</I> (<I>prh</I>) mutant which contains a point mutation in the <I>Ccdc39</I> gene, causing loss of cilia-mediated unidirectional CSF flow. In this study, we identified cortical neuropil maturation defects such as impaired excitatory synapse maturation and loss of homeostatic microglia, and swimming locomotor defects in early postnatal <I>prh</I> mutant mice. Strikingly, systemic application of the anti-inflammatory small molecule bindarit significantly supports healthy postnatal cerebral cortical development in the <I>prh</I> mutant. While bindarit only mildly reduced the ventricular volume, it significantly improved the edematous appearance and myelination of the corpus callosum. Moreover, the treatment attenuated thinning in cortical Layers II&ndash;IV, excitatory synapse formation, and interneuron morphogenesis, by supporting the ramified-shaped homeostatic microglia from excessive cell death. Also, the therapeutic effect led to the alleviation of a spastic locomotor phenotype of the mutant. We found that microglia, but not peripheral monocytes, contribute to amoeboid-shaped activated myeloid cells in <I>prh</I> mutants' corpus callosum and the proinflammatory cytokines expression. Bindarit blocks nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and its downstream proinflammatory cytokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in the <I>prh</I> mutant. Collectively, we revealed that amelioration of neuroinflammation is crucial for white matter and neuronal maturation in neonatal hydrocephalus. Future studies of bindarit treatment combined with CSF diversion surgery may provide long-term benefits supporting neuronal development in neonatal hydrocephalus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In neonatal hydrocephalus, little is known about the signaling cascades of neuroinflammation or the impact of such inflammatory insults on neural cell development within the perinatal cerebral cortex. Here, we report that proinflammatory activation of myeloid cells, the majority of which are derived from microglia, impairs periventricular myelination and cortical neuronal maturation using the mouse <I>prh</I> genetic model of neonatal hydrocephalus. Administration of bindarit, an anti-inflammatory small molecule that blocks nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation, restored the cortical thinning and synaptic maturation defects in the <I>prh</I> mutant brain through suppression of microglial activation. These data indicate the potential therapeutic use of anti-inflammatory reagents targeting neuroinflammation in the treatment of neonatal hydrocephalus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupting the Balance of Protein Quality Control Protein UBQLN2 Accelerates Tau Proteinopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tau protein accumulation drives toxicity in several neurodegenerative disorders. To better understand the pathways regulating tau homeostasis in disease, we investigated the role of ubiquilins (UBQLNs)&mdash;a class of proteins linked to ubiquitin-mediated protein quality control (PQC) and various neurodegenerative diseases&mdash;in regulating tau. Cell-based assays identified UBQLN2 as the primary brain-expressed UBQLN to regulate tau. UBQLN2 efficiently lowered wild-type tau levels regardless of aggregation, suggesting that UBQLN2 interacts with and regulates tau protein under normal conditions or early in disease. Moreover, UBQLN2 itself proved to be prone to accumulation as insoluble protein in male and female tau transgenic mice and the human tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy. Genetic manipulation of UBQLN2 in a tauopathy mouse model demonstrated that a physiological UBQLN2 balance is required for tau homeostasis. UBQLN2 overexpression exacerbated phosphorylated tau pathology and toxicity in mice expressing P301S mutant tau, whereas P301S mice lacking UBQLN2 showed significantly reduced phosphorylated tau. Further studies support the view that an imbalance of UBQLN2 perturbs ubiquitin-dependent PQC and autophagy. We conclude that changes in UBQLN2 levels, whether because of pathogenic mutations or secondary to disease states, such as tauopathy, contribute to proteostatic imbalances that exacerbate neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We defined a role for the protein quality control protein Ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2), in age-related neurodegenerative tauopathies. This group of disorders is characterized by the accumulation of tau protein aggregates, which differ when UBQLN2 levels are altered. Given the lack of effective disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies and the function of UBQLN2 in handling various disease-linked proteins, we explored the role of UBQLN2 in regulating tau. We found that UBQLN2 reduced tau levels in cell models but behaved differently in mouse brain, where it accelerated mutant tau pathology and tau-mediated toxicity. A better understanding of the diverse functions of regulatory proteins like UBQLN2 can elucidate some of the causative factors in neurodegenerative disease and outline new routes to therapeutic intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dual PI3K{delta}/{gamma} Inhibitor Duvelisib Prevents Development of Neuropathic Pain in Model of Paclitaxel-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development of painful paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) represents a major dose-limiting side effect of paclitaxel chemotherapy. Here we report a promising effect of duvelisib (Copiktra), a novel FDA-approved PI3K/ isoform-specific inhibitor, in preventing paclitaxel-induced pain-like behavior and pronociceptive signaling in DRGs and spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) in rat and mouse model of PIPN. Duvelisib blocked the development of mechanical hyperalgesia in both males and females. Moreover, duvelisib prevented paclitaxel-induced sensitization of TRPV1 receptors, and increased PI3K/Akt signaling in small-diameter DRG neurons and an increase of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells within DRGs. Specific optogenetic stimulation of inhibitory neurons combined with patch-clamp recording revealed that duvelisib inhibited paclitaxel-induced weakening of inhibitory, mainly glycinergic control on SCDH excitatory neurons. Enhanced excitatory and reduced inhibitory neurotransmission in the SCDH following PIPN was also alleviated by duvelisib application. In summary, duvelisib showed a promising ability to prevent neuropathic pain in PIPN. The potential use of our findings in human medicine may be augmented by the fact that duvelisib is an FDA-approved drug with known side effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that duvelisib, a novel FDA-approved PI3K/ isoform-specific inhibitor, prevents the development of paclitaxel-induced pain-like behavior in males and females and prevents pronociceptive signaling in DRGs and spinal cord dorsal horn in rat and mouse model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.</p>

                Background: Racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life healthcare can be reduced by showing physicians how to best respond to a documented underlying cause: African American families‚Äô hopes for a miracle via divine intervention influence their end-of-life medical decisions, like, for example, making them not want to withdraw ventilatory support in cases of poor neurologic prognosis because they are still hoping for God to intervene.¬† Methods: Autoethnographic research probing the author‚Äôs Spiritual Care experience in this context yields a nuanced, 90-second point-of-care spiritual intervention physicians can use to address the religious aspect of African American families who base end-of-life medical decisions on their hopes for a miracle via divine intervention. Autoethnographic analysis is framed by physician-author, Dr. Jessica Zitter‚Äôs documented journey of grappling with this context. The evolution of Dr. Zitter‚Äôs responses to miracle-hoping African American families provides a framework for applying autoethnographic analysis to a critical appropriation of the Johns Hopkins ‚ÄúAMEN‚Äù communication protocol for families hoping for a miracle.¬† Results: The common instinct of white physicians to remain neutral, holding miracle-hoping African American families at arm‚Äôs length, rather than supportively engaging their hopes, is shown to be an intellectual ruse for emotional avoidance. A novel, counterintuitive spiritual intervention for the religious aspect of miracle-hoping African American families is integrated into an existing physician communication protocol for responding to families hoping for a miracle with recommendations for utilization of existing communication technology when necessary.¬† Conclusion: Properly addressing the religious dimension of African American families hoping for a miracle may help physicians to increase their therapeutic connection with families, decrease their own stress/burnout levels, and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life healthcare.‚ÄØ

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">pTITAN2:¬†Permutation of treatment labels and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Taxa Indicator Threshold ANalysis (TITAN) was developed to identify thresholds along environmental gradients where rapid changes in taxa frequency and relative abundance are observed. TITAN determines separate change-points for increasing and decreasing taxa in aggregate, as well as change-points for individual taxa, with associated confidence intervals generated using bootstrapping. However, if TITAN is applied to different classes of observations, additional analyses besides using non-overlapping confidence intervals are needed to establish whether change-points differ between treatments or groups because non-overlapping confidence intervals can indicate significant differences but overlapping confidence intervals do not necessarily mean the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Methods: To address this, we present a new R package, pTITAN2, which is an extension to the existing TITAN2 package. The pTITAN2 package was developed to enable comparisons of TITAN output between treatments by permutating the observed data between treatments and rerunning TITAN on the permuted data. Results: The pTITAN2 package includes two functions, occurrences and permute. The occurrences function selects the taxonomic codes to be used in a TITAN run while maintaining the most taxonomic details. The permute function is then used to create a list of permuted sets of taxa and environmental gradients. TITAN is then run again on the permuted data and p-value test can be calculated using the observed and permuted TITAN output to test for statistical differences between treatment effects. Conclusions: The package pTITAN2 is an extension of the existing TITAN2 package and enables users to perform the appropriate statistical tests and determine statistical differences without using overlapping confidence intervals.

                Background: The unprecedented development of Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised the healthcare industry. In the next generation of healthcare systems, self-diagnosis will be pivotal to personalised healthcare services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new screening and diagnostic approaches like mobile health are well-positioned to reduce disease spread and overcome geographical barriers. This paper presents a non-invasive screening approach to predict the health of a person from visually observable features using machine learning techniques. Images like face and skin surface of the patients are acquired using camera or mobile devices and analysed to derive clinical reasoning and prediction of the person‚Äôs health. Methods: In specific, a two-level classification approach is presented. The proposed hierarchical model chooses a class by training a binary classifier at the node of the hierarchy. Prediction is then made using a set of class-specific reduced feature set. Results: Testing accuracies of 86.87% and 76.84% are reported for the first and second-level classification. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields favourable prediction results while greatly reduces the computational time. Conclusions: The study suggests that it is possible to predict the health condition of a person based on his/her face appearance using cost-effective machine learning approaches.

                Background: The associations of water and sanitation with population health have been well-documented. However, the specific effects of water and sanitation on chronic diseases in old age are least explored. This study examines the associations between water, sanitation and chronic diseases among older people in Ghana and whether these associations are moderated by sex and spatial variation. Methods: Data from the WHO-SAGE Wave 2 involving adults aged ‚â• 50 years were analyzed. Chronis diseases were assessed based on the self-reported diagnosis by a healthcare professional. The exposures included water sources, type of toilet, and sharing of toilet facilities. Generalized logistic regression models estimated the effects of water and sanitation indicators on chronic diseases.¬† Results: Overall, 18.8% of the sample reported at least one chronic disease. Compared to men and those in rural areas, women and urban residents respectively were more likely to report chronic disease (p¬†< 0.001). After full adjustments, logistic regressions showed that the use of unimproved sanitation (OR = 1.732, CI: 1.377‚Äì5.418) and sharing of sanitation facilities (OR = 1.624, CI: 1.095‚Äì1.320) were associated with higher odds of chronic diseases. However, the use of water did not reach significance (p = 0.125). We found a significant interaction effect for type of toilet √ó sex (OR = 3.498, CI: 1.744‚Äì16.442), source of water √ó residence (OR = 5.935, CI: 1.320‚Äì26.685), and type of toilet √ó spatial variation (OR = 1.998, CI: 1.462‚Äì8.642).¬† Conclusions: The use of unimproved sanitation facilities and the sharing of toilet facilities are associated with the occurrence of chronic diseases among older people. Policy and public health interventions targeted at improving the health and well-being of older people should conspicuously include better access and improved sanitation services.

                This dataset was collected from a total of 1,977 university lecturers across 24 African countries, that were purposively targeted due to their level of exposure to scholarly publications. The dataset was collected through an online survey that was sent to respondents through email, WhatsApp, and the Association of African Universities Telegram group. The questionnaire was designed by the researchers and validated by five experts for face and content validity. The demographic information of the data was analysed and the softcopy of the data uploaded to the Mendeley database for easy retrieval after deidentification (see Data Availability statement). The associated questionnaire can be found in the extended data. In Africa, this appears to be the broadest dataset associated with academics‚Äô perception of utilizing digital platforms for research sharing. This implies that scholars can use this dataset to quantitatively analyse the extent to which different digital tools are being utilized for research communication. Considering the current restrictions on in-person social gatherings due to COVID-19, researchers working on related studies may readily utilize this set of data, saving time and cost. A comprehensive but non-exhaustive number of 20 digital tools were assessed based on academics' awareness and current engagement with them, and the challenges they have faced using them. This offers a wide range of areas for studies to be anchored. Furthermore, researchers interested in specific digital tools can also evaluate the extent to which academic staff in African universities are aware of and willing to utilize them for research dissemination. This data will enable scholars and researchers in Africa and beyond to understand the extent to which academics in varsities are willing to adopt digital repositories for research sharing in the context of Africa.

METASnake is a novel tool, implemented in the Snakemake workflow language, to automate multiple metaWRAP modules. Specifically, it wraps the shell scripts provided within the original metaWRAP software, within Snakemake. This approach enables high-throughput simultaneous assembly and analysis of multiple shotgun metagenomic datasets using the robust modular metaWRAP software. We expect this advancement to be of import in institutions where high-performance computing infrastructure is available, especially in the context of big data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Impact of Green Practices in Value Chain on Firm Performance in the Context of a Developing Country [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Companies need to go green to remain relevant. Previous studies have confirmed that going green leads to superior performance for companies. However, research of green practices in a value chain requires further attention, especially in identifying the green value chain activities that lead to superior performance. A value chain analysis focuses on identifying competitive advantages of firms through five primary and four support activities. Methods: This study extends from Ong et al. (2019), who developed and validated the instrument for the nine green value chain activities, to also examine their effect on firm performance. The 207 valid responses in this study are collected through a questionnaire survey of the sampling frame consisting of companies in Bursa Malaysia and the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers Directory. Results: The findings reveal that the companies‚Äô green practices in primary value chain activities are higher than in the supporting value chain activities. Technological development is the activity with the lowest green attention among the nine value chain activities. Our multiple regression analysis shows that 25% of the variation in firm performance can be significantly explained by the nine green value chain activities. In terms of the individual green value chain activities, green technology development is the only activity that can positively and significantly explain firm performance. Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that companies intending to build their green core competence need to engage in green technology development. Companies that go green for the purpose of complying to regulations and fulfilling minimum customers‚Äô demands can still embed green practices into their green value chain without compromising their performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel mutation in hexokinase 2 confers resistance to 2-deoxyglucose by altering protein dynamics</a></h4>

Glucose is central to many biological processes, serving as an energy source and a building block for biosynthesis. After glucose enters the cell, hexokinases convert it to glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P) for use in anaerobic fermentation, aerobic oxidative phosphorylation, and the pentose-phosphate pathway. We here describe a genetic screen in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> that generated a novel spontaneous mutation in hexokinase-2, <i>hxk2</i><sup>G238V</sup>, that confers resistance to the toxic glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). Wild-type hexokinases convert 2DG to 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2DG-6P), but 2DG-6P cannot support downstream glycolysis, resulting in a cellular starvation-like response. Curiously, though the <i>hxk2</i><sup>G238V</sup> mutation encodes a loss-of-function allele, the affected amino acid does not interact directly with bound glucose, 2DG, or ATP. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Hxk2<sup>G238V</sup> impedes sugar binding by altering the protein dynamics of the glucose-binding cleft, as well as the large-scale domain-closure motions required for catalysis. These findings shed new light on Hxk2 dynamics and highlight how allosteric changes can influence catalysis, providing new structural insights into this critical regulator of carbohydrate metabolism. Given that hexokinases are upregulated in some cancers and that 2DG and its derivatives have been studied in anti-cancer trials, the present work also provides insights that may apply to cancer biology and drug resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Missense variants in human ACE2 strongly affect binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike providing a mechanism for ACE2 mediated genetic risk in Covid-19: A case study in affinity predictions of interface variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stuart A. MacGowan, Michael I. Barton, Mikhail Kutuzov, Omer Dushek, P. Anton van der Merwe, Geoffrey J. Barton</p>

SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Spike) binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the strength of this interaction could influence parameters relating to virulence. To explore whether population variants in ACE2 influence Spike binding and hence infection, we selected 10 ACE2 variants based on affinity predictions and prevalence in gnomAD and measured their affinities and kinetics for Spike receptor binding domain through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 37¬∞C. We discovered variants that reduce and enhance binding, including three ACE2 variants that strongly inhibited (p.Glu37Lys, ŒîŒîG = ‚Äì1.33 ¬± 0.15 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> and p.Gly352Val, predicted ŒîŒîG = ‚Äì1.17 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) or abolished (p.Asp355Asn) binding. We also identified two variants with distinct population distributions that enhanced affinity for Spike. ACE2 p.Ser19Pro (ŒîŒîG = 0.59 ¬± 0.08 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) is predominant in the gnomAD African cohort (AF = 0.003) whilst p.Lys26Arg (ŒîŒîG = 0.26 ¬± 0.09 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) is predominant in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AF = 0.01) and European non-Finnish (AF = 0.006) cohorts. We compared ACE2 variant affinities to published SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infectivity data and confirmed that ACE2 variants with reduced affinity for Spike can protect cells from infection. The effect of variants with enhanced Spike affinity remains unclear, but we propose a mechanism whereby these alleles could cause greater viral spreading across tissues and cell types, as is consistent with emerging understanding regarding the interplay between receptor affinity and cell-surface abundance. Finally, we compared mCSM-PPI2 ŒîŒîG predictions against our SPR data to assess the utility of predictions in this system. We found that predictions of decreased binding were well-correlated with experiment and could be improved by calibration, but disappointingly, predictions of highly enhanced binding were unreliable. Recalibrated predictions for all possible ACE2 missense variants at the Spike interface were calculated and used to estimate the overall burden of ACE2 variants on Covid-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tumor immune cell clustering and its association with survival in African American women with ovarian cancer</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Wilson, Alex C. Soupir, Ram Thapa, Jordan Creed, Jonathan Nguyen, Carlos Moran Segura, Travis Gerke, Joellen M. Schildkraut, Lauren C. Peres, Brooke L. Fridley</p>

New technologies, such as multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy (mIF), are being developed and used for the assessment and visualization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). These assays produce not only an estimate of the abundance of immune cells in the TIME, but also their spatial locations. However, there are currently few approaches to analyze the spatial context of the TIME. Therefore, we have developed a framework for the spatial analysis of the TIME using Ripley‚Äôs <i>K</i>, coupled with a permutation-based framework to estimate and measure the departure from complete spatial randomness (CSR) as a measure of the interactions between immune cells. This approach was then applied to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) using mIF collected on intra-tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) and tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 160 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients in the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) (94 subjects on TMAs resulting in 263 tissue cores; 93 subjects with 260 ROIs; 27 subjects with both TMA and ROI data). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the association of abundance and spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3+), cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+CD3+), and regulatory T-cells (CD3+FoxP3+) with overall survival. Analysis was done on TMA and ROIs, treating the TMA data as validation of the finding from the ROIs. We found that EOC patients with high abundance and low spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and T-cell subsets in their tumors had the best overall survival. Additionally, patients with EOC tumors displaying high co-occurrence of cytotoxic T-cells and regulatory T-cells had the best overall survival. Grouping women with ovarian cancer based on both cell abundance and spatial contexture showed better discrimination for survival than grouping ovarian cancer cases only by cell abundance. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of evaluating not only immune cell abundance but also the spatial contexture of the immune cells in the TIME. In conclusion, the application of this spatial analysis framework to the study of the TIME could lead to the identification of immune content and spatial architecture that could aid in the determination of patients that are likely to respond to immunotherapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The impact of individual perceptual and cognitive factors on collective states in a data-driven fish school model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Weijia Wang, Ram√≥n Escobedo, St√©phane Sanchez, Cl√©ment Sire, Zhangang Han, Guy Theraulaz</p>

In moving animal groups, social interactions play a key role in the ability of individuals to achieve coordinated motion. However, a large number of environmental and cognitive factors are able to modulate the expression of these interactions and the characteristics of the collective movements that result from these interactions. Here, we use a data-driven fish school model to quantitatively investigate the impact of perceptual and cognitive factors on coordination and collective swimming patterns. The model describes the interactions involved in the coordination of burst-and-coast swimming in groups of <i>Hemigrammus rhodostomus</i>. We perform a comprehensive investigation of the respective impacts of two interactions strategies between fish based on the selection of the most or the two most influential neighbors, of the range and intensity of social interactions, of the intensity of individual random behavioral fluctuations, and of the group size, on the ability of groups of fish to coordinate their movements. We find that fish are able to coordinate their movements when they interact with their most or two most influential neighbors, provided that a minimal level of attraction between fish exist to maintain group cohesion. A minimal level of alignment is also required to allow the formation of schooling and milling. However, increasing the strength of social interactions does not necessarily enhance group cohesion and coordination. When attraction and alignment strengths are too high, or when the heading random fluctuations are too large, schooling and milling can no longer be maintained and the school switches to a swarming phase. Increasing the interaction range between fish has a similar impact on collective dynamics as increasing the strengths of attraction and alignment. Finally, we find that coordination and schooling occurs for a wider range of attraction and alignment strength in small group sizes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Systematically assessing microbiome‚Äìdisease associations identifies drivers of inconsistency in metagenomic research</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Braden T. Tierney, Yingxuan Tan, Zhen Yang, Bing Shui, Michaela J. Walker, Benjamin M. Kent, Aleksandar D. Kostic, Chirag J. Patel</p>

Evaluating the relationship between the human gut microbiome and disease requires computing reliable statistical associations. Here, using millions of different association modeling strategies, we evaluated the consistency‚Äîor robustness‚Äîof microbiome-based disease indicators for 6 prevalent and well-studied phenotypes (across 15 public cohorts and 2,343 individuals). We were able to discriminate between analytically robust versus nonrobust results. In many cases, different models yielded contradictory associations for the same taxon‚Äìdisease pairing, some showing positive correlations and others negative. When querying a subset of 581 microbe‚Äìdisease associations that have been previously reported in the literature, 1 out of 3 taxa demonstrated substantial inconsistency in association sign. Notably, >90% of published findings for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were particularly nonrobust in this regard. We additionally quantified how potential confounders‚Äîsequencing depth, glucose levels, cholesterol, and body mass index, for example‚Äîinfluenced associations, analyzing how these variables affect the ostensible correlation between <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> abundance and a healthy gut. Overall, we propose our approach as a method to maximize confidence when prioritizing findings that emerge from microbiome association studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Is orgasmic meditation a form of sex?: practitioners of orgasmic meditation view the practice as significantly more similar to meditation than to sex or fondling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Orgasmic Meditation (OM) is a structured, partnered meditative practice in which one person, who can be any gender, strokes the clitoris of their partner for 15 minutes. As such, it resembles a sexual activity. OM is taught as a practice that is distinct from sex, and we wondered whether people who engage in OM actually maintain that distinction themselves. Methods: We conducted an online convenience sample survey including qualitative open-ended text questions and quantitative Likert-style questions that was distributed to email listservs for practitioners of OM. In the study, 414 participants completed the 30-item questionnaire including questions designed to differentiate the potentially related concepts of OM, seated meditation, fondling, and sex, as bases for comparison. Results: Participants reported that they strongly agreed that OM is not fondling or sex, giving an average Likert-type rating of 4.55 and 4.65, respectively. Participants disagreed most strongly with the statements ‚ÄúOM is Sex,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOM is Fondling,‚Äù with average ratings of 1.42 and 1.48, respectively (strongly disagree). There was also high disagreement with the statement ‚ÄúOM is not mediation,‚Äù with a rating of 1.53. Conclusion: The quantitative results of this mixed methods study show that OM practitioners view the practice as significantly more similar to meditation than to sex or fondling. These results were consistent, regardless of whether the question was asked in the positive or negative or whether OM was being compared to one behavior individually or to multiple behaviors at the same time. The distinction between OM and sex/fondling rapidly becomes more pronounced as practitioners complete more OMs. This suggests that the novelty of genital touching in meditation may diminish over time, as practitioners get used to the more alternative point of focus. The results of this study have implications for the practice and how it is approached and regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mobile perceived trust mediation on the intention and adoption of FinTech innovations using mobile technology: A systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The banking and financial sectors have witnessed a significant development recently due to financial technology (FinTech), and it has become an essential part of the financial system. Many factors helped the development of this sector, including the pandemics such as Covid-19, the considerable increasing market value of the FinTech sector worldwide, and new technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and mobile technology. Moreover, changes in consumer's preferences, especially the Z-generation (digital generation). FinTech shifted the traditional business models to mobile platforms characterized by ease of access and swift transactions. Mobile technology became the main backbone for FinTech innovations and acts as a channel to deliver FinTech services that overcome all geographical and timing barriers, thus enhancing financial inclusion. Mobile perceived Trust (MPT), or the trust in using financial business models via mobile technology, is a crucial factor in the FinTech context that has mediation effects on the intention and adoption of different FinTech business models. Unfortunately, few studies have explored MPT mediations on consumers' intention to adopt FinTech innovations using mobile technology. Typically, many studies examined trust/MPT as an independent and unidirectional variable and investigated its effects on behaviour intention without predicting its mediation effects. This study aimed to develop a systematic literature review on MPT mediation in FinTech, focusing on the period from 2016 and 2021, in journals ranked Q1 and Q2, and known-based theories such as the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and the mobile technology acceptance model. This study found that only four articles were published in Q1 and Q2 journals. In these articles, the MPT was used as a mediator, and its effects were measured on the intention and adoption of the behaviour.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of the clinical effectiveness of self-etch sealant with the conventional acid-etch sealant for the retentive ability and marginal integrity in permanent molars: a split mouth one year randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaitin</a></h4>

              
                Background: Self-etching has been shown to be beneficial compared to the other resin sealants especially in pediatric practice. The present in-vivo study was designed to clinically evaluate the sealing ability and retention of the self-etching sealant compared to the conventional resin sealant. The aim was to evaluate and compare the retention and marginal integrity of the self-etch and acid etch sealant materials at three, six and twelve-month follow up. Methods: This was designed a randomized controlled trial, with double blind parallel, split-mouth design. In total, 35 children (70 teeth) between 7 and 10 years of age formed part of the study. Group 1 received acid-etch sealant and Group 2 received self-etch sealants. The study participants and the investigator who performed the statistical analysis were blinded to the treatment allocation. All the samples were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months. The inter-group and intragroup comparison were carried out using the Chi-Square test and Friedman test with level of significance set at 5% and the P value less than 0.05. Results: Complete retention of sealants was observed in 34.5% of conventional acid etch (group 1) and 22.9% of self-etch samples (group 2) whereas complete loss of sealants were seen in 11.4% of group 1 and 20% of the group 2 samples and intergroup comparison of retention failure was non-significant (p=0.135). In total, 85.7% of the group 1 and 82.9% of the group 2 samples exhibited good marginal integrity with no clinical changes in the enamel around the margins but this was not statistically significant (p=0.5). Conclusions: Sealants with fewer procedural steps and those which provide adequate retention would be ideal for use in children. Thus, self-etch sealants have been found to be effective and efficient as a sealant in the present in-vivo study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The pathogenicity of blood stream and central nervous system forms of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense trypanosomes in laboratory mice: a comparative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) develops in two stages namely early stage when trypanosomes are found in the blood and late stage when trypanosomes are found in the central nervous system (CNS). The two environments are different with CNS environment reported as being hostile to the trypanosomes than the blood environment. The clinical symptoms manifested by the disease in the two environments are different. Information on whether blood stream are pathologically different from CNS trypanosomes is lacking. This study undertook to compare the inter-isolate pathological differences caused by bloodstream forms (BSF) and central nervous system (CNS) of five Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr) isolates in Swiss white mice. Methods: Donor mice infected with each of the five isolates were euthanized at 21 days post infection (DPI) for recovery of BSF trypanosomes in heart blood and CNS trypanosomes in brain supernatants. Groups of Swiss white mice (n = 10) were then infected with BSF or CNS forms of each isolate and monitored for parasitaemia, packed cell volume (PCV), body weight, survivorship, trypanosome length, gross and histopathology characteristics. Results: Amplification of SRA gene prior to trypanosome morphology and pathogenicity studies confirmed all isolates as T. b. rhodesiense.¬† At 21 DPI, CNS trypanosomes were predominantly long slender (LS) while BSF were a mixture of short stumpy and intermediate forms. The density of BSF trypanosomes was on average 2-3 log-scales greater than that of CNS trypanosomes with isolate KETRI 2656 having the highest CNS trypanosome density. Conclusions: The pathogenicity study revealed clear differences in the virulence/pathogenicity of the five (5) isolates but no distinct and consistent differences between CNS and BSF forms of the same isolate. We also identified KETRI 2656 as a suitable isolate for acute menigo- encephalitic studies.

                A systematic review of clinical trials conducted with a low-dose inactivated influenza vaccine adjuvanted by azoximer bromide (AZB, Polyoxidonium), was performed to compare vaccine reactogenicity against non-adjuvant vaccines. We also assessed whether lower amounts of antigen per viral strain in AZB-adjuvanted vaccines affected antibody responses. A robust search strategy identified scientific publications reporting 30 clinical trials, comprising data on 11,736 participants and 86 trial arms, for inclusion in the analysis. Local reaction rates (Rlr) appeared to be lower in AZB-adjuvanted vaccine treatment arms versus comparator vaccine treatment arms. Meta‚Äëregression analysis revealed that AZB did not contribute to vaccine reactogenicity. Post-vaccination geometric mean titres in those exposed to AZB-adjuvanted vaccine and comparator vaccine treatment arms were similar in both children and adults aged 18‚Äì60 years, implying an antigen-sparing effect by AZB.

                Background:¬† Most primary school Physical Education (PE) has relatively little health-enhancing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). - A promising theory and evidence-based intervention, the ‚ÄòSHARP Principles‚Äô model, has been effective in making PE lessons more active in one area of England. This protocol paper explains the rationale for use of the SHARP intervention, and the methods used to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a version of SHARP translated for use in Scotland (SHARP Scotland). Methods: The feasibility of SHARP Scotland will be evaluated by key areas of focus for feasibility studies: Acceptability, Implementation, Integration, Limited Efficacy Testing. A combination of process measures, including observations, session delivery records, accelerometry-data collection, questionnaires, and semi-structured qualitative focus groups with teachers and pupils will be used. The feasibility and suitability of the SHARP Scotland intervention for a future Randomised Control Trial (RCT) will be assessed. The study will involve children from 8-11 years old (Primary 4 to 6) in two schools, one large urban school, and one smaller school; four classes will be randomly assigned to the intervention group, and four classes randomly assigned to the usual-care (standard curriculum) control group. Within the 8-week intervention, MVPA in the intervention group will be targeted by encouraging class teachers to deliver their PE classes in more active ways, following SHARP Principles. A maximum of 64 PE lessons delivered in a SHARP way will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Discussion: The outcome of this study will be an assessment of whether applying the SHARP intervention is feasible in Scottish schools. Identification of any modifications to the intervention or evaluation which are required will provide insight for a fully powered effectiveness trial in the future, if appropriate.

                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires mass immunization to control the severity of symptoms and global spread. Data from developed countries have shown a high prevalence of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. However, parental vaccine hesitancy data in low- and middle-income countries are scarce. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of parental vaccine hesitancy and identify subgroups with higher odds of vaccine hesitancy in parents in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on the parents of children aged <18 years from October 10, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Parents participated in face-to-face interviews in randomly selected locations in Bangladesh using a vaccine hesitancy questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Data from 2,633 eligible parents were analyzed. Overall, 42.8% reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for their youngest child. The final model suggested the following factors were associated with hesitancy: children's age; parent's age, religion, occupation, monthly household income, permanent address, living location, status of tobacco use, adherence with regular government vaccination programs (other than COVID-19), perceptions of¬†COVID-19 vaccine efficacy among Bangladeshi children, self-vaccination intentions, reported family members' illness or death from COVID-19, and perceived threat of COVID-19 were the independent predictors of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Conversely, participants who were not tobacco users, parents who were very likely to believe that their children or family members could be infected with COVID-19 in the following year and who were very concerned about their children or a family member contracting COVID-19 in the next year had significantly lower odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Our study suggested that vaccine hesitation varied based on sociodemographic characteristics, religion, behavior, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Therefore, interventions focused on addressing vaccine hesitancy among specific subgroups are warranted.

                Background: Self-harm is a serious public health problem across the world, impacting not only people who self-harm but also their families and society as a whole through higher resource costs and productivity losses. This review was conducted among the general Saudi population to investigate the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and factors affecting it. Methods: An electronic literature search of four major databases, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus Science Direct, and Google Scholar, was conducted to include eligible studies. All studies reporting NSSI or relevant to the subject were included. Results: A total of five articles with 1758 participants were included. The lowest recorded NSSI prevalence was 0.47% while the highest was 10.2%, both in Al-Khobar city. Conclusion: We recorded a relatively low but increasing prevalence of NSSI. The review also demonstrated that NSSI was more common among the female population and young people. Self-poisoning, including drug overdose, was the most prevalent method of self-harm. Interpersonal difficulties, marital problems, academic failure, and family and self-conflicts were common motivating factors of NSSI.

                Background: A significant bone defect is a condition wherein the bone cannot repair spontaneously. Therefore, replacing bone defects with bone substitution remains a reconstructive concern for orthopaedic surgeons. Bone Graft Substitution (BGS) are classified broadly, such as bone grafts (autograft, allograft, and xenograft) synthetic ceramics (hydroxyapatite, calcium sulphate). This study aims to determine the effect of various Bone Graft Substitute on the healing process of bone defects assessed based on the area of callus formation and levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP).¬†¬† Methods: The study design was an in vivo laboratory experimental approach with a randomized post-test only control group design. The 36 experimental animals that matched the inclusion criteria were divided into five groups, in each one of control positive group, one of control negative group, and three of treatment group. The bone graft substitution used in this study is a synthetic ceramic, namely Synthetic HA-Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 - BONGROS¬Æ, Bone Graft Substitution Nanocrystalline HA-CaSO4-PEROSSAL¬Æ, and also hydroxyapatite Bovine. After selecting rats, we performed osteotomy on the femur to the made bone defect. After 30 days, murine models were harvested. Then, we measure callus formation using radiological examination and ALP level serum¬† Results: From Callus formation, Nanocrystalline HA-CaSO4 is the highest (86.54 ¬± 4.24604) compared with other groups and significantly (p:0.021) increase in callus formation than the other experimental groups. Then, from the ALP level, Bovine is the highest (9.287 ¬± 0.58586) but did not significantly compare with K-neg, and the second one is Nanocrystalline HA-CaSO4 higher than KP-1, and it has a significantly higher levels serum ALP rather than K-Neg.¬†¬† Conclusion: Bone Graft Substituted using Nanocrystalline HA-CaSO4 is a good material that can repair and increase callus formation in fracture model rats with bone defects.

                SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a diverse spectrum of neurological complications in the acute and post-acute stages. The pathogenesis of these complications is complex and dependent on many factors. For accurate and consistent interpretation of experimental data in this fast-growing field of research, it is essential to use terminology consistently. In this article, we outline the distinctions between neuroinvasiveness, neurotropism, and neurovirulence. Additionally, we discuss current knowledge of these distinct features underlying the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological complications.

                Hierarchical temporal dynamics are a fundamental computational property of the brain; however, there are no whole-brain, noninvasive investigations into timescales of neural processing in animal models. To that end, we used the spatial resolution and sensitivity of ultrahigh field fMRI performed at 10.5 Tesla to probe timescales across the whole macaque brain. We uncovered within-species consistency between timescales estimated from fMRI and electrophysiology. Crucially, we extended existing electrophysiological hierarchies to whole brain topographies. Our results validate the complementary use of hemodynamic and electrophysiological intrinsic timescales, establishing a basis for future translational work. Further, with these results in hand, we were able to show that one facet of the high-dimensional functional connectivity topography of any region in the brain is closely related to hierarchical temporal dynamics. We demonstrated that intrinsic timescales are organized along spatial gradients that closely match functional connectivity gradient topographies across the whole brain. We conclude that intrinsic timescales are a unifying organizational principle of neural processing across the whole brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tom70-based transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and aging</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial biogenesis has two major steps: the transcriptional activation of nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial proteins and the import of nascent mitochondrial proteins that are synthesized in the cytosol. These nascent mitochondrial proteins are aggregation-prone and can cause cytosolic proteostasis stress. The transcription factor-dependent transcriptional regulations and the TOM-TIM complex-dependent import of nascent mitochondrial proteins have been extensively studied. Yet, little is known regarding how these two steps of mitochondrial biogenesis coordinate with each other to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of these aggregation-prone nascent mitochondrial proteins. Here we show that in budding yeast, Tom70, a conserved receptor of the TOM complex, moonlights to regulate the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins. Tom70's transcription regulatory role is conserved in <i>Drosophila</i>. The dual roles of Tom70 in both transcription/biogenesis and import of mitochondrial proteins allow the cells to accomplish mitochondrial biogenesis without compromising cytosolic proteostasis. The age-related reduction of Tom70, caused by reduced biogenesis and increased degradation of Tom70, is associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mtDNA, and mitochondrial proteins. While loss of Tom70 accelerates aging and age-related mitochondrial defects, overexpressing TOM70 delays these mitochondrial dysfunctions and extends the replicative lifespan. Our results reveal unexpected roles of Tom70 in mitochondrial biogenesis and aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NBI-921352, a first-in-class, NaV1.6 selective, sodium channel inhibitor that prevents seizures in Scn8a gain-of-function mice, and wild-type mice and rats</a></h4>

              
                NBI-921352 (formerly XEN901) is a novel sodium channel inhibitor designed to specifically target Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels. Such a molecule provides a precision-medicine approach to target <i>SCN8A</i>-related epilepsy syndromes (<i>SCN8A</i>-RES), where gain-of-function (GoF) mutations lead to excess Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sodium current, or other indications where Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 mediated hyper-excitability contributes to disease (Gardella &amp; Moller, 2019; Johannesen et al., 2019; Veeramah et al., 2012). NBI-921352 is a potent inhibitor of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.051 ¬µM), with exquisite selectivity over other sodium channel isoforms (selectivity ratios of 756X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, 134X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, 276X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, and &gt;583X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5). NBI-921352 is a state-dependent inhibitor, preferentially inhibiting inactivated channels. The state dependence leads to potent stabilization of inactivation, inhibiting Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents, including resurgent and persistent Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents, while sparing the closed/rested channels. The isoform-selective profile of NBI-921352 led to a robust inhibition of action-potential firing in glutamatergic excitatory pyramidal neurons, while sparing fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, where Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 predominates. Oral administration of NBI-921352 prevented electrically induced seizures in a <i>Scn8a</i> GoF mouse, as well as in wild-type mouse and rat seizure models. NBI-921352 was effective in preventing seizures at lower brain and plasma concentrations than commonly prescribed sodium channel inhibitor anti-seizure medicines (ASMs) carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lacosamide. NBI-921352 was well tolerated at higher multiples of the effective plasma and brain concentrations than those ASMs. NBI-921352 is entering phase II proof-of-concept trials for the treatment of <i>SCN8A</i><i>-</i>developmental epileptic encephalopathy (<i>SCN8A</i>-DEE) and adult focal-onset seizures.

                <b>Background:</b> There is mounting evidence that <i>in                        utero</i> and early life exposures may predispose an individual to                    metabolic disorders in later life; and dysregulation of lipid metabolism is                    critical in such outcomes. However, there is limited knowledge about lipid                    metabolism and factors causing lipid dysregulation in early life that could                    result in adverse health outcomes in later life. We studied the effect of                    antenatal factors such as gestational age, birth weight and mode of birth on                    lipid metabolism at birth; changes in the circulating lipidome in the first four                    years of life and the effect of breastfeeding in the first year of life. From                    this study, we aim to generate a framework for deeper understanding into factors                    effecting lipid metabolism in early life, to provide early interventions for                    those at risk of developing metabolic disorders including cardiovascular                    diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Small proline-rich proteins (SPRRs) are epidermally produced antimicrobial proteins that defend the cutaneous barrier by direct bacterial membrane disruption</a></h4>

              
                Human skin functions as a physical barrier, preventing the entry of foreign pathogens while also accommodating a myriad of commensal microorganisms. A key contributor to the skin landscape is the sebaceous gland. Mice devoid of sebocytes are prone to skin infection, yet our understanding of how sebocytes function in host defense is incomplete. Here we show that the small proline-rich proteins, SPRR1 and SPRR2 are bactericidal in skin. SPRR1B and SPPR2A were induced in human sebocytes by exposure to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Colonization of germ-free mice was insufficient to trigger increased SPRR expression in mouse skin, but LPS injected into mouse skin triggered the expression of the mouse SPRR orthologous genes, <i>Sprr1a</i> and <i>Sprr2a</i>, through stimulation of MYD88. Both mouse and human SPRR proteins displayed potent bactericidal activity against MRSA (methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and skin commensals. Thus, <i>Sprr1a<sup>-/-</sup>;Sprr2a<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice are more susceptible to MRSA and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>skin infection. Lastly, mechanistic studies demonstrate that SPRR proteins exert their bactericidal activity through binding and disruption of the bacterial membrane. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the regulation and antimicrobial function of SPRR proteins in skin and how the skin defends the host against systemic infection.

                Rate-distortion theory provides a powerful framework for understanding the nature of human memory by formalizing the relationship between information rate (the average number of bits per stimulus transmitted across the memory channel) and distortion (the cost of memory errors). Here we show how this abstract computational-level framework can be realized by a model of neural population coding. The model reproduces key regularities of visual working memory, including some that were not previously explained by population coding models. We verify a novel prediction of the model by reanalyzing recordings of monkey prefrontal neurons during an oculomotor delayed response task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kv7 channel antagonists block glycine receptors</a></h4>

              
                XE991 (10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone) is currently the most widely used and specific antagonist of the Kv7 (KCNQ) family of K+ channels. We report an unexpected antagonistic effect of this drug on ionotropic glycine receptors. In recordings of synaptic transmission in two brainstem nuclei (the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and the dorsal cochlear nucleus), 10 M XE991, a concentration typical for Kv7 studies in brain tissue, inhibited evoked glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) without altering paired-pulse ratio, and also reduced the amplitude of glycinergic miniature IPSCs. These results are indicative of a direct effect of the drug on postsynaptic glycine receptors. XE991 also produced dose-dependent block of the response to exogenously applied glycine, to a degree comparable to the block of synaptic transmission. Moreover, the drug inhibited homomeric glycine receptors expressed on presynaptic membrane of the calyx of Held. The degree of block was independent of glycine concentration, suggesting an allosteric interaction. The effects of XE991 on glycine responses are not likely to reflect block of the glycine-activated Cl- channels themselves, because block was voltage independent, and because GABA-activated Cl- currents were resistant to XE991 at concentrations up to 100 M. Linopirdine, but not retigabine, also antagonized glycine receptor currents. Given the prevalence of glycine receptor signaling in the brain, these observations should be taken into account in studies of the roles of Kv7 channels in neural circuit function and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A vector reward prediction error model explains dopaminergic heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                The hypothesis that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons broadcast an error signal for the prediction of reward (reward prediction error, RPE) is among the great successes of computational neuroscience1-3. However, recent results contradict a core aspect of this theory: that the neurons uniformly convey a scalar, global signal. Instead, when animals are placed in a high-dimensional environment, DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) display substantial heterogeneity in the features to which they respond, while also having more consistent RPE-like responses at the time of reward. Here we introduce a new Vector RPE model that explains these findings, by positing that DA neurons report individual RPEs for a subset of a population vector code for an animal's state (moment-to-moment situation). To investigate this claim, we train a deep reinforcement learning model on a navigation and decision-making task, and compare the Vector RPE derived from the network to population recordings from DA neurons during the same task. The Vector RPE model recapitulates the key features of the neural data: specifically, heterogeneous coding of task variables during the navigation and decision-making period, but uniform reward responses. The model also makes new predictions about the nature of the responses, which we validate. Our work provides a path to reconcile new observations of DA neuron heterogeneity with classic ideas about RPE coding, while also providing a new perspective on how the brain performs reinforcement learning in high dimensional environments.

                Thalamoreticular circuitry is central to sensory processing, attention, and sleep, and is implicated in numerous brain disorders, but the cellular and synaptic mechanisms remain intractable. Therefore, we developed the first detailed microcircuit model of mouse thalamus and thalamic reticular nucleus that captures morphological and biophysical properties of ~14,000 neurons connected via ~6M synapses, and recreates biological synaptic and gap junction connectivity. Realistic spontaneous and evoked activity during wakefulness and sleep emerge allowing dissection of cellular and synaptic contributions. Computer simulations suggest that reticular inhibition shapes thalamic responses and cortex can drive frequency-selective thalamic enhancement during wakefulness, whereas in sleep, reticular inhibition and cortical UP-states can trigger thalamic bursts and spindles. Gap junctions and short-term synaptic plasticity underlie spindle properties such as waxing and waning, and neuromodulation influences the occurrence of spindles. The model is openly available to support testing hypotheses of thalamoreticular circuitry in normal brain function and in disease.

                The slow oscillation (SO) is a central neuronal dynamic during sleep and is generated by alternating periods of high and low neuronal activity (ON and OFF states). Mounting evidence causally links the SO to sleep's functions, and it has recently become possible to manipulate the SO non-invasively and phase-specifically. These developments represent promising clinical avenues, but they also highlight the importance of improving our understanding of how ON/OFF states affect incoming stimuli and what role they play in neuronal plasticity. Most studies using closed-loop stimulation rely on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) signals, which reflect neuronal ON and OFF states only indirectly. Here we develop an online detection algorithm based on spiking activity recorded from laminar arrays in mouse motor cortex. We find that online detection of ON and OFF states reflects specific phases of spontaneous LFP SO. Our neuronal-spiking-based closed-loop procedure offers a novel opportunity for testing the functional role of SO in sleep-related restorative processes and neural plasticity.

                In drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, automated tools for seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization using brief interictal recordings would supplement presurgical evaluations and improve care. Thus, we sought to localize SOZs by training a multi-channel convolutional neural network on stereo-EEG (SEEG) cortico-cortical evoked potentials. We performed single pulse electrical stimulation with 10 drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients implanted with SEEG. Using the 500,000 unique post-stimulation SEEG epochs, we trained a multi-channel one-dimensional convolutional neural network to determine whether an SOZ was stimulated. SOZs were classified with a mean leave-one-patient-out testing sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 74.6%. To achieve maximum accuracy, the model requires a 0-350 ms post stimulation time period. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the model accurately classified unilateral vs bilateral mesial temporal lobe seizure onset, and neocortical SOZs. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that a deep learning framework can be used to accurately classify SOZs using cortico-cortical evoked potentials. Our findings suggest accurate classification of SOZs relies on a complex temporal evolution of evoked potentials within 350 ms of stimulation. Validation in a larger dataset could provide a practical clinical tool for the presurgical evaluation of drug resistant epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human hippocampal responses to network stimulation vary with theta phase</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal memory function is thought to be supported by distinct connectivity states, with strong extrahippocampal input benefitting encoding and weak extrahippocampal input benefitting retrieval. Previous research in rodents suggests that the hippocampal theta oscillation orchestrates the transition between these states, with opposite phase angles respectively predicting minimal and maximal extrahippocampal input. However, it is unclear whether this phase dependence exists in humans. We used network-targeted stimulation to investigate whether hippocampal receptivity to network input varies with theta phase in humans of both sexes. Intracranial local field potentials were recorded from individuals with epilepsy undergoing medically necessary stereotactic electroencephalographic recording. In each subject, biphasic bipolar direct electrical stimulation was delivered to lateral temporal sites with demonstrated connectivity to hippocampus. Stimulation evoked ipsilateral hippocampal potentials with distinct early and late negative components. Using evoked-component amplitude to measure functional connectivity, we assessed whether different phases of hippocampal theta reflected distinct connectivity states. Stimulation enhanced both early and late component amplitudes when delivered during the observed theta peak relative to trough. Analysis of estimated theta phase delays between stimulation locations and hippocampus suggested that hippocampal response amplitude was maximized when stimulation influenced hippocampal activity at approximately 90{ring} before the trough of its theta rhythm. The pattern of theta phase dependence observed in hippocampus was not identified for amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex control locations. These findings demonstrate that theta phase reflects connectivity states of human hippocampal networks, confirming a putative mechanism by which oscillations modulate local hippocampal processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synergistic effect of mutations in the Parkinson's disease-linked proteins synaptojanin 1 and auxilin</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by defective dopaminergic (DAergic) input to the striatum. Mutations in two genes encoding synaptically-enriched clathrin-uncoating factors, synaptojanin 1 (SJ1) and auxilin, result in PD. SJ1 knock-in (SJ1-KIRQ) mice carrying PD mutation display neurological manifestation reminiscent of PD. Here we report that auxilin knockout (Aux-KO) mice display dystrophic changes of a subset of nigrostriatal DAergic terminals similar to those of SJ1-KIRQ mice. Furthermore, Aux-KO/SJ1-KIRQ double mutant mice have shorter lifespan and more severe synaptic defects than single mutant mice. These include more numerous dystrophic striatal nerve terminals positive for DAergic markers and for the PD risk protein SV2C, as well as adaptive changes in striatal interneurons. The synergistic effect of the two mutations demonstrates a special lability of DAergic neurons to defects in clathrin uncoating, with implications for PD pathogenesis in at least some forms of this condition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Turning the head while biking makes older people lose cycling direction and balance</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bike safety in older subjects is a major concern in multiple countries given the strong increase in the number of cyclists that are admitted to the hospital due to single-sided bicycle accidents in older populations. The increase in single-sided accident rate in older subjects suggests that older adults have more difficulty controlling balance while bicycling in traffic, which has been related to various age-related changes in the sensorimotor system. Yet, the impact of these age-related sensorimotor deficits on the ability of older people to remain stable on their bike during traffic situations such as turning their upper body to check on potential road users, remains unknown. Methods: We instructed a group of 40 young (22.86, SD:1.53 years) and 41 older participants (62.73 SD:1.57 years) to bike in a straight line while performing a shoulder check movement in order to identify the color of an object presented behind them. We recorded the task-errors (lost balance, errors in identifying the color, cycling outside the lane) and computed the steering angle and rotation of the frame, pelvis and torso from IMU recordings. Results: We observed that older adults made task-errors (one third of the older participants failed at the task by making errors such as cone-identification errors, loss of balance and cycling outside the lane). In the successful trials, we observed an increase in steering angle and rotation of the pelvis with respect to the frame in the older subjects compared to the young subjects. Significance: Older cyclists lose balance while turning their head, which might contribute to the increased number of single sided bike accidents in older subjects. The use of simple devices, such as using a mirror, should be encouraged in older subjects to replace the shoulder check maneuver.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcranial random noise stimulation of the primary visual cortex but not retina modulates visual contrast sensitivity.</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) has been shown to significantly improve visual perception. Previous studies demonstrated that tRNS delivered over cortical areas acutely enhances visual contrast detection of stimuli when tRNS intensity is optimized for the individual. However, it is currently unknown whether tRNS-induced signal enhancement could be achieved within different neural substrates along the retino-cortical pathway and whether the beneficial effect of optimal tRNS intensities can be reproduced across sessions. In 3 experimental sessions, we tested whether tRNS applied to the primary visual cortex (V1) and/or to the retina improves visual contrast detection. We first measured visual contrast detection threshold (VCT; N=24, 16 females) during tRNS delivery separately over V1 (no tRNS, 0.75, 1, 1.5mA) and over the retina (no tRNS, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3mA), determined the optimal tRNS intensities for each individual (ind-tRNS), and retested the effects of ind-tRNS within the sessions. We further investigated whether we could reproduce the ind-tRNS-induced modulation on a different session (N=19, 14 females). Finally, we tested whether the simultaneous application of ind-tRNS to the retina and V1 causes additive effects. We found that at the group level tRNS of 0.75mA decreases VCT compared to baseline when delivered to the V1. Beneficial effects of ind-tRNS could be replicated when retested within the same experimental session but not when retested in a separate session. Applying tRNS to the retina did not cause a systematic reduction of VCT, irrespective of whether the individually optimized intensity was considered or not. We also did not observe consistent additive effects of V1 and retina stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that V1 seems to be more sensitive than the retina to tRNS-induced modulation of visual contrast processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic methamphetamine administration produces cognitive deficits through augmentation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Chronic methamphetamine (METH) abuse is associated with the emergence of cognitive deficits and hypofrontality, a pathophysiological marker of many neuropsychiatric disorders that is produced by altered balance of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. However, there is a dearth of information regarding the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying METH-induced cognitive deficits and associated hypofrontal states. We find here that repeated METH administration in rats produces deficits in working memory and increases in inhibitory synaptic transmission onto pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The increased PFC inhibition is detected by an increase in spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic synaptic currents (IPSCs), an increase in GABAergic presynaptic function, and a shift in the excitatory-inhibitory balance onto PFC deep-layer pyramidal neurons. We find that pharmacological blockade of D1 dopamine receptor function reduces the METH-induced augmentation of IPSCs, suggesting a critical role for D1 dopamine signaling in METH-induced hypofrontality. In addition, chronic METH administration increases the intrinsic excitability of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, a key local interneuron population in PFC that controls inhibitory tone. Using a cell type-specific chemogenetic approach, we show that increasing PV+FSI activity in the PFC is necessary and sufficient for METH-induced deficits in temporal order memory. Together, our findings reveal that chronic METH exposure increases PFC inhibitory tone through a D1 dopamine signaling-dependent potentiation of inhibitory synaptic transmission, and that reduction of PV+FSI activity can rescue METH-induced cognitive deficits, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach to treating cognitive symptoms in patients suffering from methamphetamine use disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vivo physiology of foveal retinal ganglion cells in Macaca fascicularis</a></h4>

              
                The primate fovea is specialized for high-resolution spatial and chromatic vision, possessing a unique topography characterized by a pit in which the inner retina and associated vasculature have been excavated, the highest density of cones anywhere in the retina, and a disproportionately large representation in visual cortex. The crucial visual properties conferred by the fovea are mediated by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) the somas of which lie at the margin of the foveal pit. Microelectrode recordings of these centermost retinal ganglion cells have been challenging due to the fragility of the fovea in the excised retina. This has been overcome in this study by combining high resolution fluorescence adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy with calcium imaging to optically record functional responses of foveal RGCs to visual stimuli in the living eye. Here we use this approach to study the chromatic responses of RGCs to uniform fields modulated in different directions in color space and achromatic responses with monochromatic drifting gratings. We repeated these recordings in many cells in each of three macaca fasicularis primates over weeks or months. We find that most of the L/M chromatically opponent cells serving the most central cones respond to high spatial frequencies, reflecting strong surround inhibition that sacrifices sensitivity at low frequencies in favor of the transmission of fine detail in the retinal image. In addition, we find the L/M cells vary in spatial frequency bandwidths, suggesting that L/M chromatic opponency, often considered largely due to input from single cones, has more diverse receptive field structure than previously thought. By characterizing the functional properties of retinal ganglion cells in vivo through adaptive optics, we provide a lower bound on the response characteristics of these cells in situ and their role in vision processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual Perception of 3D Space and Shape in Time - Part II: 3D Space Perception with Holographic Depth</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception plays a critical role in navigating 3D space and extracting semantic information crucial to survival. Even though visual stimulation on the retina is fundamentally 2D, we seem to perceive the world around us in vivid 3D effortlessly. This reconstructed 3D space is allocentric and faithfully represents the external 3D world. How can we recreate stable 3D visual space so promptly and reliably? To solve this mystery, we have developed new concepts MePMoS (Memory-Prediction-Motion-Sensing) and NHT (Neural Holography Tomography). These models state that visual signal processing must be primarily top-down, starting from memory and prediction. Our brains predict and construct the expected 3D space holographically using traveling alpha brainwaves. Thus, 3D space is represented by the three time signals in three directions. To test this hypothesis, we designed reaction time (RT) experiments to observe predicted space-to-time conversion, especially as a function of distance. We placed LED strips on a horizontal plane to cover distances from close up to 2.5 m or 5 m, either using a 1D or a 2D lattice. Participants were instructed to promptly report observed LED patterns at various distances. As expected, stimulation at the fixation cue location always gave the fastest RT. Additional RT delays were proportional to the distance from the cue. Furthermore, both covert attention (without eye movements) and overt attention (with eye movements) created the same RT delays, and both binocular and monocular views resulted in the same RTs. These findings strongly support our predictions, in which the observed RT-depth dependence is indicative of the spatiotemporal conversion required for constructing allocentric 3D space. After all, we perceive and measure 3D space by time as Einstein postulated a century ago.

                Neurotransmission triggers Ca2+ signals in perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). As most PAPs are below the diffraction limit, the presence of Ca2+ stores in PAPs, notably the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is unclear. Here, we create 46 three dimensional meshes of hippocampal tripartite synapses reconstructed from electron microscopy. We find that 75% of PAPs contain some ER, as close as 72 nm to the synapse, and quantify its geometrical properties. To discern the effect of ER shape and distribution on Ca2+ activity, we implemented an algorithm that automatically redistributes the ER within the reconstructed PAP meshes, with constant ER and PAP shape. Reaction-diffusion simulations in those meshes reveal that Ca2+ signals in PAPs are shaped by a complex interplay between the clustering of Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ buffering, ER shape and distribution. This study, by detecting ER in PAPs and linking its spatial properties to Ca2+ activity, sheds new light on mechanisms regulating signal transmission at tripartite synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A tale of two connectivities: intra- and inter-subject functional connectivity jointly enable better prediction of social abilities</a></h4>

              
                Naturalistic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms, such as movie viewing, are attracting increased attention, given their ability to mimic the real-world cognitive demands on attention and multimodal sensory integration. Moreover, naturalistic paradigms allow for characterizing brain network responses associated with dynamic social cognition in a model-free manner using inter-subject functional connectivity (ISFC). While intra-subject functional connectivity (FC) characterizes the individual's brain functional architecture, ISFC characterizes the neural coupling driven by time-locked extrinsic dynamic stimuli across individuals. Here, we hypothesized that ISFC and FC provide distinct and complementary information about individual differences in social cognition. To test this hypothesis, we examined a public movie-viewing fMRI dataset with 32 healthy adults and 90 typically developing children. Building three partial least squares regression (PLS) models to predict social abilities using FC and/or ISFC, we compared predictive performance to determine whether combining two connectivity measures could improve the prediction accuracy of individuals' social-cognitive abilities measured by a Theory of Mind (ToM) assessment. Our results indicated that the joint model (ISFC+FC) yielded the highest predictive accuracy and significantly predicted individuals' social cognitive abilities (rho = 0.34, p < 0.001). We also confirmed that the improved accuracy was not due to the increased feature dimensionality. In conclusion, we demonstrated that intra-/inter-subject connectivity encodes unique information about social abilities, and a joint investigation could help us gain a more complete understanding of the complex processes supporting social cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psilocybin induces spatially constrained alterations in thalamic functional organization and connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist psychedelics including psilocybin and LSD ("classic" psychedelics) evoke acute alterations in perception and cognition. Altered thalamocortical connectivity has been proposed to underlie these effects, which is supported by some functional MRI (fMRI) studies. Likely due to sample size limitations, these studies have treated the thalamus as a unitary structure, despite known differential 5-HT2AR expression and functional specificity of different intrathalamic nuclei. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been employed to generate functional subdivisions of the thalamus from resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. This report utilizes a novel data-sparing ICA approach in order to examine psilocybin-induced changes in intrathalamic functional organization and thalamocortical connectivity. Methods: Baseline rsfMRI data (n=38) was utilized to generate a template, which was then applied in a novel ICA-based analysis of the acute effects of psilocybin on intra- and extra-thalamic functional organization and connectivity in a smaller sample (n=18). Correlations with subjective reports of drug effect and comparisons with a previously reported analytic approach (treating the thalamus as a single functional unit) were conducted. Results: Several intrathalamic components showed significant psilocybin-induced alterations in intrathalamic spatial organization, largely localized to the mediodorsal and pulvinar nuclei, and correlated with reported subjective effects. These same components demonstrated alterations in thalamocortical connectivity, largely with visual and default mode networks. Analysis in which the thalamus is treated as a singular unitary structure showed an overall numerical increase in thalamocortical connectivity, consistent with previous literature using this approach, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Utilization of a novel analytic approach demonstrated changes in intra- and extra-thalamic functional organization and connectivity of intrathalamic nuclei and cortical networks known to express the 5-HT2AR. Given that these changes were not observed using whole-thalamus analyses, it seems that psilocybin may cause widespread but modest increases in thalamocortical connectivity that are offset by strong focal decreases in functionally relevant intrathalamic nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stage dependent differential influence of metabolic and structural networks on memory across Alzheimer's disease continuum</a></h4>

              
                Background: Large-scale neuronal network breakdown underlies memory impairment in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the differential trajectories of the relationships between network organization and memory across pathology and cognitive stages in AD remain elusive. We determined whether and how the influences of individual-level structural and metabolic covariance network integrity on memory varied with amyloid pathology across clinical stages without assuming a constant relationship. Methods: 708 participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were studied. Individual-level structural and metabolic covariance scores in higher-level cognitive and hippocampal networks were derived from magnetic resonance imaging and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography using seed-based partial least square analyses. The non-linear associations between network scores and memory across cognitive stages in each pathology group were examined using sparse varying coefficient modelling. Results: We showed that the associations of memory with structural and metabolic networks in the hippocampal and default mode regions exhibited pathology-dependent differential trajectories across cognitive stages using sparse varying coefficient modelling. In amyloid pathology group, there was an early influence of hippocampal structural network deterioration on memory impairment in the preclinical stage, and a biphasic influence of the angular gyrus-seeded default mode network metabolism on memory in both preclinical and dementia stages. In non- amyloid pathology groups, in contrast, the trajectory of the hippocampus-memory association was opposite and weaker overall, while no metabolism covariance networks were related to memory. Key findings were replicated in a larger cohort of 1280 participants. Conclusions: Our findings highlight potential windows of early intervention targeting network breakdown at the preclinical AD stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain signal predictions from multi-scale networks using a linearized framework</a></h4>

              
                Simulations of neural activity at different levels of detail have become ubiquitous in modern neurosciences, aiding the interpretation of experimental data and underlying neural mechanisms at the level of cells and circuits. Extracellular electric measurements of brain signals that reflect transmembrane currents throughout the neural tissue remain commonplace. The lower frequencies (<300Hz or so) of measured signals generally stem from synaptic activity driven by recurrent interactions among neural populations and computational models should also incorporate accurate predictions of such signals. Due to limited computational resources, large scale neuronal network models (>1E6 neurons or so) often require reducing the level of biophysical detail and account mainly for times of action potentials ('spikes') or spike rates, and corresponding extracellular signal predictions have thus poorly accounted for their biophysical origin. Here we propose a computational framework for predicting spatiotemporal filter kernels for such extracellular signals stemming from synaptic activity, accounting for the biophysics of neurons, populations and recurrent connections. Signals are obtained by convolving population spike rates by appropriate kernels for each connection pathway and summing the contributions. Our main results are that kernels derived via linearized synapse and membrane dynamics, distributions of cells, conduction delay and volume conductor model allows for accurately capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of ground truth extracellular signals. One particular observation is that changes in the effective membrane time constants caused by persistent synapse activation must be accounted for. The work also constitutes a major advance in computational efficacy of accurate, biophysics-based signal predictions from large scale spike and rate-based neuron network models drastically reducing signal prediction times compared to biophysically detailed network models. This work also provides insight into how experimentally recorded low-frequency extracellular signals of neuronal activity may be approximately linearly dependent on spiking activity. A new software tool LFPykernels serves as a reference implementation of the framework.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapidly evolving genes underlie Aedes aegypti mosquito reproductive resilience during drought</a></h4>

              
                Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes impose a severe global public health burden as vectors of multiple viral pathogens. Under optimal environmental conditions, Aedes aegypti females have access to human hosts that provide blood proteins for egg development, conspecific males that provide sperm for fertilization, and freshwater that serves as an egg-laying substrate suitable for offspring survival. As global temperatures rise, Aedes aegypti females are faced with climate challenges like intense droughts and intermittent precipitation, which create unpredictable, suboptimal conditions for egg-laying. Here we show that under drought-like conditions simulated in the laboratory, females retain mature eggs in their ovaries for extended periods, while maintaining the viability of these eggs until they can be laid in freshwater. Using transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of Aedes aegypti ovaries, we identify two previously uncharacterized genes named tweedledee and tweedledum, each encoding a small, secreted protein that both show ovary-enriched, temporally-restricted expression during egg retention. These genes are mosquito-specific, linked within a syntenic locus, and rapidly evolving under positive selection, raising the possibility that they serve an adaptive function. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of both tweedledee and tweedledum demonstrates that they are specifically required for extended retention of viable eggs. These results highlight an elegant example of taxon-restricted genes at the heart of an important adaptation that equips Aedes aegypti females with insurance to flexibly extend their reproductive schedule without losing reproductive capacity, thus allowing this species to exploit unpredictable habitats in a changing world.

                Environmental toxicant exposure, including air pollution, is increasing worldwide. However, toxicant exposures are not equitably distributed. Rather, low-income and minority communities bear the greatest burden, along with higher levels of psychosocial stress. Both air pollution and maternal stress during pregnancy have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, but biological mechanisms and targets for therapeutic intervention remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that combined prenatal exposure to air pollution (diesel exhaust particles, DEP) and maternal stress (MS) in mice induces social behavior deficits only in male offspring, in line with the male bias in autism. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by changes in microglia and dopaminergic circuits in the brain, along with changes in the structure of the gut epithelium and microbiome. Importantly, DEP/MS-induced social deficits in males are prevented by shifting the gut microbiome by cross-fostering at birth and reversed by chemogenetic activation of the dopamine system.

                The sense of taste permits the recognition of valuable nutrients and the avoidance of potential toxins. Models of gustatory coding propose that within modalities (e.g. sweet, bitter, etc.), taste ligands are not distinct stimuli. However, these models are based on data from mice or fruitflies that have omnivorous, non-specialist diets. A specialist feeder might, however, be expected to have acuity within modality if stimulus resolution was critical to survival. Here, we show that the gustatory system of the bumblebee is capable of performing within-modality discrimination of sugar compound identity. The temporal firing patterns of two sugar-sensing gustatory neurons (GRNs) within the galeal sensilla of the bees mouthparts separate sugars into four distinct groups that correlate with sugar nutritional value. Representative sugars from each of these groups could be discriminated by bumblebees in a two-choice assay. Furthermore, the bees could discriminate among high nutritional value sugars such as fructose, sucrose, and maltose, implying that GRNs from other locations on the mouthparts improve the resolution of sugar identity in the bee brain. The bumblebees refined sense of sweet taste is likely to be an adaptation that enables precise calculations of the nature and nutritional value of floral nectar.

                Neuropathic pain is a complex, debilitating disease that results from injury to the somatosensory nervous system. The presence of systemic chronic inflammation has been observed in chronic pain patients, but whether it plays a causative role remains unclear. This study aims to determine the perturbation of systemic homeostasis by an injury to peripheral nerve and its involvement in neuropathic pain. We assessed the proteomic profile in the serum of mice at one-day and one-month following partial sciatic nerve injury (PSNL) or sham surgery. We also assessed mouse mechanical and cold sensitivity in naive mice after receiving intravenous administration of serum from PSNL or sham mice. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis revealed that PSNL resulted in a long-lasting alteration of serum proteome, where the majority of differentially expressed proteins were in inflammation related pathways, involving cytokines/chemokines, autoantibodies and complement factors. While transferring sham serum to naive mice did not change their pain sensitivity, PSNL serum significantly lowered mechanical thresholds and induced cold hypersensitivity in naive mice. With broad anti-inflammatory properties, bone marrow cell extracts (BMCE) not only partially restored serum proteomic homeostasis, but also significantly ameliorated PSNL-induced mechanical allodynia, and serum from BMCE-treated PSNL mice no longer induced hypersensitivity in naive mice. These findings clearly demonstrate that nerve injury has a long-lasting impact on systemic homeostasis, and nerve injury associated systemic inflammation contributes to the development of neuropathic pain.

                Alzheimer Disease (AD) is associated with cerebral plaques and tangles, reduced synapse number, and shrinkage in several brain areas and these morphological effects are associated with the onset of compromised cognitive, motor, and anxiety-like behaviours. The focus of this study was to examine the effect of neonatal tactile stimulation on AD-like behavioural and neurological symptoms on APP NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, a mouse model of AD. Our findings indicate that neonatal tactile stimulation improves cognition, motor skills, and anxiety-like symptoms in both offspring of stressed (dams exposed to gestational noise stress) and non-stressed APP mice and that these alterations are associated with reduced A{beta} plaque formation. Thus, tactile stimulation appears to be a promising non-invasive preventative strategy for slowing the onset of dementia in aging animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling of individual neurophysiological brain connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Introduction. Computational models are often used to assess how functional connectivity (FC) patterns emerge from neuronal population dynamics and anatomical connections in the brain. However, group averaged data is often used in this context and it remains unclear whether individual predictions of FC patterns using this approach can be made. Here, we assess the value of using individualized structural data for simulation of individual whole-brain FC. Methods. The Jansen and Rit neural mass model was employed, where masses were coupled using individual structural connectivity (SC) obtained from diffusion weighted imaging. Simulated FC was correlated to individual magnetoencephalography-derived empirical FC. FC was estimated using both phase-based (phase lag index (PLI), phase locking value (PLV)) and amplitude-based (amplitude envelope correlation (AEC)) metrics to analyze the goodness-of-fit of different metrics for individual predictions. Prediction of individual FC was compared against the prediction of group averaged FC. We further tested whether SC of a different participant could equally well predict a participants FC pattern. Results. The AEC provided a significantly better match between individually simulated and empirical FC than phase-based metrics. Simulations with individual SC provided higher correlations between simulated and empirical FC compared to using the group-averaged SC. However, using SC from other participants resulted in similar correlations between simulated and empirical FC compared to using participants own SC. Discussion. This work underlines the added value of FC simulations based on individual instead of group-averaged SC, and could aid in a better understanding of mechanisms underlying individual functional network trajectories in neurological disease.

                Contextual embeddings, derived from deep language models (DLMs), provide a continuous vectorial representation of language. This embedding space differs fundamentally from the symbolic representations posited by traditional psycholinguistics. Do language areas in the human brain, similar to DLMs, rely on a continuous embedding space to represent language? To test this hypothesis, we densely recorded the neural activity in the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG, also known as Broca area) of three participants using dense intracranial arrays while they listened to a 30-minute podcast. From these fine-grained spatiotemporal neural recordings, we derived for each patient a continuous vectorial representation for each word (i.e., a brain embedding). Using stringent, zero-shot mapping, we demonstrated that brain embeddings in the IFG and the DLM contextual embedding space have strikingly similar geometry. This shared geometry allows us to precisely triangulate the position of unseen words in both the brain embedding space (zero-shot encoding) and the DLM contextual embedding space (zero-shot decoding). The continuous brain embedding space provides an alternative computational framework for how natural language is represented in cortical language areas.

                Alzheimer Disease (AD) is one of the largest health crises in the world. There are, however, limited but expensive pharmaceutical interventions to treat AD and most of the treatment options are not for cure or prevention, but to slow down the progression of the disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tactile stimulation on AD-like symptoms and pathology in APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice, a mouse model of AD. The results show that tactile stimulation improves the AD-like symptoms on tests of cognition, motor, and anxiety-like behaviours and these improvements are associated with reduced AD pathology in APP mice.

                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can influence human perception and behavior, with recent evidence also suggesting its potential impact in clinical settings, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Behavioral and indirect physiological evidence indicates that phase-dependent constructive and destructive interference between the tACS electric field and ongoing brain oscillations may play an important role, but direct in-vivo validation was infeasible because stimulation artifacts impeded such assessment. Using stimulation artifact source separation (SASS), a real-time compatible artifact suppression approach, we overcame this limitation and provide direct evidence for millisecond-by-millisecond phase-dependent enhancement and suppression of ongoing brain oscillations during amplitude-modulated tACS (AM-tACS) across 29 healthy human volunteers. We found that AM-tACS enhanced and suppressed targeted brain oscillations by 11.7 +/- 5.14% and 10.1 +/- 4.07% respectively. Millisecond-precise modulation of oscillations predicted modulation of behavior (r = 0.65, p < 0.001). These results not only provide direct evidence for constructive and destructive interference as a key mechanism of AM-tACS but suggest superiority of phase-locked (closed-loop) AM-tACS over conventional (open-loop) AM-tACS to purposefully enhance or suppress brain oscillations.

                While clusterwise inference is a popular approach in neuroimaging that improves sensitivity, current methods do not account for explicit spatial autocorrelations because most use univariate test statistics to construct cluster-extent statistics. Failure to account for such dependencies could result in decreased reproducibility. To address methodological and computational challenges, we propose a new powerful and fast statistical method called CLEAN (Clusterwise inference LEveraging spatial Autocorrelations in Neuroimaging). CLEAN computes multivariate test statistics by modelling brain-wise spatial autocorrelations, constructs cluster-extent test statistics, and applies a refitting-free resampling approach to control false positives. We validate CLEAN using simulations and applications to the Human Connectome Project. This novel method provides a new direction in neuroimaging that paces with advances in high-resolution MRI data which contains a substantial amount of spatial autocorrelation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Separability of Human Motor Memories during Reaching Adaptation with Force Cues</a></h4>

              
                Judging by the breadth of our motor repertoire during daily activities, it is clear that acquiring multiple motor skills is a hallmark of the human motor system. However, for reaching movements the different planning conditions under which this is possible in laboratory settings have remained a challenging question. Considering the sensitivity of limb afferent feedback relative to externally applied forces, we hypothesised that independent cues delivered by means of background loads could support simultaneous formation of different motor memories of various velocity-dependent force fields. We demonstrate in a series of experiments that indeed healthy adults can form internal priors about opposite force fields, independently of the direction of the background force cue. However, when the cue and force field were only related by their magnitude, a separation was still observed but the associated mechanism was subject to interference. Finally, we highlight that this paradigm allows dissociating trial-by-trial acquisition of internal representations from within-trial feedback adaptation, as these two adaptation mechanisms are associated with different time scales that can be measured reliably.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-organizing Single-Rosette Brain Organoids from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells</a></h4>

              
                The field of brain organoid research is complicated by morphological variability with multiple neural rosette structures per organoid. We have developed a new human brain organoid technique that generates self-organizing, single-rosette spheroids (SOSRS) with reproducible size, cortical-like lamination, and cell diversity. Rather than patterning a 3-dimensional embryoid body, we initiate brain organoid formation from a 2-dimensional monolayer of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that is patterned with small molecules into neuroepithelium and differentiated to cells of the developing dorsal cerebral cortex. This approach recapitulates the 2D to 3D transition from neural plate to neural tube that occurs during neurodevelopment. The vast majority of monolayer fragments form spheres with a single central lumen and consistent growth rates. Over time, the SOSRS develop appropriately ordered lamination consistent with six cortical layers by immunocytochemistry and single cell RNA-sequencing. The reproducibility of this method has allowed us to demonstrate robust structural phenotypes arising from chemical teratogen exposure or when modeling a genetic neurodevelopmental epileptic disorder. This platform should advance studies of human cortical development, brain disorder mechanisms, and precision therapies.

	<p>Background: Device-aided therapies (DAT), such as continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI), levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion (LCIG), and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS), have markedly changed the treatment landscape of advanced Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (aPD). In some patients, it is necessary to switch or combine DATs for various reasons. The aim of this retrospective study was to explore the frequency and reasons for switching between or combining DATs in two movement disorders centres in Slovenia and Israel. Methods: We collected and analysed demographic and clinical data from aPD patients who switched between or combined DATs. Motor and non-motor reasons, adverse events for switching/combining, and their frequency were examined, as was the effect of DAT using the Global Improvement subscale of the Clinical Global Impression Scale, Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale part III, Mini Mental State Examination, and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire 39. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used to analyse the data. Results: Of 505 aPD patients treated with DATs at both centres between January 2009 and June 2021, we identified in a total of 30 patients (6%) who either switched DAT (n = 24: 7 LCIG-to-STN&amp;amp;minus;DBS, 1 LCIG-to-CSAI, 5 CSAI-to STN&amp;amp;minus;DBS, 8 CSAI-to-LCIG, 1 STN&amp;amp;minus;DBS-to-LCIG, 1 LCIG-to-CSAI-to-STN&amp;amp;minus;DBS, and 1 STN&amp;amp;minus;DBS-to-CSAI-to-LCIG) or combined DATs (n = 6:5 STN&amp;amp;minus;DBS+LCIG and 1 STN&amp;amp;minus;DBS+CSAI-to-STN&amp;amp;minus;DBS+LCIG). In most of these patients, an inadequate control of motor symptoms was the main reason for switching or combining DATs, but non-motor reasons (related to the disease and/or DAT) were also identified. Conclusions: Switching between and combining DATs is uncommon, but in some patients brings substantial clinical improvement and should be considered in those who have either inadequate symptom control on DAT treatment or have developed DAT-related complications.</p>

	<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental disorder characterized by repetitive, unwanted thoughts and behavior due to abnormal neuronal corticostriatal-thalamocortical pathway and other neurochemical changes. Purmorphamine is a smoothened-sonic-hedgehog agonist that has a protective effect against many neurological diseases due to its role in maintaining functional connectivity during CNS development and its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. As part of our current research, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of PUR against behavioral and neurochemical changes in 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder in rats. Additionally, the effect of PUR was compared with the standard drug for OCD, i.e., fluvoxamine. The intra-dorsal raphe-nucleus injection of 8-OH-DPAT in rats for seven days significantly showed OCD-like repetitive and compulsive behavior along with increased oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, as well as neurotransmitter imbalance. These alterations were dose-dependently attenuated by long-term purmorphamine treatment at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg i.p. In this study, we assessed the level of various neurochemical parameters in different biological samples, including brain homogenate, blood plasma, and CSF, to check the drug&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect centrally and peripherally. These effects were comparable to the standard oral treatment withfluvoxamine at 10 mg/kg. However, when fluvoxamine was given in combination with purmorphamine, there was a more significant restoration of these alterations than the individualtreatmentswithfluvoxamine and purmorphamine. All the above findings demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect of purmorphamine in OCD can be strong evidence for developing a new therapeutic target for treating and managing OCD.</p>

	<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak can be spontaneous or nonspontaneous. The management options include conservative treatments, blood patch, and surgical repairs. We compared clinical symptoms, image findings, management options, hospitalization, and relapse rates among different causes of CSF leaks. Eighty-one patients were recruited: 20 with spontaneous and 61 with nonspontaneous CSF leaks. Nonspontaneous causes included lumbar puncture, surgery, and trauma. Surgery sites comprised sphenoid, spine, skull base, and calvaria. Spontaneous CSF leak came from the sphenoid or spine. Age, gender, body mass index, initial symptoms, hospitalization, treatment courses, and recurrence rates showed no difference between the groups. The spontaneous group had higher CSF accumulations on their MRIs. MRI pachymeninge enhancement showed the highest sensitivity (78.6%) for intracranial hypotension. Meningitis occurred in 1/3 of sphenoid, skull base, and calvarian surgeries. Earlier reoperation was correlated with shorter hospitalization (r = 0.651), but the recurrence rates were similar. Longer intervals between surgery and CSF leak encouraged reoperation. Among the spontaneous spine and lumbar puncture-related CSF leaks, 57.1% of them responded to 4 days of conservative treatment. Among the trauma-related CSF leaks, 90.9% of them required surgical repair. The demographic data and symptoms were similar in various groups of CSF leak. The symptom onset durations and treatment strategies were different. However, the recurrence rates were similar.</p>

	<p>Binaural beat (BB) stimulation, which has two different frequencies for each ear, is reportedly effective in reducing anxiety and controlling mood. This study aimed to evaluate the brain wave entrainment effect of binaural beats and to propose an effective and safe supplementary therapy for relieving the symptoms of insomnia. Subjects between 20 and 59 years of age with subclinical symptoms of insomnia were recruited from the community. Quantitative electroencephalography was measured twice, before and two weeks after the BB intervention. Participants used the apparatus with or without 6 Hz BB for 30 min before going to bed for two weeks. When music with BB was played, the relative theta power increased (occipital, p = 0.009). After two weeks of intervention with music, the theta power increased when listening to music with BB (parietal, p = 0.009). After listening to music with BB for two weeks, the decrease in the beta power was more noticeable than after using music-only devices when participants listened to music in the laboratory (occipital, p = 0.035). When BB were played, the entrapment of the theta wave appeared. Therefore, exposure to music with BB is likely to reduce the hyper-arousal state and contribute to sleep induction.</p>

	<p>It has been widely assumed that in speech perception it is imperative to first detect a set of distinctive properties or features and then use them to recognize phonetic units like consonants, vowels, and tones. Those features can be auditory cues or articulatory gestures, or a combination of both. There have been no clear demonstrations of how exactly such a two-phase process would work in the perception of continuous speech, however. Here we used computational modelling to explore whether it is possible to recognize phonetic categories from syllable-sized continuous acoustic signals of connected speech without intermediate featural representations. We used Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Self-organizing Map (SOM) to simulate tone perception in Mandarin, by either directly processing f0 trajectories, or extracting various tonal features. The results show that direct tone recognition not only yields better performance than any of the feature extraction schemes, but also requires less computational power. These results suggest that prior extraction of features is unlikely the operational mechanism of speech perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Properties and hemispheric differences of theta oscillations in the human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The left and right primate hippocampi (LH and RH) are thought to support distinct functions, but little is known about differences between the hemispheres at the neuronal level. We recorded single-neuron and local field potentials from the human hippocampus in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes. We detected theta-frequency bouts of oscillatory activity while patients performed a visual recognition memory task. Theta appeared in bouts of 3.16‚Äâcycles, with sawtooth-shaped oscillations that had a prolonged downswing period. Outside the seizure onset zone, the average frequency of theta bouts was higher in the RH compared to the LH (6.0 vs. 5.3‚ÄâHz). LH theta bouts had lower amplitudes and a higher prevalence compared to the RH (26% vs. 21% of total time). Additionally, the RH contained a population of thin spiking visually tuned neurons that were not present in the LH. These data show that human theta appears in short oscillatory bouts whose properties vary between hemispheres, thereby revealing neurophysiological properties of the hippocampus that differ between the hemispheres.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a feasibility study of longitudinal surveys to assess the impact of policies on tobacco use among school-going adolescents in South Asia [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Smokeless tobacco (ST) use is common among youth in South Asia where 85% of the world‚Äôs 300 million ST users live and use the most lethal ST forms. Little is known about the impact of tobacco control policies on the youth ST uptake in those countries. We planned to conduct longitudinal surveys among school going adolescents to evaluate existing tobacco control policies on tobacco uptake and use, and a feasibility study for that prospective, observational cohort study. Study objectives: (1) To demonstrate the feasibility of selection, recruitment and retention of schools and of study participants; (2) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the study procedure and study tool (questionnaire); (3) To evaluate if the questionnaire can assess tobacco uptake and use, and their potential predictors. Methods and analysis: The feasibility study will be conducted in two administrative areas within each of three South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. We will use both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. Eight eligible schools will be randomly selected within purposively selected sub-districts from each country. We plan to conduct one baseline and one follow up survey among students of grade 6-8, one year apart. At each time point, data on tobacco uptake and potential predictors will be collected from students via self-administered questionnaires that were designed for the longitudinal study. The qualitative component will be embedded into the study with each round of data collection to assess the acceptability of the study instrument (questionnaire) and data collection methods, via focus group discussions with students and semi-structured interviews with schoolteachers. Recruitment and retention rates, completeness of the questionnaires, frequencies and associations of tobacco use and explanatory variables will be reported. Data gathered from the focus group and interviews will be analysed using the framework approach.

                Introduction: Indonesia has the second highest number of Tuberculosis (TB) in the world and tuberculosis still pose as a global health priority problem. For the diagnostics, microscopy is still one of important modalities in TB diagnosis especially in peripheral areas for screening, case-finding, and treatment evaluation. The use of microscopy is limited to operator visual burden and specimen load. This study aims to modify the use of the microscope by using everyday item to increase microscope operator workload. Method: This is an analytic study of the use of colored cellophane in microscopic examination of sputum smear from 24 pulmonary TB patients from Jakarta and Surabaya. The sputum samples were confirmed positive by standardized ZN-AFB microscopy and/or Xpert MTB/RIF. Each sputum were made into two slides, for each slide, 10 oil immersion fields were captured using Optilab microscope camera mounted on microscope. A total of 480 data pairs were analysed by comparing color characteristic of acid-fast bacilli pixels and its adjacent background pixels and by counting Acid fast Bacilli for each observation field. IUATLD scale were also observed by 3 operators. Results: Contrast ratio for each AFB and its adjacent pixels were significantly higher in groups using cellophane filter than without using filter (p = 0.001). AFB identification per image acquired using filter were not significantly higher (p=0.815). Conclusion: Colored cellophane increases contrast ratio and eases microscopic examination, thus increases sputum smear microscopic observation capability. Also it might increase identification capability with digital image processing.

                Thermal injuries in young children involving the buttocks, perineum, and lower limbs raise suspicion of child abuse. Determining the manner of death and ruling out homicide in a fatal case of scalding remains a challenge for forensic practitioners. One such issue is reported in the present case report, where a medicolegal evaluation of a fatal scald in a two-year-old girl child is discussed. Young children sustaining serious injuries from scalds is a grave social concern. Such young lives need to be protected from scald injuries whether accidental or purposeful. Differences in injury patterns on the basis of their distribution and their characteristics are important to determine manner of death in such cases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The ER membrane complex (EMC) can functionally replace the Oxa1 insertase in mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by B√ºsra G√ºng√∂r, Tamara Flohr, Sriram G. Garg, Johannes M. Herrmann</p>

Two multisubunit protein complexes for membrane protein insertion were recently identified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER): the guided entry of tail anchor proteins (GET) complex and ER membrane complex (EMC). The structures of both of their hydrophobic core subunits, which are required for the insertion reaction, revealed an overall similarity to the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family members found in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. This suggests that these membrane insertion machineries all share a common ancestry. To test whether these ER proteins can functionally replace Oxa1 in yeast mitochondria, we generated strains that express mitochondria-targeted Get2‚ÄìGet1 and Emc6‚ÄìEmc3 fusion proteins in Oxa1 deletion mutants. Interestingly, the Emc6‚ÄìEmc3 fusion was able to complement an <i>Œîoxa1</i> mutant and restored its respiratory competence. The Emc6‚ÄìEmc3 fusion promoted the insertion of the mitochondrially encoded protein Cox2, as well as of nuclear encoded inner membrane proteins, although was not able to facilitate the assembly of the Atp9 ring. Our observations indicate that protein insertion into the ER is functionally conserved to the insertion mechanism in bacteria and mitochondria and adheres to similar topological principles.

                Background: Syndemics or synergies of cooccurring epidemics are widely studied across health and social sciences in recent years. Methods: We conducted a meta-knowledge analysis of articles published between 2001 to 2020 in this growing field of academic scholarship. Results: We found a total of 830 articles authored by 3025 authors, mostly from high-income countries. Publications on syndemics are gradually increasing since 2003, with rapid development in 2013. Each article was cited more than 15 times on average, and most (n = 604) articles were original studies. Syndemics research focused on several areas, including HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health, gender minority stressors, racism, violence, chronic physical and mental disorders, food insecurity, social determinants of health, and coronavirus disease 2019. Moreover, biopsychosocial interactions between multiple health problems were studied across medical, anthropological, public health, and other disciplines of science. Conclusions: The limited yet rapidly evolving literature on syndemics informs transdisciplinary interests to understand complex coexisting health challenges in the context of systematic exclusion and structural violence in vulnerable populations. The findings also suggest applications of syndemic theory to evaluate clinical and public health problems, examine the socioecological dynamics of factors influencing health and wellbeing, and use the insights to alleviate health inequities in the intersections of synergistic epidemics and persistent contextual challenges for population health.

                Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into nerve cells with an induction from chemical compounds in medium culture. Chromolaena odorata contains active compounds, such as alkaloids and flavonoids, that can initiate the transformation of MSCs into nerve cells. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of methanol extracted C. odorata leaf to induce the differentiation of bone marrow MSCs into nerve cells. Methods: A serial concentration of C. odorata leaf extract (0.7‚Äì1.0 mg/mL) with two replications was used. The parameters measured were the number of differentiated MSCs into nerve cells (statistically analyzed using ANOVA) and cell confirmation using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The results showed that the C. odorata extract had a significant effect on the number MSCs differentiating into nerve cells (p < 0.05) on the doses of 0.8 mg/ml with 22.6%. Molecular assay with RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the nerve cell gene in all of the samples. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study showed the potential application of C. odorata leaf extract in stem cell therapy for patients experiencing neurodegeneration by inducing the differentiation of MSCs into nerve cells.

                This review explores innovative and sustainable strategies for conservation and use of village or indigenous chickens (IC) (Gallus domesticus) in Zambia and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Small scale farmers (SSF) have kept IC for hundreds of years to meet their households‚Äô nutritional needs, incomes, social-cultural and religious uses among others. The commitment exhibited by SSF in keeping IC has made them the major custodians of essential animal genetic resources in low-income regions. Between 1991 and 2012, private breeders invested over US$95 million in Zambia‚Äôs commercial poultry sector resulting in over 100% increase in annual production of day-old chicks to 65 million. However, high production cost and low market access hindered the participation of SSF hence their continued dependence on IC. Unfortunately, the future of IC genetic resources is threatened due to the rapid loss and erosion of IC breeds. In the 2015 biodiversity status report, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, an international body of the United Nation highlighted that over 3.5% of IC breeds were extinct, nearly 33% were at high risk and over 67% were of unknown status. Poultry diseases, lack of sustainable conservation strategies and poor use among others have significantly contributed to these losses. For example, in 2012, 60% of IC were diseased in parts of SSA including Zambia. If these challenges are not mitigated, the loss of IC genetic resources and the adverse impact on rural communities are inevitable. Further, future research and breeding programs on commercial chickens may also be limited as a result of erosion of IC genetic resources. Therefore, this paper reviews and contributes to previous studies that demonstrated how researcher-community-stakeholder engagements potentially enhanced sustainability and the adoption of innovative ideas including the potential to increase conservation and sustainable use of local chicken biodiversity in Zambia and parts of SSA.

                Unlike previous pandemics, the COVID-19 pandemic is unique in that, for the first time, social isolation is not isolation but a migration imperative. World 4.0, the digital society, has endowed people with a capacity for interconnectedness through using social networks for entertainment. In particular, stickers and memes, as founding grammars of discourses, narratives, ways of feeling, and imaginaries, can demonstrate, from an informational sociobiological approach, the phenomenon of memes in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article highlights the meme as a shock of laughter for the mind and body, becoming the phenomenon that has prevailed and strengthened throughout the pandemic. It proposes some reflections on the role of memes as a shock of personal enjoyment and reflection unveiling the contemporary social context. We present four moments of the memes during the pandemic, in the first the memes reflect the new emerging condition with subjectivities such as mockery, reduction, and denial. The second moment shows the unfathomable encounter between the person and the pandemic, where the panic in the meme turns into humour. The third moment shows the terror beginning to unravel. Here, the meme operates as a shocking power of laughter in epicconscious activity. In the fourth moment, the memes reflect the establishment of a new normal. The meme is already a vehicle for unexpected situations as a consequence of the pandemic phenomenon.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to describe and compare disease course and prognosis of early (ie, disease onset before age 11‚Äâyears) and late (ie, disease onset after age 11‚Äâyears) onset pediatric multiple sclerosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospectively collected clinical information from Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register of 1993 pediatric multiple sclerosis patients, of whom 172 had early onset, was analyzed. Cox models adjusted for sex, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and disease-modifying treatments and stratified for diagnostic criteria adopted (Poser vs McDonald) were used to assess the risk of reaching irreversible Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 3, 4, and 6, and conversion to secondary progressive phenotype in early versus late onset pediatric patients. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A greater proportion of males, isolated brainstem involvement, and longer time interval between first and second clinical episode were observed in early versus late onset pediatric patients. Compared to late onset, early onset pediatric patients took longer from disease onset to convert to secondary progressive phenotype and to reach all disability milestones. Recovery from first demyelinating event, time to first relapse, annualized relapse rate during the first 3‚Äâyears of disease, and disease-modifying treatment exposure were independent predictors for long-term disability in early onset pediatric patients. In late onset pediatric patients, isolated optic neuritis, multifocal symptoms, and progressive course at disease onset were additional predictors for long-term disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings point toward the existence of a different natural history in early versus late onset pediatric multiple sclerosis patients. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Transcription is a complex, dynamic process. Using live single-cell measurements, Patange et¬†al. show, in a recent issue of Cell Reports, that elevated levels of the transcription factor MYC enhance target gene RNA production by increasing the duration but not frequency of transcriptional bursts.
