<div class="section" id="ana25158-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Although gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is generally regarded as an alternative biomarker for alcohol consumption, its independent role in vascular diseases emerged recently. However, its role in stroke remains unknown. The aim of this study is to clarify the impact of GGT on stroke in a large-sized, national, standardized population cohort in Korea.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25158-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provides full-coverage health insurance service for all citizens. Using data from the NHIS, the NHIS–National Sample Cohort was designed by randomly selecting 2% of Koreans, carefully considering demographic characteristics. We analyzed eligible individuals from this standardized cohort. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the study investigating the relationship between GGT and stroke.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25158-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Among the 456,100 eligible participants, 7,459 patients (1.64%) developed stroke as follows: 5,789 ischemic strokes, 1,046 intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), and 624 subarachnoid hemorrhages. GGT was independently correlated with increased risk of stroke after adjustment for alcohol consumption and stroke risk factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–1.51). The risks of both ischemic stroke (HR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.32–1.58) and ICH (HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.18–1.80) were significantly elevated with increasing GGT. Despite some effect modifications by sex, age, and alcohol, the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke in association with GGT remained significant in all subgroups.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25153-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>To assess video-polysomnographic (vPSG) criteria and their cutoff values for the diagnosis of disorders of arousal (DOAs; sleepwalking, sleep terror).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25153-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>One hundred sixty adult patients with DOAs and 50 sex- and age-matched healthy participants underwent a clinical evaluation and vPSG assessment to quantify slow wave sleep (SWS) interruptions (SWS fragmentation index, slow/mixed and fast arousal ratios, and indexes per hour) and the associated behaviors. First, a case–control analysis was performed in 100 patients and the 50 controls to define the optimal cutoff values using receiver operating characteristic curves. Their sensitivity was then assessed in the other 60 patients with DOAs.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25153-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>The SWS fragmentation index and the mixed, slow, and slow/mixed arousal indexes and ratios were higher in patients with DOAs than controls. The highest area under the curve (AUC) values were obtained for the SWS fragmentation and slow/mixed arousal indexes (AUC = 0.88 and 0.90, respectively). The SWS fragmentation index cutoff value of 6.8/h reached a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 82%. The slow/mixed arousal index had a sensitivity of 94% for the 2.5/h cutoff, and 100% specificity for 6/h. Both parameters showed good interrater agreement, and their sensitivities were confirmed in the second group of patients. Combining electroencephalographic parameters and video-based behavioral analyses increased the correct classification rate up to 91.3%.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25153-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Frequent slow/mixed arousals in SWS and complex behaviors during vPSG are strongly associated with DOAs, and could be promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of non–rapid eye movement parasomnias.

<div class="section" id="ana25160-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>CD16<sup>+</sup>/CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages (MΦs) and microglia accumulate in the brains of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis (HIVE), a neuropathological correlate of the most severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, HIV-associated dementia. Recently, we found that some parenchymal microglia in brain of HIV<sup>+</sup> subjects without encephalitis (HIV/noE) but with varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment express CD16 and CD163, even in the absence of detectable virus production. To further our understanding of microglial activation in HIV, we investigated expression of specific genes by profiling parenchymal microglia from archival brain tissue of patients with HIVE and HIV/noE, and HIV<sup>−</sup> controls.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25160-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Single-population microarray analyses were performed on ∼2,500 laser capture microdissected CD163<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>, or CD68<sup>+</sup> MΦs/microglia per case, using terminal continuation RNA amplification and a custom-designed array platform.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25160-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Several classes of microglial transcripts in HIVE and HIV/noE were altered, relative to HIV<sup>−</sup> subjects, including factors related to cell stress, immune activation, and apoptosis. Additionally, several neurotrophic factors were reduced in HIV infection, suggesting an additional mechanism of neuropathogenesis. The majority of transcripts altered in HIVE displayed intermediate changes in HIV/noE.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25160-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Our results support the notion that microglia contribute to the maintenance of brain homeostasis and their potential loss of function in the context of chronic inflammation contributes to neuropathogenesis. Furthermore, they indicate the utility of profiling MΦs/microglia to increase our understanding of microglia function, as well as to ascertain alterations in specific pathways, genes, and potentially, encoded proteins that may be amenable to targeted treatment modalities in diseases affecting the brain.

<div class="section" id="ana25157-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>To assess the association between incident Parkinson disease (PD) and subsequent incident epileptic seizures.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25157-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a nested case–control analysis using data from the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We identified patients aged ≥40 years with an incident diagnosis of PD between 1995 and 2016 and a matched comparison group of PD-free individuals. We calculated crude incidence rates (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of epileptic seizures in PD patients and the PD-free comparison group, and corresponding crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs). In the nested case–control analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (adj. ORs) of incident PD among cases with incident epileptic seizures and seizure-free controls overall and stratified by various seizure-provoking comorbidities.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25157-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Among 23,086 incident PD patients and 92,343 PD-free individuals, we identified 898 patients with incident epileptic seizures. The crude IR of epileptic seizures in PD patients was 266.7/100,000 person-years (95% CI = 235.6–297.7), and in PD-free individuals it was 112.4/100,000 person-years (95% CI = 103.5–121.3; IRR = 2.37, 95% CI = 2.06–2.73). The adj. OR of epileptic seizures was 1.68 (95% CI = 1.43–1.98) in PD patients compared with PD-free individuals. PD patients with comorbid brain disorders (adj. OR = 12.36, 95% CI = 8.74–17.48) or with &gt; 1 seizure-provoking comorbidity (adj. OR = 13.24, 95% CI = 10.15-17.25) were at the highest risk of epileptic seizures compared with PD-free individuals with no seizure-provoking comorbidities.</p></div></div>

Visual motion detection in sighted animals is essential to guide behavioral actions ensuring their survival. In Drosophila, motion direction is first detected by T4/T5 neurons. Their axons innervate four lobula plate layers tuned to the four cardinal motion directions. How T4/T5 neurons with layer-specific representation of motion-direction preferences are specified during development is unknown. We show that diffusible Wingless (Wg) between adjacent neuroepithelia induces its own expression to form secondary signaling centers. These activate decapentaplegic (dpp) in apposing tertiary domains dedicated to producing layer 3/4-specific T4/T5 neurons. In the absence of Dpp signaling, T4/T5 neurons adopt the default layer 1/2 fate. Dpp signaling induces the expression of the T-box transcription factor Optomotor-blind (Omb), serving as a relay to postmitotic neurons. Omb-mediated repression of Dachshund transforms layer 1/2- into layer 3/4-specific neurons. Hence, spatio-temporal relay mechanisms, bridging the distances between neuroepithelial domains and their postmitotic progeny, implement T4/T5 neuron layer-specificity.

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu<br />  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini<br /> The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng<br /> Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Jee-Yeon   Hwang, R Suzanne   Zukin<br /> The restrictive element-1 silencing transcription factor)/NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) is a transcriptional repressor which acts via epigenetic remodeling to silence target genes. Emerging evidence indicates that REST is a master transcriptional regulator of neuron-specific genes not only in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, but also in differentiated neurons during the critical period in postnatal brain development, where it plays a role in fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and in normal aging, where it promotes neuroprotection by repressing genes involved in oxidative stress and β-amyloid toxicity. This review focuses on recent findings that dysregulation of REST and REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling provide a central mechanism critical to the progressive neurodegeneration associated with neurologic disorders and diseases including global ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Steffen BE   Wolff, Bence P   Ölveczky<br /> The development of increasingly sophisticated methods for recording and manipulating neural activity is revolutionizing neuroscience. By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Francesco   Petrelli, Paola   Bezzi<br /> Astrocytes, the largest glial population in human and murine brains, are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity. During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Le   Xiao, Peter   Scheiffele<br /> The view of cerebellar functions has been extended from controlling sensorimotor processes to processing ‘contextual’ information and generating predictions for a diverse range of behaviors. These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Carla EM   Golden, Joseph D   Buxbaum, Silvia   De Rubeis<br /> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are caused by a wide range of genetic mutations, a significant fraction of which reside in genes important for synaptic function. Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Yishi   Jin, Yingchuan B   Qi<br /> The ability of neurons to modify or remodel their synaptic connectivity is critical for the function of neural circuitry throughout the life of an animal. Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell<br /> When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. <br /><br />

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Elena   Marcello, Monica   Di Luca, Fabrizio   Gardoni<br /> In the last decade several synaptonuclear protein messengers including Jacob, CRTC1, AIDA-1, ProSaP2/Shank3 and RNF10 have been identified and characterized as key players for modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Mümine   Şentürk, Hugo J   Bellen<br />  Drosophila melanogaster is a genetic model organism that has contributed to the discovery of numerous genes whose human homologues are associated with diseases. The development of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate its genome accelerates the discovery of the genetic basis of undiagnosed human diseases and the elucidation of molecular pathogenic events of known and novel diseases. Here, we discuss various approaches used in flies to assess the function of the fly homologues of disease-associated genes. We highlight how systematic and combinatorial approaches based on recently established methods provide us with integrated tool sets that can be applied to the study of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. <br /><br />

                <h4><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25152">A mendelian form of neural tube defect caused by a de novo null variant in SMARCC1 in an identical twin</a></h4>

<div class="para"><p>Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans and yet their molecular etiology remains poorly understood. NTDs are believed to result from the complex interaction of environmental factors with a multitude of genetic risk factors in a classical multifactorial disease model. Mendelian forms of NTDs in which single variants are sufficient to cause the disease are extremely rare. We report a monozygotic twin with severe NTDs (occipital encephalocele and myelomeningocele) and a shared de novo, likely truncating, variant in <em>SMARCC1</em>. RTPCR analysis suggests the potential null nature of the variant attributed to nonsense-mediated decay. <em>SMARCC1</em> is extremely constrained in humans and encodes a highly conserved core chromatin remodeler, BAF155. Mice that are heterozygous for a null allele or homozygous for a hypomorphic allele develop severe NTDs in the form of exencephaly. This is the first report of <em>SMARCC1</em> mutation in humans, and it shows a critical and conserved requirement for intact BAF chromatin remodeling complex in neurulation.

<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>To assess the diagnostic value of extended sleep duration on a controlled 32-hour bed rest protocol in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>One hundred sixteen patients with high suspicion of IH (37 clear-cut IH according to multiple sleep latency test criteria and 79 probable IH), 32 with hypersomnolence associated with a comorbid disorder (non-IH), and 21 controls underwent polysomnography, modified sleep latency tests, and a 32-hour bed rest protocol. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to find optimal total sleep time (TST) cutoff values on various periods that discriminate patients from controls.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>TST was longer in patients with clear-cut IH than other groups (probable IH, non-IH, and controls) and in patients with probable IH than non-IH and controls. The TST cutoff best discriminating clear-cut IH and controls was 19 hours for the 32-hour recording (sensitivity = 91.9%, specificity = 85.7%) and 12 hours (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24 hours. The 19-hour cutoff displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between IH and non-IH patients. Patients with IH above the 19-hour cutoff were overweight, had more sleep inertia, and had higher TST on all periods compared to patients below 19 hours, whereas no differences were found for the 12-hour cutoff. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and TST during 32-hour recording in IH patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cutoff best discriminating patients from controls was 19 hours over 32 hours, allowing a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes. Sleepier patients on the multiple sleep latency test were also the more severe in terms of extended sleep. Ann Neurol 2018.</p></div></div>

<p>Background and Purpose: This study was designed to compare the effects of
high-intensity interval training (HIT) and moderate-intensity continuous
training (MOD) on functional recovery and cerebral plasticity during the first
2 weeks following cerebral ischemia. Methods: Rats were randomized as follows:
Control (n=15), SHAM (n=9), MCAO (n=13), MCAO-D1 (n=7), MOD (n=13) and HIT
(n=13). Incremental tests were performed at day 1 (D1) and 14 (D14) to identify
the running speed associated with the lactate threshold (SLT) and the maximal
speed (Smax). Functional tests were performed at D1, D7 and D14. Microglia
form, cytokines, p75NTR, KCC2 and NKCC1 expression were made at D15.
Results-HIT was more effective to improve the endurance performance than MOD
and induced a fast recovery of the impaired forelimb grip force. The Iba-1
positive cells with amoeboid form and the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine
expression were lower in HIT group, mainly in the ipsilesional hemisphere. A
p75NTR overexpression is observed on the ipsilesional side together with a
restored NKCC1/KCC2 ratio on the contralesional side. Conclusions-Low-volume
HIT based on lactate threshold appears to be more effective after cerebral
ischemia than work-matched MOD to improve aerobic fitness, grip strength and
might promote cerebral plasticity.

<p>Drawing upon a body of research on the evolution of creativity, this paper
proposes a theory of how, when, and why the forward-thinking story-telling
abilities of humans evolved, culminating in the visionary abilities of science
fiction writers. The ability to recursively chain thoughts together evolved
approximately two million years ago. Language abilities, and the ability to
shift between different modes of thought, evolved approximately 100,000 years
ago. Science fiction dates to at least the second Century AD. It is suggested
that well before this time, but after 100,000 years ago, and concurrent with
the evolution of a division of labour between creators and imitators there
arose a division of labour between past, present, and future thinkers.
Agent-based model research suggests there are social benefits to the evolution
of individual differences in creativity such that there is a balance between
novelty-generating creators and continuity-perpetuating imitators. A balance
between individuals focused on the past, present, and future would be expected
to yield similar adaptive benefits.

<p>Despite the decades of efforts, the choice of EEG reference is still a
debated fundamental issue. Non-neutral reference can inevitably inject the
uncontrolled temporal biases into all EEG recordings, which may influence the
spatiotemporal analysis of brain activity. A method, termed microstates,
identifying spatiotemporal EEG features as the quasi-stable topography states
in milliseconds, suggests its potential as biomarkers of neurophysiological
disease. As reference electrode standardization technique (REST) could
reconstruct an infinity reference approximately, it is a question whether REST
or the other references will be more reliable than average reference (AR) for
the microstates analysis. In this study, we design the microstate-based EEG
forward model, and apply different references for microstates analysis. The
spatial similarity between the generated and assumed cluster maps is mainly
investigated. Furthermore, the real EEG data by the parametric bootstrap method
is used to validate the performance of the references. Finally, we find that
REST is robust to recover more similar cluster maps to the assumption than AR
in the simulation, and the cluster maps between REST and AR on the real EEG
data are quite different. This study may indicate that REST contributes to
identifying more objective microstates features than AR.

<p>The insect olfactory system, which includes the antennal lobe (AL), mushroom
body (MB), and ancillary structures, is a relatively simple neural system
capable of learning. Its structural features, which are widespread in
biological neural systems, process olfactory stimuli through a cascade of
networks where large dimension shifts occur from stage to stage and where
sparsity and randomness play a critical role in coding. Learning is partly
enabled by a neuromodulatory reward mechanism of octopamine stimulation of the
AL, whose increased activity induces rewiring of the MB through Hebbian
plasticity. Enforced sparsity in the MB focuses Hebbian growth on neurons that
are the most important for the representation of the learned odor. Based upon
current biophysical knowledge, we have constructed an end-to-end computational
model of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory system which includes the interaction
of the AL and MB under octopamine stimulation. Our model is able to robustly
learn new odors, and our simulations of integrate-and-fire neurons match the
statistical features of in-vivo firing rate data. From a biological
perspective, the model provides a valuable tool for examining the role of
neuromodulators, like octopamine, in learning, and gives insight into critical
interactions between sparsity, Hebbian growth, and stimulation during learning.
Our simulations also inform predictions about structural details of the
olfactory system that are not currently well-characterized. From a machine
learning perspective, the model yields bio-inspired mechanisms that are
potentially useful in constructing neural nets for rapid learning from very few
samples. These mechanisms include high-noise layers, sparse layers as noise
filters, and a biologically-plausible optimization method to train the network
based on octopamine stimulation, sparse layers, and Hebbian growth.

Current myoelectric prostheses allow upper-limb amputees to regain voluntary motor control of their artificial limb by exploiting residual muscle function in the forearm. However, the over-reliance on visual cues resulting from a lack of sensory feedback is a common complaint. Recently, several groups have provided tactile feedback in upper-limb amputees by using implanted electrodes, surface nerve stimulation or sensory substitution. These approaches have led to improved function and prosthesis embodiment. Nevertheless, the provided information remains limited to a subset of the rich sensory cues available to healthy individuals. More specifically, proprioception, the sense of limb position and movement, is predominantly absent from current systems. Here we show that sensory substitution based on intraneural stimulation can deliver position feedback in real-time and in conjunction with somatotopic tactile feedback. This approach allowed two trans-radial amputees to regain high and close-to-natural remapped proprioceptive acuity, with a median joint angle reproduction accuracy of 9.1{degrees} and a median threshold to detection of passive movements of 9.5{degrees}, which was compatible with results obtained in healthy subjects. The simultaneous delivery of position information and somatotopic tactile feedback allowed both amputees to discriminate object size and compliance with high levels of accuracy (75.5%). These results demonstrate that touch information delivered via somatotopic neural stimulation and position information delivered via sensory substitution can be exploited simultaneously and efficiently by trans-radial amputees. This study paves the way towards more sophisticated bidirectional bionic limbs conveying rich, multimodal sensations.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262725v1?rss=1">Haploinsufficiency of autism candidate gene NUAK1 impairs cortical development and behavior</a></h4>

Recently, numerous rare de novo mutations have been identified in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, despite the predicted loss-of-function nature of some of these de novo mutations, the affected individuals are heterozygous carriers, which would suggest that most of these candidate genes are haploinsufficient and/or that these mutations lead to expression of dominant-negative forms of the protein. Here, we tested this hypothesis with the gene Nuak1, recently identified as a candidate ASD gene and that we previously identified for its role in the development of cortical connectivity. We report that Nuak1 is happloinsufficient in mice in regard to its function in cortical axon branching in vitro and in vivo. Nuak1+/- mice show a combination of abnormal behavioral traits ranging from defective memory consolidation in a spatial learning task, defects in social novelty (but not social preference) and abnormal sensorimotor gating and prepulse inhibition of the startle response. Overall, our results demonstrate that Nuak1 haploinsufficiency leads to defects in the development of cortical connectivity and a complex array of behavorial deficits compatible with ASD, intellectual disability and schizophrenia.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262626v1?rss=1">Network dimensionality underlies flexible representation of cognitive information</a></h4>

The functional networks in human cortex that most flexibly represent cognitive information are hubs with widespread connectivity throughout the brain. Going beyond simple hub measures, we hypothesized that the dimensionality of each network's global connectivity pattern (its global dimensionality) underlies its ability to produce highly diverse task activation patterns (its representational flexibility). Supporting our hypothesis, we report that the global dimensionality estimated during resting state correlates with the representational flexibility estimated across a variety of cognitive tasks. Demonstrating the robustness of this relationship, each network's global connectivity pattern could be used to predict its representational flexibility. Additionally, we found that the frontoparietal cognitive control network had the highest dimensionality and flexibility, and that individuals with higher network dimensionality had higher representational flexibility. Together, these findings suggest that a network's global dimensionality contributes to its ability to represent diverse cognitive information, implicating dimensionality as a network mechanism underlying flexible cognitive representation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262576v1?rss=1">Distinct Neural Signatures of Reward and Sensory Prediction Error in Motor Learning</a></h4>

Two distinct processes contribute to changes in motor commands during reach adaptation: reward based learning and sensory error based learning. In sensory error based learning, the mapping between sensory targets and motor commands is recalibrated according to error feedback. In reward based learning, motor commands are associated with subjective value, such that successful actions are reinforced. We recorded EEG from humans of either sex to identify and dissociate the neural correlates of reward prediction error (RPE) and sensory prediction error (SPE) during learning tasks designed to isolate each response. We designed a visuomotor rotation task to isolate sensory error based learning in response to SPE, which was induced by altered visuospatial feedback of hand position. In a reward learning task, we isolated learning in response to RPE, which was induced by binary reward feedback. We found that a fronto-central event related potential called the feedback related negativity occurred specifically in response to RPE during reward based learning, while a more posterior component called the P300 was associated with SPE during a visuomotor rotation task. These findings reveal a dissociation between well characterized EEG signatures of error processing in two distinct motor learning processes.

Multiple concussions, particularly in contact sports, have been associated with cognitive deficits, psychiatric impairment and neurodegenerative diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We used volumetric and deformation-based morphometric analyses to test the hypothesis that repeated concussions may be associated with smaller regional brain volumes, poorer cognitive performance and behavioural symptoms among former professional football players compared to healthy controls. This study included fifty-three retired Canadian Football League players, 25 age- and education-matched healthy controls, and controls from the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience database for validation. Volumetric analyses revealed greater hippocampal atrophy than expected for age in former athletes with multiple concussions than controls and smaller left hippocampal volume was associated with poorer verbal memory performance. Deformation-based morphometric confirmed smaller bilateral hippocampal volume that were associated with poorer verbal memory performance in athletes. Repeated concussions may lead to greater regional atrophy than expected for age.

Color vision requires the activity of cone photoreceptors to be compared in post-receptoral circuitry. Decades of psychophysical measurements have quantified the nature of these comparative interactions on a coarse scale. How such findings generalize to a cellular scale remains unclear. To answer that question, we quantified the influence of background light on the appearance of spots targeted to individual cones. The eye's abberations were corrected with adaptive optics and its position was precisely tracked in real-time to compensate for natural movement. Subjects reported the color appearance of each spot. A majority of L- and M-cones consistently gave rise to the sensation of white, while a smaller group repeatedly elicited hue sensations. When blue sensations were reported they were more likely mediated by M- than L-cones. Blue sensations were elicited from M-cones against a short-wavelength background that preferentially elevated S-cone quantal catch, while stimulation of the same cones against a white background elicited green sensations. In one of two subjects, proximity to S-cones increased the probability of blue reports when M-cones were probed. Thus, what is seen when an M-cone is probed appears to depend on the relative activity of cones at other locations in the mosaic.

<p>by Michaël Dougoud, Laura Vinckenbosch, Rudolf P. Rohr, Louis-Félix Bersier, Christian Mazza</p>

The consensus that complexity begets stability in ecosystems was challenged in the seventies, a result recently extended to ecologically-inspired networks. The approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i.e. with positive abundances. However, this key assumption has not been tested. We provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3gE01kroZuI" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Evidence suggests disordered breathing is critically involved in Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). To that end, evaluating structures that are activated by seizures and can activate brain regions that produce cardiorespiratory changes can further our understanding of the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Prior preclinical studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the human amygdala induces apnea, suggesting a role for the amygdala in controlling respiration. In this study, we aimed to both confirm these findings in a larger group of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and also further explore the anatomical and cognitive properties of this effect.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Seven surgical TLE patients had depth electrodes implanted in the amygdala that were used to deliver electrical stimulation during functional mapping prior to resection. Real-time respiratory monitoring was performed in each patient to confirm apnea.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Our data confirm that amygdala stimulation reliably induces apnea (occurring in all seven patients) and further suggest that apnea can be overcome by instructing the patient to inhale, and can be prevented entirely by breathing through the mouth prior to electrical stimulation. Finally, stimulation induced apnea occurred only when stimulating the medial most amygdalar contacts located in the central nucleus.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>These findings confirm a functional connection between the amygdala and respiratory control in humans. Moreover, they suggest specific amygdalar nuclei may be critical in mediating this effect and that attentional state is critical to apnea mediated by amygdala activation - perhaps alluding to future development of strategies for the prevention of SUDEP.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Background</b>: Understanding the pathological changes underlying mild motor features of the eldery and defining a patient population with prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) are of great clinical importance. It remains unclear, however, how to accurately and specifically diagnose prodromal PD. We examined whether older adults with minimal parkinsonian motor features have nigrostriatal degeneration and α-synuclein pathology consistent with prodromal PD.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Brain sections were obtained from older adults with a clinical diagnosis of PD (N=21) and without a clinical diagnosis of PD (N=27) who underwent motor examination proximate to death. Cases without PD were further dichotomized into no motor deficit (n=9) or minimal motor features (n-18) groups using a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. We performed quantitative unbiased stereological analyses of dopaminergic neurons/terminals and α-synuclein accumulation in the nigrostriatal system.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: In all subjects with minimal motor features, there were significant reductions in dopaminergic neurons and terminals in the substantia nigra and putamen that was intermediate between subjects with no motor deficit and PD. Phosphorylated α-synuclein inclusions were observed in the substantia nigra that were of similar density to what was seen in PD. Furthermore, there was greater Lewy neuritic pathology in the putamen relative to PD patients. Lastly, neurons with α-synuclein inclusions displayed reductions in tyrosine hydroxylase expression that was comparable in subjects with both minimal motor features and PD.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Minimal motor features in older adults may represent prodromal PD and identify at risk individuals for testing putative neuroprotective interventions that could slow or prevent PD progression.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><em>Objective</em>: To evaluate the outcomes one-year and longer following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in a large series of patients treated over a five-year period since introduction of this novel technique.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Methods</em>: Surgical outcomes of a consecutive series of fifty-eight patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent the surgery at our institution with at least 12-months follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Results</em>: One-year following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy 53.4% (95% confidence interval: 40.8%-65.7%) of all patients were free of disabling seizures (Engel 1). Three of nine patients became seizure free following repeat ablation. Subgroup analysis showed that 60.5% (95% confidence interval: 45.6%-73.7%) of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis were free of disabling seizures as compared to 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 15.0%-58.5%) of patients without mesial temporal sclerosis. Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 scores significantly improved at the group level, few procedure-related complications were observed, and verbal memory outcome was better than historical open resection data.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Interpretation</em>: In an unselected consecutive series of patients, stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy yielded seizure-free rates for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy lower than, but comparable to, the outcomes typically associated with open temporal lobe surgery. Analogous to results from open surgery, patients without mesial temporal sclerosis fared less well. This novel procedure is an effective minimally invasive alternative to resective surgery. In the minority of patients not free of disabling seizures, laser ablation presents no barrier to additional open surgery. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<p>EEG signals are records of nonlinear solitary waves in human brains. The
waves have several types (e.g., a, b, g, q, d) in response to different levels
of consciousness. They are classified into two groups: Group-1 consists of
complex storm-like waves (a, b, and g); Group-2 is composed of simple
quasilinear waves (q and d). In order to elucidate the mechanism of EEG wave
formation and propagation, this paper extends the Vlasov-Maxwell equations of
Plasma Brain Dynamics (PBD) to a set of two-fluid, self-similar, nonlinear
solitary wave equations. Numerical simulations are performed for different EEG
signals. Main results include: (1) The excitation and propagation of the EEG
wave packets are dependent of electric and magnetic fields, brain aqua-ions,
electron and ion temperatures, masses, and their initial fluid speeds; (2)
Group-1 complex waves contain three ingredients: the high-frequency
ion-acoustic (IA) mode, the intermediate-frequency lower-hybrid (LH) mode, and
the low-frequency ion-cyclotron (IC) mode; (3) Group-2 simple waves fall within
the IA band, featured by one or a combination of the three envelopes:
sinusoidal, sawtooth, and spiky/bipolar. The study proposes an alternative
model to Quantum Brain Dynamics (QBD) by suggesting that the formation and
propagation of the nonlinear solitary EEG waves in the brain have the same
mechanism as that of the waves in space plasmas

We revisit recent evidence showing that nasal respiration entrains oscillations at the same frequency as breathing in several regions of the rodent brain. Moreover, respiration modulates the amplitude of a specific gamma sub-band (70–120Hz), most prominently in frontal regions. Since rodents often breathe at delta and theta frequencies, we caution that previous studies on delta and theta power and their cross-regional synchrony, as well as on delta–gamma and theta–gamma coupling, may have detected the respiration-entrained rhythm and respiration–gamma coupling.

Matt et al. introduce α-actinin as a critical postsynaptic docking protein for PSD-95 and AMPARs. They found that disruption of the PSD-95-α-actinin interaction by point-mutating the essential residues on either protein leads to reduced synaptic localization of PSD-95 and AMPARs.

Chang and Abderemane-Ali et al. define a unified framework for calmodulin (CaM) control of Kv7 (KCNQ) channels, important in the brain, heart, and ear. A CaM C-lobe calcium-dependent switch releases a shared Apo/CaM clamp conformation that enables Kv7 isoform-specific functional outcomes.

Based on fluorescence recordings, Cartailler et al. recover the voltage dynamics in dendritic spines by deconvolution. They investigate electricity at a nanometric scale using electro-diffusion modeling and concluded that spine geometry and electrolyte shape the current-voltage conversion and electrical resistance.

There is current controversy regarding the role of prefrontal versus posterior cortices in consciousness. Clinical and correlative data have been used both to support and refute a causal role for prefrontal cortex in the level of consciousness, but a definitive relationship has not been demonstrated. We used anesthetic-induced unconsciousness as a model system to study the effect of cholinergic and noradrenergic stimulation of rat prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices on the level of consciousness. We demonstrate that cholinergic stimulation of prefrontal cortex, but not parietal cortical areas, restored wakefulness in rats despite continuous exposure to sevoflurane anesthesia. Noradrenergic stimulation of the prefrontal or parietal areas did not reverse the anesthetized state. We conclude that cholinergic mechanisms in prefrontal cortex can control the level of consciousness.

Objective: This study aimed to characterise effects of coil orientation on the size of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) from both sides of Orbicularis Oris (OO) and compare these effects with those reported for First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI), following stimulation to left lip and left hand Primary Motor Cortex. Methods: Using a 70mm figure-of-eight coil, we collected MEPs from eight different orientations while recording from contralateral and ipsilateral OO and FDI using a monophasic pulse. Results: MEPs from OO were evoked consistently for six out of eight orientations for contralateral and ipsilateral sites. When latency and silent periods were taken into account, contralateral orientations 0, 45, 90, and 315 degrees were found to best elicit OO MEPs with a likely cortical origin. As expected, the largest FDI MEPs were recorded with an orientation of 45 degrees, invoking a posterior-anterior (PA) current flow, from the contralateral location. Conclusion: Orientations traditionally used for FDI were also found suitable for eliciting OO MEPs. Individuals vary more in their optimal coil orientation for eliciting MEPs from OO than for FDI. It is recommended that researchers iteratively probe several orientations when eliciting MEPs from OO. Care must be taken however because several orientations likely induced direct activation of facial muscles.

Maturation is a process that allows synapses to acquire full functionality; failures in synaptic maturation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules essential for synapse maturation, but the underlying pathways are incompletely understood. Here, we show that maturational increases in active zone stability and synaptic vesicle recycling rely on the joint action of Neuroligins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Applying BDNF to neuronal cultures mimicked the maturation-promoting effects of overexpressing the Neuroligin isoforms NL1 or NL2. Inhibiting BDNF signaling reduced the effects of NL1 and NL2 on presynaptic maturation and of NL2 on synapse formation. Applying BDNF to NL1-knockout mouse cultures rescued defective presynaptic maturation, indicating that BDNF acts downstream of NL1 and can restore presynaptic maturation at late stages of network development. Our data introduce BDNF as a novel and essential component in a transsynaptic pathway linking Neuroligin-mediated cell adhesion, neurotrophin action and presynaptic maturation.

Objective: Endodontic diagnosis collectively relies on interpretation of chair-side clinical testing and pain history to assess the presence of inflammation in the pulp and periapical tissues. Whether clinical findings relate to a patient subjective pain description is largely unknown. We tested for an association between mechanical and thermal sensory responses of affected teeth, with pain quality descriptors and pain intensity at rest and in function. Identification of such associations will clarify whether pain descriptors are useful in discriminating the underlying biological processes contributing to dental pain. Methods: Participants (n= 228) were recruited from among those presenting with toothache at a dental emergency clinic. Clinical testing (cold, EPT, percussion, palpation, and bite) was completed by calibrated examiners and participants verbally rated their pain intensity with reference to 22 pain qualities (0-10 VAS). Two-way ANOVA determined the relationship between groups defined by pulp vitality and percussion sensitivity and the intensity rating of each pain descriptor. Results: Patients with percussion hypersensitivity reported significantly higher levels of current pain, worst pain, pain at rest and pain in function. Patients with positive cold detection reported higher levels of pain at rest. There was a significant interaction between the cold responsiveness and percussion hypersensitivity on the intensity of pain evoked by cold. Patients with a positive cold detection and percussion hypersensitivity experienced more intense evoked pain with eating or drinking cold things. Patients with positive cold detection reported higher intensity shooting pain. Finally, patients with percussion hypersensitivity reported higher levels of radiating, throbbing pain and pain evoked by chewing/biting (all p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Shooting pain is more salient in odontalgia patients with a vital pulp diagnosis with positive cold detection results, and may be a unique feature of pulp mediated pain. Radiating, throbbing, and evoked pain are associated with percussion sensitivity and could reflect central sensitization or more advanced inflammatory processes. As pain is an individual and multidimensional experience, a detailed pain history including pain descriptors may help improve endodontic diagnosis and distinguish the underlying biological mechanisms in different stages of the disease.

Learning and memory are known to be supported by a network involving the medial temporal lobe and linked neocortical regions. Emerging evidence indicates that primary sensory regions (i.e., V1) may be also contribute to recognition memory processes, but this has been only tested with a single visuospatial sequence as the target memorandum. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the capacity of human V1 to support the learning of multiple, concurrent and complex visual sequences involving discontinous (second-order) associations. Two peripheral, task-irrelevant but structured sequences of orientated gratings appeared simultaneously in right and left visual fields alongside a central, task-relevant sequence that was in the focus of spatial attention. Pseudorandom sequences were interspersed amongst the three complex structured sequences with different asynchronies. We found that a network involving the precuneus and V1 was involved in learning the structured sequence presented at central fixation, whereas right V1 was modulated by repeated exposure to a concurrent structured sequence presented in the left visual field. The same result was not found in left V1. These results indicate that human V1 can support the learning of multiple concurrent sequences involving complex discontinuous inter-item associations, even those that are goal-irrelevant.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259812v1?rss=1">Nuclear localization of TORC1 and cellular co-localization of TORC1 and c-Fos in the visceral neuraxis after systemic LiCl injection</a></h4>

Cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated gene expression is critical for the processing of visceral information, including learning about visceral stimuli (e.g. conditioned taste aversion). However, CREB requires additional co-factors to induce gene expression, including transducer of regulated CREB-activity (TORC). The nuclear localization of TORC1 has not been examined previously in the visceral neuraxis. c-Fos, a widely-used marker of activity, is induced by visceral stimulation. If CREB-mediated gene transcription is necessary for c-Fos induction in the visceral neuraxis after systemic LiCl injection, then TORC should be active following stimulation, and co-localized with c-Fos in activated neurons. We examined nuclear (activated) TORC1 in the visceral neuraxis at 30, 60, and 180 minutes after LiCl, as compared to c-Fos induction. Consistent with previous studies we found increases in c-Fos 60 min after LiCl in all regions. Nuclear TORC1 was also increased in the area postrema, NTS, and paraventricular nucleus after LiCl. Surprisingly, in the central amygdala, TORC1 was deactivated after LiCl, such that almost all TORC1 was cytoplasmic, whereas control rats had almost all nuclear TORC1. Fluorescent double-labeling of TORC1 and c-Fos after LiCl found that cellular co-localization of c-Fos and TORC1 was very low across the visceral neuraxis. Nuclear TORC1 expression reveals a population of cells in the visceral neuraxis, independent of c-Fos-positive cells, that are regulated by LiCl. TORC1, and in turn CREB-mediated gene transcription, may not be necessary for c-Fos induction in the visceral neuraxis after LiCl.

Transcranial focused ultrasound is a form of non-invasive neuromodulation that uses acoustic energy to affect neuronal excitability. The effect of ultrasound on human motor cortical excitability is currently unknown. We apply ultrasound to the primary motor cortex in humans using a novel transcranial ultrasound and magnetic stimulation (TUMS) paradigm that allows for concurrent and concentric ultrasound stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This allows for non-invasive inspection of the effect of ultrasound on motor neuronal excitability using the motor evoked potential (MEP) generated by TMS. We test the effect of ultrasound on single pulse MEP recruitment curves and paired pulse protocols including short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). We also test the longevity of the effect and the effect of ultrasound on the cortical silent period in a small sub-sample of participants. In addition, we test the effect of ultrasound to motor cortex on a stimulus response reaction time task. Results show ultrasound inhibits the amplitude of single-pulse MEPs and attenuates intracortical facilitation but does not affect intracortical inhibition. Early evidence suggests that ultrasound does not affect cortical silent period duration and that the duration of inhibition may be related to the duration of stimulation. Finally, ultrasound reduces reaction time on a simple stimulus response task. This is the first report of the effect of ultrasound on human motor cortical excitability and motor behavior and confirms previous results in the somatosensory cortex that ultrasound results in effective neuronal inhibition that confers a performance advantage.

<p>by James X. Sun, Yuting He, Eric Sanford, Meagan Montesion, Garrett M. Frampton, Stéphane Vignot, Jean-Charles Soria, Jeffrey S. Ross, Vincent A. Miller, Phil J. Stephens, Doron Lipson, Roman Yelensky</p>

A key constraint in genomic testing in oncology is that matched normal specimens are not commonly obtained in clinical practice. Thus, while well-characterized genomic alterations do not require normal tissue for interpretation, a significant number of alterations will be unknown in whether they are germline or somatic, in the absence of a matched normal control. We introduce SGZ (somatic-germline-zygosity), a computational method for predicting somatic vs. germline origin and homozygous vs. heterozygous or sub-clonal state of variants identified from deep massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of cancer specimens. The method does not require a patient matched normal control, enabling broad application in clinical research. SGZ predicts the somatic vs. germline status of each alteration identified by modeling the alteration’s allele frequency (AF), taking into account the tumor content, tumor ploidy, and the local copy number. Accuracy of the prediction depends on the depth of sequencing and copy number model fit, which are achieved in our clinical assay by sequencing to high depth (&gt;500x) using MPS, covering 394 cancer-related genes and over 3,500 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Calls are made using a statistic based on read depth and local variability of SNP AF. To validate the method, we first evaluated performance on samples from 30 lung and colon cancer patients, where we sequenced tumors and matched normal tissue. We examined predictions for 17 somatic hotspot mutations and 20 common germline SNPs in 20,182 clinical cancer specimens. To assess the impact of stromal admixture, we examined three cell lines, which were titrated with their matched normal to six levels (10–75%). Overall, predictions were made in 85% of cases, with 95–99% of variants predicted correctly, a significantly superior performance compared to a basic approach based on AF alone. We then applied the SGZ method to the COSMIC database of known somatic variants in cancer and found &gt;50 that are in fact more likely to be germline.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/134RQp414fk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1588?rss=1">Regulation of Lateral Hypothalamic Orexin Activity by Local GABAergic Neurons</a></h4>

<p>Orexin (also known as hypocretin) neurons are considered a key component of the ascending arousal system. They are active during wakefulness, at which time they drive and maintain arousal, and are silent during sleep. Their activity is controlled by long-range inputs from many sources, as well as by more short-range inputs, including from presumptive GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical region (LH/PF). To characterize local GABAergic input to orexin neurons, we used channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in brain slices. We expressed channelrhodopsin-2 in GABAergic neurons (Vgat<sup>+</sup>) in the LH/PF and recorded from genetically identified surrounding orexin neurons (LH/PF<sup>Vgat</sup> -&gt; Orx). We performed all experiments in mice of either sex. Photostimulation of LH/PF GABAergic neurons inhibited the firing of orexin neurons through the release of GABA, evoking GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated IPSCs in orexin neurons. These photo-evoked IPSCs were maintained in the presence of TTX, indicating direct connectivity. Carbachol inhibited LH/PF<sup>Vgat</sup> -&gt; Orx input through muscarinic receptors. By contrast, application of orexin was without effect on LH/PF<sup>Vgat</sup> -&gt; Orx input, whereas dynorphin, another peptide produced by orexin neurons, inhibited LH/PF<sup>Vgat</sup> -&gt; Orx input through -opioid receptors. Our results demonstrate that orexin neurons are under inhibitory control by local GABAergic neurons and that this input is depressed by cholinergic signaling, unaffected by orexin and inhibited by dynorphin. We propose that local release of dynorphin may, via collaterals, provides a positive feedback to orexin neurons and that, during wakefulness, orexin neurons may be disinhibited by acetylcholine and by their own release of dynorphin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lateral hypothalamus contains important wake-promoting cell populations, including orexin-producing neurons. Intermingled with the orexin neurons, there are other cell populations that selectively discharge during nonrapid eye movement or rapid eye movement sleep. Some of these sleep-active neurons release GABA and are thought to inhibit wake-active neurons during rapid eye movement and nonrapid eye movement sleep. However, this hypothesis had not been tested. Here we show that orexin neurons are inhibited by a local GABAergic input. We propose that this local GABAergic input inhibits orexin neurons during sleep but that, during wakefulness, this input is depressed, possibly through cholinergically mediated disinhibition and/or by release of dynorphin from orexin neurons themselves.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1575?rss=1">Transcriptional Regulator ZEB2 Is Essential for Bergmann Glia Development</a></h4>

<p>Bergmann glia facilitate granule neuron migration during development and maintain the cerebellar organization and functional integrity. At present, molecular control of Bergmann glia specification from cerebellar radial glia is not fully understood. In this report, we show that ZEB2 (aka, SIP1 or ZFHX1B), a Mowat–Wilson syndrome-associated transcriptional regulator, is highly expressed in Bergmann glia, but hardly detectable in astrocytes in the cerebellum. The mice lacking <i>Zeb2</i> in cerebellar radial glia exhibit severe deficits in Bergmann glia specification, and develop cerebellar cortical lamination dysgenesis and locomotion defects. In developing <i>Zeb2</i>-mutant cerebella, inward migration of granule neuron progenitors is compromised, the proliferation of glial precursors is reduced, and radial glia fail to differentiate into Bergmann glia in the Purkinje cell layer. In contrast, <i>Zeb2</i> ablation in granule neuron precursors or oligodendrocyte progenitors does not affect Bergmann glia formation, despite myelination deficits caused by <i>Zeb2</i> mutation in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Transcriptome profiling identified that ZEB2 regulates a set of Bergmann glia-related genes and FGF, NOTCH, and TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway components. Our data reveal that ZEB2 acts as an integral regulator of Bergmann glia formation ensuring maintenance of cerebellar integrity, suggesting that ZEB2 dysfunction in Bergmann gliogenesis might contribute to motor deficits in Mowat–Wilson syndrome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bergmann glia are essential for proper cerebellar organization and functional circuitry, however, the molecular mechanisms that control the specification of Bergmann glia remain elusive. Here, we show that transcriptional factor ZEB2 is highly expressed in mature Bergmann glia, but not in cerebellar astrocytes. The mice lacking <i>Zeb2</i> in cerebellar radial glia, but not oligodendrocyte progenitors or granular neuron progenitors, exhibit severe defects in Bergmann glia formation. The orderly radial scaffolding formed by Bergmann glial fibers critical for cerebellar lamination was not established in <i>Zeb2</i> mutants, displaying motor behavior deficits. This finding demonstrates a previously unrecognized critical role for ZEB2 in Bergmann glia specification, and points to an important contribution of ZEB2 dysfunction to cerebellar motor disorders in Mowat–Wilson syndrome.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1558?rss=1">Locus Coeruleus Activity Strengthens Prioritized Memories Under Arousal</a></h4>

<p>Recent models posit that bursts of locus ceruleus (LC) activity amplify neural gain such that limited attention and encoding resources focus even more on prioritized mental representations under arousal. Here, we tested this hypothesis in human males and females using fMRI, neuromelanin MRI, and pupil dilation, a biomarker of arousal and LC activity. During scanning, participants performed a monetary incentive encoding task in which threat of punishment motivated them to prioritize encoding of scene images over superimposed objects. Threat of punishment elicited arousal and selectively enhanced memory for goal-relevant scenes. Furthermore, trial-level pupil dilations predicted better scene memory under threat, but were not related to object memory outcomes. fMRI analyses revealed that greater threat-evoked pupil dilations were positively associated with greater scene encoding activity in LC and parahippocampal cortex, a region specialized to process scene information. Across participants, this pattern of LC engagement for goal-relevant encoding was correlated with neuromelanin signal intensity, providing the first evidence that LC structure relates to its activation pattern during cognitive processing. Threat also reduced dynamic functional connectivity between high-priority (parahippocampal place area) and lower-priority (lateral occipital cortex) category-selective visual cortex in ways that predicted increased memory selectivity. Together, these findings support the idea that, under arousal, LC activity selectively strengthens prioritized memory representations by modulating local and functional network-level patterns of information processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adaptive behavior relies on the ability to select and store important information amid distraction. Prioritizing encoding of task-relevant inputs is especially critical in threatening or arousing situations, when forming these memories is essential for avoiding danger in the future. However, little is known about the arousal mechanisms that support such memory selectivity. Using fMRI, neuromelanin MRI, and pupil measures, we demonstrate that locus ceruleus (LC) activity amplifies neural gain such that limited encoding resources focus even more on prioritized mental representations under arousal. For the first time, we also show that LC structure relates to its involvement in threat-related encoding processes. These results shed new light on the brain mechanisms by which we process important information when it is most needed.</p>

<p>Forming valid predictions about the environment is crucial to survival. However, whether humans are able to form valid predictions about natural stimuli based on their temporal statistical regularities remains unknown. Here, we presented subjects with tone sequences with pitch fluctuations that, over time, capture long-range temporal dependence structures prevalent in natural stimuli. We found that subjects were able to exploit such naturalistic statistical regularities to make valid predictions about upcoming items in a sequence. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings revealed that slow, arrhythmic cortical dynamics tracked the evolving pitch sequence over time such that neural activity at a given moment was influenced by the pitch of up to seven previous tones. Importantly, such history integration contained in neural activity predicted the expected pitch of the upcoming tone, providing a concrete computational mechanism for prediction. These results establish humans' ability to make valid predictions based on temporal regularities inherent in naturalistic stimuli and further reveal the neural mechanisms underlying such predictive computation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the brain predicts upcoming events in the environment. To date, this question has primarily been addressed in experiments using relatively simple stimulus sequences. Here, we studied predictive processing in the human brain using auditory tone sequences that exhibit temporal statistical regularities similar to those found in natural stimuli. We observed that humans are able to form valid predictions based on such complex temporal statistical regularities. We further show that neural response to a given tone in the sequence reflects integration over the preceding tone sequence and that this history dependence forms the foundation for prediction. These findings deepen our understanding of how humans form predictions in an ecologically valid environment.</p>

<p>In primate retina, "red-green" color coding is initiated when signals originating in long (L) and middle (M) wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors interact antagonistically. The center-surround receptive field of "midget" ganglion cells provides the neural substrate for L versus M cone-opponent interaction, but the underlying circuitry remains unsettled, centering around the longstanding question of whether specialized cone wiring is present. To address this question, we measured the strength, sign, and spatial tuning of L- and M-cone input to midget receptive fields in the peripheral retina of macaque primates of either sex. Consistent with previous work, cone opponency arose when one of the cone types showed a stronger connection to the receptive field center than to the surround. We implemented a difference-of-Gaussians spatial receptive field model, incorporating known biology of the midget circuit, to test whether physiological responses we observed in real cells could be captured entirely by anatomical nonselectivity. When this model sampled nonselectively from a realistic cone mosaic, it accurately reproduced key features of a cone-opponent receptive field structure, and predicted both the variability and strength of cone opponency across the retina. The model introduced here is consistent with abundant anatomical evidence for nonselective wiring, explains both local and global properties of the midget population, and supports a role in their multiplexing of spatial and color information. It provides a neural basis for human chromatic sensitivity across the visual field, as well as the maintenance of normal color vision despite significant variability in the relative number of L and M cones across individuals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Red-green color vision is a hallmark of the human and nonhuman primate that starts in the retina with the presence of long (L)- and middle (M)-wavelength sensitive cone photoreceptor types. Understanding the underlying retinal mechanism for color opponency has focused on the broad question of whether this characteristic can emerge from nonselective wiring, or whether complex cone-type-specific wiring must be invoked. We provide experimental and modeling support for the hypothesis that nonselective connectivity is sufficient to produce the range of red-green color opponency observed in midget ganglion cells across the retina. Our nonselective model reproduces the diversity of physiological responses of midget cells while also accounting for systematic changes in color sensitivity across the visual field.</p>

<p>Visual short-term memory (VSTM) and attention are distinct yet interrelated processes. While both require selection of information across the visual field, memory additionally requires the maintenance of information across time and distraction. VSTM recruits areas within human (male and female) dorsal and ventral parietal cortex that are also implicated in spatial selection; therefore, it is important to determine whether overlapping activation might reflect shared attentional demands. Here, identical stimuli and controlled sustained attention across both tasks were used to ask whether fMRI signal amplitude, functional connectivity, and contralateral visual field bias reflect memory-specific task demands. While attention and VSTM activated similar cortical areas, BOLD amplitude and functional connectivity in parietal cortex differentiated the two tasks. Relative to attention, VSTM increased BOLD amplitude in dorsal parietal cortex and decreased BOLD amplitude in the angular gyrus. Additionally, the tasks differentially modulated parietal functional connectivity. Contrasting VSTM and attention, intraparietal sulcus (IPS) 1–2 were more strongly connected with anterior frontoparietal areas and more weakly connected with posterior regions. This divergence between tasks demonstrates that parietal activation reflects memory-specific functions and consequently modulates functional connectivity across the cortex. In contrast, both tasks demonstrated hemispheric asymmetries for spatial processing, exhibiting a stronger contralateral visual field bias in the left versus the right hemisphere across tasks, suggesting that asymmetries are characteristic of a shared selection process in IPS. These results demonstrate that parietal activity and patterns of functional connectivity distinguish VSTM from more general attention processes, establishing a central role of the parietal cortex in maintaining visual information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual short-term memory (VSTM) and attention are distinct yet interrelated processes. Cognitive mechanisms and neural activity underlying these tasks show a large degree of overlap. To examine whether activity within the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) reflects object maintenance across distraction or sustained attention per se, it is necessary to control for attentional demands inherent in VSTM tasks. We demonstrate that activity in PPC reflects VSTM demands even after controlling for attention; remembering items across distraction modulates relationships between parietal and other areas differently than during periods of sustained attention. Our study fills a gap in the literature by directly comparing and controlling for overlap between visual attention and VSTM tasks.</p>

<p>As key functional units in neural circuits, different types of neuronal synapses play distinct roles in brain information processing, learning, and memory. Synaptic abnormalities are believed to underlie various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here, by combining cryo-electron tomography and cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy, we distinguished intact excitatory and inhibitory synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons, and visualized the <i>in situ</i> 3D organization of synaptic organelles and macromolecules in their native state. Quantitative analyses of &gt;100 synaptic tomograms reveal that excitatory synapses contain a mesh-like postsynaptic density (PSD) with thickness ranging from 20 to 50 nm. In contrast, the PSD in inhibitory synapses assumes a thin sheet-like structure ~12 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. On the presynaptic side, spherical synaptic vesicles (SVs) of 25–60 nm diameter and discus-shaped ellipsoidal SVs of various sizes coexist in both synaptic types, with more ellipsoidal ones in inhibitory synapses. High-resolution tomograms obtained using a Volta phase plate and electron filtering and counting reveal glutamate receptor-like and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-like structures that interact with putative scaffolding and adhesion molecules, reflecting details of receptor anchoring and PSD organization. These results provide an updated view of the ultrastructure of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and demonstrate the potential of our approach to gain insight into the organizational principles of cellular architecture underlying distinct synaptic functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To understand functional properties of neuronal synapses, it is desirable to analyze their structure at molecular resolution. We have developed an integrative approach combining cryo-electron tomography and correlative fluorescence microscopy to visualize 3D ultrastructural features of intact excitatory and inhibitory synapses in their native state. Our approach shows that inhibitory synapses contain uniform thin sheet-like postsynaptic densities (PSDs), while excitatory synapses contain previously known mesh-like PSDs. We discovered "discus-shaped" ellipsoidal synaptic vesicles, and their distributions along with regular spherical vesicles in synaptic types are characterized. High-resolution tomograms further allowed identification of putative neurotransmitter receptors and their heterogeneous interaction with synaptic scaffolding proteins. The specificity and resolution of our approach enables precise <i>in situ</i> analysis of ultrastructural organization underlying distinct synaptic functions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1482?rss=1">Perceptual Surprise Improves Action Stopping by Nonselectively Suppressing Motor Activity via a Neural Mechanism for Motor Inhibition</a></h4>

<p>Motor inhibition is a cognitive control ability that allows humans to stop actions rapidly even after initiation. Understanding and improving motor inhibition could benefit adaptive behavior in both health and disease. We recently found that presenting surprising, task-unrelated sounds when stopping is necessary improves the likelihood of successful stopping. In the current study, we investigated the neural underpinnings of this effect. Specifically, we tested whether surprise-related stopping improvements are due to a genuine increase in motor inhibition. In Experiment 1, we measured motor inhibition in primary motor cortex of male and female humans by quantifying corticospinal excitability (CSE) via transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography during a hybrid surprise–Go/NoGo task. Consistent with prior studies of motor inhibition, successful stopping was accompanied by nonselective suppression of CSE; that is, CSE was suppressed even in task-unrelated motor effectors. Importantly, unexpected sounds significantly increased this motor-system inhibition to a degree that was directly related to behavioral improvements in stopping. In Experiment 2, we then used scalp encephalography to investigate whether unexpected sounds increase motor-inhibition-related activity in the CNS. We used an independent stop-signal localizer task to identify a well characterized frontocentral low-frequency EEG component that indexes motor inhibition. We then investigated the activity of this component in the surprise–Go/NoGo task. Consistent with Experiment 1, this signature of motor inhibition was indeed increased when NoGo signals were followed by unexpected sounds. Together, these experiments provide converging evidence suggesting that unexpected events improve motor inhibition by automatically triggering inhibitory control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to stop ongoing actions rapidly allows humans to adapt their behavior flexibly and rapidly. Action stopping is important in daily life (e.g., stopping to cross the street when a car approaches) and is severely impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, finding ways to improve action stopping could aid adaptive behaviors in health and disease. Our current study shows that presenting unexpected sounds in stopping situations facilitates successful stopping. This improvement is specifically due to a surprise-related increase in a neural mechanism for motor inhibition, which rapidly suppresses the excitability of the motor system after unexpected events. These findings suggest a tight interaction between the neural systems for surprise processing and motor inhibition and yield a promising avenue for future research.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1472?rss=1">Retrosplenial Cortex Indexes Stability beyond the Spatial Domain</a></h4>

<p>Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is highly responsive to landmarks in the environment that remain fixed in a permanent location, and this has been linked with its known involvement in scene and spatial processing. However, it is unclear whether RSC representations of permanence are a purely spatial phenomenon or whether they extend into behavioral and conceptual domains. To test this, during functional MRI scanning, we had people (males and females) read three different types of sentences that described either something permanent or transient. The first two sentence types were imageable, with a focus either on a spatial landmark or on an action. The third type of sentence involved non-imageable abstract concepts. We found that, in addition to being more active for sentences describing landmarks with a permanent location in space, RSC was also significantly engaged by sentences describing stable and consistent behaviors or actions, as long as they were rooted within a concrete imageable setting. RSC was not responsive to abstract concepts, even those that embodied the notion of stability. Similarly, it was not engaged by imageable sentences with transient contents. In contrast, parahippocampal cortex was more engaged by imageable sentences describing landmarks, whereas the hippocampus was active for all imageable sentences. In addition, for imageable sentences describing permanence, there was bidirectional functional coupling between RSC and these medial temporal lobe structures. It appears, therefore, that RSC-mediated permanence representations could be helpful for more than spatially mapping environments and may also provide information about the reliability of events occurring within them.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is known to process information about landmarks in the environment that have a fixed, permanent location. Here we tested whether this permanence response was apparent beyond the spatial domain, which could have implications for understanding the role of the RSC more widely across cognition. We found that the RSC was engaged not only by permanent landmarks but also by stable and consistent actions. It was not responsive to transient landmarks or actions or to abstract concepts, even those that embodied the notion of stability. We conclude that the RSC might do more than help to map spatial environments, by possibly also providing information about the reliability of events occurring within them.</p>

<p>Abuse rates for inhalants among adolescents continue to be high, yet preclinical models for studying mechanisms underlying inhalant abuse remain limited. Our laboratory has previously shown that, in male rats, an acute binge-like exposure to toluene vapor that mimics human solvent abuse modifies the intrinsic excitability of mPFC pyramidal neurons projecting to the NAc. These changes showed region (infralimbic; IL vs prelimbic; PRL), layer (shallow; 2/3 vs deep; 5/6), target (core vs shell), and age (adolescent vs adult) dependent differences (Wayman and Woodward, 2017). To expand these findings using reward-based models that may better mimic human drug abuse, we used whole-cell electrophysiology and drug receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs to examine changes in neuronal function and behavior in rats showing a conditioned place preference (CPP) to toluene. Repeated pairings of adolescent rats to binge concentrations of toluene vapor previously shown to enhance dopamine release in reward-sensitive areas of the brain produced CPP that persisted for 7 but not 30 d. Toluene-induced CPP was associated with increased excitability of IL5/6 mPFC neurons projecting to the core of the NAc and reduced excitability of those projecting to the NAc shell. No changes in PRL-NAc-projecting neurons were found in toluene-CPP rats. Chemogenetic reversal of the toluene-induced decrease in IL5/6-NAc shell neurons blocked the expression of toluene-induced CPP while manipulating IL5/6-NAc core neuron activity had no effect. These data reveal that alterations in selective mPFC-NAc pathways are required for expression of toluene-induced CPP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Disturbed physiology of pyramidal neurons projecting from the mPFC to the NAc has been shown to have different roles in drug-seeking behaviors for a number of drugs (e.g., methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, alcohol, heroin). Here, we report that rats repeatedly exposed to the volatile organic solvent toluene, a member of the class of abused inhalants often used for intoxicating purposes by adolescents, induces a preference for the drug-paired environment that is accompanied by altered physiology of a specific population of NAc-projecting mPFC neurons. Chemogenetic correction of this deficit before testing prevented expression of drug preference. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of corticolimbic circuitry in mediating the rewarding properties of abused inhalants.</p>

<p>The mouse olfactory bulb (OB) features continued, activity-dependent integration of adult-born neurons, providing a robust model with which to examine mechanisms of plasticity in the adult brain. We previously reported that local OB interneurons secrete the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in an activity-dependent manner onto adult-born granule neurons and that local CRH signaling promotes expression of synaptic machinery in the bulb. This effect is mediated via activation of the CRH receptor 1 (<i>CRHR1</i>), which is developmentally regulated during adult-born neuron maturation. CRHR1 is a G<sub>S</sub>-protein-coupled receptor that activates CREB-dependent transcription in the presence of CRH. Therefore, we hypothesized that locally secreted CRH activates CRHR1 to initiate circuit plasticity programs. To identify such programs, we profiled gene expression changes associated with CRHR1 activity in adult-born neurons of the OB. Here, we show that CRHR1 activity influences expression of the brain-specific Homeobox-containing transcription factor POU Class 6 Homeobox 1 (<i>POU6f1</i>). To elucidate the contributions of <i>POU6f1</i> toward activity-dependent circuit remodeling, we targeted CRHR1<sup>+</sup> neurons in male and female mice for cell-type-specific manipulation of <i>POU6f1</i> expression. Whereas loss of <i>POU6f1</i> in CRHR1<sup>+</sup> neurons resulted in reduced dendritic complexity and decreased synaptic connectivity, overexpression of <i>POU6f1</i> in CRHR1<sup>+</sup> neurons promoted dendritic outgrowth and branching and influenced synaptic function. Together, these findings suggest that the transcriptional program directed by <i>POU6f1</i> downstream of local CRH signaling in adult-born neurons influences circuit dynamics in response to activity-dependent peptide signaling in the adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Elucidating mechanisms of plasticity in the adult brain is helpful for devising strategies to understand and treat neurodegeneration. Circuit plasticity in the adult mouse olfactory bulb is exemplified by both continued cell integration and synaptogenesis. We previously reported that these processes are influenced by local neuropeptide signaling in an activity-dependent manner. Here, we show that local corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling induces dynamic gene expression changes in CRH receptor expressing adult-born neurons, including altered expression of the transcription factor <i>POU6f1</i>. We further show that <i>POU6f1</i> is necessary for proper dendrite specification and patterning, as well as synapse development and function in adult-born neurons. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which peptide signaling modulates adult brain circuit plasticity.</p>

<p>Human primary motor cortex (M1) is essential for producing dexterous hand movements. Although distinct subpopulations of neurons are activated during single-finger movements, it remains unknown whether M1 also represents sequences of multiple finger movements. Using novel multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis techniques and combining evidence from both 3T and 7T fMRI data, we found that after 5 d of intense practice, premotor and parietal areas encoded the different movement sequences. There was little or no evidence for a sequence representation in M1. Instead, activity patterns in M1 could be fully explained by a linear combination of patterns for the constituent individual finger movements, with the strongest weight on the first finger of the sequence. Using passive replay of sequences, we show that this first-finger effect is due to neuronal processes involved in the active execution, rather than to a hemodynamic nonlinearity. These results suggest that M1 receives increased input from areas with sequence representations at the initiation of a sequence, but that M1 activity itself relates to the execution of component finger presses only. These results improve our understanding of the representation of finger sequences in the human neocortex after short-term training and provide important methodological advances for the study of long-term skill development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> There is clear evidence that human primary motor cortex (M1) is essential for producing individuated finger movements, such as pressing a button. Over and above its involvement in movement execution, it is less clear whether M1 also plays a role in learning and controlling sequences of multiple finger movements, such as when playing the piano. Using cutting-edge multivariate fMRI analysis and carefully controlled experiments, we demonstrate here that, while premotor areas clearly show a sequence representation, activity patterns in M1 can be fully explained from the patterns for individual finger movements. The results provide important new insights into the interplay of M1 and premotor cortex for learning of sequential movements.</p>

<p>For animals to survive, they must reliably predict during foraging which substances are suitable for consumption. Despite extensive study, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying such adaptive behavior remain poorly understood. Here, using a tastant (sucrose/quinine)-reinforced "go/no-go" task in male and female mice, we examined the anatomical and functional connectivity of the circuit linking the insular cortex (IC) to the central amygdala (CeA) and the role of this circuit in the establishment of appropriate behavioral responses. Using anatomic tracing approaches combined with optogenetics-assisted circuit mapping, we found that the gustatory region of the IC sends direct excitatory projections to the lateral division of the CeA (CeL), making monosynaptic excitatory connections with distinct populations of CeL neurons. Specific inhibition of neurotransmitter release from the CeL-projecting IC neurons prevented mice from acquiring the "no-go" response, and impaired the "go" responses in the go/no-go task. Furthermore, selective activation of the IC–CeL pathway with optogenetics drove unconditioned lick suppression in thirsty animals, induced aversive responses, and was sufficient to instruct conditioned action suppression in response to a cue predicting the optogenetic activation. These results indicate that activities in the IC–CeL circuit are critical for establishing taste-reinforced behavioral responses, including avoidance responses to an aversive tastant, and are sufficient to drive learning of anticipatory avoidance. Our findings suggest that the IC–CeL circuit plays an important role in guiding appropriate choices during foraging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An animal's ability to predict which substances are suitable for consumption and then produce an appropriate action to those substances is critical for survival. Here we found that activity in the circuit that links the insular cortex (IC) to the central amygdala (CeA) is necessary for establishing appropriate behavioral responses to taste-predicting cues. This neural circuit seems to be particularly tuned to avoid an unpleasant tastant, and is also sufficient to drive learning of such avoidance responses. These results suggest that the IC–CeA circuit is critical for generating appropriate behavioral responses during foraging when facing different choices.</p>

<p>Poor response and high relapse rates remain problematic in the treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Although mechanisms of pharmacotherapies are intensely studied, little is known about mechanisms of behavioral therapy that could inform improved treatments. We have previously demonstrated the therapeutic effects of extinction learning as a behavioral intervention modeling exposure therapy in rats. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction is necessary for its therapeutic effects. The inhibitory Gi-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug CaMKIIα-hM4Di was expressed in vmPFC before administering chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). vmPFC projection neurons were then inhibited during extinction treatment by administering clozapine-<i>N</i>-oxide. Coping behavior and cognitive flexibility were assessed 24 h later on the shock-probe defensive burying test and attentional set-shifting test, respectively. Replicating previous results, extinction reversed the CUS-induced deficits in coping behavior and cognitive flexibility. Inhibiting vmPFC during extinction blocked these therapeutic effects. Further, increasing vmPFC activity with the excitatory Gq-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug hM3Dq 24 h before testing was sufficient to reverse the CUS-induced deficits. CUS reduced mPFC responsivity, assessed by measuring afferent-evoked field potentials in the mPFC, and this reduction was reversed by extinction treatment 24 h before testing. These results demonstrate the necessity of vmPFC activity in the therapeutic effects of extinction as a model of exposure therapy, and suggest that increased vmPFC activity induced by extinction is sufficient to produce lasting plastic changes that underlie its beneficial effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stress-related psychiatric disorders remain poorly treated. Psychotherapies can be effective, but their mechanisms remain unknown, hindering progress toward improved treatment. We used a rat model of behavioral therapy to identify potential targets for enhancing treatment. Fear extinction as a therapeutic behavioral intervention reversed stress-induced cognitive dysfunction and passive coping in rats, modeling components of stress-related psychiatric disease. Extinction also reversed stress-induced attenuation of mPFC responsivity. The therapeutic effects were prevented by blocking activity of glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC during extinction, and were mimicked by inducing activity in lieu of extinction. Thus, activity and plasticity in the mPFC underlie the beneficial effects of extinction on cognitive flexibility and coping behavior compromised by stress, and could be targets to enhance behavioral therapy.</p>

<p>Standard brain stimulation protocols modify human motor cortex excitability by modulating the gain of the activated corticospinal pathways. However, the restoration of motor function following lesions of the corticospinal tract requires also the recruitment of additional neurons to increase the net corticospinal output. For this purpose, we investigated a novel protocol based on brain state-dependent paired associative stimulation.</p>
<p>Motor imagery (MI)-related electroencephalography was recorded in healthy males and females for brain state-dependent control of both cortical and peripheral stimulation in a brain–machine interface environment. State-dependency was investigated with concurrent, delayed, and independent stimulation relative to the MI task. Specifically, sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the β-band (16–22 Hz) triggered peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis and transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation, either synchronously or subsequently. These MI-related paradigms were compared with paired cortical and peripheral input applied independent of the brain state. Cortical stimulation resulted in a significant increase in corticospinal excitability only when applied brain state-dependently and synchronously to peripheral input. These gains were resistant to a depotentiation task, revealed a nonlinear evolution of plasticity, and were mediated via the recruitment of additional corticospinal neurons rather than via synchronization of neuronal firing. Recruitment of additional corticospinal pathways may be achieved when cortical and peripheral inputs are applied concurrently, and during β-ERD. These findings resemble a gating mechanism and are potentially important for developing closed-loop brain stimulation for the treatment of hand paralysis following lesions of the corticospinal tract.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The activity state of the motor system influences the excitability of corticospinal pathways to external input. State-dependent interventions harness this property to increase the connectivity between motor cortex and muscles. These stimulation protocols modulate the gain of the activated pathways, but not the overall corticospinal recruitment. In this study, a brain–machine interface paired peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening with transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation during volitional β-band desynchronization. Cortical stimulation resulted in the recruitment of additional corticospinal pathways, but only when applied brain state-dependently and synchronously to peripheral input. These effects resemble a gating mechanism and may be important for the restoration of motor function following lesions of the corticospinal tract.</p>

<p>Fine processes of astrocytes enwrap synapses and are well positioned to sense neuronal information via synaptic transmission. In rodents, astrocyte processes sense synaptic transmission via Gq-protein coupled receptors (GqPCR), including the P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R), to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Astrocytes display numerous spontaneous microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals; however, it is not clear whether such signals are due to local synaptic transmission and/or in what timeframe astrocytes sense local synaptic transmission. To ask whether GqPCRs mediate microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we engineered mice (both sexes) to specifically overexpress P2Y1Rs in astrocytes, and we visualized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals via a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP6f, in astrocytes from adult mice. Astrocytes overexpressing P2Y1Rs showed significantly larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to exogenously applied ligand and to repetitive electrical stimulation of axons compared with controls. However, we found no evidence of increased microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Instead, Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves appeared and propagated to occupy areas that were up to 80-fold larger than microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves accounted for only 2% of total Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, but they were 1.9-fold larger and 2.9-fold longer in duration than microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at processes. Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves did not require action potentials for their generation and occurred in a probenecid-sensitive manner, indicating that the endogenous ligand for P2Y1R is elevated independently of synaptic transmission. Our data suggest that spontaneous microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals occur independently of P2Y1R activation and that astrocytes may not encode neuronal information in response to synaptic transmission at a point source of neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes are thought to enwrap synapses with their processes to receive neuronal information via Gq-protein coupled receptors (GqPCRs). Astrocyte processes display numerous microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that occur spontaneously. To determine whether GqPCRs play a role in microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and the timeframe in which astrocytes sense neuronal information, we engineered mice whose astrocytes specifically overexpress the P2Y1 receptor, a major GqPCR in astrocytes. We found that overexpression of P2Y1 receptors in astrocytes did not increase microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocyte processes but caused Ca<sup>2+</sup> wavelike signals. Our data indicate that spontaneous microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do not require activation of P2Y1 receptors.</p>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a centralized fibrotic scar surrounded by a reactive glial scar at the lesion site. The origin of these scars is thought to be perivascular cells entering lesions on ingrowing blood vessels and reactive astrocytes, respectively. However, two NG2-expressing cell populations, pericytes and glia, may also influence scar formation. In the periphery, new blood vessel growth requires proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes; if this were also true in the CNS, then the fibrotic scar would depend on dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes. NG2<sup>+</sup> glial cells (also called oligodendrocyte progenitors or polydendrocytes) also proliferate after SCI and accumulate in large numbers among astrocytes in the glial scar. Their effect there, if any, is unknown. We show that proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes and glia largely segregate into the fibrotic and glial scars, respectively; therefore, we used a thymidine kinase/ganciclovir paradigm to ablate both dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> cell populations to determine whether either scar was altered. Results reveal that loss of proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes in the lesion prevented intralesion angiogenesis and completely abolished the fibrotic scar. The glial scar was also altered in the absence of acutely dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> cells, displaying discontinuous borders and significantly reduced GFAP density. Collectively, these changes enhanced edema, prolonged hemorrhage, and impaired forelimb functional recovery. Interestingly, after halting GCV at 14 d postinjury, scar elements and vessels entered the lesions over the next 7 d, as did large numbers of axons that were not present in controls. Collectively, these data reveal that acutely dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes and glia play fundamental roles in post-SCI tissue remodeling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by formation of astrocytic and fibrotic scars, both of which are necessary for lesion repair. NG2<sup>+</sup> cells may influence both scar-forming processes. This study used a novel transgenic mouse paradigm to ablate proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> cells after SCI to better understand their role in repair. For the first time, our data show that dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes are required for post-SCI angiogenesis, which in turn is needed for fibrotic scar formation. Moreover, loss of cycling NG2<sup>+</sup> glia and pericytes caused significant multicellular tissue changes, including altered astrocyte responses and impaired functional recovery. This work reveals previously unknown ways in which proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to endogenous repair after SCI.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1351?rss=1">Intraneural Injection of ATP Stimulates Regeneration of Primary Sensory Axons in the Spinal Cord</a></h4>

<p>Injury to the peripheral axons of sensory neurons strongly enhances the regeneration of their central axons in the spinal cord. It remains unclear on what molecules that initiate such conditioning effect. Because ATP is released extracellularly by nerve and other tissue injury, we hypothesize that injection of ATP into a peripheral nerve might mimic the stimulatory effect of nerve injury on the regenerative state of the primary sensory neurons. We found that a single injection of 6 μl of 150 μm ATP into female rat sciatic nerve quadrupled the number of axons growing into a lesion epicenter in spinal cord after a concomitant dorsal column transection. A second boost ATP injection 1 week after the first one markedly reinforced the stimulatory effect of a single injection. Single ATP injection increased expression of phospho-STAT3 and GAP43, two markers of regenerative activity, in sensory neurons. Double ATP injections sustained the activation of phospho-STAT3 and GAP43, which may account for the marked axonal growth across the lesion epicenter. Similar studies performed on P2X7 or P2Y2 receptor knock-out mice indicate P2Y2 receptors are involved in the activation of STAT3 after ATP injection or conditioning lesion, whereas P2X7 receptors are not. Injection of ATP at 150 μm caused little Wallerian degeneration and behavioral tests showed no significant long-term adverse effects on sciatic nerve functions. The results in this study reveal possible mechanisms underlying the stimulation of regenerative programs and suggest a practical strategy for stimulating axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Injury of peripheral axons of sensory neurons has been known to strongly enhance the regeneration of their central axons in the spinal cord. In this study, we found that injection of ATP into a peripheral nerve can mimic the effect of peripheral nerve injury and significantly increase the number of sensory axons growing across lesion epicenter in the spinal cord. ATP injection increased expression of several markers for regenerative activity in sensory neurons, including phospho-STAT3 and GAP43. ATP injection did not cause significant long-term adverse effects on the functions of the injected nerve. These results may lead to clinically applicable strategies for enhancing neuronal responses that support regeneration of injured axons.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1335?rss=1">The Stress-Induced Transcription Factor NR4A1 Adjusts Mitochondrial Function and Synapse Number in Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

<p>The energetic costs of behavioral chronic stress are unlikely to be sustainable without neuronal plasticity. Mitochondria have the capacity to handle synaptic activity up to a limit before energetic depletion occurs. Protective mechanisms driven by the induction of neuronal genes likely evolved to buffer the consequences of chronic stress on excitatory neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC), as this circuitry is vulnerable to excitotoxic insults. Little is known about the genes involved in mitochondrial adaptation to the buildup of chronic stress. Using combinations of genetic manipulations and stress for analyzing structural, transcriptional, mitochondrial, and behavioral outcomes, we characterized NR4A1 as a stress-inducible modifier of mitochondrial energetic competence and dendritic spine number in PFC. NR4A1 acted as a transcription factor for changing the expression of target genes previously involved in mitochondrial uncoupling, AMP-activated protein kinase activation, and synaptic growth. Maintenance of NR4A1 activity by chronic stress played a critical role in the regressive synaptic organization in PFC of mouse models of stress (male only). Knockdown, dominant-negative approach, and knockout of <i>Nr4a1</i> in mice and rats (male only) protected pyramidal neurons against the adverse effects of chronic stress. In human PFC tissues of men and women, high levels of the transcriptionally active NR4A1 correlated with measures of synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. In the context of chronic stress, prolonged expression and activity of NR4A1 may lead to responses of mitochondria and synaptic connectivity that do not match environmental demand, resulting in circuit malfunction between PFC and other brain regions, constituting a pathological feature across disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The bioenergetic cost of chronic stress is too high to be sustainable by pyramidal prefrontal neurons. Cellular checkpoints have evolved to adjust the responses of mitochondria and synapses to the buildup of chronic stress. NR4A1 plays such a role by controlling the energetic competence of mitochondria with respect to synapse number. As an immediate-early gene, <i>Nr4a1</i> promotes neuronal plasticity, but sustained expression or activity can be detrimental. NR4A1 expression and activity is sustained by chronic stress in animal models and in human studies of neuropathologies sensitive to the buildup of chronic stress. Therefore, antagonism of NR4A1 is a promising avenue for preventing the regressive synaptic reorganization in cortical systems in the context of chronic stress.</p>

<p>The pervasive use of distributional semantic models or word embeddings in a
variety of research fields is due to their remarkable ability to represent the
meanings of words for both practical application and cognitive modeling.
However, little has been known about what kind of information is encoded in
text-based word vectors. This lack of understanding is particularly problematic
when word vectors are regarded as a model of semantic representation for
abstract concepts. This paper attempts to reveal the internal information of
distributional word vectors by the analysis using Binder et al.'s (2016)
brain-based vectors, explicitly structured conceptual representations based on
neurobiologically motivated attributes. In the analysis, the mapping from
text-based vectors to brain-based vectors is trained and prediction performance
is evaluated by comparing the estimated and original brain-based vectors. The
analysis demonstrates that social and cognitive information is better encoded
in text-based word vectors, but emotional information is not. This result is
discussed in terms of embodied theories for abstract concepts.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01569">Alleviating catastrophic forgetting using context-dependent gating and synaptic stabilization. (arXiv:1802.01569v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Humans and most animals can learn new tasks without forgetting old ones.
However, training artificial neural networks (ANNs) on new tasks typically
cause it to forget previously learned tasks. This phenomenon is the result of
"catastrophic forgetting", in which training an ANN disrupts connection weights
that were important for solving previous tasks, degrading task performance.
Several recent studies have proposed methods to stabilize connection weights of
ANNs that are deemed most important for solving a task, which helps alleviate
catastrophic forgetting. Here, drawing inspiration from algorithms that are
believed to be implemented in vivo, we propose a complementary method: adding a
context-dependent gating signal, such that only sparse, mostly non-overlapping
patterns of units are active for any one task. This method is easy to
implement, requires little computational overhead, and allows ANNs to maintain
high performance across large numbers of sequentially presented tasks when
combined with weight stabilization. This work provides another example of how
neuroscience-inspired algorithms can benefit ANN design and capability.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>White matter degradation has been proposed as one possible explanation for age-related cognitive decline. In the present study, we examined 2 main questions: 1) Do diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal change in cognition independently or synergistically with amyloid status? 2) Are the effects of diffusion characteristics on longitudinal cognitive change tract-specific or global in nature? Cognitive domains of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed were measured annually (mean follow-up = 3.93 ± 1.25 years). Diffusion tensor imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography were performed at baseline in 265 clinically normal older adults (aged 63–90). Tract-specific diffusion was measured as the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for 9 major white matter tracts. Global diffusion was measured as the mean FA across the 9 white matter tracts. Linear mixed models demonstrated independent, rather than synergistic, effects of global FA and amyloid status on cognitive decline. After controlling for amyloid status, lower global FA was associated with worse longitudinal performance in episodic memory and processing speed, but not executive function. After accounting for global FA, none of the individual tracts predicted a significant change in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that global, rather than tract-specific, diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal cognitive decline independently of amyloid status.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study aimed to determine whether prenatal stress, measured by the number of stressful life events during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, might relate to mood dysregulation and altered brain structure in young adulthood. Participants included 93 young adults from a community-based birth cohort from the Czech Republic. Information on prenatal stress exposure was collected from their mothers in 1990−1992. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mood-related data were collected from the young adults in 2015. MRI analyses focused on overall gray matter (GM) volume and GM volume of cortical regions previously associated with major depression. Higher prenatal stress predicted more mood dysregulation, lower overall GM volume, and lower GM volume in mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus in young adulthood. We observed no prenatal stress by sex interactions for any of the relations. We conclude that prenatal stress is an important risk factor that relates to worse mood states and altered brain structure in young adulthood irrespective of sex. Our results point to the importance and long-lasting effects of prenatal programming and suggest that offspring of mothers who went through substantial stress during pregnancy might benefit from early intervention that would reduce the odds of mental illness in later life.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the mammalian cortex, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons represent 2 major neuronal classes, which establish inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively. Despite differences in their anatomy, physiology and developmental origin, both cell types require support from glial cells, particularly astrocytes, for their growth and survival. Recent experiments indicate that glutamatergic neurons also depend on astrocytes for synapse formation. However, it is not clear if the same holds true for GABAergic neurons. By studying highly pure GABAergic cell cultures, established through fluorescent activated cell sorting, we find that purified GABAergic neurons are smaller and have reduced survival, nevertheless they establish robust synaptic transmission in the absence of glia. Support from glial cells reverses morphological and survival deficits, but does little to alter synaptic transmission. In contrast, in cultures of purified glutamatergic neurons, morphological development, survival and synaptic transmission are collectively dependent on glial support. Thus, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference in the way GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons depend on glia for the establishment of synaptic transmission, a finding that has important implications for our understanding of how neuronal networks develop.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The normal development of thalamocortical connections plays a critical role in shaping brain connectivity in the prenatal and postnatal periods. Recent studies using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in neonates and infants have shown that abnormal thalamocortical connectivity is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, all these studies have focused on a single neuroimaging modality, overlooking the dynamic relationship between structure and function at this early stage. Here, we study the relationship between structural and functional thalamocortical connectivity patterns derived from healthy full-term infants scanned with diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI within the first weeks of life (mean gestational age = 39.3 ± 1.2 weeks; age at scan = 24.2 ± 7.9 days). Our results show that while there is, in general, good spatial agreement between both MRI modalities, there are regional variations that are system-specific: regions involving primary-sensory cortices exhibit greater structural/functional overlap, whereas higher-order association areas such as temporal and posterior parietal cortices show divergence in spatial patterns of each modality. This variability illustrates the complementarity of both modalities and highlights the importance of multimodal approaches.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical spreading depolarization (SD) is the electrophysiological event underlying migraine aura, and a critical contributor to secondary damage after brain injury. Experimental models of SD have been used for decades in migraine and brain injury research; however, they are highly invasive and often cause primary tissue injury, diminishing their translational value. Here we present a non-invasive method to trigger SDs using light-induced depolarization in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons (Thy1-ChR2-YFP). Focal illumination (470 nm, 1–10 mW) through intact skull using an optical fiber evokes power-dependent steady extracellular potential shifts and local elevations of extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] that culminate in an SD when power exceeds a threshold. Using the model, we show that homozygous mice are significantly more susceptible to SD (i.e., lower light thresholds) than heterozygous ChR2 mice. Moreover, we show SD susceptibility differs significantly among cortical divisions (motor, whisker barrel, sensory, visual, in decreasing order of susceptibility), which correlates with relative channelrhodopsin-2 expression. Furthermore, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocks the transition to SD without diminishing extracellular potential shifts. Altogether, our data show that the optogenetic SD model is highly suitable for examining physiological or pharmacological modulation of SD in acute and longitudinal studies.</span>

Neuropeptides commonly signal by metabotropic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In some mollusks and cnidarians, RFamide neuropeptides mediate fast ionotropic signaling by peptide-gated ion channels that belong to the DEG/ENaC family. Here we describe a neuropeptide system with a dual mode of signaling by both a peptide-gated channel and a GPCR. We identified and characterised a peptide-gated channel in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii that is specifically activated by Wamide myoinhibitory peptides derived from the same proneuropeptide. The myoinhibitory peptide-gated ion channel (MGIC) belongs to the DEG/ENaC family and is paralogous to RFamide-gated channels. Platynereis myoinhibitory peptides also activate a previously described GPCR, MAG. We measured the potency of all Wamides on both MGIC and MAG and identified peptides that preferentially activate one or the other receptor. Analysis of a single-cell transcriptome resource indicates that MGIC and MAG signal to distinct target neurons. The identification of a Wamide-gated channel suggests that peptide-gated channels are more diverse and widespread in animals than previously appreciated. The possibility of neuropeptide signaling by both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors to different target cells in the same organism highlights an additional level of complexity in peptidergic signaling networks.

Ribbon synapses of hair cells transmit mechanical information but the transfer characteristics relating deflection of the hair bundle to glutamate release have not been assessed directly. Here we have imaged glutamate to investigate how hair cells encode information in the lateral line of zebrafish. Half the hair cells signalled cupula motion in either direction from rest, achieving maximum sensitivity for deflections of ~40 nm in the preferred direction. The remainder rectified completely and were less sensitive, extending the operating range of the neuromast beyond 1 m. Adaptation was also heterogeneous, with some hair cells generating sustained synaptic outputs and others transient. A unique signal encoded a return to rest: a transient burst from hair cells unresponsive to the initial stimulus. A mixed population of hair cells with these various transfer characteristics will allow a neuromast to encode weak stimuli as well as the amplitude and duration of stronger deflections.

Stress is known to exert its detrimental effects not only by enhancing fear, but also by impairing its extinction. However, in earlier studies stress exposure invariably preceded both processes. Thus, compared to unstressed animals, stressed animals had to extinguish fear memories from higher levels of freezing caused by prior exposure to stress. Here we decouple the two processes to examine if stress specifically impairs fear extinction. Strikingly, when fear memories were formed before stress exposure, thereby allowing animals to initiate extinction from comparable levels of fear, recall of fear extinction was unaffected. Despite this we observed a persistent increase in theta activity in the BLA. Theta activity in the mPFC, by contrast, was normal. Stress also disrupted mPFC-BLA theta-frequency synchrony and directional coupling. Thus, in the absence of the fear-enhancing effects of stress, the expression of fear reflects normal regulation of mPFC activity, not stress-induced hyperactivity in the amygdala.

Episodic memories are rich in sensory information and often contain integrated information from different sensory modalities. For instance, we can store memories of a recent concert with visual and auditory impressions being integrated in one episode. Theta oscillations have recently been implicated in playing a causal role synchronizing and effectively binding the different modalities together in memory. However, an open question is whether momentary fluctuations in theta synchronization predict the likelihood of associative memory formation for multisensory events. To address this question we presented movies and sounds with their luminance and volume modulated at theta (4 Hz), with a phase offset at 0{degrees} or 180{degrees} with respect to each other. This allowed us to entrain the visual and auditory cortex in a synchronous (0{degrees}) or asynchronous manner (180{degrees}). Participants were asked to remember the association between a movie and a sound while having their EEG activity recorded. Associative memory performance was significantly enhanced in the synchronous (0{degrees}) compared to the asynchronous (180{degrees}) condition. Source-level analysis demonstrated that the physical stimuli effectively entrained their respective cortical areas with a corresponding phase offset. Importantly, the strength of entrainment during encoding correlated with the efficacy of associative memory such that small phase differences between visual and auditory cortex predicted a high likelihood of correct retrieval in a later recall test. These findings suggest that theta oscillations serve a specific function in the episodic memory system: Binding the contents of different modalities into coherent memory episodes.

The striatum shows general topographic organization and regional differences in behavioral functions. How corticostriatal topography differs across cortical areas and cell types to support these distinct functions is unclear. This study contrasted corticostriatal projections from two layer 5 cell types, intratelencephalic (IT-type) and pyramidal tract (PT-type) neurons, using viral vectors expressing fluorescent reporters in Cre-driver mice. Long-range corticostriatal projections from sensory and motor cortex are somatotopic, with a decreasing somatotopic specificity as injections move from sensory to motor and frontal areas. Somatotopic organization differs between IT-type and PT-type neurons, including injections in the same site, with IT-type neurons having higher somatotopic stereotypy than PT-type neurons. Furthermore, IT-type projections from interconnected cortical areas have stronger correlations in corticostriatal targeting than PT-type projections do. Thus, as predicted by a long-standing basal ganglia model, corticostriatal projections of interconnected cortical areas form parallel circuits in basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex loops.

Nerve injury often causes neuronal loss and glial proliferation, disrupting the delicate balance between neurons and glial cells in the brain. Recently, we have developed an innovative technology to convert internal reactive glial cells into functional neurons inside the mouse brain. Here, we further demonstrate that such glia-to-neuron conversion can rebalance neuron-glia ratio and reverse glial scar back to neural tissue. Specifically, using a severe stab injury model in the mouse cortex, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes significantly reduced glial reactivity and transformed toxic A1 astrocytes into less harmful astrocytes before neuronal conversion. Importantly, astrocytes were not depleted after neuronal conversion but rather repopulated due to its intrinsic proliferation capability. Remarkably, converting reactive astrocytes into neurons also significantly reduced microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Moreover, accompanying regeneration of new neurons together with repopulation of new astrocytes, blood-brain-barrier was restored and synaptic density was rescued in the injury sites. Together, these results demonstrate that glial scar can be reversed back to neural tissue through rebalancing neuron:glia ratio after glia-to-neuron conversion.

<p>by Peter W. Donhauser, Esther Florin, Sylvain Baillet</p>

Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG, EEG) are essential techniques for studying distributed signal dynamics in the human brain. In particular, the functional role of neural oscillations remains to be clarified. For that reason, imaging methods need to identify distinct brain regions that concurrently generate oscillatory activity, with adequate separation in space and time. Yet, spatial smearing and inhomogeneous signal-to-noise are challenging factors to source reconstruction from external sensor data. The detection of weak sources in the presence of stronger regional activity nearby is a typical complication of MEG/EEG source imaging. We propose a novel, hypothesis-driven source reconstruction approach to address these methodological challenges. The imaging with embedded statistics (iES) method is a subspace scanning technique that constrains the mapping problem to the actual experimental design. A major benefit is that, regardless of signal strength, the contributions from all oscillatory sources, which activity is consistent with the tested hypothesis, are equalized in the statistical maps produced. We present extensive evaluations of iES on group MEG data, for mapping 1) induced oscillations using experimental contrasts, 2) ongoing narrow-band oscillations in the resting-state, 3) co-modulation of brain-wide oscillatory power with a seed region, and 4) co-modulation of oscillatory power with peripheral signals (pupil dilation). Along the way, we demonstrate several advantages of iES over standard source imaging approaches. These include the detection of oscillatory coupling without rejection of zero-phase coupling, and detection of ongoing oscillations in deeper brain regions, where signal-to-noise conditions are unfavorable. We also show that iES provides a separate evaluation of oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization in experimental contrasts, which has important statistical advantages. The flexibility of iES allows it to be adjusted to many experimental questions in systems neuroscience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TNJ39uqAYcw" width="1" />

<p>by Volker Pernice, Rava Azeredo da Silveira</p>

Neural populations respond to the repeated presentations of a sensory stimulus with correlated variability. These correlations have been studied in detail, with respect to their mechanistic origin, as well as their influence on stimulus discrimination and on the performance of population codes. A number of theoretical studies have endeavored to link network architecture to the nature of the correlations in neural activity. Here, we contribute to this effort: in models of circuits of stochastic neurons, we elucidate the implications of various network architectures—recurrent connections, shared feed-forward projections, and shared gain fluctuations—on the stimulus dependence in correlations. Specifically, we derive mathematical relations that specify the dependence of population-averaged covariances on firing rates, for different network architectures. In turn, these relations can be used to analyze data on population activity. We examine recordings from neural populations in mouse auditory cortex. We find that a recurrent network model with random effective connections captures the observed statistics. Furthermore, using our circuit model, we investigate the relation between network parameters, correlations, and how well different stimuli can be discriminated from one another based on the population activity. As such, our approach allows us to relate properties of the neural circuit to information processing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ANUis3AuuHE" width="1" />

<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Astrocytes fulfill neuronal trophic roles normally, but are transformed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) into A1-type reactive astrocytes that may destroy neurons through unknown mechanisms. <b>Methods</b>: To investigate astrocyte inflammatory mechanisms, astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) were isolated immunochemically from plasmas of AD patients and matched controls for ELISA quantification of complement proteins. <b>Results</b>: ADE levels of C1q, C4b, C3d, factor B, factor D, Bb, C3b and C5b-C9 terminal complement complex (TCC), but not mannose-binding lectin (MBL), normalized by the CD81 exosome marker were significantly higher for AD patients (n=28) than age- and gender-matched controls (all p&lt;0.0001). ADE normalized levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly higher for AD patients than controls, but there was greater overlap between the two groups than for complement proteins. Mean ADE levels of complement proteins for AD patients in a longitudinal study were significantly higher (n=16, p&lt;0.0001) at the AD2 stage of moderate dementia than at the AD1 preclinical stage five to 12 years earlier, which were the same as for controls. ADE levels of complement regulatory proteins CD59, CD46, decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and complement receptor type 1 (CR1), but not factor I, were significantly lower for AD patients than controls (p&lt;0.0001 for CD59 and DAF), were diminished by the AD1 stage and were further decreased at the AD2 stage. <b>Interpretation</b>: ADE complement effector proteins in AD are produced by dysregulated systems, attain higher levels than in controls, and may potentially damage neurons in the late inflammatory phase of AD.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Introduction</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antibody encephalitis is mediated by IgG-autoantibodies directed against the NR1-subunit of the NMDAR. Around 20% of patients have an underlying ovarian teratoma, and the condition responds to early immunotherapies and ovarian teratoma removal. However, despite clear therapeutic relevance, mechanisms of NR1-IgG production and the contribution of germinal center B cells to NR1-IgG levels are unknown.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Clinical data and longitudinal paired serum NR1-reactive IgM and IgG levels from ten patients with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis were determined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these ten patients, and two available ovarian teratomas, were stimulated with combinations of immune factors, and tested for secretion of total IgG and NR1-antibodies.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In addition to disease-defining NR1-IgG, serum NR1-IgM were found in 6/10 patients. NR1-IgM levels were typically highest around disease onset, and detected for several months into the disease course. Moreover, circulating patient B cells were differentiated into CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>++</sup>CD38<sup>++</sup> antibody-secreting cells <em>in vitro</em> and, in 90% of patients, secreted NR1-IgM and NR1-IgG. Secreted levels of NR1-IgG correlated with serum NR1-IgG (p&lt;0.0001) and this was observed across the varying disease durations, suggestive of an ongoing process. Furthermore, ovarian teratoma tissue contained infiltrating lymphocytes which produced NR1-IgG in culture.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Persistent serum NR1-IgM and NR1-IgG, alongside the consistent production of NR1-IgG from circulating B cells and from ovarian teratomas suggest ongoing germinal center-reactions may account for the peripheral cell populations which secrete NR1-IgG. Cells participating in germinal center reactions might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25145-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Gray matter (GM) atrophy occurs in all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes. We investigated whether there is a spatiotemporal pattern of GM atrophy that is associated with faster disability accumulation in MS.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25145-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We analyzed 3,604 brain high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans from 1,417 participants: 1,214 MS patients (253 clinically isolated syndrome [CIS], 708 relapsing-remitting [RRMS], 128 secondary-progressive [SPMS], and 125 primary-progressive [PPMS]), over an average follow-up of 2.41 years (standard deviation [SD] = 1.97), and 203 healthy controls (HCs; average follow-up = 1.83 year; SD = 1.77), attending seven European centers. Disability was assessed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem, and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25145-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>SPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio = 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.65, 0.82; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (–1.45%), PPMS (–1.66%), and RRMS (–1.34%) than CIS (–0.88%) and HCs (–0.94%; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01). The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (–1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (–0.76%), CIS (–0.75%), and HCs (–0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (–1.24-%) was faster than CIS (–0.63%) and HCs (–0.23%; all <em>p</em> values &lt;0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta = 0.04; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25145-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>This large, multicenter and longitudinal study shows that DGM volume loss drives disability accumulation in MS, and that temporal cortical GM shows accelerated atrophy in SPMS than RRMS. The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions. Ann Neurol 2018</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital nondystrophic myopathies and is characterized by muscle weakness, often from birth. Mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> are a frequent cause of NM (ie, NEM3). <em>ACTA1</em> encodes alpha-actin 1, the main constituent of the sarcomeric thin filament. The mechanisms by which mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> contribute to muscle weakness in NEM3 are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that sarcomeric dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness in NEM3 patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>To test this hypothesis, we performed contractility measurements in individual muscle fibers and myofibrils obtained from muscle biopsies of 14 NEM3 patients with different <em>ACTA1</em> mutations. To identify the structural basis for impaired contractility, low angle X-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy were applied.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Our findings reveal that muscle fibers of NEM3 patients display a reduced maximal force-generating capacity, which is caused by dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in the majority of patients, as revealed by contractility measurements in myofibrils. Low angle X-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy indicate that dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in NEM3 patients involves a lower number of myosin heads binding to actin during muscle activation. This lower number is not the result of reduced thin filament length. Interestingly, the calcium sensitivity of force is unaffected in some patients, but decreased in others.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Dysfunctional sarcomere contractility is an important contributor to muscle weakness in the majority of NEM3 patients.

<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>We evaluated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is able to enhance dysphagia rehabilitation following stroke. Besides relating clinical effects with neuroplastic changes in cortical swallowing processing, we aimed to identify factors influencing treatment success.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>In this double-blind, randomized study, 60 acute dysphagic stroke patients received contralesional anodal (1mA, 20 minutes) or sham tDCS on 4 consecutive days. Swallowing function was thoroughly assessed before and after the intervention using the validated Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS) and clinical assessment. In 10 patients, swallowing-related brain activation was recorded applying magnetoencephalography before and after the intervention. Voxel-based statistical lesion pattern analysis was also performed.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Study groups did not differ according to demographic data, stroke characteristics, or baseline dysphagia severity. Patients treated with tDCS showed greater improvement in FEDSS than the sham group (1.3 vs 0.4 points, mean difference = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4–1.4, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0005). Functional recovery was accompanied by a significant increase of activation (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in the contralesional swallowing network after real but not sham tDCS. Regarding predictors of treatment success, for every hour earlier that treatment was initiated, there was greater improvement on the FEDSS (adjusted odds ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98–1.00, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in multivariate analysis. Stroke location in the right insula and operculum was indicative of worse response to tDCS (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Application of tDCS over the contralesional swallowing motor cortex supports swallowing network reorganization, thereby leading to faster rehabilitation of acute poststroke dysphagia.

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in human
beings, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current
standard of care includes interventional catheter ablation in selected
patients, but the success rate is limited. The major limitation of the current
approach to AF is the lack of fundamental understanding of its underlying
mechanism. Specifically, it remains unclear whether human AF dynamics are a
deterministic or a stochastic process. Here we assess for determinism in human
AF by evaluating the properties of the symbolic representation of intracardiac
electrical recordings obtained from patients. Specifically, we evaluate (a) the
number of the missing ordinal patterns, (b) the rate of missing ordinal pattern
decay for increased length of the time series, and (c) the causal-entropy
complexity plane of the Bandt-Pompe symbolic representation. When used
together, these are powerful tools to detect determinism, even in the presence
of experimental noise and brief time series.

<p>`Bursting', defined as periods of high frequency firing of a neuron separated
by periods of quiescence, has been observed in various neuronal systems, both
\textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}. It has been associated with a range of
neuronal processes, including efficient information transfer and the formation
of functional networks during development, and has been shown to be sensitive
to genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Accurate detection of periods of
bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both
spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity. A wide variety of
computational methods have been developed to detect periods of bursting in
spike trains recorded from neuronal networks. In this chapter, we review
several of the most popular and successful of these methods.

<p>Music, being a multifaceted stimulus evolving at multiple timescales,
modulates brain function in a manifold way that encompasses not only the
distinct stages of auditory perception but also higher cognitive processes like
memory and appraisal. Network theory is apparently a promising approach to
describe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during
music listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined
within the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Using naturalistic
music, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with
different cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface EEG
measurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to
quantify the interplay among rhythms. It was also contrasted against the
structure from the rest and noise listening conditions to reveal the specific
components stemming from music listening. Our methodology includes an efficient
graph-partitioning algorithm, which is further utilized for mining prototypical
modular patterns, and a novel algorithmic procedure for identifying switching
nodes that consistently change module during music listening. Our results
suggest the multiplex character of the music-induced functional reorganization
and particularly indicate the dependence between the networks reconstructed
from the {\delta} and {\beta}H rhythms. This dependence is further justified
within the framework of nested neural oscillations and fits perfectly within
the context of recently introduced cortical entrainment to music. Considering
its computational efficiency, and in conjunction with the flexibility of in
situ electroencephalography, it may lead to novel assistive tools for real-life
applications.

<p>Certain concepts, words, and images are intuitively more similar than others
(dog vs. cat, dog vs. spoon), though quantifying such similarity is notoriously
difficult. Indeed, this kind of computation is likely a critical part of
learning the category boundaries for words within a given language. Here, we
use a set of 27 items (e.g. 'dog') that are highly common in infants' input,
and use both image- and word-based algorithms to independently compute
similarity among them. We find three key results. First, the pairwise item
similarities derived within image-space and word-space are correlated,
suggesting preserved structure among these extremely different representational
formats. Second, the closest 'neighbors' for each item, within each space,
showed significant overlap (e.g. both found 'egg' as a neighbor of 'apple').
Third, items with the most overlapping neighbors are later-learned by infants
and toddlers. We conclude that this approach, which does not rely on human
ratings of similarity, may nevertheless reflect stable within-class structure
across these two spaces. We speculate that such invariance might aid lexical
acquisition, by serving as an informative marker of category boundaries.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We recently reported that right-side dominance of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in self-body recognition (proprioceptive illusion) task emerges during adolescence in typical human development. Here, we extend this finding by demonstrating that functional lateralization to the right IPL also develops during adolescence in another self-body (specifically a self-face) recognition task. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 60 right-handed healthy children (8–11 years), adolescents (12–15 years), and adults (18–23 years; 20 per group) while they judged whether a presented face was their own (Self) or that of somebody else (Other). We also analyzed fMRI data collected while they performed proprioceptive illusion task. All participants performed self-face recognition with high accuracy. Among brain regions where self-face-related activity (Self vs. Other) developed, only right IPL activity developed predominantly for self-face processing, with no substantial involvement in other-face processing. Adult-like right-dominant use of IPL emerged during adolescence, but was not yet present in childhood. Adult-like common activation between the tasks also emerged during adolescence. Adolescents showing stronger right-lateralized IPL activity during illusion also showed this during self-face recognition. Our results suggest the importance of the right IPL in neuronal processing of information associated with one’s own body in typically developing humans.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in awake marmoset (<span style="font-style: italic;">Callithrix jacchus</span>), an arboreal animal for which spatial processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory cortex.</span>

Moreover, PDK1 deletion disrupted the distribution of Reelin<sup>+</sup> cells and decreased the level of <span style="font-style: italic;">Reelin</span> mRNA which may contribute to the defective migration of progenitor cells and the disrupted radial glial scaffolds. Furthermore, the inhibition of GSK3β activity partially restored the decreased proliferation of primary neural stem cells in vitro.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical resting state networks have been consistently identified in infants using resting state-functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Comparable studies in adults have demonstrated cerebellar components of well-established cerebral networks. However, there has been limited investigation of early cerebellar functional connectivity. We acquired non-sedated rs-fMRI data in the first week of life in 57 healthy, term-born infants and at term-equivalent postmenstrual age in 20 very preterm infants (mean birth gestational age 27 ± 2 weeks) without significant cerebral or cerebellar injury. Seed correlation analyses were performed using regions of interests spanning the cortical and subcortical gray matter and cerebellum. Parallel analyses were performed using rs-fMRI data acquired in 100 healthy adults. Our results demonstrate that cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity is well-established by term. Intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity were largely similar in infants and adults. However, infants showed more functional connectivity structure within the cerebellum, including stronger homotopic correlations and more robust anterior–posterior anticorrelations. Prematurity was associated with reduced correlation magnitudes, but no alterations in intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity topography. These results add to the growing evidence that the cerebellum plays an important role in shaping early brain development during infancy.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) vary widely between individuals and are associated with intellectual ability and risk for various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Factors influencing this variability remain poorly understood, but the radial unit hypothesis, as well as the more recent supragranular cortex expansion hypothesis, suggests that prenatal and perinatal influences may be particularly important. In this report, we examine the impact of 17 major demographic and obstetric history variables on interindividual variation in CT and SA in a unique sample of 805 neonates who received MRI scans of the brain around 2 weeks of age. Birth weight, postnatal age at MRI, gestational age at birth, and sex emerged as important predictors of SA. Postnatal age at MRI, paternal education, and maternal ethnicity emerged as important predictors of CT. These findings suggest that individual variation in infant CT and SA is explained by different sets of environmental factors with neonatal SA more strongly influenced by sex and obstetric history and CT more strongly influenced by socioeconomic and ethnic disparities. Findings raise the possibility that interventions aimed at reducing disparities and improving obstetric outcomes may alter prenatal/perinatal cortical development.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Radial migration of cortical projection neurons is a prerequisite for shaping a distinct multilayered cerebral cortex during mammalian corticogenesis. Members of Rab GTPases family were reported to regulate radial migration. Here, in vivo conditional knockout or in utero knockdown (KD) of Rab23 in mice neocortex causes aberrant polarity and halted migration of cortical projection neurons. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism reveals down-regulation of N-cadherin in the Rab23-deficient neurons, which is a cell adhesion protein previously known to modulate radial migration. (Shikanai M, Nakajima K, Kawauchi T. 2011. N-cadherin regulates radial glial fiber-dependent migration of cortical locomoting neurons. Commun Integr Biol. 4:326–330.) Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) also decreases the expression of N-cadherin, implicating an upstream effect of ERK1/2 on N-cadherin and also suggesting a link between Rab23 and ERK1/2. Further biochemical studies show that silencing of Rab23 impedes activation of ERK1/2 via perturbed platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFRα) signaling. Restoration of the expression of Rab23 or N-cadherin in Rab23-KD neurons could reverse neuron migration defects, indicating that Rab23 modulates migration through N-cadherin. These studies suggest that cortical neuron migration is mediated by a molecular hierarchy downstream of Rab23 via N-cadherin.</span>

Mycolactone is the exotoxin produced by <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> and is the virulence factor behind the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer. The toxin has a broad spectrum of biological effects within the host organism, stemming from its interaction with at least two molecular targets and the inhibition of protein uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it has been shown that the toxin can passively permeate into host cells, it is clearly lipophilic. Association with lipid carriers would have substantial implications for the toxin’s distribution within a host organism, delivery to cellular targets, diagnostic susceptibility, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. Yet the toxin’s interactions with, and distribution in, lipids are unknown. Herein we have used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, guided by all-atom simulations, to study the interaction of mycolactone with pure and mixed lipid membranes. Using established techniques, we calculated the toxin’s preferential localization, membrane translocation, and impact on membrane physical and dynamical properties. The computed water-octanol partition coefficient indicates that mycolactone prefers to be in an organic phase rather than in an aqueous environment. Our results show that in a solvated membrane environment the exotoxin mainly localizes in the water-membrane interface, with a preference for the glycerol moiety of lipids, consistent with the reported studies that found it in lipid extracts of the cell. The calculated association constant to the model membrane is similar to the reported association constant for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Mycolactone is shown to modify the physical properties of membranes, lowering the transition temperature, compressibility modulus, and critical line tension at which pores can be stabilized. It also shows a tendency to behave as a linactant, a molecule that localizes at the boundary between different fluid lipid domains in membranes and promotes inter-mixing of domains. This property has implications for the toxin’s cellular access, T-cell immunosuppression, and therapeutic potential.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LYJj4QzsN_A" width="1" />

<p>by Caitlin Collins, Xavier Didelot</p>

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in microbial organisms have the potential to vastly improve the way we understand, manage, and treat infectious diseases. Yet, microbial GWAS methods established thus far remain insufficiently able to capitalise on the growing wealth of bacterial and viral genetic sequence data. Facing clonal population structure and homologous recombination, existing GWAS methods struggle to achieve both the precision necessary to reject spurious findings and the power required to detect associations in microbes. In this paper, we introduce a novel phylogenetic approach that has been tailor-made for microbial GWAS, which is applicable to organisms ranging from purely clonal to frequently recombining, and to both binary and continuous phenotypes. Our approach is robust to the confounding effects of both population structure and recombination, while maintaining high statistical power to detect associations. Thorough testing via application to simulated data provides strong support for the power and specificity of our approach and demonstrates the advantages offered over alternative cluster-based and dimension-reduction methods. Two applications to <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> illustrate the versatility and potential of our method, confirming previously-identified penicillin resistance loci and resulting in the identification of both well-characterised and novel drivers of invasive disease. Our method is implemented as an open-source R package called treeWAS which is freely available at https://github.com/caitiecollins/treeWAS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OLN5pMOESlw" width="1" />

<p>by Pau Farré, Eldon Emberly</p>

The packaging of DNA inside a nucleus shows complex structure stabilized by a host of DNA-bound factors. Both the distribution of these factors and the contacts between different genomic locations of the DNA can now be measured on a genome-wide scale. This has advanced the development of models aimed at predicting the conformation of DNA given only the locations of bound factors—the chromatin folding problem. Here we present a maximum-entropy model that is able to predict a contact map representation of structure given a sequence of bound factors. Non-local effects due to the sequence neighborhood around contacting sites are found to be important for making accurate predictions. Lastly, we show that the model can be used to infer a sequence of bound factors given only a measurement of structure. This opens up the possibility for efficiently predicting sequence regions that may play a role in generating cell-type specific structural differences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O5rA1JNPMq0" width="1" />

<p>by Ximing Li, William R. Holmes</p>

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) holoenzymes play a critical role in decoding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in neurons. Understanding how this occurs has been the focus of numerous studies including many that use models. However, CaMKII is notoriously difficult to simulate in detail because of its multi-subunit nature, which causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of species that must be modeled. To study the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-CaMKII reaction network with detailed kinetics while including the effect of diffusion, we have customized an existing stochastic particle-based simulator, Smoldyn, to manage the problem of combinatorial explosion. With this new method, spatial and temporal aspects of the signaling network can be studied without compromising biochemical details. We used this new method to examine how calmodulin molecules, both partially loaded and fully loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, choose pathways to interact with and activate CaMKII under various Ca<sup>2+</sup> input conditions. We found that the dependence of CaMKII phosphorylation on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal frequency is intrinsic to the network kinetics and the activation pattern can be modulated by the relative amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin and by the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion. Depending on whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is saturating or not, calmodulin molecules could choose different routes within the network to activate CaMKII subunits, resulting in different frequency dependence patterns. In addition, the size of the holoenzyme produces a subtle effect on CaMKII activation. The more extended the subunits are organized, the easier for calmodulin molecules to access and activate the subunits. The findings suggest that particular intracellular environmental factors such as crowding and calmodulin availability can play an important role in decoding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and can give rise to distinct CaMKII activation patterns in dendritic spines, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel nanodomains and cytoplasm.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yb7HPOwKnGo" width="1" />

<p>Byrne and colleagues present a paper on a timely topic with potentially
important results. However, we think that issues in the design and analysis
complicate the interpretation and limit the generalizability of the findings.
Specifically, the details of the small volume correction used in the primary
analysis are not adequately described and, moreover, the results do not appear
to be corroborated by the whole-brain analysis. In addition, the follow-up
multilevel modeling, which is fundamental to the conclusions of the paper, is
inherently circular thereby guaranteeing discovery of the reported effect.
Finally, the study does not control for other factors that vary over the course
of the day and are known to impact MRI measurements, and fails to link the
neural results directly to any relevant behavior.

<p>The hippocampus and the striatum support episodic and procedural memory,
respectively, and "place" and "response" learning within spatial navigation.
Recently this dichotomy has been linked to "model-based" and "model-free"
reinforcement learning. Here we present a well-constrained neural model of how
both systems support spatial navigation, and apply the same model to more
abstract problems such as sequential decision making. In particular, we show
that if a task can be transformed into a Markov Decision Process, the machinery
provided by the hippocampus and striatum can be utilized to solve it. These
results show how the hippocampal complex can represent non-spatial problems,
including context, probabilities and action-dependent information, in support
of "model-based" reinforcement learning to complement learning within the
striatum.

<p>Many recent efforts in computational modeling of macro-scale brain dynamics
have begun to take a data-driven approach by incorporating structural and/or
functional information derived from subject data. Here, we discuss recent work
using personalized brain network models to study structure-function
relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such
models and show how this computational approach can provide previously
unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments.
Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be
used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical
outcomes in epilepsy.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09133">Neurofeedback Tunes Scale-Free Dynamics in Spontaneous Brain Activity. (arXiv:1512.09133v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Brain oscillations exhibit long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), which
reflect the regularity of their fluctuations: low values representing more
random (decorrelated) while high values more persistent (correlated) dynamics.
LRTCs constitute supporting evidence that the brain operates near criticality,
a state where neuronal activities are balanced between order and randomness.
Here, healthy adults used closed-loop brain training (neurofeedback, NFB) to
reduce the amplitude of alpha oscillations, producing a significant increase in
spontaneous LRTCs post-training. This effect was reproduced in patients with
post-traumatic stress disorder, where abnormally random dynamics were reversed
by NFB, correlating with significant improvements in hyperarousal. Notably,
regions manifesting abnormally low LRTCs (i.e., excessive randomness)
normalized toward healthy population levels, consistent with theoretical
predictions about self-organized criticality. Hence, when exposed to
appropriate training, spontaneous cortical activity reveals a residual capacity
for "self-tuning" its own temporal complexity, despite manifesting the abnormal
dynamics seen in individuals with psychiatric disorder. Lastly, we observed an
inverse-U relationship between strength of LRTC and oscillation amplitude,
suggesting a breakdown of long-range dependence at high/low synchronization
extremes, in line with recent computational models. Together, our findings
offer a broader mechanistic framework for motivating research and clinical
applications of NFB, encompassing disorders with perturbed LRTCs.

The biological basis of consciousness is one of the most challenging and fundamental questions in 21st century science. A related pursuit aims to identify the neural correlates and causes of unconsciousness. We review current trends in the investigation of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological states of unconsciousness at the level of large-scale functional brain networks. We focus on the roles of brain connectivity, repertoire, graph-theoretical techniques, and neural dynamics in understanding the functional brain disconnections and reduced complexity that appear to characterize these states.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors (D<sub>2</sub>Rs) contribute to the inverted U-shaped relationship between dopamine signaling and prefrontal function. Genetic networks from post-mortem human brain revealed 84 partner genes co-expressed with <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span>. Moreover, eight functional single nucleotide polymorphisms combined into a polygenic co-expression index (PCI) predicted co-expression of this <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> network and were associated with prefrontal function in humans. Here, we investigated the non-linear association of the PCI with behavioral and Working Memory (WM) related brain response to pharmacological D<sub>2</sub>Rs stimulation. Fifty healthy volunteers took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional MRI (fMRI) study with bromocriptine and performed the N-Back task. The PCI by drug interaction was significant on both WM behavioral scores (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.046) and related prefrontal activity (all corrected <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.05) using a polynomial PCI model. Non-linear responses under placebo were reversed by bromocriptine administration. fMRI results on placebo were replicated in an independent sample of 50 participants who did not receive drug administration (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.034). These results match earlier evidence in non-human primates and confirm the physiological relevance of this <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> co-expression network. Results show that in healthy subjects, different alleles evaluated as an ensemble are associated with non-linear prefrontal responses. Therefore, brain response to a dopaminergic drug may depend on a complex system of allelic patterns associated with <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> co-expression.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>How the variety of neurons that organize into neocortical layers and functional areas arises is a central question in the study of cortical development. While both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are known to influence this process, whether distinct neuronal progenitor groups contribute to neuron diversity and allocation is poorly understood. Using in vivo genetic fate-mapping combined with whole-cell patch clamp recording, we show that the firing pattern and apical dendritic morphology of excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are specified in part by their neural precursor lineage. Further, we show that separate precursors contribute to unique features of barrel cortex topography including the intralaminar position and thalamic innervation of the neurons they generate. Importantly, many of these lineage-specified characteristics are different from those previously measured for pyramidal neurons in layers 2–3 of the frontal cortex. Collectively, our data elucidate a dynamic temporal program in neuronal precursors that fine-tunes the properties of their progeny according to the lamina of destination.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Rhythmic synchronization of neurons is known to affect neuronal interactions. In the motor system, oscillatory power fluctuations modulate corticospinal excitability. However, previous research addressing phase-specific gain modulation in the motor system has resulted in contradictory findings. It remains unclear how many time windows of increased responsiveness each oscillatory cycle provides. Moreover, we still lack conclusive evidence as to whether the motor cortex entails an intrinsic response modulation along the rhythm cycle, as shown for spinal neurons. We investigated this question with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex at rest. Application of near-motor threshold stimuli revealed a frequency- and phase-specific gain modulation at both cortical and spinal level, independent of the spontaneous oscillatory power fluctuations at each level. We detected bilateral sensorimotor circuits in the lower beta-band (14–17 Hz) and unilateral corticospinal circuits in the upper beta-band (20–24 Hz). These findings provide novel evidence that intrinsic activity in the human motor cortex modulates input gain along the beta oscillatory cycle within distinct circuits. In accordance with periodic alternations of synchronous hyper- and depolarization, increased neuronal responsiveness occurred once per oscillatory beta cycle. This information may lead to new brain state-dependent and circuit-specific interventions for targeted neuromodulation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence consistent with the supportive role of eye movement in neural reactivation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Flexible interactions between brain regions enable neural systems to adaptively transfer and process information. However, the neural substrates that regulate adaptive communications between brain regions are understudied. In this human fMRI study, we investigated this issue by tracking time-varying, task-evoked changes in functional connectivity between localized occipitotemporal regions while participants performed different tasks on the same visually presented stimuli. We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal and the primary visual regions selectively increased during the processing of task-relevant information. Further, additional task demands selectively strengthen these targeted connectivity patterns. To identify candidate regions that contribute to this increase in inter-regional coupling, we regressed the task-specific time-varying connectivity strength between primary visual and occipitotemporal regions against voxel-wise activity patterns elsewhere in the brain. This allowed us to identify a set of frontal and parietal regions whose activity increased as a function of task-evoked functional connectivity. These results suggest that frontoparietal regions may provide top-down biasing signals to influence task-specific interactions between brain regions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Creativity is the ability to see the world in new ways. Creative individuals exhibit the ability to switch between different modes of thinking and shift their mental focus. This suggests a connection between creativity and dynamic interactions of brain networks. We report here the first investigation into the relationship between the reconfiguration of dynamic brain networks during the resting state and verbal creativity using two fMRI datasets involving 574 subjects. We find that verbal creativity correlates with temporal variability of the functional-connectivity (FC) patterns of the lateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. High variability of these regions indicates flexible connectivity patterns which may facilitate executive functions. Furthermore, verbal creativity correlates with the temporal variability of FC patterns within the default mode network (DMN), between the DMN and attention/sensorimotor network, and between control and sensory networks. High variability of FCs between the DMN and attention networks characterizes frequent adjustments of attention. Finally, dynamic interaction between the cerebellum and task control network also contributes to verbal creativity, suggesting a relationship between the cerebellum and creativity. This study reveals a close relationship between verbal creativity and high variability of cortical networks involved in spontaneous thought, attention and cognitive control.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Several human imaging studies have suggested that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is highly active when participants receive competing inputs, and that these signals may be important for influencing the downstream planning of actions. Despite increasing evidence from several neuroimaging studies, no study has examined ACC activity at the level of the single neuron in rodents performing similar tasks. To fill this gap, we recorded from single neurons in ACC while rats performed a stop-change task. We found higher firing on trials with competing inputs (STOP trials), and that firing rates were positively correlated with accuracy and movement speed, suggesting that when ACC was engaged, rats tended to slow down and perform better. Finally, firing was the strongest when STOP trials were preceded by GO trials and was reduced when rats adapted their behavior on trials subsequent to a STOP trial.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuron-glial related cell adhesion molecule NrCAM is a newly identified negative regulator of spine density that genetically interacts with Semaphorin3F (Sema3F), and is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To investigate a role for NrCAM in spine pruning during the critical adolescent period when networks are established, we generated novel conditional, inducible NrCAM mutant mice (Nex1Cre-ERT2: NrCAMflox/flox). We demonstrate that NrCAM functions cell autonomously during adolescence in pyramidal neurons to restrict spine density in the visual (V1) and medial frontal cortex (MFC). Guided by molecular modeling, we found that NrCAM promoted clustering of the Sema3F holoreceptor complex by interfacing with Neuropilin-2 (Npn2) and PDZ scaffold protein SAP102. NrCAM-induced receptor clustering stimulated the Rap-GAP activity of PlexinA3 (PlexA3) within the holoreceptor complex, which in turn, inhibited Rap1-GTPase and inactivated adhesive β1 integrins, essential for Sema3F-induced spine pruning. These results define a developmental function for NrCAM in Sema3F receptor signaling that limits dendritic spine density on cortical pyramidal neurons during adolescence.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the ongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations. A simple analytic account for how fast spike time correlations affect both microscopic and macroscopic network structure is lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory for STDP in recurrent networks and show the emergence of assemblies of strongly coupled neurons with shared stimulus preferences. After training, this connectivity is actively reinforced by spike train correlations during the spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding. Assembly formation has often been associated with firing rate-based plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary framework, where fine temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain learned structure in cortical networks.</span>

A significant portion of bone fractures fail to heal properly, increasing healthcare costs. Advances in fracture management have slowed because translation barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to facilitate discovery of biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models—Callus Analogs—were created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing an alternative way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80×80 μm region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog—a theory—of the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve ≥ 70% Similarity. We used an iterative refinement protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73–90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2–4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83–94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a fresh medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qhxB-qfzMYk" width="1" />

<p>by Bandan Chakrabortty, Ikram Blilou, Ben Scheres, Bela M. Mulder</p>

Plant morphogenesis is strongly dependent on the directional growth and the subsequent oriented division of individual cells. It has been shown that the plant cortical microtubule array plays a key role in controlling both these processes. This ordered structure emerges as the collective result of stochastic interactions between large numbers of dynamic microtubules. To elucidate this complex self-organization process a number of analytical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of cortical microtubules have been proposed. To date, however, these models have been restricted to two dimensional planes or geometrically simple surfaces in three dimensions, which strongly limits their applicability as plant cells display a wide variety of shapes. This limitation is even more acute, as both local as well as global geometrical features of cells are expected to influence the overall organization of the array. Here we describe a framework for efficiently simulating microtubule dynamics on triangulated approximations of arbitrary three dimensional surfaces. This allows the study of microtubule array organization on realistic cell surfaces obtained by segmentation of microscopic images. We validate the framework against expected or known results for the spherical and cubical geometry. We then use it to systematically study the individual contributions of global geometry, cell-edge induced catastrophes and cell-face induced stability to array organization in a cuboidal geometry. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze the highly non-trivial geometry of leaf pavement cells of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and <i>Hedera helix</i>. We show that our simulations can predict multiple features of the microtubule array structure in these cells, revealing, among others, strong constraints on the orientation of division planes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ogXqfE-FHg" width="1" />

<p>A key question in modern neuroscience is how cognitive changes in a human
brain can be quantified and captured by functional connectomes (FC) . A
systematic approach to measure pairwise functional distance at different brain
states is lacking. This would provide a straight-forward way to quantify
differences in cognitive processing across tasks; also, it would help in
relating these differences in task-based FCs to the underlying structural
network. Here we propose a framework, based on Jensen-Shannon divergence,to map
the task-rest connectivity divergence between tasks and resting-state FC. We
show how this information theoretical measure allows for quantifying
connectivity changes in distributed and centralized processing in functional
networks. We study resting-state and seven tasks from the Human Connectome
Project dataset to obtain the most divergent links across tasks. We investigate
how these changes are associated to different functional brain networks, and
use the proposed measure to infer changes in the information processing
regimes. Furthermore, we show how the FC divergence with respect to resting
state is shaped by structural connectivity, and to what extent this
relationship depends on the task. This framework provides a well grounded
mathematical quantification of connectivity changes associated to cognitive
processing in large-scale brain networks.

<p>The dynamics of networks of neuronal cultures has been recently shown to be
strongly dependent on the network geometry and in particular on their
dimensionality. However, this phenomenon has been so far mostly unexplored from
the theoretical point of view. Here we reveal the rich interplay between
network geometry and synchronization of coupled oscillators in the context of a
simplicial complex model of manifolds called Complex Network Manifold. The
networks generated by this model combine small world properties (infinite
Hausdorff dimension) and a high modular structure with finite and tunable
spectral dimension. We show that the networks display frustrated
synchronization for a wide range of the coupling strength of the oscillators,
and that the synchronization properties are directly affected by the spectral
dimension of the network.

<p>In this work we study the excitatory AMPA, and NMDA, and inhibitory GABAA
receptor mediated dynamical changes in neuronal networks of neonatal rat cortex
in vitro. Extracellular network-wide activity was recorded with 59 planar
electrodes simultaneously under different pharmacological conditions. We
analyzed the changes of overall network activity and network-wide burst
frequency between baseline and AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) or NMDA receptor (NMDA-R)
driven activity, as well as between the latter states and disinhibited
activity. Additionally, spatiotemporal structures of pharmacologically modified
bursts and recruitment of electrodes during the network bursts were studied.
Our results show that AMPA-R and NMDA-R receptors have clearly distinct roles
in network dynamics. AMPA-Rs are in greater charge to initiate network wide
bursts. Therefore NMDA-Rs maintain the already initiated activity. GABAA
receptors (GABAA-Rs) inhibit AMPA-R driven network activity more strongly than
NMDA-R driven activity during the bursts.

<p>by Fei Qi, Magdalena Motz, Kirsten Jung, Jürgen Lassak, Dmitrij Frishman</p>

Translation of consecutive prolines causes ribosome stalling, which is alleviated but cannot be fully compensated by the elongation factor P. However, the presence of polyproline motifs in about one third of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> proteins underlines their potential functional importance, which remains largely unexplored. We conducted an evolutionary analysis of polyproline motifs in the proteomes of 43 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains and found evidence of evolutionary selection against translational stalling, which is especially pronounced in proteins with high translational efficiency. Against the overall trend of polyproline motif loss in evolution, we observed their enrichment in the vicinity of translational start sites, in the inter-domain regions of multi-domain proteins, and downstream of transmembrane helices. Our analysis demonstrates that the time gain caused by ribosome pausing at polyproline motifs might be advantageous in protein regions bracketing domains and transmembrane helices. Polyproline motifs might therefore be crucial for co-translational folding and membrane insertion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDkLZ5Cs-1M" width="1" />

Bioinformatics is recognized as part of the essential knowledge base of numerous career paths in biomedical research and healthcare. However, there is little agreement in the field over what that knowledge entails or how best to provide it. These disagreements are compounded by the wide range of populations in need of bioinformatics training, with divergent prior backgrounds and intended application areas. The Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee has sought to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in terms of a set of bioinformatics core competencies that cut across many user personas and training programs. The initial competencies developed based on surveys of employers and training programs have since been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement. This report describes the current status of the competencies and presents a series of use cases illustrating how they are being applied in diverse training contexts. These use cases are intended to demonstrate how others can make use of the competencies and engage in the process of their continuing refinement and application. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H-O9q3LkWbg" width="1" />

Two recent papers have tackled the fundamental questions of how place fields are formed in a new environment and what plasticity mechanisms contribute to this process. Bittner et al., in their recent publication, discovered a novel plasticity rule that, in contrast to previous rules, spans the behavioral, seconds-long, timescale. Sheffield et al. have monitored, for the first time, dendritic activity during place field formation, and show the emergence of spatially tuned local NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 neurons.

Modern neuroscientific techniques that specifically manipulate and measure neuronal activity in behaving animals now allow bridging of the gap from the cellular to the behavioral level. However, in doing so, they also pose new challenges. Research using incompletely defined manipulations in a high-dimensional space without clear hypotheses is likely to suffer from multiple well-known conceptual and statistical problems. In this context it is essential to develop hypotheses with testable implications across levels.

The hippocampus is one of the brain’s great mysteries. Historically, theories of its function included emotion, response inhibition, general memory and spatial perception/learning, with memory versus space emerging as a particular focus of more recent debates. A 1978 paper by Olton and colleagues captured this dichotomy by exploiting their newly developed radial maze task to reveal a profound deficit in the ability of hippocampally lesioned rats to execute a spatial memory task. This finding supported the emerging spatial map theory of hippocampal function, and helped pave the way for the subsequent uncovering of an entire brain system linking space and memory.

2018 marks the 40th anniversary of Trends in Neurosciences (TINS), which I had the honor of joining last summer as its editor. As part of the anniversary, we will be issuing a series of 40 short Science and Society articles, each highlighting a past paper (or two) published during one of the years 1978–2017. At its core, the series aims to showcase the breadth of neuroscientific research, and give a glimpse of the remarkable progress during the last few decades. The February issue of TINS launches the series, with four articles discussing papers from 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008.

Prior to the 21st century, genetic mechanisms that regulate sleep were largely unknown. In 1998, de Lecea et al. [1] (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95:322–327) and Sakurai et al. [2] (Cell 1998; 92: 573–585) reported the discovery of a gene they named hypocretin and orexin, respectively, which led to a revolution in our understanding of genetic and neuronal mechanisms that regulate sleep.

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females and is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding-protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Initially, MeCP2 had been shown to be a repressor of gene transcription. In their 2008 paper, Chahrour and colleagues (DOI: 10.1126/science.1153252) reported that MeCP2 could also function as a transcriptional activator.

The structural identification of the cationic channel of the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor involved its biochemical tagging by channel blockers, followed by site-directed mutagenesis analyses reported in two papers in 1988. The ion channel was demonstrated to be lined by the transmembrane segment MII, in which the binding sites of channel blockers are “framed” by anionic rings.

<p>by Runmin Wei, Jingye Wang, Erik Jia, Tianlu Chen, Yan Ni, Wei Jia</p>

Left-censored missing values commonly exist in targeted metabolomics datasets and can be considered as missing not at random (MNAR). Improper data processing procedures for missing values will cause adverse impacts on subsequent statistical analyses. However, few imputation methods have been developed and applied to the situation of MNAR in the field of metabolomics. Thus, a practical left-censored missing value imputation method is urgently needed. We developed an iterative Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach (GSimp). We compared GSimp with other three imputation methods on two real-world targeted metabolomics datasets and one simulation dataset using our imputation evaluation pipeline. The results show that GSimp outperforms other imputation methods in terms of imputation accuracy, observation distribution, univariate and multivariate analyses, and statistical sensitivity. Additionally, a parallel version of GSimp was developed for dealing with large scale metabolomics datasets. The R code for GSimp, evaluation pipeline, tutorial, real-world and simulated targeted metabolomics datasets are available at: https://github.com/WandeRum/GSimp.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TpqgoEqOUBM" width="1" />

The Binary State Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE) model is a branching process based model that allows the diversification rates to be controlled by a binary trait. We develop a general approach, based on the BiSSE model, for predicting pathogenicity in bacterial populations from microsatellites profiling data. A comprehensive approach for predicting pathogenicity in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> populations is proposed using the state-dependent branching process model combined with microsatellites TRS-PCR profiling. Additionally, we have evaluated the possibility of using the BiSSE model for estimating parameters from genetic data. We analyzed a real dataset (from 251 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains) and confirmed previous biological observations demonstrating a prevalence of some virulence traits in specific bacterial sub-groups. The method may be used to predict pathogenicity of other bacterial taxa.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uz6bdMXl0nc" width="1" />

<p>by Yonathan Murin, Jeremy Kim, Josef Parvizi, Andrea Goldsmith</p>

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting about 1% of the world population. For patients with focal seizures that cannot be treated with antiepileptic drugs, the common treatment is a surgical procedure for removal of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this work we introduce an algorithm for automatic localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epileptic patients based on electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. The proposed algorithm builds upon the hypothesis that the abnormal excessive (or synchronous) neuronal activity in the brain leading to seizures <i>starts in the SOZ</i> and then <i>spreads</i> to other areas in the brain. Thus, when this abnormal activity starts, signals recorded at electrodes close to the SOZ should have a relatively large <i>causal influence</i> on the rest of the recorded signals. The SOZ localization is executed in two steps. First, the algorithm represents the set of electrodes using a directed graph in which nodes correspond to recording electrodes and the edges’ weights quantify the <i>pair-wise</i> causal influence between the recorded signals. Then, the algorithm infers the SOZ from the estimated graph using a variant of the <i>PageRank</i> algorithm followed by a novel post-processing phase. Inference results for 19 patients show a close match between the SOZ inferred by the proposed approach and the SOZ estimated by expert neurologists (success rate of 17 out of 19).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jWjec7d9uT0" width="1" />

<p>by Francesco Alessandro Massucci, Francesc Sagués, M. Ángeles Serrano</p>

The most frequent form of pairwise synthetic lethality (SL) in metabolic networks is known as plasticity synthetic lethality. It occurs when the simultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or genes is lethal, while the default of the functional partner is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Using computational techniques on bacterial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the functional partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure viability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant fraction of other interconnected reactions, forming what we call a SL cluster. Interestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of reactions and genes. This strong overlap mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and increased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided by essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions and genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the intersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient drug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved strategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RgV2wA7v53Q" width="1" />

Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7RLEkfWxsdM" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EGKWmrKeD6Y/article">The extent of ribosome queuing in budding yeast</a></h4>

<p>by Alon Diament, Anna Feldman, Elisheva Schochet, Martin Kupiec, Yoav Arava, Tamir Tuller</p>

Ribosome queuing is a fundamental phenomenon suggested to be related to topics such as genome evolution, synthetic biology, gene expression regulation, intracellular biophysics, and more. However, this phenomenon hasn't been quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability to detect ribosome queuing. On the other hand, most of the models in the field assume and analyze a certain level of queuing. Here we present an experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics. The approach was implemented on the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> transcriptome. Our data shows that ribosome queuing is more frequent than previously thought: the measured ratio of ribosomes within dRPFs to mRPFs is 0.2–0.35, suggesting that at least one to five translating ribosomes is in a traffic jam; these queued ribosomes cannot be captured by traditional methods. We found that specific regions are enriched with queued ribosomes, such as the 5’-end of ORFs, and regions upstream to mRPF peaks, among others. While queuing is related to higher density of ribosomes on the transcript (characteristic of highly translated genes), we report cases where traffic jams are relatively more severe in lowly expressed genes and possibly even selected for. In addition, our analysis demonstrates that higher adaptation of the coding region to the intracellular tRNA levels is associated with lower queuing levels. Our analysis also suggests that the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> transcriptome undergoes selection for eliminating traffic jams. Thus, our proposed approach is an essential tool for high resolution analysis of ribosome traffic during mRNA translation and understanding its evolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGKWmrKeD6Y" width="1" />

<p>by Rahila Rahimova, Simon Fontanel, Corinne Lionne, Lars Peter Jordheim, Suzanne Peyrottes, Laurent Chaloin</p>

The ecto-5’-nucleotidase CD73 plays an important role in the production of immune-suppressive adenosine in tumor micro-environment, and has become a validated drug target in oncology. Indeed, the anticancer immune response involves extracellular ATP to block cell proliferation through T-cell activation. However, in the tumor micro-environment, two extracellular membrane-bound enzymes (CD39 and CD73) are overexpressed and hydrolyze efficiently ATP into AMP then further into immune-suppressive adenosine. To circumvent the impact of CD73-generated adenosine, we applied an original bioinformatics approach to identify new allosteric inhibitors targeting the dimerization interface of CD73, which should impair the large dynamic motions required for its enzymatic function. Several hit compounds issued from virtual screening campaigns showed a potent inhibition of recombinant CD73 with inhibition constants in the low micromolar range and exhibited a non-competitive inhibition mode. The structure-activity relationships studies indicated that several amino acid residues (D366, H456, K471, Y484 and E543 for polar interactions and G453-454, I455, H456, L475, V542 and G544 for hydrophobic contacts) located at the dimerization interface are involved in the tight binding of hit compounds and likely contributed for their inhibitory activity. Overall, the gathered information will guide the upcoming lead optimization phase that may lead to potent and selective CD73 inhibitors, able to restore the anticancer immune response.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MmJFMNHwHpM" width="1" />
