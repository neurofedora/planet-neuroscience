              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A computational account of why more valuable goals seem to require more effortful actions</a></h4>

              
                To decide whether a course of action is worth pursuing, individuals typically weigh its expected costs and benefits. Optimal decision-making relies upon accurate effort cost anticipation, which is generally assumed to be performed independently from goal valuation. In two experiments (n = 46), we challenged this independence principle of standard decision theory. We presented participants with a series of treadmill routes randomly associated to monetary rewards and collected both ‘accept’ versus ‘decline’ decisions and subjective estimates of energetic cost. Behavioural results show that higher monetary prospects led participants to provide higher cost estimates, although reward was independent from effort in our design. Among candidate cognitive explanations, they support a model in which prospective cost assessment is biased by the output of an automatic computation adjusting effort expenditure to goal value. This decision bias might lead people to abandon the pursuit of valuable goals that are in fact not so costly to achieve.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct hyperactive RAS/MAPK alleles converge on common GABAergic interneuron core programs</a></h4>

              
                RAS/MAPK gene dysfunction underlies various cancers and neurocognitive disorders. While the role of RAS/MAPK genes have been well studied in cancer, less is known about their function during neurodevelopment. There are many genes that work in concert to regulate RAS/MAPK signaling, suggesting that if common brain phenotypes could be discovered they could have a broad impact on the many other disorders caused by distinct RAS/MAPK genes. We assessed the cellular and molecular consequences of hyperactivating the RAS/MAPK pathway using three distinct genes in a cell type previously implicated in RAS/MAPK-mediated cognitive changes, cortical GABAergic interneurons. We uncovered a spectrum of GABAergic core programs that are commonly altered in each of the mutants. Notably, hyperactive RAS/MAPK mutants bias developing cortical interneurons towards those that are somatostatin+. The increase in somatostatin+ interneurons could also be induced by elevated neural activity and we show the core RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is one mechanism by which this occurs. Overall, these findings present new insights into how different RAS/MAPK mutations can converge on GABAergic interneurons, which may be important for other RAS/MAPK genes/disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Development of Eight Wireless Automated Cages System with Two Lickometers Each for Rodents</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Drinking behavior has been used in fundamental research to study metabolism, motivation, decision-making and different aspects of health problems, such as anhedonia and alcohol use disorders. In the majority of studies, liquid intake is measured by weighing the bottles before and after the experiment. This method does not tell much about the drinking microstructure, e.g., licking bouts and periods of preference for each liquid, which could be valuable to understand drinking behavior. To improve data acquisition of drinking microstructure, companies have developed lickometer devices that acquire timestamps when animals approach or drink from a specific sipper. Nevertheless, commercially available devices have elevated costs. Here, we present a low-cost alternative for a lickometer system that allows wireless data acquisition of licks from eight cages with two sippers each. We ran a three-phase validation protocol to ensure (1) proper choice of the sensor to detect licks; (2) adaptation of the device to a wireless transmission and realistic <I>in silico</I> tests; and (3) <I>in vivo</I> validation to test the correlation between the amount of licks measured by the lickometer and the bottle weight. The capacitive sensor presented appropriate recall and precision for our device. After adaptation to wireless transmission, the <I>in silico</I> validation demonstrated low reading and transmission errors even when tested in extreme simultaneous licking conditions. Finally, we observed a positive correlation between water or ethanol consumption and lick count, showing that the lickometers can be used for <I>in vivo</I> studies interested in rodent drinking microstructure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patient perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after total hip arthroplasty: A qualitative study (PHETHAS-2) [version 4; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients' experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate how patients perceived home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA, focusing on facilitators and barriers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data were analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1). Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and four subthemes were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their well-known everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities, though some lacked contact to physiotherapist. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal of returning to the well-known everyday life served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise after THA along with the flexibility regarding time and place for performing exercises. Boring exercises as well as both pain and no pain were identified as barriers to the performance of home-based rehabilitation exercise. Participants were motivated towards performing general physical activities which were part of their everyday life.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Next-generation sequencing (NGS) reveals low-abundance HIV-1 drug resistance mutations among patients experiencing virological failure at the time of therapy switching in Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence and spread of antiretroviral drug resistant HIV-1 variants is one of the major factors associated with therapeutic failure in persons living with HIV (PLWH) as it jeopardizes the efforts to reduce the progression to AIDS. Whereas Sanger sequencing is the most appropriate conventional method for HIV drug resistance testing, it has limited capacity to detect low-abundance variants. This study assessed the suitability of next generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal low-abundance HIV-1 drug resistance mutations amongst patients experiencing virological failure at the time of therapy switching in Uganda. Methods: Archived blood samples previously collected from 60 PLWH were used in this study. Briefly HIV viral RNA was extracted and performed targeted NGS of portions of both the HIV protease and reverse transcriptase genes on the illumina MiSeq. For performance comparison, Sanger sequencing was also performed for all the samples targeting the highlighted genes. The sequence data generated was analyzed using HyDRA bioinformatics pipeline, accompanied by the Stanford HIV drug resistance database, to annotate and report drug resistance mutations/variants. Results: Out of the 60 samples, 58 passed preliminary quality control and were considered for subsequent analysis—of which 38/58 (65.5%) registered low-abundance HIV drug resistance variants. Overall, 757 variants from the NGS data and 90 variants from the Sanger data were identified. The most prevalent minority variants included; K65R (65.5%), K14R (63.8%), K45R (63.8%), L63P (63.8%), I15V (63.8%), K70R (60.3%), V77I (60.3%), L283I (60.3%), G16E (58.6%) and L282C (58.6%). Conclusion: An estimated 65.5% of the sampled population harbors low-abundance HIV-1 variants, most of which are associated with virological failure, and consequently antiviral drug resistance. NGS suitably detects drug resistance mutations even at frequencies below 20% of the viral quasi species that are occasionally missed by Sanger sequencing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Changing the method of consent to increase the numbers of cadaveric donors in Saudi Arabia: the autonomy paradox [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Saudi Arabia, the gap between the demand and availability of organs persists, with a total of 13,731 patients who remain on the waiting list in 2019. Family refusal is a major obstacle limiting donation since their consent must be obtained prior to the retrieval of organs. The cause of family refusal is mainly due to the unknown wishes of their loved one to become a donor. This analysis aimed to compare three systems of obtaining consent in terms of effectiveness, respect for personal autonomy, and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia to ensure feasibility and effectiveness in increasing the number of donors. Policy alternatives and implications: The consent systems include opt-in (explicit consent), opt-out (presumed consent), and mandated choice systems. The mandated choice policy might be the optimal solution to investigate since it could balance the respect for individual autonomy and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions and recommendations: Mandated choice ensures the respect of personal autonomy while influencing the next of kin's decision to donate the organs. Additionally, a recommendation to decision makers is to utilize the Tawakkalna app to send alerts to the next of kin when a user registers as a donor with the user's consent. Moreover, more research should be dedicated to investigating the Saudi public's current culture and perceptions of organ donation to ensure feasibility.

                <p>by Athira Athira, Daniel Dondorp, Jerneja Rudolf, Olivia Peytral, Marios Chatzigeorgiou</p>

Vertebrate nervous systems can generate a remarkable diversity of behaviors. However, our understanding of how behaviors may have evolved in the chordate lineage is limited by the lack of neuroethological studies leveraging our closest invertebrate relatives. Here, we combine high-throughput video acquisition with pharmacological perturbations of bioamine signaling to systematically reveal the global structure of the motor behavioral repertoire in the <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> larvae. Most of <i>Ciona</i>’s postural variance can be captured by 6 basic shapes, which we term “eigencionas.” Motif analysis of postural time series revealed numerous stereotyped behavioral maneuvers including “startle-like” and “beat-and-glide.” Employing computational modeling of swimming dynamics and spatiotemporal embedding of postural features revealed that behavioral differences are generated at the levels of motor modules and the transitions between, which may in part be modulated by bioamines. Finally, we show that flexible motor module usage gives rise to diverse behaviors in response to different light stimuli.

Cycling of organic carbon in the ocean has the potential to mitigate or exacerbate global climate change, but major questions remain about the environmental controls on organic carbon flux in the coastal zone. Here, we used a field experiment distributed across 28° of latitude, and the entire range of 2 dominant kelp species in the northern hemisphere, to measure decomposition rates of kelp detritus on the seafloor in relation to local environmental factors. Detritus decomposition in both species were strongly related to ocean temperature and initial carbon content, with higher rates of biomass loss at lower latitudes with warmer temperatures. Our experiment showed slow overall decomposition and turnover of kelp detritus and modeling of coastal residence times at our study sites revealed that a significant portion of this production can remain intact long enough to reach deep marine sinks. The results suggest that decomposition of these kelp species could accelerate with ocean warming and that low-latitude kelp forests could experience the greatest increase in remineralization with a 9% to 42% reduced potential for transport to long-term ocean sinks under short-term (RCP4.5) and long-term (RCP8.5) warming scenarios. However, slow decomposition at high latitudes, where kelp abundance is predicted to expand, indicates potential for increasing kelp-carbon sinks in cooler (northern) regions. Our findings reveal an important latitudinal gradient in coastal ecosystem function that provides an improved capacity to predict the implications of ocean warming on carbon cycling. Broad-scale patterns in organic carbon decomposition revealed here can be used to identify hotspots of carbon sequestration potential and resolve relationships between carbon cycling processes and ocean climate at a global scale.

                Background: Academic success of international medical students enrolled in Chinese universities is of great significance, because it directly influences their performance in the license exam and in obtaining a job. Insufficient research has been conducted on academics’ awareness of factors related to teaching that affect their students’ academic success.  Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with academics (N=36) from November 2020 to January 2021 at two medical universities in China. Each interview, lasting between 30 to 70-min, was audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.  Results: The important teaching factors that academics perceived to influence the success of students are: (i) style of pedagogy, (ii) addressing students’ language difficulties and differences, (iii) teaching resources management, (iv) attributes of the academics, (v) supervision and guidance by the academics, (vi) rapport between the academic and student, (vii) linking teaching content to license exams, (viii) classroom discipline management, and (ix) assessment style. Conclusions: University faculties and departments that are involved in teaching international medical students need to ensure that academic staff are provided with ongoing professional development and resources to enhance teaching quality. The nine areas identified above should provide priority topics for such staff training.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Adverse COVID-19 vaccination effects in Finnish patients with Ménière’s disease: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The association between reporting adverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination effects and those with a history of audiovestibular difficulties is unknown. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate adverse vaccination effects in adults with a history of Ménière’s disease. Specifically, the incidence of adverse effects, the factors associated with those reporting adverse effects and the relationship between the reporting of audiovestibular and other adverse effects. Methods: A mixed-methods exploratory cross-sectional survey study design was used. Data were collected from 333 members of the Finnish Ménière Association. The survey was designed to obtain demographic information that may be associated with having adverse effects or not, vaccination-specific information and adverse vaccination effects. Both health and audiovestibular adverse events were identified. Data analysis included comparing those reporting and not reporting adverse vaccination effects. Results: The mean age was 63 years with 81% being female. Of the 327 respondents who had one of the COVID-19 vaccinations (Comirnatry/ Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, or Moderna), 203 (62%) reported no adverse effects. The type of or number of vaccinations were not related to the reporting of adverse effects. The most frequently reported adverse effects were injection site tenderness (38%), arm pain (21%), fever (15%) and headaches (15%). Post-vaccination tinnitus and vertigo (both 7%) were the most frequently reported audiovestibular-related symptoms, followed by aural fullness (6%) and hearing loss (4%). Those reporting previous pre-vaccination vertigo were more likely to have post-vaccination vertigo. The presence of post-vaccination tinnitus, hearing loss, and aural fullness, predicted the presence of post-vaccination vertigo. Conclusions: A small proportion of patients with a history of Ménière’s disease may experience adverse post-vaccination effects. Further research is required to explore whether adverse post-vaccination audiovestibular effects are more prevalent in those with a history of otological disorders compared with the general population.

                Background: Prolonged activation of skeletal muscles causes a decrease in the production of fatigue. Exercise with strenuous intensity causes an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). An increase in free radicals causes oxidative stress resulting in damage to cell function to mitochondrial dysfunction, and fatigue. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant potential of red dragon fruit (RDF) to delay fatigue due to oxidative stress, which improves cell function in mitochondria. Methods: 25 male rats (Rattus norvegicus) aged three months were divided into five groups: Group K1 was N.A. (No Activity) but drinking and eating; Group K2 performed strenuous exercise without RDF treatment; Groups 3, 4, and 5 (P1, P2 and P3, respectively) performed strenuous exercise and were treated with 75 mg kg-1.bw, 150 mg kg-1.bw, and 300 mg kg-1.bw of RDF extract, respectively. The exercise for the rats involved intense swimming for 20 minutes  a day three time a week for fouweeks.  Malondialdehyde (MDA) dan SOD was measured with the ELISA and histopathology for muscle soleus and lung tissue. Results: Strenuous exercise followed by RDF extract ingestion was compared for fatigue in terms of duration and time; before (24.55±1.38 minute) and after (95.31±7.82 minute) and led to a significant difference of 39% (p<0.01). The study also compared MDA before and after RDF extract ingestion in the K2 vs. the P1 group (p<0.05). At the same time, P2 differed more significantly (p<0.01). This indicated a spread of free radicals and featured histopathological damage of muscle cells. However, ingestion of RDF extract leads to improvement of soleus muscle cells; thus, repairs cell function, delaying fatigue. Conclusion: This study confirmed that strenuous exercise, which causes an increase in ROS, intensifies free radicals with RDF extract ingestion and declines oxidative stress, repairing cell function and delaying fatigue.

                Background: Despite the promise of radiomics studies, their limited reproducibility has hindered meaningful clinical translation. Variability in study designs as well as image acquisition and processing contribute to unreproducible radiomic results. This work’s purpose was to (i) quantitatively compare variability of radiomic features extracted from 2-D spin echo (SE) and 3-D spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) T1-weighted post-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) images of brain metastases acquired within the same patient in a single imaging session, and (ii) provide a framework to inform data acquisition for reproducible radiomics studies. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 29 patients with pathologically-confirmed brain metastases and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images acquired using 2-D SE and 3-D SPGR sequences within one exam was identified. Metastases were segmented twice by different physicians using semi-automated methods. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics for 264 preprocessing variable combinations. Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was computed between features extracted from images acquired by both pulse sequences and different tumor segmentations. Results: We provided general recommendations to improve MR-based radiomic feature reproducibility by clustering and identifying low-concordance features and processing variables. Median CCC between 2-D SE and 3-D SPGR (measuring feature agreement between pulse sequences) was greater for fixed bin count intensity discretization (0.76 versus 0.63) and specific high-concordance features (0.74  versus 0.53). Applying all recommendations improved median CCC from 0.51 to 0.79. Median CCC between contours (measuring feature sensitivity to inter-observer variability) was higher for 2-D SE (0.93 versus 0.86) but improved to 0.93 for 3-D SPGR after low-concordance feature exclusion. Conclusions: The following recommendations are proposed to improve reproducibility: 1) Fixed bin count intensity discretization for all studies, 2) for studies with 2-D and 3-D datasets, excluding high-variability features from downstream analyses, 3) when segmentation is manual or semi-automated, using only 2-D SE images or excluding features susceptible to segmentation variability.

                In this editorial, we identify the key questions requiring further exploration in the sociology of vaccines. In doing so, we discuss the socio-structural forces shaping views towards knowledge about and access to vaccination, trust in vaccines and regulators/decision makers, the associated problem of financial interests in vaccine development and regulation, and global vaccine inequalities. Across the breadth of these issues, we additionally identify a range of theoretical perspectives and conceptual directions that sociologists might utilise when producing innovative empirical, methodological and theoretical research on vaccination relating to risk and uncertainty, conflicts of interest, power and inequality.

                <p>Differences in gut microbiota between Parkinson's disease patients and controls seem to depend on multiple—frequently unmeasured—confounders. Monozygotic twins offer a unique model for controlling several factors responsible for interpersonal variation in gut microbiota. Fecal samples from 20 monozygotic twin pairs (n = 40) discordant for Parkinson's disease were studied (metagenomic shotgun analysis). Paired data analysis detected minimal differences in bacterial taxa abundance at species level (<i>Bacteroides pectinophilus</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.037], <i>Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.050], and <i>Bifidobacterium catenulatum</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.025]) and in predicted metabolic pathways (<i>primary bile acid biosynthesis</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.037]).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Productivity of mother pigs is lower, and mortality greater, in countries that still confine them in gestation crates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For decades, pig farmers have used gestation crates to confine pregnant sows. Gestation crates physically restrain sows for most of their life, preventing them from walking or turning around. Growing concern about animal welfare has been pressuring the industry for change, with recent legislation in several countries restricting the use of crates. Still, the notion that gestation crates negatively affect sow welfare has been challenged by producers in regions where crates are still used, who argue that, by facilitating health monitoring and preventing aggression, crates lead to lower sow mortality and higher piglet outputs per sow. We test whether these claims are valid by comparing these parameters across countries with different housing systems. Methods: We use publicly available data from InterPig, a network of pig production economists in 17 countries that provides harmonized methods for meaningful comparisons of production and cost indicators. We focus on the last five years (2015-2019) of data available. Annual sow mortality and the number of pigs sold per sow were compared among (1) countries where gestation crates are the norm (CRATE), (2) countries where gestation crates are restricted to four weeks after insemination (RESTRICTED), and (3) countries where gestation crates are banned (BANNED). Results: Sow mortality was significantly higher (F2,85=5.03;P=0.009), and annual pig production per sow significantly lower (F2,85=5.99;P=0.004), in the CRATE than in the RESTRICTED group. Conclusions: Claims of higher mortality and reduced productivity per sow in crate-free systems are not substantiated by this industry-validated dataset. While many factors differ among the country groups (e.g., genetics, nutrition, climate), the observation that factors other than crating have a greater influence on performance challenges claims of an overall negative effect of loose housing on the parameters investigated. This evidence should be considered in policies affecting the welfare of breeding pigs.

                Background: The Informed Health Choices (IHC) Key Concepts is a framework that provides a basis for developing educational resources and evaluating people’s ability to think critically about health actions. We developed the original Key Concepts framework by reviewing texts and checklists for the public, journalists, and health professionals and collecting structured feedback from an international advisory group. We revised the original 2015 framework yearly from 2016 to 2018 based on feedback and experience using the framework. The objectives of this paper are to describe the development of the framework since 2018 and summarise their basis. Methods: For the 2019 version, we responded to feedback on the 2018 version. For the current 2022 version, in addition to responding to feedback on the 2019 version, we reviewed the evidence base for each of the concepts. Whenever possible, we referenced systematic reviews that provide a basis for a concept. We screened all Cochrane methodology reviews and searched Epistemonikos, PubMed, and Google Scholar for methodology reviews and meta-epidemiological studies. Results: The original framework included 32 concepts in six groups. The 2019 version and the current 2022 version include 49 concepts in the same three main groups that we have used since 2016. There are now 10 subgroups or higher-level concepts. For each concept, there is an explanation including one or more examples, the basis for the concept, and implications. Over 600 references are cited that support the concepts, and over half of the references are systematic reviews. Conclusions: There is a large body of evidence that supports the IHC key concepts and we have received few suggestions for changes since 2019.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sapporo: A workflow execution service that encourages the reuse of workflows in various languages in bioinformatics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The increased demand for efficient computation in data analysis encourages researchers in biomedical science to use workflow systems. Workflow systems, or so-called workflow languages, are used for the description and execution of a set of data analysis steps. Workflow systems increase the productivity of researchers, specifically in fields that use high-throughput DNA sequencing applications, where scalable computation is required. As systems have improved the portability of data analysis workflows, research communities are able to share workflows to reduce the cost of building ordinary analysis procedures. However, having multiple workflow systems in a research field has resulted in the distribution of efforts across different workflow system communities. As each workflow system has its unique characteristics, it is not feasible to learn every single system in order to use publicly shared workflows. Thus, we developed Sapporo, an application to provide a unified layer of workflow execution upon the differences of various workflow systems. Sapporo has two components: an application programming interface (API) that receives the request of a workflow run and a browser-based client for the API. The API follows the Workflow Execution Service API standard proposed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. The current implementation supports the execution of workflows in four languages: Common Workflow Language, Workflow Description Language, Snakemake, and Nextflow. With its extensible and scalable design, Sapporo can support the research community in utilizing valuable resources for data analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Synaptic-like axo-axonal transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons onto dopaminergic fibers</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic axons express nicotinic receptors that modulate and evoke neurotransmitter release. Using direct recordings from dopaminergic axons, Kramer et al. reveal the presence of spontaneous synaptic-like nicotinic axonal EPSPs capable of generating spontaneous axonal action potentials. These findings demonstrate the mechanisms underlying nicotinic-receptor-mediated membrane-potential signaling in dopaminergic axons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolution of a counter-defense mechanism in a virus constrains its host range</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria use diverse immunity mechanisms to defend themselves against their viral predators, bacteriophages. In turn, phages can acquire counter-defense systems, but it remains unclear how such mechanisms arise and what factors constrain viral evolution. Here, we experimentally evolved T4 phage to overcome a phage-defensive toxin-antitoxin system, <i>toxIN</i>, in <i>E. coli</i>. Through recombination, T4 rapidly acquires segmental amplifications of a previously uncharacterized gene, now named <i>tifA</i>, encoding an inhibitor of the toxin, ToxN. These amplifications subsequently drive large deletions elsewhere in T4's genome to maintain a genome size compatible with capsid packaging. The deleted regions include accessory genes that help T4 overcome defense systems in alternative hosts. Thus, our results reveal a trade-off in viral evolution; the emergence of one counter-defense mechanism can lead to loss of other such mechanisms, thereby constraining host range. We propose that the accessory genomes of viruses reflect the integrated evolutionary history of the hosts they infected.

                Topographic sensory representations often do not scale proportionally to the size of their input regions, with some expanded and others contracted. In vision, the foveal representation is magnified cortically, as are the fingertips in touch. What principles drive this allocation, and how should receptor density, e.g. the high innervation of the fovea or the fingertips, and stimulus statistics, e.g. the higher contact frequencies on the fingertips, contribute? Building on work in efficient coding, we address this problem using linear models that optimally decorrelate the sensory signals. We introduce a sensory bottleneck to impose constraints on resource allocation and derive the optimal neural allocation. We find that bottleneck width is a crucial factor in resource allocation, inducing either expansion or contraction. Both receptor density and stimulus statistics affect allocation and jointly determine convergence for wider bottlenecks. Furthermore, we show a close match between the predicted and empirical cortical allocations in a well-studied model system, the star-nosed mole. Overall, our results suggest that the strength of cortical magnification depends on resource limits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coupling to short linear motifs creates versatile PME-1 activities in PP2A holoenzyme demethylation and inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes target broad substrates by recognizing short motifs via regulatory subunits. PP2A methylesterase 1 (PME-1) is a cancer-promoting enzyme and undergoes methylesterase activation upon binding to the PP2A core enzyme. Here we showed that PME-1 readily demethylates different families of PP2A holoenzymes and blocks substrate recognition <i>in vitro</i>. The high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a PP2A-B56 holoenzyme-PME-1 complex reveals that PME-1 disordered regions, including a substrate-mimicking motif, tether to the B56 regulatory subunit at remote sites. They occupy the holoenzyme substrate-binding groove and allow large structural shifts in both holoenzyme and PME-1 to enable multi-partite contacts at structured cores to activate the methylesterase. B56-interface mutations selectively block PME-1 activity toward PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and affect the methylation of a fraction of total cellular PP2A. The B56-interface mutations allow us to uncover B56-specific PME-1 functions in p53 signaling. Our studies reveal multiple mechanisms of PME-1 in suppressing holoenzyme functions and versatile PME-1 activities derived from coupling substrate-mimicking motifs to dynamic structured cores.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modular, cascade-like transcriptional program of regeneration in Stentor</a></h4>

              
                The giant ciliate <i>Stentor coeruleus</i> is a classical model system for studying regeneration and morphogenesis at the level of a single cell. The anterior of the cell is marked by an array of cilia, known as the oral apparatus, which can be induced to shed and regenerate in a series of reproducible morphological steps, previously shown to require transcription. If a cell is cut in half, each half will regenerate an intact cell, including a new oral apparatus in the posterior half. We used RNAseq to assay the dynamic changes in <i>Stentor</i>'s transcriptome during regeneration, after both oral apparatus shedding and bisection, allowing us to identify distinct temporal waves of gene expression including kinases, RNA binding proteins, centriole biogenesis factors, and orthologs of human ciliopathy genes implicated in Meckel and Joubert syndromes. By comparing transcriptional profiles of different regeneration events in the same species, we were able to identify distinct modules of gene expression corresponding to oral apparatus regeneration, posterior holdfast regeneration, and recovery after wounding. By measuring gene expression in cells in which translation is blocked, we show that the sequential waves of gene expression involve a cascade mechanism in which later waves of expression are triggered by translation products of early-expressed genes. Among the early-expressed genes, we identified an E2F transcription factor and the conserved RNA binding protein Pumilio as potential regulators of regeneration based on the expression pattern of their predicted target genes. RNAi mediated knockdown experiments indicate that Pumilio is required for regenerating oral structures of the correct size. We show that E2F is involved in the completion of regeneration but is dispensable for earlier steps. This work allows us to classify regeneration genes into groups based on their potential role for regeneration in distinct cell regeneration paradigms, and provides insight into how a single cell can coordinate complex morphogenetic pathways to regenerate missing structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decomposing neural circuit function into information processing primitives</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive functions arise from the coordinated activity of neural populations distributed over large-scale brain networks. However, it is challenging to understand and measure how specific aspects of neural dynamics translate into operations of information processing, and, ultimately, cognitive functions. An obstacle is that simple circuit mechanisms such as self-sustained or propagating activity and nonlinear summation of inputs do not directly give rise to high-level functions. Nevertheless, they already implement simple transformations of the information carried by neural activity. Here, we propose that distinct neural circuit functions, such as stimulus representation, working memory, or selective attention stem from different combinations and types of low-level manipulations of information, or information processing primitives. To test this hypothesis, we combine approaches from information theory with computational simulations of canonical neural circuits involving one or more interacting brain regions that emulate well-defined cognitive functions. More specifically, we track the dynamics of information emergent from dynamic patterns of neural activity, using suitable quantitative metrics to detect where and when information is actively buffered (active information storage), transferred (information transfer) or non-linearly merged (information modification), as possible modes of low-level processing. We find that neuronal subsets maintaining representations in working memory or performing attention-related gain modulation are signaled by their boosted involvement in operations of active information storage or information modification, respectively. Thus, information dynamics metrics, beyond detecting which network units participate in cognitive processing, also promise to specify how and when they do it, i.e., through which type of primitive computation, a capability that may be exploited for the parsing of actual experimental recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor gates plasticity in developing visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                We have previously shown that recovery of visual responses to a deprived eye during the critical period in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) requires both export of mRNA encoding brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to the dendrites of cortical cells (Kaneko et al., 2012) and phosphorylation of the TrkB receptor for BDNF (Kaneko et al., 2008a). TrkB phosphorylation is not required for the loss of response during monocular deprivation (MD). Studies in vitro show that formation of new connections requires BDNF (Meyer-Franke et al., 1995, 1998; Gottmann et al., 2009). We have now studied the temporal relationship between the production of mature BDNF and the recovery of visual responses. Visual cortical responses to an eye whose vision has been occluded for several days during the critical period and is then re-opened recovers rapidly during binocular vision or more slowly following reverse occlusion, when the previously intact fellow eye is occluded in a model of patch therapy for amblyopia. The time to recovery of visual responses differed by 18 hours between these two procedures, but in each the production of mature BDNF preceded the recovery by 6 hours. These findings suggest that a spurt of BDNF secretion stimulates the growth of connections serving the deprived eye to restore visual responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory corticostriatal connections in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Auditory learning critically depends on sensory, decisional, and reward-based processes that are supported by the dorsal striatum. Auditory corticostriatal connections have been well-characterized in animal models including non-human primates, where primary auditory cortex preferentially connects to putamen, and caudate head receives most of its inputs from anterior superior temporal cortex. However, the extent to which human auditory corticostriatal connectivity follows similar organizational principles is challenging to assess due the small, deep anatomy of these striatal structures. We leveraged high-quality diffusion-weighted MRI tractography to virtually dissect structural pathways between auditory cortical regions and dorsal striatal regions in a sub-millimeter resolution single-subject dataset. Across most of auditory cortex, putamen connections were more frequent than caudate connections; only anterior-most superior temporal cortex had strong connectivity with caudate, specifically the caudate head. Putamen streamline endpoints were largely along the ventral portion of the structure, ranging from caudal to middle putamen. Consistent with these results, caudate connections were largely confined to an anterior pathway, whereas putamen connections were more equally spread between anterior and posterior pathways to temporal cortex. In contrast to the auditory findings, visual corticostriatal streamlines did not preferentially reach putamen. We replicate these results in an independent sample of near-millimeter resolution single-session diffusion MRI from the Human Connectome Project. Overall, our results suggest strong structural connectivity between primary and association auditory cortices with putamen but not with any subdivision of caudate. Prioritized connectivity between superior temporal cortex and putamen is highly suggestive of distinct functional roles for striatal subdivisions in auditory perception.

                Recent developments on Bayesian inference and prediction for effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) stem from a wide variety of methods, including machine learning, multilevel models, and others. However, few of these approaches make use of clear estimates of the ERP voltage across time and across space (scalp). In the present article, via an iterative process, we propose Gaussian random walk (GRW) models that can estimate voltage uncertainty across time and also provide correlation matrices across electrodes. We apply these models to real ERP data from a P3b paradigm as an example. We discuss results in terms of past and current literature of both ERP estimation and electroencephalography analysis in general.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep/wake changes in perturbational complexity in rats and mice</a></h4>

              
                In humans, the level of consciousness can be assessed by quantifying the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical responses using the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) and related PCIst (st, state transitions). These measures are consistently high in wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and low in dreamless non-REM (NREM) sleep, deep slow wave anesthesia, and coma. The neuronal mechanisms underlying the reduction of PCI/PCIst in unconscious states remain largely unexplored. The extent to which different cortical areas or layers contribute to these measures is also unknown. To address these questions, here we first validate the use of PCIst in freely moving rats (8 males) and mice (12, 4 females) by showing that its values are lower in NREM sleep and slow wave anesthesia than in wake or REM sleep, as in humans. We then show that low PCIst is associated with the occurrence of an OFF period of neuronal silence. Moreover, the stimulation of deep, but not superficial, cortical layers leads to reliable changes in PCIst across sleep/wake and anesthesia. Finally, consistent changes in PCIst can be measured independent of which single area is being stimulated or recorded, except for recordings in mouse prefrontal cortex. These experiments directly support the hypothesis that PCIst is low when an OFF period disrupts causal interactions in cortical networks. Moreover, they demonstrate that, as in humans, PCIst can be used for the reliable assessment of vigilance states in unresponsive animals, without the need to rely on behavioral outputs such as the righting reflex.

                The septohippocampal pathway plays an important role in learning and memory. It projects from the medial septum-vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) to the hippocampus and provides the latter with its main cholinergic innervation. To assess the importance of cholinergic selectivity and timing of MSDB stimulation in modulating learning and memory, we directly compared the effects of several MSDB stimulation strategies in healthy rats. We evaluated the effects of DREADD-mediated selective cholinergic neuronal MSDB stimulation and nonselective neuronal MSDB stimulation on spatial learning and memory in the appetitive radial arm maze and on resting-state brain networks using resting-state functional MRI. DREADDs were activated with the novel DREADD agonist J60. Selective cholinergic MSDB stimulation during, but not after, radial arm maze training improved spatial learning compared with J60-treated sham rats and had no effect on working memory or reversal learning. J60-treated sham rats had a worse working memory than saline-treated sham rats during the reversal phase of the radial arm maze task, suggesting an adverse effect of chronic use of J60. Nonselective MSDB stimulation during training resulted in a loss of appetite and exclusion from the radial arm maze training. Acute selective cholinergic and nonselective MSDB stimulation induced decreased functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode-like network. In addition, acute nonselective MSDB stimulation resulted in increased intrahippocampal FC, while selective cholinergic MSDB stimulation led to globally increased FC with the nucleus accumbens. While the combined effect of radial arm maze learning and the necessary chronic food restriction with or without chronic MSDB stimulation had no observable effect on resting-state networks, chronic food restriction alone globally increased FC in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Direct Speech Reconstruction from Sensorimotor Brain Activity with Optimized Deep Learning Models</a></h4>

              
                Development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is key for enabling communication in individuals who have lost the faculty of speech due to severe motor paralysis. A BCI control strategy that is gaining attention employs speech decoding from neural data. Recent studies have shown that a combination of direct neural recordings and advanced computational models can provide promising results. Understanding which decoding strategies deliver best and directly applicable results is crucial for advancing the field. In this paper, we optimized and validated a decoding approach based on speech reconstruction directly from high-density electrocorticography recordings from sensorimotor cortex during a speech production task. We show that 1) dedicated machine learning optimization of reconstruction models is key for achieving the best reconstruction performance; 2) individual word decoding in reconstructed speech achieves 92-100% accuracy (chance level is 8%); 3) direct reconstruction from sensorimotor brain activity produces intelligible speech. These results underline the need for model optimization in achieving best speech decoding results and highlight the potential that reconstruction-based speech decoding from sensorimotor cortex can offer for development of next-generation BCI technology for communication.

                Currently, there is a need for the generation of non-opioid analgesics for treating chronic pain. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the analgesic effects of testosterone. However, treatment with testosterone is not feasible due to adverse effects. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) were developed to overcome these limitations by minimizing activation of androgenic side effects. First, we demonstrate SARM administration alleviates widespread muscle pain in male and female mice. We then developed a SARM-loaded PLGA microparticle formulation that reverses widespread muscle pain in two injections. In vitro and in vivo release kinetics demonstrate the microparticle formulation had sustained SARM release for 4 weeks. Antagonism of androgen receptors blocked the analgesic effects of the SARM microparticles. SARM treatment had no effect on cardiac or liver enzymes, cardiac histology, and did not produce rewarding behavior. These studies demonstrate SARM microparticles as a potential therapeutic for chronic muscle pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of Auditory Sensory Neuron Diversity by Runx1</a></h4>

              
                Functional heterogeneity among sensory neurons is a cardinal property of the vertebrate auditory system, yet it is not known how this heterogeneity is established to ensure proper encoding of sound. Here, we show that the transcription factor Runx1 controls the composition of molecularly and physiologically diverse sensory neurons (Ia, Ib, Ic) in the murine cochlea, which collectively encode a wide range of sound intensities. Runx1 is enriched in Ib and Ic spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) precursors by late embryogenesis. Loss of Runx1 from embryonic SGNs (Runx1CKO) shifted the balance of subtype identities without affecting neuron number, with more SGNs taking on Ia identities at the expense of Ib/Ic identities, as shown by single cell RNA-sequencing. This conversion was more complete for genes linked to neuronal function than for those related to connectivity. Accordingly, although synaptic position did not change, synapses in the Ib/Ic location took on Ia-like properties. Suprathreshold responses to sound were enhanced in the auditory nerve of Runx1CKO mice, confirming an expansion of neurons behaving functionally like Ia SGNs. Fate-mapping experiments further showed that deletion of Runx1 shortly after birth also redirected Ib and Ic SGNs towards Ia identity, indicating that SGN subtype identities remain plastic postnatally. Altogether, these findings show that diverse neuronal identities essential for normal auditory stimulus coding arise in a hierarchical fashion that remains malleable during postnatal development.

                Hearing is an essential sense in the life cycle of malaria mosquitoes. Within large swarms formed transiently at dusk, mosquitoes acoustically recognize their mating partners by their wingbeats. Indeed, malaria mosquitoes only respond to the flight tones of mating partners during swarm time. This phenomenon implies a sophisticated context- and time-dependent modulation of mosquito audition, the mechanisms of which are still largely unknown. Using transcriptomics, we identify a complex network of candidate neuromodulators regulating mosquito hearing. Among them, octopamine stands out as regulator of the auditory performance during swarm time. To explore octopamine roles in mosquito hearing, we carried out an in-depth analysis of octopamine-mediated effects on auditory function. We found that octopamine affects the properties of the mosquito ear on multiple levels: it modulates the tuning and stiffness of the flagellar sound receiver and it controls the erection of antennal fibrillae in males. We found that two different receptors are driving octopamine auditory roles, including a novel beta octopamine receptor. We also demonstrate that the octopaminergic auditory control system can be targeted by insecticides. Our findings identify octopamine signalling as a key component of hearing and mating partner detection in malaria mosquitoes, and as a potential novel target for mosquito control.

                Everyday visual experience contains many brief stationary moments when we continue to be consciously aware our sensory input. However, neural activity is dramatically attenuated shortly after the onset response, and it is unclear how the content of our experience remains stable nevertheless. To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of object representation in sustained viewing conditions, we use intracranial recordings from ten patients viewing images from variable categories in multiple durations. We reveal that the distributed neural representation of categories and exemplars in posterior-sensory regions remains sustained and stable, mirroring the stability of experience, despite substantial variability in activity after the onset response. Additionally, we find transient coding of visual content in frontoparietal cortex, even when no report is required. Together, our results suggest sustained perception is maintained by sensory regions, not by overall activation magnitude but by the position within an "Experience Subspace", and perceptual changes involve frontoparietal regions, regardless of the task. These findings directly inform recent large-scale attempts to test theories of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordinated cadherin functions sculpt respiratory motor circuit connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Breathing, and the motor circuits that control it, are essential for life. At the core of respiratory circuits are Dbx1-derived interneurons, which generate the rhythm and pattern of breathing, and phrenic motor neurons (MNs), which provide the final motor output that drives diaphragm muscle contractions during inspiration. Despite their critical function, the principles that dictate how respiratory circuits assemble are unknown. Here we show that coordinated activity of a type I cadherin (N-cadherin) and type II cadherins (Cadherin-6, -9, and -10) is required in both MNs and Dbx1-derived neurons to generate robust respiratory motor output. Both MN- and Dbx1-specific cadherin inactivation during a critical developmental window results in perinatal lethality due to respiratory failure and a striking reduction in phrenic MN bursting activity. This combinatorial cadherin code is required to establish phrenic MN cell body and dendritic topography; surprisingly, however, cell body position appears to be dispensable for the targeting of phrenic MNs by descending respiratory inputs. Our findings demonstrate that type I and type II cadherins function cooperatively throughout the respiratory circuit to generate a robust breathing output and reveal novel strategies that drive the assembly of motor circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Role for the Fornix in Temporal Sequence Memory</a></h4>

              
                Converging evidence from studies of human and nonhuman animals suggests that the hippocampus contributes to sequence learning by using temporal context to bind sequentially occurring items. The fornix is a white matter pathway containing the major input and output pathways of the hippocampus, including projections from medial septum, and to diencephalon, striatum, and prefrontal cortex. If the fornix meaningfully contributes to hippocampal function, then individual differences in fornix microstructure might predict sequence memory. Here, we tested this prediction by performing tractography in 51 healthy adults who had undertaken a sequence memory task. Microstructure properties of the fornix were compared with those of tracts connecting medial temporal lobe regions, but not predominantly the hippocampus: the Parahippocampal Cingulum bundle (PHC) (conveying retrosplenial projections to parahippocampal cortex) and the Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus (ILF) (conveying occipital projections to perirhinal cortex). Using principal components analysis, we combined Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging measures obtained from multi-shell diffusion MRI into two informative indices, the first (PC1) capturing axonal packing/myelin, the second (PC2) capturing microstructural complexity. We found a significant correlation between fornix PC2 and implicit reaction-time indices of sequence memory, indicating that greater fornix microstructural complexity is associated with better sequence memory. No such relationship was found with measures from the PHC and ILF. This study highlights the importance of the fornix in aiding memory for objects within a temporal context, potentially reflecting a role in mediating network communication within an extended hippocampal system.

                Amyloid-{beta} precursor protein (APP) regulates neuronal activity through the release of secreted APP (sAPP) acting at cell-surface receptors. APP and sAPP were reported to bind to the extracellular sushi domain 1 (SD1) of GABAB receptors (GBRs). A 17 amino-acid peptide (APP17) derived from APP was sufficient for SD1 binding and shown to mimic the inhibitory effect of sAPP on neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity. The functional effects of APP17 and sAPP were similar to those of the GBR agonist baclofen and blocked by a GBR antagonist. These experiments led to the proposal that sAPP activates GBRs to exert its neuronal effects. However, whether APP17 and sAPP indeed influence classical GBR signaling pathways in heterologous cells was not analyzed. Here, we confirm that APP17 binds to GBRs with nanomolar affinity. However, biochemical and electrophysiological assays indicate that APP17 does not influence GBR activity in heterologous cells. Moreover, we found no evidence for APP17 regulating K+ currents in cultured neurons, neurotransmitter release in brain slices, or neuronal activity in vivo. Our results show that APP17 is not a functional GBR ligand and indicate that sAPP exerts neuronal effects through receptors other than GBRs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multifunctional requirements for ERK1/2 signaling in the development of ganglionic eminence derived glia and cortical inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 intracellular signaling pathway is activated by numerous cues during brain development and dysregulated in neurodevelopmental syndromes, particularly the RASopathies and certain forms of autism. Cortical excitatory/inhibitory imbalance is thought to be critical in the neuropathogenesis of these conditions. However, the developmental functions of ERK1/2 signaling in cortical inhibitory neurons (CINs) and other medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived non-neuronal cells are poorly understood. Here, we genetically modulated ERK1/2 signaling in mouse MGE neural progenitors or GABAergic neurons in vivo. We find that MEK-ERK1/2 signaling is essential for regulating MGE-derived oligodendrocyte number in the anterior commissure. While Erk1/2 inactivation does not alter CIN number, we show that CIN-autonomous ERK1/2 signaling is necessary for chemogenetic activity-dependent FOSB expression in vivo. This deficit coincides with a significant and persistent reduction in somatostatin, but not parvalbumin, expression in a subset of ERK1/2 deleted inhibitory neurons. Interestingly, one week of chronic chemogenetic stimulation in juvenile or adult animals partially rescues the decrease in somatostatin expression in Erk1/2 mutant CINs. Our data demonstrate ERK1/2 signaling is required for the establishment of MGE-derived glia, whereas in CINs, ERK1/2 drives activity dependent-responses and the expression of somatostatin in a subset of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A circuit mechanism for the coordinated actions of opposing neuropeptide and neurotransmitter signals</a></h4>

              
                Fast-acting neurotransmitters and slow, modulatory neuropeptides are commonly co-released from neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), albeit from distinct synaptic vesicles. The mechanisms of how co-released neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that have opposing actions, e.g., stimulatory versus inhibitory, work together to exert control of neural circuit output remain unclear. This question has been difficult to resolve due to the inability to selectively isolate these signaling pathways in a cell- and circuit-specific manner. To overcome these barriers, we developed a genetic-based anatomical disconnect procedure that utilizes distinct DNA recombinases to independently facilitate conditional in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of neurotransmitter- and neuropeptide-related genes in distinct cell types in two different brain regions simultaneously. With this approach we demonstrate that the stimulatory neuropeptide neurotensin (Nts) and the inhibitory neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are co-released from neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), work coordinately to activate dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA-DA). We show that GABA release from LH-Nts neurons acts on GABA neurons within the VTA to rapidly disinhibit VTA-DA neurons, while Nts signals through the Nts receptor 1 (Ntsr1) on VTA-DA neurons to promote a slow depolarization of these cells. Thus, these two signals act on distinct time scales through different cell types to enhance mesolimbic dopamine neuron activation, which optimizes behavioral reinforcement. These data demonstrate a circuit-based mechanism for the coordinated action of a neurotransmitter and neuropeptide with opposing effects on cell physiology.

	<p>Executive function task (EF) deficits are hypothesized to underlie difficulties with self-regulation. However, tasks assessing EF impairments have only been weakly correlated with rating scales that index self-regulation difficulties. A community sample of children and youth aged between 8 and 20 years old were assessed longitudinally. Growth curve analyses and correlations were conducted to better understand how these two types of measures relate to one another across development, as well as the impact of age-related variance. EF was assessed using the Stroop Task and Trail Making test and behavioral ratings of self-regulation were captured using the SWAN scale. EF task performance improved steeply until age 14&amp;amp;ndash;15, whereas the SWAN Scale showed small age-related decreases. EF task performance was moderately correlated with age among 8&amp;amp;ndash;13-year-olds and to a lesser extent among 14&amp;amp;ndash;20-year-olds. SWAN scores were not significantly related to age in either group. Correlations were similar in an ADHD &amp;amp;ldquo;at-risk&amp;amp;rdquo; subgroup. EF task performance and parent ratings of attention regulation have different developmental trajectories, which may partly explain why correlations are low to modest in these samples. In particular, age-related variance is an important methodological consideration with significant implications for the assessment of self-regulation in children and youth with ADHD.</p>

	<p>The high prevalence of diagnosed cases of severe neurological disorders, a significant proportion of which are epilepsy, contributes to a high level of mortality and disability in the population. Neurotrophic factors BDNF and GNDF are considered promising agents aimed at increasing the central nervous system&amp;amp;rsquo;s adaptive potential for the development of the epileptiform activity. Despite the pronounced neuroprotective and anticonvulsant potential, an appropriate way to stimulate these endogenous signaling molecules with minimal risk of side effects remains an open question. Herein, we assessed the safety of gene therapy using original adeno-associated viral constructs carrying the genes of neurotrophic factors BDNF and GDNF in the early postnatal period of development of experimental animals. The intraventricular injection of AAV-Syn-BDNF-eGFP and AAV-Syn-GDNF-eGFP viral constructs into newborn mice was found to provide persistent overexpression of target genes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in vivo for four weeks after injection. The application of viral constructs has a multidirectional effect on the weight and body length characteristics of mice in the early postnatal period; however, it ensures the animals&amp;amp;rsquo; resistance to the development of seizure activity under audiogenic stimulation in the late postnatal period and preserves basic behavioral reactions, emotional status, as well as the mnestic and cognitive abilities of mice after simulated stress. Our results demonstrated the safety of using the AAV-Syn-BDNF-eGFP and AAV-Syn-GDNF-eGFP viral constructs in vivo, which indicates the expediency of further testing the constructs as therapeutic anticonvulsants.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to determine how transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) alters autonomic nervous activity by comparing the effects of different tVNS frequencies and current intensities. We also investigated the sex-dependent autonomic response to tVNS. Thirty-five healthy adult participants were stimulated using a tVNS stimulator at the left cymba conchae while sitting on a reclining chair; tVNS-induced waveform changes were then recorded for different stimulus frequencies (Experiment 1: 3.0 mA at 100 Hz, 25 Hz, 10 Hz, 1 Hz, and 0 Hz (no stimulation)) and current intensities (Experiment 2: 100 Hz at 3.0 mA, 1.0 mA, 0.2 mA (below sensory threshold), and 0 mA (no stimulation)) using an electrocardiogram. Pulse widths were set at 250 &amp;amp;micro;s in both experiment 1 and 2. Changes in heart rate (HR), root-mean-square of the difference between two successive R waves (RMSSD), and the ratio between low-frequency (LF) (0.04&amp;amp;ndash;0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF) (0.15&amp;amp;ndash;0.40 Hz) bands (LF/HF) in spectral analysis, which indicates sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively, in heart rate variability (HRV), were recorded for analysis. Although stimulation at all frequencies significantly reduced HR (p = 0.001), stimulation at 100 Hz had the most pronounced effect (p = 0.001) in Experiment 1 and was revealed to be required to deliver at 3.0 mA in Experiment 2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, participants with higher baseline sympathetic activity experienced higher parasympathetic response during stimulation, and sex differences may exist in the autonomic responses by the application of tVNS. Therefore, our findings suggest that optimal autonomic changes induced by tVNS to the left cymba conchae vary depending on stimulating parameters and sex.</p>

	<p>The objective of the study is to provide age-related normative values for dorsal sural nerve (DSN) and to analyse its application during follow-up of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) pre-symptomatic subjects. We consecutively recruited ATTRv pre-symptomatic carriers in which clinical examination, cardiological evaluation, and nerve conduction studies of the sural nerve and DSN were performed. To provide normative data of DSN, neurophysiologic parameters from healthy controls referred to our service were entered into linear regression analyses to check the relative influence of age and height. A correction grid was then derived. We collected 231 healthy subjects: the mean DSN sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude was 9.99 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.48 &amp;amp;mu;V; the mean conduction velocity was 49.01 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.31 m/s. Significant correlations were found between age and height with DSN SNAP amplitude. Fifteen ATTRv pre-symptomatic carriers were examined. Sural nerve NCS were normal in 12/15 and revealed low/borderline values in three subjects. Considering our correction grid, we found an abnormal DNS amplitude in 9/15 subjects and low/borderline values in 2/15. In ATTRv, early detection of peripheral nerve damage is crucial to start a disease-modifying treatment. DSN may be easily and reliably included in the routine neurophysiological follow-up of ATTRv pre-symptomatic subjects.</p>

	<p>Cognitive load significantly influences learning effectiveness. All the three types of cognitive load&amp;amp;mdash;intrinsic, extraneous, and germane&amp;amp;mdash;are important for guiding teachers in preparing effective instructional designs for students. However, the techniques used to assess the relationship between brain activity and cognitive load during learning activities require further investigation. This study preliminarily examined cognitive load during mathematics computations based on cognitive-load theory. We used event-related potentials to compare carryover and without carryover additions under three types of stimuli (uncoloured Arabic numerals, colourful Arabic numerals, and Chinese numerals) to measure learners&amp;amp;rsquo; cognitive load. According to the concept and rationale of cognitive-load theory, the design defined the extraneous and germane cognitive load to measure the N1 and P2 components and the relevant behavioural data. The highest P2 amplitude was observed in the Chinese numerals condition as extraneous cognitive load, and the N1 component was observed in the colourful Arabic numerals condition as germane cognitive load. Thus, both components may play an important role in extraneous and germane cognitive load. Additionally, these exhibit negative correlations during mathematical computations. This study&amp;amp;rsquo;s findings and implications offer insights into future ways for assessing cognitive load using brain imaging techniques and potential applications for brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces.</p>

	<p>This study was carried out on six adult red kangaroos of both sexes. To determine the location of the oligodendrocytes (OLGs) of the hippocampus (Hip) and corpus callosum (CC), the method of impregnation of the neuroglia with silver salts was applied. The iron distribution in the OLGs was determined by the histochemical method. The Nissl method was used to determine the location of the brain structure and to analyze the number of OLGs. In the Hip, these cells are located one beside another, mainly in blood vessels and neurons; in the neocortex (NC), they are located in layers I&amp;amp;ndash;VI; and in the CC, they are arranged in characteristic rows and accompany both nerve fibers and blood vessels. The analysis of the results obtained by the chosen methods in the Hip, NC, and CC in males and females did not show statistically significant differences in the distribution and location of the red kangaroo OLGs. The involvement of these cells is a physiological process that proceeds in a similar manner throughout the life of individuals and actively influences the metabolism of neurons and myelin.</p>

	<p>The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and systemic immune-inflammatory (SII) index, which provide a simple, rapid, inexpensive method to measure the level of inflammation, have been examined as potential inflammatory biomarkers of bipolar disorder (BD) in several studies. We conducted a case-control study recruiting 180 BD patients and 407 healthy controls. BD patients who met the inclusion criteria and were hospitalized due to BD at the psychiatry clinic of the University General Hospital of Larisa, Greece, until September 2021 were included in the study. Among them, 111 patients experienced a manic episode and 69 patients experienced a depressive episode. Data including a complete blood count were retrieved from their first admission to the hospital. Bipolar patients had a higher NLR, MLR and SII index compared to healthy controls when they were experiencing a manic episode (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and a depressive episode (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). MLR was increased with large effect size only in patients expressing manic episodes. Neutrophils and NLR had the highest area under the curve with a cutoff of 4.38 and 2.15 in the ROC curve, respectively. Gender-related differences were mainly observed in the SII index, with males who were expressing manic episodes and females expressing depressive episodes having an increased index compared to healthy controls. The NLR, MLR and SII index were significantly higher in patients with BD than in healthy controls, which implies a higher grade of inflammation in BD patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Questionable Research Practices, Low Statistical Power, and Other Obstacles to Replicability: Why Preclinical Neuroscience Research Would Benefit from Registered Reports</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Replicability, the degree to which a previous scientific finding can be repeated in a distinct set of data, has been considered an integral component of institutionalized scientific practice since its inception several hundred years ago. In the past decade, large-scale replication studies have demonstrated that replicability is far from favorable, across multiple scientific fields. Here, I evaluate this literature and describe contributing factors including the prevalence of questionable research practices (QRPs), misunderstanding of <I>p</I>-values, and low statistical power. I subsequently discuss how these issues manifest specifically in preclinical neuroscience research. I conclude that these problems are multifaceted and difficult to solve, relying on the actions of early and late career researchers, funding sources, academic publishers, and others. I assert that any viable solution to the problem of substandard replicability must include changing academic incentives, with adoption of registered reports being the most immediately impactful and pragmatic strategy. For animal research in particular, comprehensive reporting guidelines that document potential sources of sensitivity for experimental outcomes is an essential addition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Ablation of Sod2 in Astrocytes Induces Sex-Specific Effects on Cognitive Function, D-Serine Availability, and Astrogliosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive decline is a debilitating aspect of aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species, neuroinflammation, and astrogliosis. This study investigated the effects of decreased mitochondrial antioxidant response specifically in astrocytes on cognitive performance and neuronal function in C57BL/6J mice using a tamoxifen-inducible astrocyte-specific knockout of manganese superoxide dismutase (aSOD2-KO), a mitochondrial matrix antioxidant that detoxifies superoxide generated during mitochondrial respiration. We reduced astrocyte SOD2 levels in male and female mice at 11&ndash;12 months of age and tested in an automated home cage (PhenoTyper) apparatus for diurnal patterns, spatial learning, and memory function at 15 months of age. aSOD2-KO impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory and decreased cognitive flexibility in the reversal phase of the testing paradigm in males. Female aSOD2-KO showed no learning and memory deficits compared with age-matched controls despite significant reduction in hippocampal SOD2 expression. aSOD2-KO males further showed decreased hippocampal long-term potentiation, but paired-pulse facilitation was unaffected. Levels of <scp>d</scp>-serine, an NMDA receptor coagonist, were also reduced in aSOD2-KO mice, but female knockouts showed a compensatory increase in serine racemase expression. Furthermore, aSOD2-KO mice demonstrated increased density of astrocytes, indicative of astrogliosis, in the hippocampus compared with age-matched controls. These data demonstrate that reduction in mitochondrial antioxidant stress response in astrocytes recapitulates age-related deficits in cognitive function, <scp>d</scp>-serine availability, and astrogliosis. Therefore, improving astrocyte mitochondrial homeostasis may provide a therapeutic target for intervention for cognitive impairment in aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Diminished antioxidant response is associated with increased astrogliosis in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. Manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) is an antioxidant in the mitochondrial matrix that detoxifies superoxide and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis. We show that astrocytic ablation of SOD2 impairs hippocampal-dependent plasticity in spatial working memory, reduces long-term potentiation of hippocampal neurons and levels of the neuromodulator <scp>d</scp>-serine, and increases astrogliosis, consistent with defects in advanced aging and Alzheimer's disease. Our data provide strong evidence for sex-specific effects of astrocytic SOD2 functions in age-related cognitive dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase Regulates Dscam Expression through a Noncanonical Function of the Cytoplasmic Poly(A)-Binding Protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) plays a pivotal role in the development, degeneration, and regeneration of neurons. DLK can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The <I>Drosophila</I> DLK, Wallenda (Wnd), regulates the expression of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) to control presynaptic arbor growth. This regulation is mediated by the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of <I>Dscam</I> mRNA, which suggests that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) mediate DLK function. We performed a genome-wide cell-based RNAi screen of RBPs and identified the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, pAbp, as an RBP that mediates Wnd-induced increase in Dscam expression. Genetic analysis shows that Wnd requires <I>pAbp</I> for promoting presynaptic arbor growth and for enhancing Dscam expression. Our analysis revealed that <I>Dscam</I> mRNAs harbor short poly(A) tails. We identified a region in <I>Dscam</I> 3'UTR that specifically interacts with pAbp. Removing this region significantly reduced Wnd-induced increase in Dscam expression. These suggest that a noncanonical interaction of PABP with the 3'UTR of target transcripts is essential for DLK functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The kinase DLK plays key roles in a multitude of neuronal responses, including axon development, neurodegeneration, and nerve injury. Previous studies show that DLK acts via mRNAs to regulate protein synthesis, but how DLK does so is poorly understood. This study demonstrates that DLK regulates the synthesis of Dscam through the poly(A)-binding protein PABP-C. Whereas PABP-C is known as a general translational activator, our study shows that DLK-mediated Dscam expression involves a noncanonical interaction between PABP-C and the <I>Dscam</I> mRNA, which leads to a selective regulation of <I>Dscam</I> translation by PABP-C. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms that underlie the function of DLK and regulation of gene expression of PABP-C.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Meclizine and Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Agonists Attenuate Severe Pain and Ca2+ Activity of Primary Sensory Neurons in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects ~68% of patients undergoing chemotherapy, causing debilitating neuropathic pain and reducing quality of life. Cisplatin is a commonly used platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug known to cause CIPN, possibly by causing oxidative stress damage to primary sensory neurons. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are widely hypothesized to be involved in pain processing and pain mitigation. Meclizine is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist known to have neuroprotective effects, including an anti-oxidative effect. Here, we used a mouse model of cisplatin-induced CIPN using male and female mice to test agonists of mGluR8 and Group II mGluR as well as meclizine as interventions to reduce cisplatin-induced pain. We performed behavioral pain tests, and we imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of the large population of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons <I>in vivo</I>. For the latter, we used a genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Pirt-GCaMP3, which enabled us to monitor different drug interventions at the level of the intact DRG neuronal ensemble. We found that CIPN increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in DRG neurons, increased number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and increased hyper-responses to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. We found that mechanical and thermal pain caused by CIPN was significantly attenuated by the mGluR8 agonist, (S)&ndash;3,4-DCPG, the Group II mGluR agonist, LY379268, and the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, meclizine. DRG neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity elevated by CIPN was attenuated by LY379268 and meclizine, but not by (S)&ndash;3,4-DCPG. Furthermore, meclizine and LY379268 attenuated cisplatin-induced weight loss. These results suggest that Group II mGluR agonist, mGluR8 agonist, and meclizine are promising candidates as new treatment options for CIPN, and studies of their mechanisms are warranted.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a painful condition that affects most chemotherapy patients and persists several months or longer after treatment ends. Research on CIPN mechanism is extensive but has produced only few clinically useful treatments. Using <I>in vivo</I> GCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in live animals over 1800 neurons/dorsal root ganglia (DRG) at once, we have characterized the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin and three treatments that decrease CIPN pain. Cisplatin increases sensory neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and develops various sensitization. Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, LY379268 or the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, meclizine decreases cisplatin's effects on neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and reduces pain hypersensitivity. Our results and experiments provide insights into cellular effects of cisplatin and drugs preventing CIPN pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adenosine and Astrocytes Determine the Developmental Dynamics of Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity in the Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>During development, critical periods of synaptic plasticity facilitate the reordering and refinement of neural connections, allowing the definitive synaptic circuits responsible for correct adult physiology to be established. The L4&ndash;L2/3 synapses in the somatosensory cortex (S1) exhibit a presynaptic form of spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) that probably fulfills a role in synaptic refinement. This t-LTD persists until the fourth postnatal week in mice, disappearing thereafter. When we investigated the mechanisms underlying this maturation-related loss of t-LTD in either sex mouse slices, we found that it could be completely recovered by antagonizing adenosine type 1 receptors. By contrast, an agonist of A<SUB>1</SUB>R impeded the induction of t-LTD at P13&ndash;27. Furthermore, we found that the adenosine that mediated the loss of t-LTD at the end of the fourth week of development is most probably supplied by astrocytes. At more mature stages (P38&ndash;60), we found that the protocol used to induce t-LTD provokes t-LTP. We characterized the mechanisms underlying the induction of this form of LTP, and we found it to be expressed presynaptically, as witnessed by paired-pulse and coefficient of variation analysis. In addition, this form of presynaptic t-LTP requires the activation of NMDARs and mGlu1Rs, and the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the postsynaptic neuron through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Nitric oxide is also required for t-LTP as a messenger in the postsynaptic neuron as are the adenosine and glutamate that are released in association with astrocyte signaling. These results provide direct evidence of the mechanisms that close the window of plasticity associated with t-LTD and that drive the switch in synaptic transmission from t-LTD to t-LTP at L4&ndash;L2/3 synapses, in which astrocytes play a central role.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During development, critical periods of plasticity facilitate the reordering and refining of neural connections, allowing correct adult physiology to be established. The L4&ndash;L2/3 synapses in the somatosensory cortex exhibit a presynaptic form plasticity (LTD) that probably fulfills a role in synaptic refinement. It is present until the fourth postnatal week in mice, disappearing thereafter. The mechanisms that are responsible for this loss of plasticity are not clear. We describe here these mechanisms and those involved in the switch from LTD to LTP observed as the brain matures. Defining these events responsible for closing (and opening) plasticity windows may be important for brain repair, sensorial recovery, the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, and for educational policy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Influence of Rat Central Thalamic Neurons on Foraging Behavior in a Hazardous Environment</a></h4>

              
                <p>Foraging entails a complex balance between approach and avoidance alongside sensorimotor and homeostatic processes under the control of multiple cortical and subcortical areas. Recently, it has become clear that several thalamic nuclei located near the midline regulate motivated behaviors. However, one midline thalamic nucleus that projects to key nodes in the foraging network, the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT), has received little attention so far. Therefore, the present study examined CMT contributions to foraging behavior using inactivation and unit recording techniques in male rats. Inactivation of CMT or the basolateral amygdala (BLA) with muscimol abolished the normally cautious behavior of rats in the foraging task. Moreover, CMT neurons showed large but heterogeneous activity changes during the foraging task, with many neurons decreasing or increasing their discharge rates, with a modest bias for the latter. A generalized linear model revealed that the nature (inhibitory vs excitatory) and relative magnitude of the activity modulations seen in CMT neurons differed markedly from those of principal BLA cells but were very similar to those of fast-spiking BLA interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that CMT is an important regulator of foraging behavior. In the Discussion, we consider how CMT is integrated into the network of structures that regulate foraging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Foraging entails a complex balance between approach and avoidance alongside sensorimotor and homeostatic processes under the control of multiple cortical and subcortical areas. Although the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT) is connected to many nodes in this network, its role in the regulation of foraging behavior has not been investigated so far. Here, we examined CMT contributions to foraging behavior using inactivation and unit recording techniques. We found that CMT inactivation abolishes the normally cautious foraging behavior of rats and that CMT neurons show large but heterogeneous changes in firing rates during the foraging task. Together, these results suggest that CMT is an important regulator of foraging behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pallidal Activity Related to Posture and Movement during Reaching in the Cat</a></h4>

              
                <p>We tested the hypothesis that the pallidum contributes to the control of both posture and movement. We recorded neuronal activity from the pallidum in a task in which male cats reached forward from a standing posture to depress a lever. In agreement with previous studies, we found that a majority of pallidal cells (91/116, 78%), including neurons in both the entopeduncular nucleus and the globus pallidus, showed significant modulation of their activity during reaching with the contralateral limb. Mostly different populations of cells were active during the transport (flexion) and lever press (extension) phase of the task. Most cells showed dynamic patterns of activity related to the movement. However, a modest proportion of modulated cells (18/91, 20%) showed properties consistent with a contribution to the control of anticipatory postural responses, whereas a further 10% showed activity consistent with a contribution to postural support during the movement. Although some cells that showed modified activity only during reaches with the contralateral forelimb, many cells (65/91, 71%) were also activated during reaches with the ipsilateral forelimb. This was particularly true for cells related to the lever press, many of which discharged similarly during reaches of either limb. This suggests a context-dependent control of movement and posture in which the same muscles are used for different functions during contralateral and ipsilateral reach. Comparison with the results from recordings made previously from the motor cortex and the pontomedullary reticular formation in the same task show more similarities with the former than the latter.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pathologic changes in basal ganglia function frequently lead to problems with postural stability and gait initiation. Here, we show that some neurons in one of the output regions of the basal ganglia, the pallidum, show discharge activity compatible with a contribution to postural control. At the same time, we note that such cells are a minority in this region with most cells being related to movement rather than posture. We also show that many neurons are active during movements of both the contralateral and ipsilateral limbs, sometimes with identical discharge patterns. We suggest that this indicates a context-dependent regulation of movement and posture in the pallidum.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the hippocampus, inducing the learning and memory deficiencies. Ras GTPase is closely related to the synaptic function and memory. This study was to investigate the effects of farnesyl transferase inhibitor lonafarnib on the synaptic structure and function in AD male mice and explore the potential mechanism. Our results showed 50 mg/kg lonafarnib (intraperitoneal) rescued the impaired spatial memory and improved the damaged synaptic transmission and plasticity of A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice. In addition, lonafarnib ameliorated the morphology of synaptic dendrites and spines in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice. Furthermore, lonafarnib enhanced &alpha;7nAChR cell surface expression and phosphorylation of downstream Akt and CaMKII in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which were inhibited by &alpha;7nAChR antagonist methyl lycaconitine (MLA), and increased the phosphorylation of CREB in a CaMKII- but not ERK-dependent way. Lonafarnib enhanced hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which was sensitive to MLA and KN93 (an inhibitor of CaMKII), but not related to ERK and Akt pathways. H-Ras, but not Rhes, was related to the lonafarnib induced improvement of &alpha;7nAChR cell surface expression and BDNF content. Interestingly, lonafarnib induced improvement of synaptic transmission, plasticity and spatial cognition in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice was abolished by BDNF deprivation with TrkB/Fc chimera protein. Our results indicate that lonafarnib can rescue the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which may be related to the improvement of BDNF content through the H-Ras-&alpha;7nAChR-dependent CaMKII-CREB pathway, leading to the improvement of spatial cognition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the hippocampus, inducing the learning and memory deficiencies. However, no effective drugs have not been developed for the treatment of AD synaptic. This study for the first time reported the beneficial effects of Ras inhibitor lonafarnib on the synaptic structure and function in AD mice, providing an alternative way for the treatment of "synaptic disease" in AD patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Auditory and Visual Phase-Locking Are Observed during Audio-Visual Benefit and Silent Lip-Reading for Speech Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Speech perception in noisy environments is enhanced by seeing facial movements of communication partners. However, the neural mechanisms by which audio and visual speech are combined are not fully understood. We explore MEG phase-locking to auditory and visual signals in MEG recordings from 14 human participants (6 females, 8 males) that reported words from single spoken sentences. We manipulated the acoustic clarity and visual speech signals such that critical speech information is present in auditory, visual, or both modalities. MEG coherence analysis revealed that both auditory and visual speech envelopes (auditory amplitude modulations and lip aperture changes) were phase-locked to 2-6 Hz brain responses in auditory and visual cortex, consistent with entrainment to syllable-rate components. Partial coherence analysis was used to separate neural responses to correlated audio-visual signals and showed non-zero phase-locking to auditory envelope in occipital cortex during audio-visual (AV) speech. Furthermore, phase-locking to auditory signals in visual cortex was enhanced for AV speech compared with audio-only speech that was matched for intelligibility. Conversely, auditory regions of the superior temporal gyrus did not show above-chance partial coherence with visual speech signals during AV conditions but did show partial coherence in visual-only conditions. Hence, visual speech enabled stronger phase-locking to auditory signals in visual areas, whereas phase-locking of visual speech in auditory regions only occurred during silent lip-reading. Differences in these cross-modal interactions between auditory and visual speech signals are interpreted in line with cross-modal predictive mechanisms during speech perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Verbal communication in noisy environments is challenging, especially for hearing-impaired individuals. Seeing facial movements of communication partners improves speech perception when auditory signals are degraded or absent. The neural mechanisms supporting lip-reading or audio-visual benefit are not fully understood. Using MEG recordings and partial coherence analysis, we show that speech information is used differently in brain regions that respond to auditory and visual speech. While visual areas use visual speech to improve phase-locking to auditory speech signals, auditory areas do not show phase-locking to visual speech unless auditory speech is absent and visual speech is used to substitute for missing auditory signals. These findings highlight brain processes that combine visual and auditory signals to support speech understanding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensorimotor Cortex GABA Moderates the Relationship between Physical Exertion and Assessments of Effort</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experiences of physical exertion guide our assessments of effort. While these assessments critically influence our decisions to engage in daily activities, little is known about how they are generated. We had female and male human participants exert grip force and assess how effortful these exertions felt; and used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure their brain GABA concentration. We found that variability in exertion (i.e., the coefficient of variation in their force exertion profile) was associated with increases in assessments of effort, making participants judge efforts as more costly. GABA levels in the sensorimotor cortex (SM1) moderated the influence of exertion variability on overassessments of effort. In individuals with higher sensorimotor GABA, exertion variability had a diminished influence on overassessments of effort. Essentially, sensorimotor GABA had a protective effect on the influence of exertion variability on inflations of effort assessment. Our findings provide a neurobiological account of how the brain's GABAergic system integrates features of physical exertion into judgments of effort, and how basic sensorimotor properties may influence higher-order judgments of effort.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Feelings of effort critically shape our decisions to partake in activities of daily living. It remains unclear how the brain translates physical activity into judgments about effort (i.e., "How effortful did that activity feel?"). Using modeling of behavior and neuroimaging, we show how the nervous system uses information about physical exertion to generate assessments of effort. We found that higher variability in exertion was associated with increases in assessments of effort, making participants judge efforts as more costly. GABA, the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter, moderated the influence of exertion variability on overassessments of effort. These findings illustrate how low-level features of motor performance and sensorimotor neurochemistry influence higher-order cognitive processes related to feelings of effort.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Transfer of Tactile Learning from Trained to Untrained Body Parts Supported by Cortical Coactivation in Primary Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A pioneering study by <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Volkmann (1858)</cross-ref> revealed that training on a tactile discrimination task improved task performance, indicative of tactile learning, and that such tactile learning transferred from trained to untrained body parts. However, the neural mechanisms underlying tactile learning and transfer of tactile learning have remained unclear. We trained groups of human subjects (female and male) in daily sessions on a tactile discrimination task either by stimulating the palm of the right hand or the sole of the right foot. Task performance before training was similar between the palm and sole. Posttraining transfer of tactile learning was greater from the trained right sole to the untrained right palm than from the trained right palm to the untrained right sole. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern classification analysis revealed that the somatotopic representation of the right palm in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was coactivated during tactile stimulation of the right sole. More pronounced coactivation in the cortical representation of the right palm was associated with lower tactile performance for tactile stimulation of the right sole and more pronounced subsequent transfer of tactile learning from the trained right sole to the untrained right palm. In contrast, coactivation of the cortical sole representation during tactile stimulation of the palm was less pronounced and no association with tactile performance and subsequent transfer of tactile learning was found. These results indicate that tactile learning may transfer to untrained body parts that are coactivated to support tactile learning with the trained body part.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual skills such as the discrimination of tactile cues can improve by means of training, indicative of perceptual learning and sensory plasticity. However, it has remained unclear whether and if so, how such perceptual learning can occur if the training task is very difficult. Here, we show for tactile perceptual learning that the representation of the palm of the hand in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) is coactivated to support learning of a difficult tactile discrimination task with tactile stimulation of the sole of the foot. Such cortical coactivation of an untrained body part to support tactile learning with a trained body part might be critically involved in the subsequent transfer of tactile learning between the trained and untrained body parts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altered Development of Amygdala-Connected Brain Regions in Males and Females with Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altered amygdala development is implicated in the neurobiology of autism, but little is known about the coordinated development of the brain regions directly connected with the amygdala. Here we investigated the volumetric development of an amygdala-connected network, defined as the set of brain regions with monosynaptic connections with the amygdala, in autism from early to middle childhood. A total of 950 longitudinal structural MRI scans were acquired from 282 children (93 female) with autism and 128 children with typical development (61 female) at up to four time points (mean ages: 39, 52, 64, and 137 months, respectively). Volumes from 32 amygdala-connected brain regions were examined using mixed effects multivariate distance matrix regression. The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 was administered to assess degree of autistic traits and social impairments. The amygdala-connected network exhibited persistent diagnostic differences (<I>p</I> values &le; 0.03) that increased over time (<I>p</I> values &le; 0.02). These differences were most prominent in autistics with more impacted social functioning at baseline. This pattern was not observed across regions without monosynaptic amygdala connection. We observed qualitative sex differences. In males, the bilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortices were most affected, while in females the left fusiform and superior temporal gyri were most affected. In conclusion, (1) autism is associated with widespread alterations to the development of brain regions connected with the amygdala, which were associated with autistic social behaviors; and (2) autistic males and females exhibited different patterns of alterations, adding to a growing body of evidence of sex differences in the neurobiology of autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Global patterns of development across brain regions with monosynaptic connection to the amygdala differentiate autism from typical development, and are modulated by social functioning in early childhood. Alterations to brain regions within the amygdala-connected network differed in males and females with autism. Results also indicate larger volumetric differences in regions having monosynaptic connection with the amygdala than in regions without monosynaptic connection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Three Dimensions of Association Link Migraine Symptoms and Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migraine is a heterogeneous disorder with variable symptoms and responsiveness to therapy. Because of previous analytic shortcomings, variance in migraine symptoms has been inconsistently related to brain function. In the current analysis, we used data from two sites (<I>n</I> = 143, male and female humans), and performed canonical correlation analysis, relating resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) with a broad range of migraine symptoms, ranging from headache characteristics to sleep abnormalities. This identified three dimensions of covariance between symptoms and RSFC. The first dimension related to headache intensity, headache frequency, pain catastrophizing, affect, sleep disturbances, and somatic abnormalities, and was associated with frontoparietal and dorsal attention network connectivity, both of which are major cognitive networks. Additionally, RSFC scores from this dimension, both the baseline value and the change from baseline to postintervention, were associated with responsiveness to mind-body therapy. The second dimension was related to an inverse association between pain and anxiety, and to default mode network connectivity. The final dimension was related to pain catastrophizing, and salience, sensorimotor, and default mode network connectivity. In addition to performing canonical correlation analysis, we evaluated the current clustering of migraine patients into episodic and chronic subtypes, and found no evidence to support this clustering. However, when using RSFC scores from the three significant dimensions, we identified a novel clustering of migraine patients into four biotypes with unique functional connectivity patterns. These findings provide new insight into individual variability in migraine, and could serve as the foundation for novel therapies that take advantage of migraine heterogeneity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Using a large multisite dataset of migraine patients, we identified three dimensions of multivariate association between symptoms and functional connectivity. This analysis revealed neural networks that relate to all measured symptoms, but also to specific symptom ensembles, such as patient propensity to catastrophize painful events. Using these three dimensions, we found four biotypes of migraine informed by clinical and neural variation together. Such findings pave the way for precision medicine therapy for migraine.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neural networks for self-adjusting mutation rate estimation when the recombination rate is unknown</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Klara Elisabeth Burger, Peter Pfaffelhuber, Franz Baumdicker</p>

Estimating the mutation rate, or equivalently effective population size, is a common task in population genetics. If recombination is low or high, optimal linear estimation methods are known and well understood. For intermediate recombination rates, the calculation of optimal estimators is more challenging. As an alternative to model-based estimation, neural networks and other machine learning tools could help to develop good estimators in these involved scenarios. However, if no benchmark is available it is difficult to assess how well suited these tools are for different applications in population genetics.
Here we investigate feedforward neural networks for the estimation of the mutation rate based on the site frequency spectrum and compare their performance with model-based estimators. For this we use the model-based estimators introduced by Fu, Futschik et al., and Watterson that minimize the variance or mean square error for no and free recombination. We find that neural networks reproduce these estimators if provided with the appropriate features and training sets. Remarkably, using the model-based estimators to adjust the weights of the training data, only one hidden layer is necessary to obtain a single estimator that performs almost as well as model-based estimators for low and high recombination rates, and at the same time provides a superior estimation method for intermediate recombination rates. We apply the method to simulated data based on the human chromosome 2 recombination map, highlighting its robustness in a realistic setting where local recombination rates vary and/or are unknown.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Policy for Data Management and Sharing (DMS Policy) recognizes the NIH’s role as a key steward of United States biomedical research and information and seeks to enhance that stewardship through systematic recommendations for the preservation and sharing of research data generated by funded projects. The policy is effective as of January 2023. The recommendations include a requirement for the submission of a Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMSP) with funding applications, and while no strict template was provided, the NIH has released supplemental draft guidance on elements to consider when developing a plan. This article provides 10 key recommendations for creating a DMSP that is both maximally compliant and effective.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Type 2 diabetes disrupts circadian orchestration of lipid metabolism and membrane fluidity in human pancreatic islets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Volodymyr Petrenko, Flore Sinturel, Ursula Loizides-Mangold, Jonathan Paz Montoya, Simona Chera, Howard Riezman, Charna Dibner</p>

Recent evidence suggests that circadian clocks ensure temporal orchestration of lipid homeostasis and play a role in pathophysiology of metabolic diseases in humans, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Nevertheless, circadian regulation of lipid metabolism in human pancreatic islets has not been explored. Employing lipidomic analyses, we conducted temporal profiling in human pancreatic islets derived from 10 nondiabetic (ND) and 6 T2D donors. Among 329 detected lipid species across 8 major lipid classes, 5% exhibited circadian rhythmicity in ND human islets synchronized in vitro. Two-time point-based lipidomic analyses in T2D human islets revealed global and temporal alterations in phospho- and sphingolipids. Key enzymes regulating turnover of sphingolipids were rhythmically expressed in ND islets and exhibited altered levels in ND islets bearing disrupted clocks and in T2D islets. Strikingly, cellular membrane fluidity, measured by a Nile Red derivative NR12S, was reduced in plasma membrane of T2D diabetic human islets, in ND donors’ islets with disrupted circadian clockwork, or treated with sphingolipid pathway modulators. Moreover, inhibiting the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis led to strong reduction of insulin secretion triggered by glucose or KCl, whereas inhibiting earlier steps of de novo ceramide synthesis resulted in milder inhibitory effect on insulin secretion by ND islets. Our data suggest that circadian clocks operative in human pancreatic islets are required for temporal orchestration of lipid homeostasis, and that perturbation of temporal regulation of the islet lipid metabolism upon T2D leads to altered insulin secretion and membrane fluidity. These phenotypes were recapitulated in ND islets bearing disrupted clocks.

                Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. Similarly, they use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the transcription factor overexpression or knockdown on its targets. Therefore, the integration of the binding and expression data can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. Here, we implemented the binding and expression target analysis (BETA) in an R/Bioconductor package. This algorithm ranks the targets based on the distances of their assigned peaks from the transcription factor ChIP experiment and the signed statistics from gene expression profiling with transcription factor perturbation. We further extend BETA to integrate two sets of data from two transcription factors to predict their targets and their combined functions. In this article, we briefly describe the workings of the algorithm and provide a workflow with a real dataset for using it. The gene targets and the aggregate functions of transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells were identified. Using the same datasets, we identified the shared targets of the two transcription factors, which were found to be, on average, more cooperatively regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning shifts the preferred theta phase of gamma oscillations in CA1</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal neuronal oscillations reflect different cognitive processes and can therefore be used to dissect the role of hippocampal subfields in learning and memory. In particular, it has been suggested that encoding and retrieval is associated with slow gamma (25–55 Hz) and fast gamma (60–100 Hz) oscillations, respectively, which appear in a nested manner at specific phases of the ongoing theta oscillations (4–12 Hz). However, the relationship between memory demand and the theta phase of gamma oscillations remains unclear. Here, we assessed the theta phase preference of gamma oscillations in the CA1 region, at the starting and junction zones of a T-maze, while rats were learning an appetitive task. We found that the theta phase preference of slow gamma showed a ~180° phase shift when animals switched from novice to skilled performance during task acquisition. This phase-shift was not present at the junction zone, where animals chose a right or left turn within the T-maze, suggesting that a recall/decision process had already taken place at the starting zone. Our findings indicate that slow gamma oscillations support both encoding and retrieval, depending on the theta phase at which they occur. These properties are particularly evident prior to cognitive engagement in an acquired spatial task.</p>

<p>Midlife vascular risk factors (MVRFs) are associated with incident dementia, as are amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and neurodegeneration. Whether vascular and Alzheimer disease-associated factors contribute to dementia independently or interact synergistically to reduce cognition is poorly understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities–Positron Emission Tomography study were followed from 1987–1989 (45–64 years old) through 2016–2017 (74–94 years old), with repeat cognitive assessment and dementia adjudication. In 2011–2013, dementia-free participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (with white matter hyperintensity [WMH] and brain volume measurement) and florbetapir (Aβ) positron emission tomography. The relative contributions of vascular risk and injury (MVRFs, WMH volume), elevated Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and neurodegeneration (smaller temporoparietal brain regions) to incident dementia were evaluated with adjusted Cox models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 298 individuals, 36 developed dementia (median follow-up = 4.9 years). Midlife hypertension and Aβ each independently predicted dementia risk (hypertension: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–5.67; Aβ SUVR [per standard deviation (SD)]: HR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.72–3.84), but did not interact significantly, whereas late life diabetes (HR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.18–5.28) and Aβ independently predicted dementia risk. WMHs (per SD: HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03–2.20) and Aβ SUVR (HR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.83–3.47) independently contributed to incident dementia, but WMHs lost significance when MVRFs were included. Smaller temporoparietal brain regions were associated with incident dementia, independent of Aβ and MVRFs (HR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.18–4.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Midlife hypertension and late life Aβ are independently associated with dementia risk, without evidence for synergy on a multiplicative scale. Given the independent contributions of vascular and amyloid mechanisms, multiple pathways should be considered when evaluating interventions to reduce the burden of dementia.

                <p>We determined the incidence of post-traumatic epilepsy after severe traumatic brain injury. Of 392 patients surviving to discharge, cumulative incidence of post-traumatic epilepsy was 25% at 5 years and 32% at 15 years, an increase compared with historical reports. Among patients with one late seizure (&gt;7 days post-trauma), the risk of seizure recurrence was 62% after 1 year and 82% at 10 years. Competing hazards regression identified age, decompressive hemicraniectomy, and intracranial infection as independent predictors of post-traumatic epilepsy. Patients with severe traumatic brain injury and a single late post-traumatic seizure will likely require long-term antiseizure medicines. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Network Effects of Brain Lesions Causing Central Post‐Stroke Pain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To test whether lesions causing central post-stroke pain (CPSP) are associated with a specific connectivity profile, whether these connections are associated with metabolic changes, and whether this network aligns with neuromodulation targets for pain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two independent lesion datasets were utilized: 1) subcortical lesions from published case reports and, 2) thalamic lesions with metabolic imaging using 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT. Functional connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was assessed using a normative connectome (n = 1000) and connections specific to CPSP were identified. Metabolic changes specific to CPSP were also identified and related to differences in lesion connectivity. Therapeutic relevance of the network was explored by testing for alignment with existing brain stimulation data and by prospectively targeting the network with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 7 patients with CPSP.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Lesion locations causing CPSP showed a specific pattern of brain connectivity that was consistent across two independent lesion datasets (spatial r = 0.82, p &lt; 0.0001). Connectivity differences were correlated with post-lesion metabolism (r = -0.48, p &lt; 0.001). The topography of this lesion-based pain network aligned with variability in pain improvement across 12 prior neuromodulation targets and across 32 patients who received rTMS to primary motor cortex (p &lt; 0.05). Prospectively targeting this network with rTMS improved CPSP in 6/7 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lesions causing pain are connected to a specific brain network that shows metabolic abnormalities and promise as a neuromodulation target.</p>

                NLRP3 is a central driver of neurodegeneration thought to function mainly in microglia. In this issue of Neuron, Panicker et al. (2022) find that NLRP3 is a parkin substrate that contributes significantly to Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis by acting in neurons.
