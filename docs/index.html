              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23310">Moral Agency in Silico: Exploring Free Will in Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.23310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of deterministic systems, specifically large language models (LLMs), to exhibit the functional capacities of moral agency and compatibilist free will. We develop a functional definition of free will grounded in Dennett's compatibilist framework, building on an interdisciplinary theoretical foundation that integrates Shannon's information theory, Dennett's compatibilism, and Floridi's philosophy of information. This framework emphasizes the importance of reason-responsiveness and value alignment in determining moral responsibility rather than requiring metaphysical libertarian free will. Shannon's theory highlights the role of processing complex information in enabling adaptive decision-making, while Floridi's philosophy reconciles these perspectives by conceptualizing agency as a spectrum, allowing for a graduated view of moral status based on a system's complexity and responsiveness. Our analysis of LLMs' decision-making in moral dilemmas demonstrates their capacity for rational deliberation and their ability to adjust choices in response to new information and identified inconsistencies. Thus, they exhibit features of a moral agency that align with our functional definition of free will. These results challenge traditional views on the necessity of consciousness for moral responsibility, suggesting that systems with self-referential reasoning capacities can instantiate degrees of free will and moral reasoning in artificial and biological contexts. This study proposes a parsimonious framework for understanding free will as a spectrum that spans artificial and biological systems, laying the groundwork for further interdisciplinary research on agency and ethics in the artificial intelligence era.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23313">Choice confidence bridges credit assignment to levels of decision hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.23313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everyday decisions often involve many different levels. What connects these higher and lower level decisions hierarchy to one another determines how the cause(s) of failures are interpreted. It is hypothesized that decision confidence guides the assignment of blame to the correct level of hierarchy but this hypothesis has only been tested by manipulation of sensory evidence itself. We examined the consequences of modulating subjective confidence in hierarchical decision making via extra-sensory, social influence. Participants who made hierarchical, motion-plus-bandit decisions also received social information from a partner that advised the participant in the motion task. The strength of social advice -- independently from sensory signals -- modulated the likelihood of strategy change after negative feedback. Our findings therefore provide strong empirical evidence that subjective confidence per se acts as the bridge in assignment of credit and blame to various levels of decision hierarchy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23429">Bayesian Approaches for Revealing Complex Neural Network Dynamics in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.23429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) belongs to the class of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the central nervous system. It is usually defined as the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which causes both motor and non-motor symptoms. Understanding the neuronal processes that underlie PD is critical for creating successful therapies. This study combines machine learning (ML), stochastic modelling, and Bayesian inference with connectomic data to analyze the brain networks involved in PD. We use modern computational methods to study large-scale neural networks to identify neuronal activity patterns related to PD development. We aim to define the subtle structural and functional connection changes in PD brains by combining connectomic with stochastic noises. Stochastic modelling approaches reflect brain dynamics' intrinsic variability and unpredictability, shedding light on the origin and spread of pathogenic events in PD. We employ a novel hybrid model to assess how stochastic noise impacts the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus (CBGTH) network, using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Bayesian inference allows us to quantify uncertainty in model parameters, improving the accuracy of our predictions. Our findings reveal that stochastic disturbances increase thalamus activity, even under deep brain stimulation (DBS). Bayesian analysis suggests that reducing these disturbances could enhance healthy brain states, providing insights for potential therapeutic interventions. This approach offers a deeper understanding of PD dynamics and paves the way for personalized treatment strategies. This is an extended version of our work presented at the ICCS-2024 conference.

                arXiv:2410.23445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is essential to understand the complex structure of the human brain to develop new treatment approaches for neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). This review paper comprehensively discusses the challenges associated with modelling the complex brain networks and dynamic processes involved in NDDs, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cortical spreading depression (CSD). We investigate how the brain's biological processes and associated multiphysics interact and how this influences the structure and functionality of the brain. We review the literature on brain network models and dynamic processes, highlighting the need for sophisticated mathematical and statistical modelling techniques. Specifically, we go through large-scale brain network models relevant to AD and PD, highlighting the pathological mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies investigated in the literature. Additionally, we investigate the propagation of CSD in the brain and its implications for neurological disorders. Furthermore, we discuss how data-driven approaches and artificial neural networks refine and validate models related to NDDs. Overall, this review underscores the significance of coupled multiscale models in deciphering disease mechanisms, offering potential avenues for therapeutic development and advancing our understanding of pathological brain dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23476">Spatio-temporal activity patterns induced by triadic interactions in an in silico neural medium</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.23476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are general mechanisms by which a node or neuron can regulate directly the link or synapse between other two neurons. The regulation takes place in a familiar way by either depressing or facilitating synaptic transmission. Such interactions are ubiquitous in neural systems, accounting for axo-axonic synapses and tripartite synapses mediated by astrocytes, for instance, and have been related to neuronal and synaptic processes at different time-scales, including short and long-term synaptic plasticity. In the field of network science, triadic interactions have been shown to produce complex spatio-temporal patterns of connectivity. Here, we investigate the emergent behavior of an in silico neural medium constituted by a population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with triadic interactions. We observe that, depending on relevant parameters defining triadic interactions, different activity patterns emerge. These include i) a silent phase, ii) a low-activity phase in which complex spatio-temporal patterns of low neuronal firing rate emerge that propagate through the medium, iii) a high-activity phase characterized by complex spatio-temporal patterns of high neuronal firing rate that propagate through the neural medium as waves of high firing activity over a bulk of low activity neurons, and iv) a pseudo-blinking phase in which the neural medium switches between high and low activity states, in a similar fashion to up/down state transitions. Here we analyse in depth the features of such patterns and relate our findings to the recently proposed model of triadic percolation.

Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural systems operate near a phase transition, optimising the transmission, storage, and processing of information. While scale invariance and non-Gaussian dynamics - hallmarks of criticality - have been observed in brain activity, a direct link between criticality and behavioural performance remains unexplored. Here, we use a phenomenological renormalisation group (PRG) approach to examine neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of mice performing a visual recognition task. We show that non-trivial scaling in neuronal activity is associated with enhanced task performance, with pronounced scaling observed during successful task completion. When rewards were removed or non-natural stimuli presented, these scaling signatures diminished. These results suggest that critical dynamics in the brain may be crucial for optimising behavioural outcomes, offering new insights into the functional role of criticality in cortical processing.

Abstract: This study aims to review recent research on the collective behaviour of excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) spiking neural networks. The research methodology used is Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) procedures, comprising three primary stages: an initial search for literature in the SCOPUS database, a screening process based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a review of the selected literatures. Out of 491 documents from 2014 to 2024, 6 research papers are qualified for review. Four distinct dynamical states have been identified: synchrony, irregular behaviour, stationary state, and oscillatory dynamics. Our review findings suggest that the collective dynamics of E-I spiking neurons stem from the interaction of intrinsic neuronal characteristics, balance mechanisms, and the type of external stimuli. Additionally, the widespread use of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons in the literature highlights its significance as a robust candidate for exploring collective behaviours in large-scale neuronal networks.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between cognition and intrinsic brain activity through purely data-driven approaches remains a significant challenge in neuroscience. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers a non-invasive method to monitor regional neural activity, providing a rich and complex spatiotemporal data structure. Deep learning has shown promise in capturing these intricate representations. However, the limited availability of large datasets, especially for disease-specific groups such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), constrains the generalizability of deep learning models. In this study, we focus on multivariate time series forecasting of independent component networks derived from rs-fMRI as a form of data augmentation, using both a conventional LSTM-based model and the novel Transformer-based BrainLM model. We assess their utility in AD classification, demonstrating how generative forecasting enhances classification performance. Post-hoc interpretation of BrainLM reveals class-specific brain network sensitivities associated with AD.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in visual decoding with fMRI data, its high cost and low temporal resolution limit widespread applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce RealMind, a novel EEG-based visual decoding framework that leverages multi-modal models to efficiently interpret semantic information. By integrating semantic and geometric consistency learning, RealMind enhances feature alignment, leading to improved decoding performance. Our framework achieves a 56.73\% Top-5 accuracy in a 200-way retrieval task and a 26.59\% BLEU-1 score in a 200-way visual captioning task, representing the first successful attempt at zero-shot visual captioning using EEG data. RealMind provides a robust, adaptable, and cost-effective alternative to fMRI-based methods, offering scalable solutions for EEG-based visual decoding in practical applications.

                arXiv:2309.15174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they may not necessarily be indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.

                arXiv:2409.18946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.

                arXiv:2410.19542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles.

                arXiv:2410.24070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems are increasingly popular tools in neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Measures comparing neural activations across conditions, architectures, and species give scalable ways to understand information transformation within different neural networks. However, recent findings show that some metrics respond to spurious signals, leading to misleading results. Establishing benchmark test cases is thus essential for identifying the most reliable metric and potential improvements. We propose that compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can provide a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. Implementing this case allows us to evaluate if metrics can identify representations that develop throughout learning and determine if representations identified by metrics reflect the network's actual computations. Building both attractor and RNN based test cases, we show that the recently proposed Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and reliably identifies behaviorally relevant representations compared to prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also demonstrate how such test cases can extend beyond metric evaluation to study new architectures. Specifically, testing DSA in modern (Mamba) state space models suggests that these models, unlike RNNs, may not require changes in recurrent dynamics due to their expressive hidden states. Overall, we develop test cases that showcase how DSA's enhanced ability to detect dynamical motifs makes it highly effective for identifying ongoing computations in RNNs and revealing how networks learn tasks.

                arXiv:2410.23302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Industry 5.0 has introduced new demands for manufacturing companies, requiring a shift in how production schedules are managed to address human centered, environmental, and economic goals comprehensively. The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP), which involves processing operations on various capable machines, accurately reflects the complexities of modern manufacturing settings. This paper investigates the FJSSP involving reconfigurable machine tools with configuration dependent setup times, while integrating human aspects like worker assignments, moving time, and rest periods, as well as minimizing total energy consumption. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to simultaneously optimize these objectives. The model determines the assignment of operations to machines, workers, and configurations while sequencing operations, scheduling worker movements, and respecting rest periods, and minimizing overall energy consumption. Given the NPhard nature of the FJSSP with worker assignments and reconfigurable tools, a memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed. This metaheuristic evolutionary algorithm features a three layer chromosome encoding method, specialized crossover and mutation strategies, and neighborhood search mechanisms to enhance solution quality and diversity. Comparisons of MA with MIP and genetic algorithms (GA) on benchmark instances demonstrate the MA efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for larger problem instances where MIP becomes impractical. This research paves the way for sustainable and resilient production schedules tailored for the factory of the future under the Industry 5.0 paradigm. The work bridges a crucial gap in current literature by integrating worker and environmental impact into the FJSSP with reconfigurable machine models.

                arXiv:2410.23619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their biologically inspired, event-driven nature, making them highly suitable for neuromorphic hardware. Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) coding, where neurons fire only once during inference, offers the benefits of reduced spike counts, enhanced energy efficiency, and faster processing. However, SNNs employing TTFS coding often suffer from diminished classification accuracy. This paper presents an efficient training framework for TTFS that not only improves accuracy but also accelerates the training process. Unlike most previous approaches, we first identify two key issues limiting the performance of TTFS neurons: information disminishing and imbalanced membrane potential distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel initialization strategy. Additionally, we introduce a temporal weighting decoding method that aggregates temporal outputs through a weighted sum, supporting BPTT. Moreover, we re-evaluate the pooling layer in TTFS neurons and find that average pooling is better suited than max-pooling for this coding scheme. Our experimental results show that the proposed training framework leads to more stable training and significant performance improvements, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on both the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24081">An Efficient Dynamic Resource Allocation Framework for Evolutionary Bilevel Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.24081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization problems are characterized by an interactive hierarchical structure, where the upper level seeks to optimize its strategy while simultaneously considering the response of the lower level. Evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practical scenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to the nested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition. This challenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase. Although recent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledge sharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundant lower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generating unpromising solutions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bilevel optimization, named DRC-BLEA. Compared to existing approaches, DRC-BLEA introduces a novel competitive quasi-parallel paradigm, in which multiple lower-level optimization tasks, derived from different upper-level individuals, compete for resources. A continuously updated selection probability is used to prioritize execution opportunities to promising tasks. Additionally, a cooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to further enhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence. Experimental results compared with chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, DRC-BLEA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse problem sets and real-world scenarios, while significantly reducing the number of function evaluations and overall running time.

Through simulations, we demonstrate that our model may work in a hybrid training scheme utilizing gradient descent as a learning algorithm. This work represents another step in the direction of evaluation of the use of artificial neural networks efficiently implemented on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: XyloAudio is a line of ultra-low-power audio inference chips, designed for in- and near-microphone analysis of audio in real-time energy-constrained scenarios. Xylo is designed around a highly efficient integer-logic processor which simulates parameter- and activity-sparse spiking neural networks (SNNs) using a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. Neurons on Xylo are quantised integer devices operating in synchronous digital CMOS, with neuron and synapse state quantised to 16 bit, and weight parameters quantised to 8 bit. Xylo is tailored for real-time streaming operation, as opposed to accelerated-time operation in the case of an inference accelerator. XyloAudio includes a low-power audio encoding interface for direct connection to a microphone, designed for sparse encoding of incident audio for further processing by the inference core. In this report we present the results of DCASE 2020 acoustic scene classification audio benchmark dataset deployed to XyloAudio 2. We describe the benchmark dataset; the audio preprocessing approach; and the network architecture and training approach. We present the performance of the trained model, and the results of power and latency measurements performed on the XyloAudio 2 development kit. This benchmark is conducted as part of the Neurobench project.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09688">A Theory of Synaptic Neural Balance: From Local to Global Order</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.09688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of synaptic neural balance and how it can emerge or be enforced in neural networks. For a given regularizer, a neuron is said to be in balance if the total cost of its input weights is equal to the total cost of its output weights. The basic example is provided by feedforward networks of ReLU units trained with $L_2$ regularizers, which exhibit balance after proper training. The theory explains this phenomenon and extends it in several directions. The first direction is the extension to bilinear and other activation functions. The second direction is the extension to more general regularizers, including all $L_p$ regularizers. The third direction is the extension to non-layered architectures, recurrent architectures, convolutional architectures, as well as architectures with mixed activation functions. Gradient descent on the error function alone does not converge in general to a balanced state, where every neuron is in balance, even when starting from a balanced state. However, gradient descent on the regularized error function ought to converge to a balanced state, and thus network balance can be used to assess learning progress. The theory is based on two local neuronal operations: scaling which is commutative, and balancing which is not commutative. Given any initial set of weights, when local balancing operations are applied to each neuron in a stochastic manner, global order always emerges through the convergence of the stochastic balancing algorithm to the same unique set of balanced weights. The reason for this is the existence of an underlying strictly convex optimization problem where the relevant variables are constrained to a linear, only architecture-dependent, manifold. Simulations show that balancing neurons prior to learning, or during learning in alternation with gradient descent steps, can improve learning speed and final performance.

                arXiv:2402.01607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is pivotal in human cognition and especially important for providing explanations and making decisions. While Judea Pearl's influential approach is theoretically elegant, its generation of a counterfactual scenario often requires too much deviation from the observed scenarios to be feasible, as we show using simple examples. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a framework of \emph{natural counterfactuals} and a method for generating counterfactuals that are more feasible with respect to the actual data distribution. Our methodology incorporates a certain amount of backtracking when needed, allowing changes in causally preceding variables to minimize deviations from realistic scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization framework that permits but also controls the extent of backtracking with a naturalness criterion. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/GuangyuanHao/natural_counterfactuals.

                arXiv:2409.16408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14067">Provable Benefits of Complex Parameterizations for Structured State Space Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance.

                Background This study examined the effect of thermocycling on the flexural strength properties of four CAD/CAM ceramic materials at different thicknesses. Methods Four CAD/CAM ceramics of different types: advanced lithium disilicate (ALD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) lithium disilicate (LD), and leucite reinforced (LE), and at three varying thicknesses 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were examined. After subjecting all specimens to 5000 thermomechanical cycles, flexural strength was determined using a universal testing apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for analysis. Two factorial ANOVA models assessed the association of different factors (ceramic type and thickness) with flexural strength and elastic modulus. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted means were computed. A p-value < 0.05 was designated significant. Results ZLS exhibited the highest flexural strength at 1.5 mm thickness, while LD showed the highest Young’s modulus of elasticity. The lowest flexural strength was observed in the 0.5 mm thickness group. There were notable variations in flexural strength across all ceramic materials, with the highest adjusted mean strength in the ZLS group, ALD, LD, and LE, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were noted in ceramic thickness, with 1.5 mm thickness showing the highest strength and 0.5 mm thickness the lowest. Conclusions Ceramic material thickness significantly impacts flexural strength, with 1.5 mm thickness deemed suitable for posterior restorations. Ceramic materials with zirconia fillers or matrix demonstrated higher flexural strength than other ceramics.

                Background Different usage scenarios and design guidelines were considered when planning a factory building and its ventilation system. Accordingly, it often makes sense to analyze the actual operating conditions again during subsequent operations in order to optimally adapt the air supply to the respective conditions in terms of demand-responsive ventilation. The aim is to ensure good indoor air quality and thermal comfort while significantly reducing energy consumption. Methods For this purpose, in addition to the sensors in the building management system, approximately 120 wireless sensors were installed in the occupied areas to measure the air temperature, operating temperature, humidity, and CO2. In this way the spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, humidity, and CO2 in the hall were visualized and evaluated to reduce the volume flows of the ventilation systems. The recorded data and findings were used to optimize ventilation systems by gaining a deeper understanding of indoor air flow. Results As part of the investigation, a considerable reduction in the air volume flows and thus the required energy consumption of the air handling units was achieved while maintaining the same thermal comfort. It was shown that the temperature field and indoor air quality were not negatively affected by the change in the air volume flow over a wide range. Conclusions This was made possible by the well-designed ventilation system, which achieves a low-pulse, slightly stratified indoor airflow, and a structural envelope with very good thermal insulation.

                Background Global environmental degradation is increasingly driving poor health outcomes worldwide. Healthcare systems and services are often not environmentally sustainable and compound the problem, while healthcare professionals are also recognised as key leaders in advancing sustainable healthcare. To adopt this leadership position, healthcare professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding environmental sustainability in healthcare must be established. This article reports the development and validation of a new instrument for this purpose that corresponds to the specificities of the Southern African context. Methods Questionnaire development followed a seven-stage process. Information was obtained from a 2021 study titled ‘South African Healthcare Professionals’ Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare: A Mixed-Methods Study’ to develop the instrument. Information was also sourced from the literature regarding environmental sustainability and healthcare to generate the first questionnaire with 29 items. The following stages included two rounds of expert input, separated by a pilot study with the target population to receive feedback regarding the instrument’s structure, relevance, and length. Content validity was determined through statistical analysis. Results Feedback was received from nine experts in stage two and 13 pilot-study participants in stage four and incorporated to improve the questionnaire. In stage six, the questionnaire was rated by seven experts. The content validity index of the questionnaire was calculated at two different stages, after which the indices were compared. Following a final edit, the questionnaire has 24 questionnaire items. The closing analysis calculated the scale content validity index average (S-CVI/Ave) of 0,922; this indicates that the final questionnaire has excellent content validity. Conclusion A questionnaire that assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals regarding environmental sustainability in Southern Africa has been developed and validated. This questionnaire can now be used for further studies in Southern Africa.

                Background Concerns regarding academic efficiency at the postgraduate level in university programs require attention from those responsible for making university administrative decisions. This study aimed to determine the terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students enrolled in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years. Methods This cross-sectional study considered all records of documents submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty in the programs offered by a dental school, published in its institutional repository between 2017 and 2023. The study variable was terminal efficiency (TE), considered both as a quantitative and qualitative variable. Additionally, some covariates were included, such as the year of formal document submission, the mode of document preparation, the second professional specialty in dentistry, and sex. Descriptive analysis was conducted to obtain absolute and relative frequencies. Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results From the evaluation of TE between 2017 and 2023, it was observed that 72.09% (n=186) of students with a document submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty and published in the repository had a TE categorized of “Up to 1 year”. Likewise, the mean TE was 0.95 years (SD=1.25), with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) between medians when evaluated based on the year of formal document submission and the dental specialty program. Conclusion The mean terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years was 0.95 years.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, beautiful and incredible patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. GNU Octave (version 9, (1)) software was applied to verify the existence, classify, and conduct computational investigations of findings prior to formal proofs. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these fascinating numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers also give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties. Furthermore, these findings play a vital role in the boarder context of mathematical sequences, contributing significantly to the field.

Wild populations are increasingly threatened by human-mediated climate change and land use changes. As populations decline, the probability of inbreeding increases, along with the potential for negative effects on individual fitness. Detecting and characterizing runs of homozygosity (ROHs) is a popular strategy for assessing the extent of individual inbreeding present in a population and can also shed light on the genetic mechanisms contributing to inbreeding depression. Here, we analyze simulated and empirical datasets to demonstrate the downstream effects of program selection and long-term demographic history on ROH inference, leading to context-dependent biases in the results. Through a sensitivity analysis we evaluate how various parameter values impact on ROH-calling results, highlighting its utility as a tool for parameter exploration. Our results indicate that ROH inferences are sensitive to factors such as sequencing depth and ROH length distribution, and with bias direction and magnitude varying with demographic history and the programs used. Estimation biases are particularly pronounced at lower sequencing depths, potentially leading to either underestimation or overestimation of inbreeding. These results are particularly important for the management of endangered species, as underestimating inbreeding signals in the genome can substantially undermine conservation initiatives. We also found that small true ROHs can be incorrectly lumped together and called as longer ROHs, leading to erroneous inference of recent inbreeding. To address these challenges, we suggest using a combination of ROH detection tools and ROH length-specific inferences, along with sensitivity analysis, to generate robust and context-appropriate population inferences regarding inbreeding history. We outline these recommendations for ROH estimation at multiple levels of sequencing effort, which are typical of conservation genomics studies.

                <p>by Lingxia Qiao, Michael Getz, Ben Gross, Brian Tenner, Jin Zhang, Padmini Rangamani</p>

The nanoscale organization of enzymes associated with the dynamics of second messengers is critical for ensuring compartmentation and localization of signaling molecules in cells. Specifically, the spatiotemporal orchestration of cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations is critical for many cellular functions. Previous experimental studies have shown that the formation of nanodomains of A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP150) and adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) on the surface of pancreatic MIN6 β cells modulates the phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP oscillations from out-of-phase to in-phase. In this work, we develop computational models of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP pathway and AKAP/AC nanodomain formation that give rise to the two important predictions: instead of an arbitrary phase difference, the out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation reaches Ca<sup>2+</sup> trough and cAMP peak simultaneously, which is defined as inversely out-of-phase; the in-phase and inversely out-of-phase oscillations associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP dynamics on and away from the nanodomains can be explained by an incoherent feedforward loop. Factors such as cellular surface-to-volume ratio, compartment size, and distance between nanodomains do not affect the existence of in-phase or inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation, but cellular surface-to-volume ratio and compartment size can affect the time delay for the inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation while the distance between two nanodomains does not. Finally, we predict that both the Turing pattern-generated nanodomains and experimentally measured nanodomains demonstrate the existence of in-phase and inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation when the AC8 is at a low level, consistent with the behavior of an incoherent feedforward loop. These findings unveil the key circuit motif that governs cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and advance our understanding of how nanodomains can lead to spatial compartmentation of second messengers.

                <p>by Emmanouil Giannakakis, Oleg Vinogradov, Victor Buendía, Anna Levina</p>

Cortical neurons are versatile and efficient coding units that develop strong preferences for specific stimulus characteristics. The sharpness of tuning and coding efficiency is hypothesized to be controlled by delicately balanced excitation and inhibition. These observations suggest a need for detailed co-tuning of excitatory and inhibitory populations. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that a combination of plasticity rules can lead to the emergence of excitation/inhibition (E/I) co-tuning in neurons driven by independent, low-noise signals. However, cortical signals are typically noisy and originate from highly recurrent networks, generating correlations in the inputs. This raises questions about the ability of plasticity mechanisms to self-organize co-tuned connectivity in neurons receiving noisy, correlated inputs. Here, we study the emergence of input selectivity and weight co-tuning in a neuron receiving input from a recurrent network via plastic feedforward connections. We demonstrate that while strong noise levels destroy the emergence of co-tuning in the readout neuron, introducing specific structures in the non-plastic pre-synaptic connectivity can re-establish it by generating a favourable correlation structure in the population activity. We further show that structured recurrent connectivity can impact the statistics in fully plastic recurrent networks, driving the formation of co-tuning in neurons that do not receive direct input from other areas. Our findings indicate that the network dynamics created by simple, biologically plausible structural connectivity patterns can enhance the ability of synaptic plasticity to learn input-output relationships in higher brain areas.

                <p>by Lani Fox, William C. Miller, Dionne Gesink, Irene Doherty, Marc Serre</p>

In 2008–2011 Forsyth County, North Carolina experienced a four-fold increase in syphilis rising to over 35 cases per 100,000 mirroring the 2021 state syphilis rate. Our methodology extends current models with: 1) donut geomasking to enhance resolution while protecting patient privacy; 2) a moving window uniform grid to control the modifiable area unit problem, edge effect and remove kriging islands; and 3) mitigating the “small number problem” with Uniform Model Bayesian Maximum Entropy. Data is 2008–2011 early syphilis cases reported to the NC Department of Health and Human Services for Forsyth County. Results were assessed using latent rate theory cross validation. We show combining a moving window and a UMBME analysis with geomasked data effectively predicted the true or latent syphilis rate 5% to 26% more accurate than the traditional, geopolitical boundary method. It removed kriging islands, reduced background incidence rate to 0, relocated nine outbreak hotspots to more realistic locations, and elucidated hotspot connectivity producing more realistic geographical patterns for targeted insights. Using the Forsyth outbreak as a case study showed how the outbreak emerged from endemic areas spreading through sexual core transmitters and contextualizing the outbreak to current and past outbreaks. As the dynamics of sexually transmitted infections spread have changed to online partnership selection and demographically to include more women, partnership selection continues to remain highly localized. Furthermore, it is important to present methods to increase interpretability and accuracy of visual representations of data.

                <p>by Francesco Poli, Maran Koolen, Carlos A. Velázquez-Vargas, Jessica Ramos-Sanchez, Marlene Meyer, Rogier B. Mars, Nanda Rommelse, Sabine Hunnius</p>

Curiosity-driven exploration involves actively engaging with the environment to learn from it. Here, we hypothesize that the cognitive mechanisms underlying exploratory behavior may differ across individuals depending on personal characteristics such as autistic traits. In turn, this variability might influence successful exploration. To investigate this, we collected self- and other-reports of autistic traits from university students, and tested them in an exploration task in which participants could learn the hiding patterns of multiple characters. Participants’ prediction errors and learning progress (i.e., the decrease in prediction error) on the task were tracked with a hierarchical delta-rule model. Crucially, participants could freely decide when to disengage from a character and what to explore next. We examined whether autistic traits modulated the relation of prediction errors and learning progress with exploration. We found that participants with lower scores on other-reports of insistence-on-sameness and general autistic traits were less persistent, primarily relying on learning progress during the initial stages of exploration. Conversely, participants with higher scores were more persistent and relied on learning progress in later phases of exploration, resulting in better performance in the task. This research advances our understanding of the interplay between autistic traits and exploration drives, emphasizing the importance of individual traits in learning processes and highlighting the need for personalized learning approaches.

                <p>by Malin Ramne, Jon Sensinger</p>

Pain perception is influenced not only by sensory input from afferent neurons but also by cognitive factors such as prior expectations. It has been suggested that overly precise priors may be a key contributing factor to chronic pain states such as neuropathic pain. However, it remains an open question how overly precise priors in favor of pain might arise. Here, we first verify that a Bayesian approach can describe how statistical integration of prior expectations and sensory input results in pain phenomena such as placebo hypoalgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, chronic pain, and spontaneous neuropathic pain. Our results indicate that the value of the prior, which is determined by the internal model parameters, may be a key contributor to these phenomena. Next, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian approach to update the parameters of the internal model based on the difference between the predicted and the perceived pain, to reflect that people integrate prior experiences in their future expectations. In contrast with simpler approaches, this hierarchical model structure is able to show for placebo hypoalgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia how these phenomena can arise from prior experiences in the form of a classical conditioning procedure. We also demonstrate the phenomenon of offset analgesia, in which a disproportionally large pain decrease is obtained following a minor reduction in noxious stimulus intensity. Finally, we turn to simulations of neuropathic pain, where our hierarchical model corroborates that persistent non-neuropathic pain is a risk factor for developing neuropathic pain following denervation, and additionally offers an interesting prediction that complete absence of informative painful experiences could be a similar risk factor. Taken together, these results provide insight to how prior experiences may contribute to pain perception, in both experimental and neuropathic pain, which in turn might be informative for improving strategies of pain prevention and relief.

                <p>by Tamjid A. Chowdhury, David A. Luy, Garrett Scapellato, Dorian Farache, Amy S. Y. Lee, Christopher C. Quinn</p>

Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be a key component of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that protect against mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment. Here, we address this question through the investigation of <i>rbm-26</i>, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ortholog of the <i>RBM27</i> autism candidate gene, which encodes an RNA-binding protein whose role in neurons is unknown. We report that RBM-26 (RBM26/27) protects against axonal defects by negatively regulating expression of the MALS-1 (MALSU1) mitoribosomal assembly factor. Autism-associated missense variants in RBM-26 cause a sharp decrease in RBM-26 protein expression along with defects in axon overlap and axon degeneration that occurs during larval development. Using a biochemical screen, we identified the mRNA for the MALS-1 mitoribosomal assembly factor as a binding partner for RBM-26. Loss of RBM-26 function causes a dramatic overexpression of <i>mals-1</i> mRNA and MALS-1 protein. Moreover, genetic analysis indicates that this overexpression of MALS-1 is responsible for the mitochondrial and axon degeneration defects in <i>rbm-26</i> mutants. These observations reveal a mechanism that regulates expression of a mitoribosomal assembly factor to protect against axon degeneration during neurodevelopment.

                <p>by F. Chris Bennett, Mariko L. Bennett</p>

Clearance of dying neurons by microglia is critical to healthy neurodevelopment, but what else do microglia eat? A new study in PLOS Biology demonstrates that microglia not only eat neurons but each other, and that this “microglia cannibalism” causes necroptotic cell death.

During brain development, neurons are selectively cleared by microglia to sculpt neural circuits. This primer discusses a recent study in PLOS Biology showing that microglia also clear away debris from other microglia, which is followed by microglial necroptosis.

The spinal cord is of fundamental importance for integrative processing in brain–body communication, yet routine noninvasive recordings in humans are hindered by vast methodological challenges. Here, we overcome these challenges by developing an easy-to-use electrophysiological approach based on high-density multichannel spinal recordings combined with multivariate spatial-filtering analyses. These advances enable a spatiotemporal characterization of spinal cord responses and demonstrate a sensitivity that permits assessing even single-trial responses. To furthermore enable the study of integrative processing along the neural processing hierarchy in somatosensation, we expand this approach by simultaneous peripheral, spinal, and cortical recordings and provide direct evidence that bottom-up integrative processing occurs already within the spinal cord and thus after the first synaptic relay in the central nervous system. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by providing noninvasive recordings of nociceptive spinal cord responses during heat-pain stimulation. Beyond establishing a new window on human spinal cord function at millisecond timescale, this work provides the foundation to study brain–body communication in its entirety in health and disease.

Aberrant aggregation of α-Synuclein is the pathological hallmark of a set of neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have led to the structural determination of the first synucleinopathy-derived α-Synuclein fibrils, which contain a non-proteinaceous, “mystery density” at the core of the protofilaments, hypothesized to be highly negatively charged. Guided by previous studies that demonstrated that polyphosphate (polyP), a universally conserved polyanion, significantly accelerates α-Synuclein fibril formation, we conducted blind docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments to model the polyP binding site in α-Synuclein fibrils. Here, we demonstrate that our models uniformly place polyP into the lysine-rich pocket, which coordinates the mystery density in patient-derived fibrils. Subsequent in vitro studies and experiments in cells revealed that substitution of the 2 critical lysine residues K43 and K45 with alanine residues leads to a loss of all previously reported effects of polyP binding on α-Synuclein, including stimulation of fibril formation, change in filament conformation and stability as well as alleviation of cytotoxicity. In summary, our study demonstrates that polyP fits the unknown electron density present in in vivo α-Synuclein fibrils and suggests that polyP exerts its functions by neutralizing charge repulsion between neighboring lysine residues.

                Reproducibility is a basis of scientific integrity, yet it remains a significant challenge across disciplines in computational science. This reproducibility crisis is now being met with an Open Science movement, which has risen to prominence within the scientific community and academic libraries especially. To address the need for reproducible computational research and promote Open Science within the community, members of the Open Science and Data Collaborations Program at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries organized a single-day hackathon centered around reproducibility. Partnering with a faculty researcher in English and Digital Humanities, this event allowed several students an opportunity to interact with real research outputs, test the reproducibility of data analyses with code, and offer feedback for improvements. With Python code and data shared by the researcher in an open repository, we revealed that students could successfully reproduce most of the data visualizations, but they required completing some manual setup and modifications to address depreciated libraries to successfully rerun the code. During the event, we also investigated the option of using ChatGPT to debug and troubleshoot rerunning this code. By interacting with a ChatGPT API in the code, we found and addressed the same roadblocks and successfully reproduced the same figures as the participating students. Assessing a second option, we also collaborated with the researcher to publish a compute capsule in Code Ocean. This option presented an alternative to manual setup and modifications, an accessible option for more limited devices like tablets, and a simple solution for outside researchers to modify or build on existing research code.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1304/v1?src=rss">Rethinking Food and Nutrition Security: Why Income Alone Isn’t Enough in Coffee-Producing Areas of Ethiopia. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Coffee-growing communities in Yayu, Southwestern Ethiopia, are perceived to be food secure due to income from coffee production. However, while income ensures caloric sufficiency, it does not necessarily translate into complete food security, especially in terms of nutrient intake. Our study assessed the food and nutrition security of smallholder farm households in Yayu, with a particular focus on dietary diversity and hidden hunger. We found significant gaps in nutritional intake, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and children under five. Policy and Implications Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) targets food-insecure areas based on economic status, assuming that income ensures food security. However, our findings suggest that this approach may be flawed, as households in coffee-growing regions are often labeled food secure despite significant deficiencies in essential nutrients such as heme iron. This calls for a re-evaluation of food security policies in cash-crop-dominated areas to address not only income but also access to diverse and nutrient-rich foods. Recommendations 1. Enhance Nutritional Education: Implement targeted educational programs focusing on the importance of dietary diversity, particularly in coffee-producing areas. 2. Diversify Agriculture: Encourage smallholder farmers to diversify crops, integrating nutrient-dense foods alongside coffee cultivation. 3. Improve Market Access: Strengthen local markets to ensure that nutrient-rich foods are available and affordable during both surplus and shortage seasons. 4. Revise PSNP Criteria: Use localized food and nutrition data rather than income alone to identify food insecurity in cash-crop regions. Conclusion Income from coffee production in Yayu improves caloric sufficiency but does not guarantee nutritional adequacy. To combat hidden hunger, policies must move beyond income-based indicators of food security and prioritize access to diverse, nutrient-rich foods. This will ensure a more comprehensive approach to food and nutrition security in Ethiopia’s coffee-growing regions.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes. These results further support adaptation of systems of care to accommodate the expansion of thrombectomy eligibility to patients with large cores and maximize EVT benefits.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses high mortality and morbidity rates with limited evidence-based therapeutic approaches. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the management of ICH.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This systematic review and meta-analysis followed recommended guidelines and protocols. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to April 12, 2024. The inclusion was restricted to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of high quality, ensuring they were not deemed to have a high risk of bias in any of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) domains. Primary outcomes were good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0–3) and mortality beyond 90 days. Secondary outcomes were early mortality within 30 days and rebleeding rates. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fourteen high-quality RCTs were included. There were 3,027 patients with ICH (1,475 randomized to MIS, and 1,452 randomized to medical management or craniotomy). Of included patients, 1,899 (62.7%) were males. MIS resulted in higher odds of achieving long-term good functional outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.25–1.82]), lower odds of long-term mortality (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90]) and lower odds of early mortality (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.95]). Rebleeding rates were similar (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.55–2.19]). The treatment effect of MIS was consistent across multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including individuals with deep ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This meta-analysis provides high-quality clinical trial evidence supporting the use of MIS as a primary treatment strategy in the management of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background During pregnancy, the placenta is an extremely important organ as it secretes its own hormones, e.g. insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), to ensure proper intrauterine fetal growth and development. Ethanol, an addictive and widely used drug, has numerous adverse effects during pregnancy, including fetal growth restriction (FGR). To date, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol triggers its toxic effects during pregnancy, particularly in the placenta, are not entirely known. For this reason, a murine model of partial IGF-1 deficiency was used to determine ethanol alterations in placental morphology and aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase (AAH) expression. Methods Wild type (WT, Igf1 +/+) and heterozygous (HZ, Igf1 +/-) female mice were given 10% ethanol in water during 14 days as an acclimation period and throughout pregnancy. WT and HZ female mice given water were used as controls. At gestational day 19, pregnant dams were sacrificed, placentas were collected and genotyped for subsequent studies. Results IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption during pregnancy altered placental morphology, and decreased placental efficiency and AAH expression in placentas from all genotypes. No differences were found in Igf1, Igf2, Igf1r and Igf2r mRNA expression in placentas from all groups. Conclusions IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption throughout gestation altered placental development, suggesting the crucial role of IGF-1 in the establishment of an adequate intrauterine environment that allows fetal growth. However, more studies are needed to study the precise mechanism to stablish the relation between both insults.

                Background Disregulation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) preformance status at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. We also observe that some glioma patients have increased prothrombin time compared to reference values. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from altered coagulation states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance, measurement, and treatment of abnormal coagulation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background People need critical thinking skills to make well-informed health choices and avoid waste and unnecessary suffering. However, educational interventions can have adverse effects, which is often overlooked. We created a framework of potential harms of interventions to improve critical thinking about health choices. The objective was to identify potential effects and articulate potential mechanisms. We intended to use the framework to inform the development and evaluation of an intervention in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Methods We created an initial framework drawing on two earlier frameworks. We surveyed external experts using Likert-scale and open-ended items, including researchers, educators, and others, in a variety of relevant fields. We emailed the survey to an international advisory network, and all other experts recommended by respondents. We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We revised the framework based on those results. To identify any effects missing from the revised framework, we individually interviewed a convenience sample of one teacher from each of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Results We received responses from 38 of 70 external experts (54%). The quantitative survey data suggested respondents agreed with the initial framework overall. However, the qualitative data led to substantial revisions. The revised framework consists of categories of adverse outcomes; outcomes within each category; sub-outcomes; individuals, groups, and populations that might experience each adverse outcome; beneficial outcomes corresponding with adverse outcomes; and potential mechanisms of adverse effects. There are six categories: decision-making harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, waste, and other harms. In the interviews with teachers, we did not identify any effects missing from the revised framework. Conclusions As far as we know, the framework is the first tool of its kind for education research. It can be improved upon and adapted.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90603">Hundreds of myosin 10s are pushed to the tips of filopodia and could cause traffic jams on actin</a></h4>

              
                Myosin 10 (Myo10) is a motor protein known for its role in filopodia formation. Although Myo10-driven filopodial dynamics have been characterized, there is no information about the absolute number of Myo10 molecules during the filopodial lifecycle. To better understand molecular stoichiometries and packing restraints in filopodia, we measured Myo10 abundance in these structures. We combined SDS-PAGE densitometry with epifluorescence microscopy to quantitate HaloTag-labeled Myo10 in U2OS cells. About 6% of total intracellular Myo10 localizes to filopodia, where it enriches at opposite cellular ends. Hundreds of Myo10s are in a typical filopodium, and their distribution across filopodia is log-normal. Some filopodial tips even contain more Myo10 than accessible binding sites on the actin filament bundle. Live-cell movies reveal a dense cluster of over a hundred Myo10 molecules that initiates filopodial elongation. Hundreds of Myo10 molecules continue to accumulate during filopodial growth, but accumulation ceases when retraction begins. Rates of filopodial elongation, second-phase elongation, and retraction are inversely related to Myo10 quantities. Our estimates of Myo10 molecules in filopodia provide insight into the physics of packing Myo10, its cargo, and other filopodia-associated proteins in narrow membrane compartments. Our protocol provides a framework for future work analyzing Myo10 abundance and distribution upon perturbation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95852">PUFA stabilizes a conductive state of the selectivity filter in IKs channels</a></h4>

              
                In cardiomyocytes, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs), pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels (Gmax). However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability, and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87258">A Pvr–AP-1–Mmp1 signaling pathway is activated in astrocytes upon traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by external mechanical forces is a major health burden worldwide, but the underlying mechanism in glia remains largely unclear. We report herein that <i>Drosophila</i> adults exhibit a defective blood–brain barrier, elevated innate immune responses, and astrocyte swelling upon consecutive strikes with a high-impact trauma device. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of these astrocytes revealed upregulated expression of genes encoding PDGF and VEGF receptor-related (Pvr, a receptor tyrosine kinase), adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1<i>,</i> a transcription factor complex of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway) composed of Jun-related antigen (Jra) and kayak (kay), and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1) following TBI. Interestingly, Pvr is both required and sufficient for AP-1 and Mmp1 upregulation, while knockdown of AP-1 expression in the background of Pvr overexpression in astrocytes rescued Mmp1 upregulation upon TBI, indicating that Pvr acts as the upstream receptor for the downstream AP-1–Mmp1 transduction. Moreover, dynamin-associated endocytosis was found to be an important regulatory step in downregulating Pvr signaling. Our results identify a new Pvr–AP-1–Mmp1 signaling pathway in astrocytes in response to TBI, providing potential targets for developing new therapeutic strategies for TBI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99858">Structural basis for molecular assembly of fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins in a diatom photosystem I supercomplex</a></h4>

              
                Photosynthetic organisms exhibit remarkable diversity in their light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). LHCs are associated with photosystem I (PSI), forming a PSI-LHCI supercomplex. The number of LHCI subunits, along with their protein sequences and pigment compositions, has been found to differ greatly among the PSI-LHCI structures. However, the mechanisms by which LHCIs recognize their specific binding sites within the PSI core remain unclear. In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a PSI supercomplex incorporating fucoxanthin chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>c</i>-binding proteins (FCPs), designated as PSI-FCPI, isolated from the diatom <i>Thalassiosira pseudonana</i> CCMP1335. Structural analysis of PSI-FCPI revealed five FCPI subunits associated with a PSI monomer; these subunits were identified as RedCAP, Lhcr3, Lhcq10, Lhcf10, and Lhcq8. Through structural and sequence analyses, we identified specific protein–protein interactions at the interfaces between FCPI and PSI subunits, as well as among FCPI subunits themselves. Comparative structural analyses of PSI-FCPI supercomplexes, combined with phylogenetic analysis of FCPs from <i>T. pseudonana</i> and the diatom <i>Chaetoceros gracilis</i>, underscore the evolutionary conservation of protein motifs crucial for the selective binding of individual FCPI subunits. These findings provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and selective binding of FCPIs in diatoms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96942">Formin-like 1β phosphorylation at S1086 is necessary for secretory polarized traffic of exosomes at the immune synapse in Jurkat T lymphocytes</a></h4>

              
                We analyzed here how formin-like 1 β (FMNL1β), an actin cytoskeleton-regulatory protein, regulates microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and multivesicular bodies (MVB) polarization and exosome secretion at an immune synapse (IS) model in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. IS formation was associated with transient recruitment of FMNL1β to the IS, which was independent of protein kinase C δ (PKCδ). Simultaneous RNA interference of all FMNL1 isoforms prevented MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion, which were restored by FMNL1βWT expression. However, expression of the non-phosphorylatable mutant FMNL1βS1086A did not restore neither MTOC/MVB polarization nor exosome secretion to control levels, supporting the crucial role of S1086 phosphorylation in MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. In contrast, the phosphomimetic mutant, FMNL1βS1086D, restored MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. Conversely, FMNL1βS1086D mutant did not recover the deficient MTOC/MVB polarization occurring in PKCδ-interfered clones, indicating that S1086 FMNL1β phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. FMNL1 interference inhibited the depletion of F-actin at the central region of the immune synapse (cIS), which is necessary for MTOC/MVB polarization. FMNL1βWT and FMNL1βS1086D, but not FMNL1βS1086A expression, restored F-actin depletion at the cIS. Thus, actin cytoskeleton reorganization at the IS underlies the effects of all these FMNL1β variants on polarized secretory traffic. FMNL1 was found in the IS made by primary T lymphocytes, both in T cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-evoked synapses. Taken together, these results point out a crucial role of S1086 phosphorylation in FMNL1β activation, leading to cortical actin reorganization and subsequent control of MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion.

                The mechanisms contributing to age-related deterioration of the female reproductive system are complex, however aberrant protein homeostasis is a major contributor. We elucidated exceptionally stable proteins, structures, and macromolecules that persist in mammalian ovaries and gametes across the reproductive lifespan. Ovaries exhibit localized structural and cell-type-specific enrichment of stable macromolecules in both the follicular and extrafollicular environments. Moreover, ovaries and oocytes both harbor a panel of exceptionally long-lived proteins, including cytoskeletal, mitochondrial, and oocyte-derived proteins. The exceptional persistence of these long-lived molecules suggest a critical role in lifelong maintenance and age-dependent deterioration of reproductive tissues.

">Consistent hierarchies of single-neuron timescales in mice, macaques and humans</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic timescales of single neurons are thought to be hierarchically organized across the cortex. This conclusion, however, is primarily based on analyses of neural responses from macaques. Whether hierarchical variation in timescales is a general brain organizing principle across mammals remains unclear. Here we took a cross-species approach and estimated neuronal timescales of thousands of single neurons recorded across multiple areas in mice, monkeys, and humans using a task-agnostic method. We identify largely consistent hierarchies of timescales in frontal and limbic regions across species: hippocampus had the shortest timescale whereas anterior cingulate cortex had the longest. Within this scheme, variability across species was found, most notably in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. We show that variation in timescales is not simply related to differences in spiking statistics nor the result of cytoarchitectonic features such as cortical granularity. Thus, hierarchically organized timescales are a consistent organizing principle across species and appear to be related to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

">Practice beyond performance stabilization increases the use of online adjustments to unpredictable perturbations in an interceptive task</a></h4>

              
                In recent decades, research has focused on motor adjustments in interception tasks within predictable environments. However, emerging studies suggest that continued practice beyond performance stabilization enhances the ability to adapt to unpredictable events. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of practicing until performance stabilization versus extended practice through superstabilization on the ability to adjust to unpredictable perturbations in intercepting a moving target. We hypothesized superstabilization would better facilitate motor adjustments in response to unpredictable perturbations. Forty participants engaged in an interception task until they achieved either performance stabilization or superstabilization. Subsequently, both stabilization and superstabilization groups were tested in an unpredictable environment, where, in certain trials, the target's velocity unexpectedly changed after the onset of the movement. The findings revealed that the superstabilization group made more adjustments in response to these perturbations than the stabilization group, attributed to their developed capacity to use online feedback as a control mechanism more efficiently. In contrast, the practice until performance stabilization did not foster this adaptive mechanism. These results support the notion that learning is a dynamic process that extends beyond the point of performance stabilization, emphasizing the benefits of continued practice for mastering complex motor tasks in variable contexts.

">Touch to text: Spatiotemporal evolution of braille letter representations in blind readers</a></h4>

              
                Visual deprivation does not silence the visual cortex, which is responsive to auditory, tactile, and other nonvisual tasks in blind persons. However, the underlying functional dynamics of the neural networks mediating such crossmodal responses remain unclear. Here, using braille reading as a model framework to investigate these networks, we presented sighted (N=13) and blind (N=12) readers with individual visual print and tactile braille alphabetic letters, respectively, during MEG recording. Using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis, we traced the alphabetic letter processing cascade in both groups of participants. We found that letter representations unfolded more slowly in blind than in sighted brains, with decoding peak latencies ~200 ms later in braille readers. Focusing on the blind group, we found that the format of neural letter representations transformed within the first 500 ms after stimulus onset from a low-level structure consistent with peripheral nerve afferent coding to high-level format reflecting pairwise letter embeddings in a text corpus. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the transformation suggest that the processing cascade proceeds from a starting point in somatosensory cortex to early visual cortex and then to inferotemporal cortex. Together our results give insight into the neural mechanisms underlying braille reading in blind persons and the dynamics of functional reorganization in sensory deprivation.

">From single words to sentence production: Shared cortical representations but distinct temporal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Sentence production is the uniquely human ability to transform complex thoughts into strings of words. Despite the importance of this process, language production research has primarily focused on single words. It remains an untested assumption that insights from this literature generalize to more naturalistic utterances like sentences. Here, we investigate this using high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (ECoG) and an overt production experiment where patients produce six words in isolation (picture naming) and in sentences (scene description). We used machine learning models to identify the unique brain activity pattern for each word during picture naming, and used these patterns to decode which words patients were processing while they produced sentences. In sensorimotor cortex, this procedure predicted each noun in the order it was said in the sentence, confirming that words share cortical representations across tasks. However, in inferior and middle frontal gyri (IFG and MFG), the order in which words were processed depended on the syntactic structure of the sentence. This dynamic interplay between sentence structure and word processing reveals that sentence production is not simply a sequence of single word production tasks. We argue that it is time for the field to leverage the extensive literature on word production for studying more naturalistic linguistic constructs like sentences.

                This study presents BROADband brain Network Estimation via Source Separation (BROAD-NESS), a novel method tailored for event-related designs, leveraging magnetoencephalographys (MEG) high temporal and spatial resolution to identify dynamic brain networks without predefined regions. By applying principal component analysis (PCA) to source-reconstructed MEG data from 83 participants in a long-term musical sequence recognition task, BROAD-NESS captured event-related networks more effectively than traditional approaches, revealing two main networks that explained 88% of the variance. The first network, involving the auditory cortices and medial cingulate gyrus, was associated with continuous auditory processing. The second network, encompassing prefrontal and hippocampal regions, inferior temporal cortex, and insula, was linked to memory, confirmed predictions and prediction error processing. With limited computational demands and minimal assumptions, BROAD-NESS offers a powerful tool for studying event-related brain dynamics, enhancing understanding of memory-related networks in recognition of temporal sequences.

">The STRIPAK complex is required for radial sorting and laminin receptor expression in Schwann cells</a></h4>

              
                During peripheral nervous system development, Schwann cells undergo Rac1-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization as they insert cytoplasmic extensions into axon bundles to radially sort, ensheath, and myelinate individual axons. However, our understanding of the direct effectors targeted by Rac1 is limited. Here, we demonstrate that striatin-3 and MOB4 are novel Rac1 interactors. We show that, similar to Rac1-null Schwann cells, Schwann cell specific ablation of striatin-3 causes defects in lamellipodia formation. In addition, conditional Schwann cell knockout of multiple striatin proteins presents a severe delay in radial sorting. Finally, we demonstrate here that deletion of Rac1 or striatin-1/3 in Schwann cells causes defects in Hippo pathway regulation, phosphorylation of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ, and expression of genes co-regulated by YAP and TAZ, such as extracellular matrix receptors. In summary, our results indicate that striatin-3 is a novel Rac1 interactor, show that striatin proteins are required for peripheral nervous system development, and reveal a role for Rac1 in regulation of the Hippo pathway in Schwann cells.

                This study investigates the neural correlates of identity and reputation processing in cooperative decision-making during the Public Goods Game (PGG). Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we examined how different types of social information--co-player facial photos, reputational scores, and a combination of both--influence activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Our findings suggest that the dlPFC is crucial for integrating reputational information, reflecting its role in cognitive control and modulation of expectations during cooperative interactions. The vmPFC, on the other hand, is involved in attributing value to the cooperative decision by synthesizing identity and reputation cues. Reputation alone elicited greater dlPFC activity, highlighting the cognitive demands of evaluating past behaviors. When both identity and reputation information were presented, vmPFC activity increased, indicating greater value processing. These results demonstrate the distinct but complementary roles of the dlPFC and vmPFC in processing social cues during cooperative decision-making.

                The brain is susceptible to disturbances in lipid metabolism. Among the rare, genetically-linked epilepsies Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy Type 8 (PME8), associated with the loss of Ceramide Synthase (CerS) activity, causes epileptic symptoms accompanied by neurodegenerative traits. We show that expression of a disease-causing cerS allele in Drosophila sensory neurons yielded developmental and degenerative dendrite loss. In cerS mutants, C18-C24 ceramides and membrane-forming complex sphingolipids, into which ceramides are converted, were reduced. At the same time bioactive signaling lipids including (dh)Sphingosine-1-P, deriving from the CerS substrate, were increased. To clarifying the etiology of PME8, we thus performed in vivo experiments to cell-autonomously rescue the individual metabolic alterations. We report that restoring specific long-chain ceramides while in parallel decreasing (dh)Sphingosine-1-P fully rescues the cerS mutant phenotype. Thus, despite the complex metabolic alterations, our data provide essential information about the metabolic origin of PME8 and delineate a potential therapy.

                Hemispheric asymmetry is a universal property of brain organization with wide implications into brain function and structure, and diseases. This study presents a laterality index for characterizing hemispheric asymmetries that underlie cortical maps using geometric eigenmodes derived from human cortical surfaces. We develop a generalized design to quantify asymmetries across various cortical spatial scales. While the design is individual-specific, we implement normalization steps to enable unbiased comparisons across individuals. As a proof of concept, we validated the method on cortical maps of 545 subjects across two datasets, using fMRI maps of healthy individuals and tau-PET maps of patients across the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Our results reveal that cortical regions in different canonical functional networks have connectivity patterns that entail different degrees of hemispheric asymmetry. Moreover, aggregates of the pathological tau protein manifest subtle asymmetries at varying spatial scales along the disease continuum.

">Comparison of the cortical hierarchy between macaque monkeys and mice based on cell-type specific microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                The primate neocortex contains a hierarchy of cortical areas, with feedforward connections running from lower to higher levels, and feedback connections running in the opposite direction. The relative hierarchical position of cortical areas has been well established by retrograde tracing studies that allow to determine whether type of output from different source areas is predominantly feedforward or feedback. This method can not determine whether the cortico-cortical input within target areas is predominantly feedforward or feedback. We here make use of cell-type specific microcircuits to provide an intrinsic measure of the strength of feedforward versus feedback processing within cortical areas in macaque monkeys and mice. This allows a more complete map of the cortical hierarchy of different species, and therefore a more direct cross-species comparison. Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons were used as a marker of feedforward processing and calretinin-expressing interneurons as a marker of feedback processing. We found steep gradients in the distributions of these two interneuron types across macaque monkey cortical areas, indicating a deep cortical hierarchy where early visual areas are dominated by feedforward neural circuits and higher cortical areas become dominated by top-recurrent circuits. In contrast, the gradient in interneuron distribution across mouse cortical areas was limited, indicating a shallow cortical hierarchy and remaining dominated by feedforward neural circuits. This implies that the mouse cortex is comparable to early visual areas in primates, remaining dominated by bottom-up input. While primates are unique in having a deep cortical hierarchy that allows neural processing in higher cortical areas to become predominantly internal.

                Macroautophagy and mitophagy are critical processes in Alzheimer disease (AD), yet their links to behavioral outcomes, particularly sex-specific differences, are not fully understood. This study investigates autophagy (LC3B-II, SQSTM1) and mitophagy (BNIP3L, BNIP3, BCL2L13) markers in the cortex and hippocampus of male and female 3xTg-AD mice, using western blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and behavioral tests (novel object recognition and novel object placement). Significant sex-specific differences emerged: female 3xTg-AD mice exhibited autophagosome accumulation due to impaired degradation in the cortex, while males showed fewer autophagosomes, especially in the hippocampus, without significant degradation changes. TEM analyses demonstrated variations in mitochondrial and mitophagosome numbers correlated with memory outcomes. Females had enhanced mitophagy, with higher BNIP3L and BCL2L13 levels, whereas males showed elevated BNIP3 dimers. Cognitive deficits in females correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction in the cortex, while in males, higher LC3B-II levels associated positively with cognitive performance, suggesting protective autophagy effects. Using machine learning, we predicted mitophagosome and mitochondrial numbers based on behavioral data, pioneering a predictive approach to cellular outcomes in AD. These findings underscore the importance of sex-specific regulation of autophagy and mitophagy in AD and support personalized therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways. Integrating machine learning emphasizes its potential to advance neurodegenerative research.

">Different serotonergic neurons regulate appetite for sucrose and hunger for proteins</a></h4>

              
                For the organism it is important to replenish internal energy storages selectively and selective appetite for nutrients might uncover internal energy requirements. How is the selective uptake of a specific nutrient regulated? Here we show that in Drosophila melanogaster different sets of serotonergic neurons regulate appetite for sucrose and hunger for proteins. Increased neuronal activity in specific subsets of serotonergic neurons and interfering with serotonin reuptake using a mutated serotonin transporter reduced the appetite for sucrose selectively, but not the hunger for proteins. The insulin receptor together with the serotonin transporter regulates the selective sucrose appetite. We provide evidence that the cellular location of the serotonin transporter depends on the insulin receptor. This mechanism might allow optimizing nutrient intake and in turn might prevent overconsumption by repressing appetite for sucrose. Given the conserved nature of the molecules involved it is likely that the mechanism is conserved in higher organisms.

">Medial septum parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons are impaired in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the SCN1A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1  subunit. Experiments in animal models of DS, including the haploinsufficient Scn1a+/- mouse, have identified impaired excitability of interneurons in the hippocampus and neocortex; this is thought to underlie the treatment-resistant epilepsy that is a prominent feature of the DS phenotype. However, additional brain structures, such as the medial septum (MS), also express SCN1A. The medial septum is known to play an important role in cognitive function and thus may contribute to the intellectual impairment that also characterizes DS. In this study, we employed whole cell patch clamp recordings in acute brain slices to characterize the electrophysiological properties of MS neurons in Scn1a+/- mice versus age-matched wild-type littermate controls. We found no discernible genotype-related differences in MS cholinergic (ChAT) neurons, but significant dysfunction within MS parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory neurons in Scn1a+/- mice. We further identified heterogeneity of firing patterns among MS PV neurons, and additional genotype differences in the proportion of subtype representation. These results confirm that the MS is an additional locus of pathology in DS, that may contribute to co-morbidities such as cognitive impairment.

">Dose-Dependent Effects of PFOS on Thyroid Hormone-Driven Neurodevelopment and Metamorphic-like change in Xenopus laevis larvae</a></h4>

              
                PFOS is a banned stain repellent that is a type of PFAS, a category of chemicals commonly referred to as "forever chemicals." These substances are known for their bioaccumulative nature and their resistance to degradation in the environment. Emerging data indicates that PFOS may disrupt thyroid hormone (TH) signaling, which plays a pivotal role in healthy vertebrate development, particularly neural development. Our study investigates whether PFOS interferes with TH-dependent developmental changes, with focus on the developing brain, in Xenopus laevis larvae. To assess this, we exposed five-day old larvae to varying concentrations of PFOS (25 ug/L, 2.5 ug/L, and 250 ng/L). Additionally, some larvae were exposed to either 15 ug/L or 1.5 ug/L of thyroxine to evaluate PFOS's potential interference with TH-dependent developmental mechanisms. After four days, we euthanized larvae and examined body length and hind limb size, dissected out brains and performed immunostaining for markers of neuronal proliferation and apoptosis. We found that PFOS significantly impeded overall body growth in a dose-dependent manner, irrespective of TH status. Moreover, PFOS impaired TH-stimulated hind limb development. In the brain, PFOS had no effect on proliferation but hindered TH-stimulated growth of the optic tectum. Last, PFOS increased apoptosis in the optic tectum, indicative of cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that PFOS may have the capacity to disrupt TH-dependent mechanisms involved in brain development. The observed pattern of change also suggests that its impact is cytotoxic and may not stem solely from a canonical endocrine disruption mechanism.

">The persistent effects of predator odor stressor enhance interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol through GABA-A receptor adaptations in the prelimbic cortex in male, but not female rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traumatic stress is associated with high rates of problematic alcohol use, but how the persistent effects of trauma impact sensitivity to alcohol remain unknown. This study examined the persistent effects of traumatic stress exposure on sensitivity to alcohol and underlying neurobiological mechanisms in rats. Methods: Male (N=98) and female (N=98) Long-Evans rats were exposed to the predator odor TMT, and two weeks later, molecular, neuronal, and behavioral sensitivity to alcohol were assessed. Next, rats were trained to discriminate alcohol from water (male N=70; female N=56), and the impact of TMT on interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol and the alcohol-like effects of systemic GABA-A receptor activation were evaluated. Lastly, functional involvement of GABA-A and NMDA receptors in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) and the anterior insular cortex (aIC) was investigated. Results: TMT exposure sex-dependently altered PrL Gabra1, and elevated aIC Grin2b and Grin2c in males. TMT increased PrL c-Fos in males, which was attenuated by alcohol administration. Alcohol-induced locomotor and startle response effects were attenuated in the TMT group in both sexes. TMT exposure potentiated interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol in males but not in females, and this effect was driven by GABA-A receptors in the PrL. Greater stress reactivity during TMT exposure was associated with higher interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol, and alcohol exposure history was linked to a heightened stress response to TMT in males. Conclusions: Traumatic stress increased interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol in males, but not females, through PrL GABA-A receptor adaptations, potentially enhancing the stimulatory, and by extension the rewarding, effects of alcohol.

">Sleep Deprivation in Mice: Looking Beyond the Slow Wave Rebound</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a fundamental process by which the brain achieves an optimal computational regime; it has been suggested that criticality is an appropriate theoretical framework in which such a process can be understood. Studying the critical and fractal dynamics of the brain involves modelling the nonlinearity of brain signals (such as EEG or ECoG) yielding, among others, the following metrics: spectral slope, spectral intercept, spectral knee, and normalized spectral entropy. Therefore, the present study investigates the nonlinear and critical dynamics of the brain in relation to sleep deprivation in mice, by comparing the sensitivity of the above-mentioned metrics to classical band-limited spectral indices. Mice were exposed to a 9 day-long sleep deprivation paradigm with baseline, sleep deprivation, and recovery phases. Spectral parameters were computed using the FOOOF algorithm. The results suggest that the classical approach (slow wave activity; 0.75 to 4.5 Hz) to neural signal processing differentiates between baseline sleep and rebound sleep only during the NREM phase. In contrast, the spectral slope and the spectral intercept both capture sleep deprivation related effects during REM and NREM episodes as well. This is particularly notable considering that the spectral knee is shifted towards higher frequencies, essentially rendering the spectral slope unreflective of slow wave activity, traditionally considered the biomarker of sleep homeostasis. Lastly, normalized spectral entropy fails to differentiate between baseline sleep and sleep following sleep deprivation in mice. These results support the sensitivity of fractal spectral parameters indexing the intricate balance between sleep and wake states.

">Using a Deep Learning Approach for Model-based Control of Deep Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been developed as a treatment method for various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and depression. Although DBS is effective, it often loses efficacy over sustained periods because constant stimulation is applied without adapting to the patient's current clinical state. In contrast, an adaptive closed-loop DBS system can offer more tailored stimulation in real-time based on a feedback biomarker. In early 2024, we developed a model-based DBS control framework that consists of three main functions: (1) a biophysically reasonable encoding model, (2) a simple decoding model, and (3) a controller. We used a polynomial fit function in the decoding model to approximate the neural-motor relationship, from DBS-induced Vim neural activity to muscle fiber electromyography (EMG). Despite promising results, the polynomial method is inaccurate in capturing the full representation of the neural-motor (EMG) function across different DBS frequencies. In this work, to capture the nonlinear intricate relationship between the neural and EMG patterns, we developed a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) as a decoding model to predict the EMG signal directly from the DBS-induced Vim neural activity. The 1-D CNN network outputted a high R2 value of 0.997 which significantly outperformed the polynomial method (R2 = 0.277) and a deep learning approach based on long short-term memory (R2 = 0.296). We anticipate that our work highlights the need for a data-driven approach that can reliably map neural activities to symptomatic signals like EMG for better adjusting DBS parameters.

">Impaired maturation of wild-type superoxide dismutase 1 associated with neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease brain and a novel murine model</a></h4>

              
                Atypical wild-type superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein misfolding and deposition occurs specifically within the degenerating substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in Parkinson disease. Mechanisms driving the formation of this pathology and relationship with SNc dopamine neuron health, are yet to be fully understood. We applied proteomic mass spectrometry and synchrotron-based biometal quantification to post-mortem brain tissues from the SNc of Parkinson disease patients and age-matched controls to uncover key factors underlying the formation of wild-type SOD1 pathology in this disorder. We then engineered brain copper deficiency and upregulated SOD1 protein levels in a novel mouse strain, termed the SOCK mouse, to verify their involvement in the development of Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology and their impact on dopamine neuron health. Soluble SOD1 protein in the degenerating Parkinson disease SNc exhibited altered post-translational modifications, which may underlie changes to the enzymatic activity and aggregation of the protein in this region. These include decreased copper binding, dysregulation of physiological glycosylation, and atypical oxidation and glycation of key SOD1 amino acid residues. We demonstrated that the biochemical profile introduced in SOCK mice promotes the same post-translational modifications and the development of Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology in the midbrain and cortex. This pathology accumulates progressively with age and is accompanied by nigrostriatal degeneration and dysfunction, which occur in the absence of -synuclein deposition. These mice do not exhibit weight loss nor spinal cord motor neuron degeneration, distinguishing them from transgenic mutant SOD1 mouse models. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that mismetallation and altered post-translational modifications precipitates wild-type SOD1 misfolding, dysfunction and deposition in the Parkinson disease brain, which may contribute to SNc dopamine neuron degeneration. Our data position this pathology as a novel drug target for this disorder, with a particular focus on therapies capable of correcting alterations to SOD1 post-translational modifications.

">Orexinergic projections to substantia innominata mediate arousal and analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neural circuits involved in anesthesia is crucial for improving its safety and efficacy. Hypothalamic orexin neurons (LHAOX), projecting broadly, are essential in regulating arousal and pain. However, the precise targets remain unclear. Here we investigated the orexin projections to the substantia innominata (SI). Combining optogenetics, fiber photometry, and EEG/EMG allowed us to manipulate orexin activities, while simultaneously recording local ligand release and global cortical activities during anesthesia. Brain slice electrophysiology revealed the synaptic connections in the SI, while RNAscope was employed to examine the distribution of orexin receptors and downstream neuronal types. Presynaptic vesicles were identified in the orexin terminals in the SI, where 49.16% of cells expressed OX2R and 6.8% expressed OX1R. Orexin release in the SI was reversibly suppressed by isoflurane. Optogenetic activation of the LHAOX[-&gt;]SI circuit significantly increased orexin release and promoted arousal from various anesthesia stages, including reanimation during 0.75% isoflurane (p < 0.0001), prolongation of 3% isoflurane induction (p = 0.0033), and acceleration of emergence from 2% isoflurane (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, activating this circuit induced analgesia to both thermal (p = 0.0074) and inflammatory (p = 0.0127) pain. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that optogenetic activation of orexin terminals in the SI elicited excitatory postsynaptic currents, which were blocked by the OX2R antagonist. SI contains more GABAergic (28.17%) and glutamatergic (11.96%) neurons than cholinergic neurons (4.13%), all of which expressed OX2R. Thus, LHAOX neurons innervate SI neurons to regulate both arousal and pain predominantly through OX2R.

">15 second assessment of hand and foot motor skill using a smartphone</a></h4>

              
                Motor skills are essential for daily functioning and serve as key indicators of healthy development and aging. However, existing assessments of motor skill are inaccessible to the public and do not directly measure the quality of the movement. Here, we developed a convenient and robust measure of motor skill that uses a smartphone app to provide on-the-spot assessment in just 15 seconds. To validate our method, we asked 1675 participants between the ages of three to eighty-eight years old to trace circles at a fixed rhythm with a smartphone, which was either held in the hand or strapped to the ankle. Motor skill was quantified by the smartphone app using an algorithm that calculated the variability in the acceleration's trajectory. Our assessment revealed significant changes in the skill of the hands and feet with age and practice. The variability of the hands and feet linearly decreased and matured in the mid-teens, but it regressed gradually thereafter. Laterality, or the difference in the motor skill between the left and right limbs, increased with age as the non-dominant hand and foot regressed faster in the elderly. Motor practice affected both skill and laterality as left-handers who were forced to write with their right-hand during childhood had a tell-tale sign of stronger right-handedness and, surprisingly, right-footedness. Our assessment aims to democratize motor skill assessment, making it accessible for professionals and users of all ages.

">A Protocol for Neuralized Murine Olfactory Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Chronic olfactory dysfunction can be associated with parkinsonism, dementia, demyelinating disorders and schizophrenia. The olfactory epithelium (OE) represents an interface between the environment and the central nervous system. Mounting evidence implicates environmental factors in neurodegenerative disease processes, necessitating investigations into their interactions with the host's genome. In Parkinson disease, hyposmia often precedes motor symptoms, raising the possibility that the OE could be involved in disease initiation. We previously demonstrated abundant alpha-synuclein expression in mammalian OE as well as aggregate formation in the olfactory nerve. Current in vitro models of OE are limited, relying primarily on post-mitotic cultures established from biopsies. To address this gap, we present a method for generating olfactory organoids of OE from adult mice. These organoids comprise neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, including sustentacular cells, thus encompassing structural elements of OE in situ. Expression of the olfactory sensory neuron marker OMP and Parkinson's-linked alpha-synuclein was also detected in olfactory organoids, highlighting their potential usefulness to mechanistic research. We established OE organoids that were kept in culture for up to 3 weeks. In addition, we inoculated organoids with the neurotropic vesicular stomatitis virus to model infections. We conclude that this olfactory organoid model system offers a new platform for studying airborne environmental factors in their interactions with a genetically defined host; this, to study OE biology and enable the exploration of disease processes within olfactory tissue.

Yet, only for some of these subtypes specific markers exist that could be employed to study of the function of individual subtypes. Osteopontin (Spp1) marks alpha-RGC, suggesting that, across ipRGC, it would only mark the M4 ipRGC subtype (synonymous to: ON-sustained alpha-RGC). Recent evidence suggests that osteopontin expression could spread to other ipRGC subtypes. Therefore, this study aims to characterise the expression pattern of osteopontin across ipRGC subtypes. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing data from RGC were analysed to identify expression patterns of Spp1 across ipRGC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on retinal cryosections and flatmounts from C57BL/6J mice to characterize the localization of osteopontin across ipRGC. Neurite tracing was employed to study dendritic morphology and identify individual ipRGC subtypes. Results: scRNAseq analysis revealed Spp1 expression in two distinct clusters of ipRGC. IHC confirmed osteopontin co-localization with Smi-32, an established marker for RGC, including M4-ipRGCs. Spp1 immunoreactivity was moreover identified in one additional group of ipRGC. By dendritic morphology and stratification those cells were clearly identified as M2 ipRGC. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that osteopontin is expressed in both M2 and M4 ipRGC, challenging the notion of osteopontin as a marker exclusively for alpha-RGC. IHC double labelling for osteopontin and melanopsin provides a novel method to identify and differentiate M2 ipRGC from other subtypes. This will support the study ipRGC physiology in a subtype specific manner and may for instance foster research in the field of optic nerve injury.

">Mental Rotation is a weak measure of the propensity to visualise.</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing evidence of substantial differences in the capacity of people to voluntarily visualise, with some (Congenital Aphants) asserting they cannot visualise at all. It has been suggested that Congenital Aphants might be mistaken about their inability, as some have performed similarly on tasks purported to measure imagery, including the mental rotation task where people decide if objects depicted from different viewpoints are the same or different. We examined how the vividness of peoples imagery is related to performance on a mental rotation task. People also reported on their response strategies. Mental rotation was an overall superior response strategy relative to non-visualising. However, the vividness of peoples imagery was only weakly associated with viewpoint contingent changes in task performance, and it did not predict changes in reliance on mental rotation as a response strategy. Overall, our data suggest performance on mental rotation tasks is a weak measure of peoples propensity to visualise.

">Denoising complex-valued diffusion MR images using a two-step non-local principal component analysis approach</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: to propose a two-step non-local principal component analysis (PCA) method and demonstrate its utility for denoising diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) with a few diffusion directions. Methods: A two-step denoising pipeline was implemented to ensure accurate patch selection even with high noise levels and was coupled with data preprocessing for g-factor normalization and phase stabilization before data denoising with a non-local PCA algorithm. At the heart of our proposed pipeline was the use of a data-driven optimal shrinkage algorithm to manipulate the singular values in a way that would optimally estimate the noise-free signal. Denoising performances were evaluated using simulation and in-vivo human data experiments. The results were compared to those obtained with existing local-PCA-based methods. Results: In both simulation and human data experiments, our approach substantially enhanced image quality relative to the noisy counterpart, yielding improved performances for estimation of relevant DTI metrics. It also outperformed existing local-PCA-based methods in reducing noise while preserving anatomic details. It also led to improved whole-brain tractography relative to the noisy counterpart. Conclusion: The proposed denoising method has the utility for improving image quality for DTI with reduced diffusion directions and is believed to benefit many applications especially those aiming to achieve quality parametric mapping using only a few image volumes.

">BrainACTIV: Identifying visuo-semantic properties driving cortical selectivity using diffusion-based image manipulation</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is thought to efficiently represent visual inputs through specialized neural populations that selectively respond to specific image categories. Advancements in generative modeling have enabled data-driven discovery of neural selectivity using brain-optimized image synthesis. However, current methods independently generate one sample at a time, making it hard to discern which image features drive neural response selectivity. To address this issue, we introduce Brain Activation Control Through Image Variation (BrainACTIV), a method for manipulating a reference image to enhance or suppress activity in a target cortical region using pretrained diffusion models. Starting from a reference image allows for fine-grained and reliable identification of optimal visuo-semantic properties. We show that our manipulations effectively modulate predicted fMRI responses and agree with hypothesized preferred categories in established regions of interest, while remaining structurally close to the reference image. In addition, we describe how two hyperparameters allow a trade-off between semantic variation and low-level structural control, and how both variations affect predicted brain activity. Finally, we demonstrate how our method accentuates differences between brain regions that are selective to the same category. We propose that BrainACTIV holds the potential to formulate robust hypotheses about brain representation as well as produce controllable naturalistic stimuli for neuroscientific experiments.

">Neural mechanisms underlying robust target selection in response to microstimulation of the oculomotor system</a></h4>

              
                Despite its prevalence in studying the causal roles of different brain circuits in cognitive processes, electrical microstimulation often results in inconsistent behavioral effects. These inconsistencies are assumed to be due to multiple mechanisms, including habituation, compensation by other brain circuits, and contralateral suppression. Considering the presence of reinforcement in most experimental paradigms, we hypothesized that interactions between reward feedback and microstimulation could contribute to inconsistencies in behavioral effects of microstimulation. To test this, we analyzed data from electrical microstimulation of the frontal eye field of male macaques during a value-based decision-making task and constructed network models to capture choice behavior. We found evidence for microstimulation-dependent adaptation in saccadic choice, such that in stimulated trials, monkeys' choices were biased toward the target in the response field of the microstimulated site (Tin). In contrast, monkeys showed a bias away from Tin in non-stimulated trials following microstimulation. Critically, this bias slowly decreased as a function of the time since the last stimulation. Moreover, microstimulation-dependent adaptation was influenced by reward outcomes in preceding trials. Despite these local effects, we found no evidence for the global effects of microstimulation on learning and sensitivity to the reward schedule. By simulating choice behavior across various network models, we found a model in which microstimulation and reward-value signals interact competitively through reward-dependent plasticity can best account for our observations. Our findings indicate a reward-dependent compensatory mechanism that enhances robustness to perturbations within the oculomotor system and could explain the inconsistent outcomes observed in previous microstimulation studies.

">Linguistic and Affective Prosody. A Unifying Perspective:A Systematic Review and ALE Meta-Analysis of the Cortical Organization of Prosody</a></h4>

              
                Prosody is a cover term referring to the melodic aspects of speech, with linguistic and affective (a.k.a. emotional) meanings. This review provides an overview of linguistic and affective prosody, testing two hypotheses on healthy individuals' linguistic and affective prosody. The first hypothesizes that the biological nature of affective prosody triggers activations unrelated to language (biological hypothesis), and the second that the aspects of affective prosody have been grammaticalized, i.e., incorporated into the language (linguistic hypothesis). We employed a systematic ALE metanalytic approach to identify neural correlates of prosody from the literature. Specifically, we assessed papers that report brain coordinates from healthy individuals selected using systematic research from academic databases, such as PubMed (NLM), Scopus, and Web of Science. We found that affective and linguistic prosody activate bilateral frontotemporal regions, like the Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG). A key difference is that affective prosody involves subcortical structures like the amygdala, and linguistic prosody activates linguistic areas and brain areas of social cognition and engagement. The shared activations, therefore, suggest that linguistic and affective meanings are combined, involving shared underlying brain connectivity mechanisms and acoustic manifestations. We propose the 'prosodic blending hypothesis' to account for the findings. The hypothesis unifies the linguistic and affective prosody distinction, suggesting that prosody incorporates affective, social, and linguistic meanings in the acoustic signal and involves selective bilateral neural contributions. Although brain regions responsible for core emotions can be activated, those meanings are produced through a coordinated and structured linguistic manner, accounting for the gradient expression of non-linguistic and categorical linguistic aspects. We argue that the process is similar to speech, lexicon, and grammar domains, as they, too, convey affective, social, and linguistic meanings without their explicit separation into linguistic and affective. Therefore, our blending hypothesis views prosody as a unified system that combines affective and linguistic functions.

">The Causal Role Of Beta Band Desynchronization: Individualized High-Definition Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Improves Bimanual Motor Control</a></h4>

              
                Objective. To unveil if 3 mA peak-to-peak high-definition beta transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied over C4 -the area overlaying the right sensorimotor cortex-enhances bimanual motor control and affects movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD), thereby providing causal evidence for the polymorphic role of MRBD in motor control. Methods. In this sham-controlled, crossover study, 36 participants underwent 20 minutes of fixed 20 Hz tACS; tACS individualized to peak beta activity during motor planning at baseline; and sham tACS randomized over three consecutive days. Before, during, and after tACS, participants performed a bimanual tracking task (BTT) and 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) data was measured. Spatiotemporal and temporal clustering statistics with underlying linear mixed effect models were used to test our hypotheses. Results. Individualized tACS significantly improved bimanual motor control, both online and offline, and increased online MRBD during motor planning compared to fixed tACS. No offline effects of fixed and individualized tACS on MRBD were found compared to sham, although tACS effects did trend towards the hypothesized MRBD increase. Throughout the course of the study, MRBD and bimanual motor performance improved. Exclusively during motor planning, MRBD was positively associated to bimanual motor performance improvements, emphasizing the functionally polymorphic role of MMRBD. tACS was well tolerated and no side-effects occurred. Conclusion. Individualized beta tACS improves bimanual motor control and enhances motor planning MRBD online. These findings provide causal evidence for the importance of MRBD when planning complex motor behavior.

">A Novel Human TBCK- Neuronal Cell Model Results in Severe Neurodegeneration and Partial Rescue with Mitochondrial Fission Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: TBCK syndrome is a rare fatal pediatric neurodegenerative disease caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the TBCK gene. Previous studies by our lab and others have implicated mTOR, autophagy, lysosomes, and intracellular mRNA transport, however the exact primary pathologic mechanism is unknown. This gap has prevented the development of targeted therapies. Methods: We employed a human neural progenitor cell line (NPC), ReNcell VM, which can differentiate into neurons and astrocytes, to understand the role of TBCK in mTORC1 activity and neuronal autophagy and cellular mechanisms of pathology. We used shRNA technology to knockdown TBCK in ReNcells. Results: These data showed that loss of TBCK did not inhibit mTORC1 activity in neither NPC nor neurons. Additionally, analysis of eight patient-derived cells and TBCK knock down HeLa cells showed that mTORC1 inhibition is inconsistent across different patients and cell types. We showed that TBCK knockdown in ReNcells affected NPC differentiation to neurons and astrocytes. Specifically, differentiation defects are coupled to cell cycle defects in NPC and increased cell death during differentiation. RNAseq analysis indicated the downregulation of several different neurodevelopmental and differentiation pathways. We observed a higher number of LC3-positive vesicles in the soma and neurites of TBCK knockdown cells. Further, TBCK knockdown altered mitochondrial dynamics and membrane potential in NPC, neurons and astrocytes. We found partial mitochondrial rescue with the mitochondrial fission inhibitor mdivi-1. Discussion: This work outlines a new Human Cell Model for TBCK-related neurodegeneration and the essential role of mitochondrial health and partial rescue with mitochondrial fission inhibitor. This data, along with human neurons and astrocytes, illuminate mechanisms of neurodegeneration and provide a possible novel therapeutic avenue for affected patients.

">Sequential transcriptional programs underpin activation of quiescent hippocampal stem cells.</a></h4>

              
                Postnatal neural stem cells are primarily quiescent, which is a cellular state that exists as a continuum from deep to shallow quiescence. The molecular changes that occur along this continuum are beginning to be understood but the transcription factor network governing these changes has not been defined. We show that these transitions are regulated by sequential transcription factor programs. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of mice with loss- or gain-of-function of the essential activation factor Ascl1, reveal that Ascl1 promotes the activation of hippocampal neural stem cells by driving these cells out of deep quiescence, despite its low protein expression. Subsequently, during the transition from deep to shallow quiescence, Ascl1 induces the expression of Mycn, which drives progression through shallow states of quiescence towards an active state. Together, these results define the required sequence of transcription factors during hippocampal neural stem cell activation.

	<p>The stability&amp;amp;ndash;plasticity dilemma remains a critical challenge in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of continuous learning. This perspective paper presents a novel approach by drawing inspiration from the mammalian hippocampus&amp;amp;ndash;cortex system. We elucidate how this biological system&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to balance rapid learning with long-term memory retention can inspire novel AI architectures. Our analysis focuses on key mechanisms, including complementary learning systems and memory consolidation, with emphasis on recent discoveries about sharp-wave ripples and barrages of action potentials. We propose innovative AI designs incorporating dual learning rates, offline consolidation, and dynamic plasticity modulation. This interdisciplinary approach offers a framework for more adaptive AI systems while providing insights into biological learning. We present testable predictions and discuss potential implementations and implications of these biologically inspired principles. By bridging neuroscience and AI, our perspective aims to catalyze advancements in both fields, potentially revolutionizing AI capabilities while deepening our understanding of neural processes.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorder (SUD) significantly impacts public health, economics, and legal systems worldwide. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) was initially developed in the late 1980s as a therapeutic approach for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using bilateral stimulation to integrate traumatic memories with calming physiological responses. However, the effectiveness of EMDR in treating SUD remains unclear. This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of EMDR therapy on craving reduction in individuals with SUD. The search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Web of Science, focusing on studies that measured craving and employed EMDR interventions. Both random and fixed effects models were used to pool effect sizes, utilizing an R software meta-package (R-4.4.1). The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The results indicated a significant reduction in cravings among patients undergoing EMDR therapy. Specifically, under the fixed effect model, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was &amp;amp;minus;0.866 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from &amp;amp;minus;1.121 to &amp;amp;minus;0.611 (z = &amp;amp;minus;6.66, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). These findings may demonstrate the significant efficacy of EMDR therapy in decreasing cravings in people with SUD.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) can indicate affective states&amp;amp;mdash;including psychosocial stress&amp;amp;mdash;in mice and rats. However, stress-induced USV changes could be confounded by laboratory experimental variables such as the type of behavioral stress paradigm, the elicitation method, rodent strain, etc. We sought to provide a review of the current literature to delineate how psychosocial stress-altered rodent USVs may be affected by factors of age, sex, strain, species, elicitation paradigm, and stressor. Methods: We used PubMed, Scopus (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EBSCO), and the following Web of Science (Clarivate) databases: Biological Abstracts, CAB Abstracts, Science Citation Index-Expanded, and Emerging Sources Citation Index. The studies identified by our search strategy were independently screened by two authors with the following inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed, in English, reported original data, and described USV in response to stress in rats or mice. The data extracted included USV acoustic parameters (mean peak frequency and mean amplitude (loudness)), details of the stress and USV elicitation paradigms, rodent species, age, and sex variables. Results: The following screening of 5309 titles/abstracts and 687 full-text articles revealed 148 articles. Footshock (20%), cold exposure (14%), and maternal separation (23.5%) were the most commonly used stress paradigms (duration and type of stressor varied across studies), with the total number of USV calls being the most commonly reported acoustic outcome. In rats, 121 articles described stress-altered USVs, while 25 studies reported the same in mice, and two reported multiple rodent species (rats and mice, alongside other rodent species such as gerbils). With respect to stress-altered USV changes with age, mice and rats increase USV rates after birth, with a peak around 6 to 10 days, and decrease USVs until weanling age. Of the five studies that reported sex-related differences in stress-induced USVs, females had an increased number of calls and lower average peak frequency in response to stress when compared to males. Only two to four studies reported strain-related differences in stress-induced vocalizations in rats and mice, respectively. Conclusions: The data from this review lay the groundwork for better understanding rodent USVs in response to psychosocial stress with effects of elicitation paradigm, stressor, age, and sex.</p>

	<p>Background: When integrating visual and somatosensory processing into the subjective postural vertical using the Romberg test, patients with hemiplegic can be sorted into either post-stroke or pushers with unilateral spatial neglect (USN). This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of the integrated processing of the integrated subjective postural vertical (ISPV) with open or closed eyes in patients with hemiplegic and/or pusher with USN. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 91 patients with hemiplegic and 45 with pusher and USN. The outcomes included the ratio and sum of SPV with the eyes closed and open. Statistical analyses were performed using the parametric and/or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test, or chi-square test after the Shapiro&amp;amp;ndash;Wilk test. Results: The outcomes in the 91 patients with hemiplegic were as follows: moderate-to-severe ISPV with ratio, 1.64&amp;amp;deg;; ISPV sum (ISPVS), 9.41&amp;amp;deg;. The outcomes in the 45 patients with pusher and USN were as follows: moderate-to-severe, ISPV: 1.35&amp;amp;deg;, and ISPVS: 13.96&amp;amp;deg;. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of demographic data or ISPV. However, the number of patients with pusher syndrome was significantly higher in the ISPVS group than in stroke patients with hemiplegic. Conclusions: Adaptation occurs by integrating sensory modalities, and the pusher behavior in patients with USN is characterized by the specific pathophysiology of a two-modality disorder with visual and somatosensory deficits. This study provides key insights into the pathophysiological characteristics of patients with pusher syndrome and USN.</p>

                Background Two-wheeled vehicles are the major mode of transportation in India. Such vehicles are exposed to excessive vibration on the road when compared to four-wheeled vehicles. However, the research on the reduction of whole body vibration in the case of two-wheelers is not explored in detail. The present study predicts rider comfort in the case of an electric two-wheeler as per ISO 2631-1, by obtaining the finding the weighted acceleration at the strategic locations of vibration at the test rig. Methods An electric two-wheeler test rig is used in the study. The values of acceleration from the test rig in running conditions are obtained by using NI LabVIEW 2019. The drive cycle of the electric vehicle (EV) test rig is controlled by Sync sols’ EV lab software. Obtaining the weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration from running the test setup, it is compared with the ISO 2631-1 standard to obtain the rider comfort. Results Loading area, traction motor, base mount, and suspension were found to be the strategic points of vibration. Frequency weighted RMS acceleration of 0.3 to 0.4 m/s2 obtained at these points are prone to cause discomfort for the rider. Vehicle speed, road profile, and duration of exposure were found to be important parameters affecting the rider’s comfort. A maximum of 4.6 m/s2 amplitude was observed. The loading area, which corresponds to a rider’s seat in actual vehicle, is important and reduction of these vibrations make the ride comfortable for the rider. Suspension and base mount of the test rig are found to be uncomfortable observing the weighted RMS acceleration. Conclusions A suitable damping technique design is very much essential in reducing these vibrations and improve the rider comfort, as many more non-deterministic vibrations are prone to cause dis-comfort in case of actual on road riding conditions.

                Background The emergence of antifungal resistance in fungal pathogens highlights the need for local epidemiological data to guide empirical therapy in clinical settings. Fungal research and anti-fungal drug resistance studies are limited in developing countries; hence, there is a need for burden estimation in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the spectrum of fungal pathogens and the anti-fungal resistance profile of fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urinary tracts of prison inmates in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in which sputum and urine samples were obtained from inmates presenting with symptoms of respiratory and urogenital infections at a prison outpatient clinic. One hundred and sixty-two samples were collected and subjected to fungal investigation using standard protocols. Susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole was assessed using standard broth microdilution. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Results From the 162, 94 samples were positive for fungal pathogens, with an overall prevalence of 58%. Seventeen (18%) of the isolated fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Histoplasma. There was a statistically significant difference between fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urogenital tracts in both sexes (p<0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing against itraconazole showed 2 of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus were resistant. Conclusion Mycological agents are significant causes of respiratory and UTI infections among prison inmates, which could be attributed to prison conditions and misdiagnosis as bacterial infections. This highlights the need for specific control measures to reduce exposure to fungal infections in prisons and in the general population.

                <p>Experimental evidence showed that an increase in intracellular chloride concentration <f></f> caused by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) input can promote epileptic firing activity, but the actual mechanisms remain elusive. Here in this theoretical work, we show that influx of chloride and concomitant bicarbonate ion <f></f> efflux upon GABA receptor activation can induce epileptic firing activity by transition of GABA from inhibition to excitation. We analyzed the intrinsic property of neuron firing states as a function of <f></f>. We found that as <f></f> increases, the system exhibits a saddle&ndash;node bifurcation, above which the neuron exhibits a spectrum of intensive firing, periodic bursting interrupted by depolarization block (DB) state, and eventually a stable DB through a Hopf bifurcation. We demonstrate that only GABA stimuli together with <f></f> efflux can switch GABA's effect to excitation which leads to a series of seizure-like events (SLEs). Exposure to a low <f></f> can drive neurons with high concentrations of <f></f> downward to lower levels of <f></f>, during which it could also trigger SLEs depending on the exchange rate with the bath. Our analysis and simulation results show how the competition between GABA stimuli-induced accumulation of <f></f> and <f></f> application-induced decrease of <f></f> regulates the neuron firing activity, which helps to understand the fundamental ionic dynamics of SLE.</p>

                <p>Aggression involves both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions. How the brain implements these two types of actions is poorly understood. We found that in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, a set of neurons, which we call CL062, previously shown to mediate male aggression also mediate female aggression. These neurons elicit aggression acutely and without the presence of a target. Although the same set of actions is elicited in males and females, the overall behavior is sexually dimorphic. The CL062 neurons do not express <I>fruitless</I>, a gene required for sexual dimorphism in flies, and expressed by most other neurons important for controlling fly aggression. Connectomic analysis in a female electron microscopy dataset suggests that these neurons have limited connections with <I>fruitless</I> expressing neurons that have been shown to be important for aggression and signal to different descending neurons. Thus, CL062 is part of a monomorphic circuit for aggression that functions parallel to the known dimorphic circuits.</p>

                <p>Odor information arrives first in the main olfactory bulb and is then broadcasted to the olfactory cortices and striatum. Downstream regions have unique cellular and connectivity architectures that may generate different coding patterns to the same odors. To reveal region-specific response features, tuning and decoding of single-unit populations, we recorded responses to the same odors under the same conditions across regions, namely, the main olfactory bulb (MOB), the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the anterior piriform cortex (aPC), and the olfactory tubercle of the ventral striatum (OT), of awake male mice. We focused on chemically closely related aldehydes that still create distinct percepts. The MOB had the highest decoding accuracy for aldehydes and was the only region encoding chemical similarity. The MOB had the highest fraction of inhibited responses and narrowly tuned odor-excited responses in terms of timing and odor selectivity. Downstream, the interconnected AON and aPC differed in their response patterns to the same stimuli. While odor-excited responses dominated the AON, the aPC had a comparably high fraction of odor-inhibited responses. Both cortices share a main output target that is the MOB. This prompted us to test if the two regions convey also different net outputs. Aldehydes activated AON terminals in the MOB as a bulk signal but inhibited those from the aPC. The differential cortical projection responses generalized to complex odors. In summary, olfactory regions reveal specialized features in their encoding with AON and aPC differing in their local computations, thereby generating inverse net centrifugal and intercortical outputs.</p>

                <p>Harmonics are an integral part of music, speech, and vocalizations of animals. Since the rest of the auditory environment is primarily made up of nonharmonic sounds, the auditory system needs to perceptually separate the above two kinds of sounds. In mice, harmonics, generally with two-tone components (two-tone harmonic complexes, TTHCs), form an important component of vocal communication. Communication by pups during isolation from the mother and by adult males during courtship elicits typical behaviors in female mice&mdash;dams and adult courting females, respectively. Our study shows that the processing of TTHC is specialized in mice providing neural basis for perceptual differences between tones and TTHCs and also nonharmonic sounds. Investigation of responses in the primary auditory cortex (Au1) from in vivo extracellular recordings and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to TTHCs exhibit enhancement, suppression, or no-effect with respect to tones. Irrespective of neuron type, harmonic enhancement is maximized, and suppression is minimized when the fundamental frequencies (<I>F</I><SUB>0</SUB>) match the neuron's best fundamental frequency (BF<SUB>0</SUB>). Sex-specific processing of TTHC is evident from differences in the distributions of neurons&rsquo; best frequency (BF) and best fundamental frequency (BF<SUB>0</SUB>) in single units, differences in harmonic suppressed cases re-BF<SUB>0</SUB>, independent of neuron types, and from pairwise noise correlations among excitatory and parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons. Furthermore, TTHCs elicit a higher response compared with two-tone nonharmonics in females, but not in males. Thus, our study shows specialized neural processing of TTHCs over tones and nonharmonics, highlighting local network specialization among different neuronal types.</p>

                <p>It is well established that holding information in working memory (WM) elicits sustained stimulus-specific patterns of neural activity. Nevertheless, here we provide evidence for a distinct class of neural activity that tracks the number of individuated items in working memory, independent of the type of visual features stored. We present two EEG studies of young adults of both sexes that provide robust evidence for a signal tracking the number of individuated representations in working memory, regardless of the specific feature values stored. In Study 1, subjects maintained either colors or orientations across separate blocks in a single session. We found near-perfect generalization of the load signal between these two conditions, despite being able to simultaneously decode which feature had been voluntarily stored. In Study 2, participants attended to two features with very distinct cortical representations: color and motion coherence. We again found evidence for a neural load signal that robustly generalized across these distinct visual features, even though cortically disparate regions process color and motion coherence. Moreover, representational similarity analysis provided converging evidence for a content-independent load signal, while simultaneously showing that unique variance in EEG activity tracked the specific features that were stored. We posit that this load signal reflects a content-independent "pointer" operation that binds objects to the current context while parallel but distinct neural signals represent the features that are stored for each item in memory.</p>

                <p>In demanding listening situations, a listener's motivational state may affect their cognitive investment. Here, we aim to delineate how domain-specific sensory processing, domain-general neural alpha power, and pupil size as a proxy for cognitive investment encode influences of motivational state under demanding listening. Participants (male and female) performed an auditory gap-detection task while the pupil size and the magnetoencephalogram were simultaneously recorded. Task demand and a listener's motivational state were orthogonally manipulated through changes in gap duration and monetary-reward prospect, respectively. Whereas task difficulty impaired performance, reward prospect enhanced it. The pupil size reliably indicated the modulatory impact of an individual's motivational state. At the neural level, the motivational state did not affect auditory sensory processing directly but impacted attentional postprocessing of an auditory event as reflected in the late evoked-response field and alpha-power change. Both pregap pupil dilation and higher parietal alpha power predicted better performance at the single-trial level. The current data support a framework wherein the motivational state acts as an attentional top&ndash;down neural means of postprocessing the auditory input in challenging listening situations.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus receives a direct projection from retinal ganglion cells. In primates, it remains unknown if the same ganglion cells also supply the lateral geniculate nucleus. To address this issue, a double-label experiment was performed in two male macaques. The animals fixated a target while injection sites were scouted in the superior colliculus by recording and stimulating with a tetrode. Once suitable sites were identified, cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 488 was injected via an adjacent micropipette. In a subsequent acute experiment, cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 555 was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus at matching retinotopic locations. After a brief survival period, ganglion cells were examined in retinal flatmounts. The percentage of double-labeled cells varied locally, depending on the relative efficiency of retrograde transport by each tracer and the precision of retinotopic overlap of injection sites in each target nucleus. In counting boxes with extensive overlap, 76&ndash;98% of ganglion cells projecting to the superior colliculus were double labeled. Cells projecting to the superior colliculus constituted 4.0&ndash;6.7% of the labeled ganglion cell population. In one particularly large zone, there were 5,746 cells labeled only by CTB-AF555, 561cells double labeled by CTB-AF555 and CTB-AF488, but no cell labeled only by CTB-AF488. These data indicate that retinal input to the macaque superior colliculus arises from a collateral axonal branch supplied by ~5% of the ganglion cells that project to the lateral geniculate nucleus. Surprisingly, there exist no ganglion cells that project exclusively to the SC.</p>

                <p>Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) have been repeatedly implicated in neuropsychiatric vulnerability, in part via their roles in mediating the decision-making processes. Although two neuromodulators share a synthesis pathway and are coactivated under states of arousal, they engage in distinct circuits and modulatory roles. However, the specific role of each neuromodulator in decision-making, in particular the exploration&ndash;exploitation tradeoff, remains unclear. Revealing how each neuromodulator contributes to exploration&ndash;exploitation tradeoff is important in guiding mechanistic hypotheses emerging from computational psychiatric approaches. To understand the differences and overlaps of the roles of these two catecholamine systems in regulating exploration, a direct comparison using the same dynamic decision-making task is needed. Here, we ran male and female mice in a restless two-armed bandit task, which encourages both exploration and exploitation. We systemically administered a nonselective DA antagonist (flupenthixol), a nonselective DA agonist (apomorphine), a NE beta-receptor antagonist (propranolol), and a NE beta-receptor agonist (isoproterenol) and examined changes in exploration within subjects across sessions. We found a bidirectional modulatory effect of dopamine on exploration. Increasing dopamine activity decreased exploration and decreasing dopamine activity increased exploration. The modulatory effect of beta-noradrenergic receptor activity on exploration was mediated by sex. Reinforcement learning model parameters suggested that dopamine modulation affected exploration via decision noise and norepinephrine modulation affected exploration via sensitivity to outcome. Together, these findings suggested that the mechanisms that govern the exploration&ndash;exploitation transition are sensitive to changes in both catecholamine functions and revealed differential roles for NE and DA in mediating exploration.</p>

                <p>The capabilities of the human ear are remarkable. We can normally detect acoustic stimuli down to a threshold sound-pressure level of 0&nbsp;dB (decibels) at the entrance to the external ear, which elicits eardrum vibrations in the picometer range. From this threshold up to the onset of pain, 120&nbsp;dB, our ears can encompass sounds that differ in power by a trillionfold. The comprehension of speech and enjoyment of music result from our ability to distinguish between tones that differ in frequency by only 0.2%. All these capabilities vanish upon damage to the ear's receptors, the mechanoreceptive sensory hair cells. Each cochlea, the auditory organ of the inner ear, contains some 16,000 such cells that are frequency-tuned between ~20&nbsp;Hz (cycles per second) and 20,000&nbsp;Hz. Remarkably enough, hair cells do not simply capture sound energy: they can also exhibit an active process whereby sound signals are amplified, tuned, and scaled. This article describes the active process in detail and offers evidence that its striking features emerge from the operation of hair cells on the brink of an oscillatory instability&mdash;one example of the critical phenomena that are widespread in physics.</p>

                <p>Neuroinflammation can positively influence axon regeneration following injury in the central nervous system. Inflammation promotes the release of neurotrophic molecules and stimulates intrinsic proregenerative molecular machinery in neurons, but the detailed mechanisms driving this effect are not fully understood. We evaluated how microRNAs are regulated in retinal neurons in response to intraocular inflammation to identify their potential role in axon regeneration. We found that miR-383-5p is downregulated in retinal ganglion cells in response to zymosan-induced intraocular inflammation. MiR-383-5p downregulation in neurons is sufficient to promote axon growth in vitro, and the intravitreal injection of a miR-383-5p inhibitor into the eye promotes axon regeneration following optic nerve crush. MiR-383-5p directly targets ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor components, and miR-383-5p inhibition sensitizes adult retinal neurons to the outgrowth-promoting effects of CNTF. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that CNTF treatment is sufficient to reduce miR-383-5p levels in neurons, constituting a positive-feedback module, whereby initial CNTF treatment reduces miR-383-5p levels, which then disinhibits CNTF receptor components to sensitize neurons to the ligand. Additionally, miR-383-5p inhibition derepresses the mitochondrial antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin-3 (PRDX3) which was required for the proregenerative effects associated with miR-383-5p loss-of-function in vitro. We have thus identified a positive-feedback mechanism that facilitates neuronal CNTF sensitivity in neurons and a new molecular signaling module that promotes inflammation-induced axon regeneration.</p>

                <p>GABAergic inhibitory interneurons comprise many subtypes that differ in their molecular, anatomical, and functional properties. In mouse visual cortex, they also differ in their modulation with an animal&rsquo;s behavioral state, and this state modulation can be predicted from the first principal component (PC) of the gene expression matrix. Here, we ask whether this link between transcriptome and state-dependent processing generalizes across species. To this end, we analysed seven single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets from mouse, human, songbird, and turtle forebrains. Despite homology at the level of cell types, we found clear differences between transcriptomic PCs, with greater dissimilarities between evolutionarily distant species. These dissimilarities arise from two factors: divergence in gene expression within homologous cell types and divergence in cell-type abundance. We also compare the expression of cholinergic receptors, which are thought to causally link transcriptome and state modulation. Several cholinergic receptors predictive of state modulation in mouse interneurons are differentially expressed between species. Circuit modelling and mathematical analyses suggest conditions under which these expression differences could translate into functional differences.</p>

                <p>Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel technique for noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). TUS delivered in a theta (5&nbsp;Hz) burst pattern (tbTUS) induces plasticity in the human primary motor cortex (M1) for 30&ndash;60&nbsp;min, showing promise for therapeutic development. Metaplasticity refers to activity-dependent changes in neural functions governing synaptic plasticity; depotentiation is the reversal of long-term potentiation (LTP) by a subsequent protocol with no effect alone. Metaplasticity can enhance plasticity induction and clinical efficacy of NIBS protocols. In our study, we compared four NIBS protocol combinations to investigate metaplasticity on tbTUS in humans of either sex. We delivered four interventions: (1) sham continuous theta burst stimulation with 150 pulses (cTBS150) followed by real tbTUS (tbTUS only), (2) real cTBS150 followed by sham tbTUS (cTBS only), (3) real cTBS150 followed by real tbTUS (metaplasticity), and (4) real tbTUS followed by real cTBS150 (depotentiation). We measured motor-evoked potential amplitude, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-interval intracortical facilitation before and up to 90&nbsp;min after plasticity intervention. Plasticity effects lasted at least 60&nbsp;min longer when tbTUS was primed with cTBS150 compared with tbTUS alone. Plasticity was abolished when cTBS150 was delivered after tbTUS. cTBS150 alone had no significant effect. No changes in M1 intracortical circuits were observed. Plasticity induction by tbTUS can be modified in manners consistent with homeostatic metaplasticity and depotentiation. This substantiates evidence that tbTUS induces LTP-like processes and suggests that metaplasticity can be harnessed in the therapeutic development of TUS.</p>

                Introduction Pediatric meningiomas are rare tumors originating from the meninges’ arachnoid cap cells, representing a small fraction of all meningiomas. The clinical presentation of pediatric meningiomas varies widely depending on their location within the central nervous system. We report a case of pediatric spinal meningioma revealed by gait disturbance. We emphasize clinical and imaging features, as well as therapeutic management of spinal meningiomas. Case presentation We present the case of a 15-year-old boy with a one-year history of chronic thoracic back pain, worsening gait disturbances, and difficulty walking. Neurological examination revealed a spastic gait with increased muscle tone and bilateral pyramidal syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a posterior intradural extramedullary mass at the T6-T7 level, causing dorsal spinal cord compression. The patient underwent complete resection of the tumor, and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a WHO grade I psammomatous spinal meningioma. Conclusion This case highlights the clinical and imaging characteristics of spinal meningiomas in pediatric patients. MRI remains the gold standard for diagnostic imaging, effectively narrowing down differential diagnoses. However, a definitive diagnosis requires histological examination. The primary therapeutic approach for pediatric meningiomas is surgical resection.

                The utilization of zein and gum arabic has grown in an attempt to formulate wall materials based on protein–polysaccharide complexes. This mixture provides a versatile delivery system for hydrophilic (guava leaf extract, GLE) or lipophilic (fish oil, FO) bioactive compounds, and it can be used as an edible film-forming polymer. This study was undertaken to characterize FO-containing edible films that were double-layered with a film containing GLE. Modified zein and gum arabic solutions (MG complex) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1.5 (v/v), adjusted to pH 5, added with glycerol (20% of the complex) and FO (5% of the complex), and finally adjusted to pH 5. This was prepared as the bottom/lower layer. The upper/active layer was prepared by mixing MG complex, glycerol, and GLE (1, 3, and 5% w/v of the complex). The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in GLE were 15.81 mg GAE/g extract and 6.99 mg QE/g extract, respectively. The IC50 of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of GLE was 26.86 ppm with antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli of 9.83 and 12.55 mm. The total plate counts of double-layered films containing GLE were retained below 3 log CFU/g during 28-day storage. The peroxide values of these films were dimmed for no more than 9.08 meq/kg sample on day 28 of storage. Thickness (872.00-971.67 μm), water vapor transmission rate (12.99-17.04 g/m2/day), tensile strength (1.56-2.02 kPa), elongation at break (61.53-75.41%), glass transition (52.74-57.50°C), melting peak (131.59-142.35°C), inhibition against B. subtilis (33.67-40.58 mm), and inhibition against E. coli (2.05-9.04 mm) were obtained by double-layered films. GLE can be successfully incorporated into the active layer of a double-layer film to improve its characteristics while significantly slowing down the microbial contamination and oxidation rate. MG complex and FO can also contribute to the performance of the edible film.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-106/v3?src=rss">Comparison of the efficacy of aescin and diclofenac sodium in the management of postoperative sequelae and their effect on salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels after surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar: a randomize</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Surgical removal of an impacted third molar is one of the most common oral surgical procedures performed in dental offices. The postoperative phase is often associated with severe inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed to manage postoperative discomfort. NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function disturbances, and platelet count reductions. Thus, the present study demonstrates the utility of aescin in managing postoperative discomfort after the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. This study aimed to correlate and compare the impact of aescin and diclofenac on salivary PGE2 levels and serum C-reactive protein levels after surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar. The study will also evaluate and compare the effectiveness of individual drug therapy in managing postoperative pain, swelling and mouth opening. Methods The planned study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, prospective clinical trial. Each patient will be prescribed either diclofenac sodium 150 mg/day or aescin (escin) 120 mg/day to be taken orally in divided doses for five days after surgically removing the impacted mandibular third molar. Pain will be assessed using a visual analog scale. Facial swelling and mouth opening will be recorded using a metric scale with standardized reference points. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be employed to measure salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels. All parameters will be recorded preoperatively (T0) on the second postoperative day (T1) and fifth postoperative day (T2). Conclusion The proposed study is expected to show a clinically acceptable response to the administration of aescin for the management of postoperative discomfort compared to diclofenac sodium after third molar surgery. The proposed study is expected to positively manipulate the levels of salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein, which are reliable inflammatory markers. The outcome of this study may provide an efficacious and safe alternative to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for managing postoperative discomfort following third molar surgery.

                Background Faith and belief systems impact the emotional as well as immunological states of believers in ways that we are just beginning to understand. However, the clinical implications of prior studies are limited. The aim of the HEALING (Hospital-based Ecumenical and Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) study is to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized patients after meeting with a chaplain coupled with the study of biblical readings. Methods Hospitalized patients were pre-screened to identify those who were most in need of a spiritual intervention. A passage from the Bible was read to them during a meeting with the chaplain at bedside (n = 20) or in the chapel (n = 18). No meeting occurred in the randomized control group (n = 19). Blood samples were obtained 30 min prior and 60 min after the meeting to measure white blood cell (WBC) count, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, IgG, and complement 3 (C3). A subgroup of the visited patients was subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), during which they listened to an audiotape of readings of the same biblical passage (n = 21). Results Immunological changes were not significant. Conversely, a significant (pfwe = 0.003) correlation was observed between lymphocyte changes and activation of the angular gyrus (left BA39) during fMRI, a brain area involved in word recognition. Conclusions This article contributes to the relevant literature by helping to create a realistic picture of the possibilities of neuroimmune modulation in clinical practice. Compared to healthy volunteers, the extent of short-term neuroimmunomodulation becomes narrower in a clinical setting. Although limited by the sample size and cohort study design, the findings suggest that the depth of psycho-immunological changes could depend on the degree to which the chaplain’s main message is understood.

                Occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is a rare genetic disease and copper transport disorder caused by a faulty ATP7A gene with multisystemic presentations, most originally related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue affections. In our case, a male neonate with OHS presented soon after birth with pathognomonic occipital exostosis, cutis laxa at the nape region, and widely opened skull sutures and fontanels. A skeletal survey showed occipital exostosis projecting from the line of insertion of the trapezius muscle and wide fontanels on skull X-ray films with no exostoses or deformities elsewhere. In addition to our case report being the second reported case for the condition detected early in the neonatal period, it also emphasizes the importance of investigating any sign thoroughly, as it may be an early alarming sign of a progressive disease that may affect the patient’s quality of life. In addition, it highlights the value of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of these patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-935/v2?src=rss">Data on selfـــefficacy  and its sources during the COVID-19 crisis:  A Saudi auditor’s perspective [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Auditors during COVID-19 experienced an unprecedented situation, in which normal audit activities were difficult to conduct. Moreover, COVID-19 forced auditors to introduce a new audit approach, “remote auditing,” which was not common in most audit firms and required the adoption of more advanced technologies. Overall, auditors during the COVID-19 pandemic needed both cognitive and technical factors to deliver high-quality audits. Despite these challenges, research on how auditors deal with these issues is limited, presenting an intriguing area of study. Methods This dataset provides insights into Saudi auditors’ experience and beliefs regarding audit activities during COVID-19. Through an online survey, researchers collected data from 193 of 417 registered auditors with the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). The survey assessed auditors’ self-efficacy in conducting audits during the pandemic and explored its sources and potential moderating factors. Specifically, the dataset includes responses to eight items related to self-efficacy, 19 items covering four common sources of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological/emotional states), and six items assessing virtual audit competency. Additionally, the dataset contains demographic information that is valuable for researchers analyzing the relationship between auditor self-efficacy, its sources, and other influencing factors. Conclusions Overall, the dataset included in this study may serve a broader audience and be useful in improving several stakeholders’ understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on auditors and how auditors assess their ability to adapt to COVID-19 consequences. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the need for auditors to adapt to new circumstances and adopt innovative approaches during challenging times, thereby ensuring the delivery of high-quality audits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1299/v1?src=rss">A causality investigation into stock prices and macroeconomic indicators in the Indian stock market [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

                <p>by Gaspard Oliviers, Rafal Bogacz, Alexander Meulemans</p>

It has been suggested that the brain employs probabilistic generative models to optimally interpret sensory information. This hypothesis has been formalised in distinct frameworks, focusing on explaining separate phenomena. On one hand, classic predictive coding theory proposed how the probabilistic models can be learned by networks of neurons employing local synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, neural sampling theories have demonstrated how stochastic dynamics enable neural circuits to represent the posterior distributions of latent states of the environment. These frameworks were brought together by variational filtering that introduced neural sampling to predictive coding. Here, we consider a variant of variational filtering for static inputs, to which we refer as Monte Carlo predictive coding (MCPC). We demonstrate that the integration of predictive coding with neural sampling results in a neural network that learns precise generative models using local computation and plasticity. The neural dynamics of MCPC infer the posterior distributions of the latent states in the presence of sensory inputs, and can generate likely inputs in their absence. Furthermore, MCPC captures the experimental observations on the variability of neural activity during perceptual tasks. By combining predictive coding and neural sampling, MCPC can account for both sets of neural data that previously had been explained by these individual frameworks.

                <p>by Alessio Andronico, Juliette Paireau, Simon Cauchemez</p>

Seasonal influenza causes significant annual morbidity and mortality worldwide. In France, it is estimated that, on average, 2 million individuals consult their GP for influenza-like-illness (ILI) every year. Traditionally, mathematical models used for epidemic forecasting can either include parameters capturing the infection process (mechanistic or compartmental models) or rely on time series analysis approaches that do not make mechanistic assumptions (statistical or phenomenological models). While the latter make extensive use of past epidemic data, mechanistic models are usually independently initialized in each season. As a result, forecasts from such models can contain trajectories that are vastly different from past epidemics. We developed a mechanistic model that takes into account epidemic data from training seasons when producing forecasts. The parameters of the model are estimated via a first particle filter running on the observed data. A second particle filter is then used to produce forecasts compatible with epidemic trajectories from the training set. The model was calibrated and tested on 35 years’ worth of surveillance data from the French Sentinelles Network, representing the weekly number of patients consulting for ILI over the period 1985–2019. Our results show that the new method improves upon standard mechanistic approaches. In particular, when retrospectively tested on the available data, our model provides increased accuracy for short-term forecasts (from one to four weeks into the future) and peak timing and intensity. Our new approach for epidemic forecasting allows the integration of key strengths of the statistical approach into the mechanistic modelling framework and represents an attempt to provide accurate forecasts by making full use of the rich surveillance dataset collected in France since 1985.

                <p>by Hannah Gordon, Zachary T. Schafer, Cody J. Smith</p>

The overproduction of cells and subsequent production of debris is a universal principle of neurodevelopment. Here, we show an additional feature of the developing nervous system that causes neural debris—promoted by the sacrificial nature of embryonic microglia that irreversibly become phagocytic after clearing other neural debris. Described as long-lived, microglia colonize the embryonic brain and persist into adulthood. Using transgenic zebrafish to investigate the microglia debris during brain construction, we identified that unlike other neural cell types that die in developmental stages after they have expanded, necroptosis-dependent microglial debris is prevalent when microglia are expanding in the zebrafish brain. Time-lapse imaging of microglia demonstrates that this debris is cannibalized by other microglia. To investigate features that promote microglia death and cannibalism, we used time-lapse imaging and fate-mapping strategies to track the lifespan of individual developmental microglia. These approaches revealed that instead of embryonic microglia being long-lived cells that completely digest their phagocytic debris, once most developmental microglia in zebrafish become phagocytic they eventually die, including ones that are cannibalistic. These results establish a paradox—which we tested by increasing neural debris and manipulating phagocytosis—that once most microglia in the embryo become phagocytic, they die, create debris, and then are cannibalized by other microglia, resulting in more phagocytic microglia that are destined to die.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27125?af=R">Association of Seizure Control with Mortality, Cognition, and Function in People With Dementia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The effects of seizure control on outcomes in persons with dementia (PWD) remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of seizure control on mortality, function, cognition, and mood among PWD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This longitudinal, multicenter study is based on 39 Alzheimer's disease centers (ADCs) in the United States from September 2005 to December 2021. PWD were grouped by seizure status into recurrent (seizures in the past year), remote (prior seizures but none in the past year), and no seizures (controls). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality among seizure groups. We used Weibull survival analysis to assess the mortality risks by seizure status after adjusting for age, sex, education, race, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, degree of cognitive impairment, dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation, brain trauma, stroke, Parkinson's disease, alcohol abuse, and depression. Cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating), function (physical dependence and nursing home residence), day-to-day activities (Functional Assessment Scores), and mood (Geriatric Depression Scale) were compared among seizure groups after adjusting for dementia duration and age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 26,501 participants, 374 (1.4%) had recurrent seizures and 510 (1.9%) had remote seizures. In multivariable survival analysis, recurrent seizures were associated with a higher mortality risk than remote and no seizures (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]; recurrent aHR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.51 to 2.12; remote aHR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.38). Median time-to-death for recurrent, remote, and no seizures was 2.4, 4.0, and 4.7 years, respectively. People with recurrent seizures had worse cognition, day-to-day function, and physical dependence than those with remote seizures and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PWD with poorly controlled recurrent seizures have worse mortality, functional, and cognitive outcomes than PWD with remote and no seizures. These findings underscore the need for timely identification and management of ongoing seizures in PWD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

An exploration using a novel, value-based, publication metric framework: the EMPIRE Index [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not app</a></h4>

              
                Background The EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index is a value-based, multi-component metric framework to assess the impact of medical publications in terms of relevance to different stakeholders. It comprises three component scores (social, scholarly and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics that indicate a different aspect of engagement with the publication. Here, we present an exploratory investigation of whether publication types or disease indications influence EMPIRE Index scores. Methods Article-level metrics were extracted and EMPIRE Index scores were calculated for 5825 journal articles published from 1 May 2017 to 1 May 2018, representing 12 disease indications (chosen to reflect a wide variety of common and rare diseases with a variety of aetiologies) and five publication types. Results There were significant differences in scores between article types and disease indications. Median (95% CI) social and scholarly impact scores ranged from 1.2 (0.3–1.6) to 4.8 (3.1–6.6), respectively, for phase 3 clinical trials, and from 0.3 (0.3–0.4) to 2.3 (1.9–2.6), respectively, for observational studies. Social and scholarly impact scores were highest for multiple sclerosis publications and lowest for non-small cell lung cancer publications. Systematic reviews achieved greater impact than regular reviews. Median trends in the social impact of different disease areas matched the level of public interest as assessed through Google search interest. Although most articles did not register societal impact, mean societal impact scores were highest for migraine publications. Conclusions The EMPIRE Index successfully identified differences in impact by disease area and publication type, which supports the notion that the impact of each publication needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors, and potentially others. These findings should be considered when using the EMPIRE Index to assess publication impact.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the effects of directional subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-dDBS) on gait and balance disorders, including freezing of gait (FOG), in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 10 participants who underwent STN-DBS and presented severe preoperative FOG, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. We used segmented DBS electrodes to investigate whether directing the predicted volume of tissue activated (VTA) to overlap the central STN preferentially improved gait and balance disorders compared to directional DBS applied in the more posterior STN (sensorimotor). We also assessed non-directional (ring-mode) STN-DBS. Our primary outcome was gait and balance control measured using instrumented gait recordings. Each patient had a pre-operative structural and diffusion-weighted imaging to model individual VTAs and to examine cortico-subthalamic connectivity. We used linear mixed-effects models to contrast the effects of central STN-dDBS, posterior STN-dDBS, and ring-mode STN-DBS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Central STN-dDBS produced significantly better improvement in gait and balance control compared to posterior STN-dDBS (<i>p</i> = 0.027), with fewer FOG episodes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, ring-mode STN-DBS resulted in worsened postural control compared to central STN-dDBS (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The cortico-subthalamic connectivity with the STN VTAs involved mostly primary sensorimotor, premotor, and medial frontal cortices, with a higher overall cortico-STN connectivity with ring-mode STN-DBS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Central STN-dDBS represents the best option to improve gait and balance disorders in PD patients, including FOG. Our findings raise the possibility of reprogramming STN-DBS toward the central area in selected patients with disabling FOG and/or postural instability after surgery.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its associated pathology have been primarily identified in humans, who have relatively large brains and long lifespans. To expand what is known about aging and neurodegeneration across mammalian species, we characterized amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau lesions in five species of aged felids (<i>n</i> = 9; cheetah, clouded leopard, African lion, serval, Siberian tiger). We performed immunohistochemistry to detect Aβ40 and Aβ42 in plaques and vessels and hyperphosphorylated tau in the temporal lobe gyrus sylvius and in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. We also quantified the densities and morphological types of microglia expressing IBA1. We found that diffuse Aβ42 plaques, but not dense-core plaques, were present more frequently in the temporal cortex and tended to be more common than Aβ40 plaques across species. Conversely, vascular Aβ was labeled more consistently with Aβ40 for each species on average. Although all individuals showed some degree of Aβ40 and/or Aβ42 immunoreactivity, only the cheetahs and clouded leopards exhibited intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated tau (i.e., pretangles), which was more common in the hippocampus. Reactive, intermediate microglia were significantly associated with total Aβ40 vessel area and pretangle load in the hippocampus. This study demonstrates the co-occurrence of Aβ and tau pathology in two felid species, cheetahs and clouded leopards. Overall, these results provide an initial view of the manifestation of Aβ and tau pathology in aged, large-brained felids, which can be compared with markers of neurodegeneration across different taxa, including domestic cats, nonhuman primates, and humans.</p>

                Yan et al. find that SARS-CoV-2 with the spike-E484D substitution can infect cells without the ACE2 receptor, relying instead on TMEM106B and heparan sulfate. However, ACE2-independent infection is only observed in cell cultures and does not occur in mice, indicating that this mutation is unlikely to substantially increase disease severity.

                Zhang et al. introduce a brain-to-text framework for decoding Mandarin sentences from intracranial neural recordings. This approach combines multi-stream deep neural network decoders with a language model, addressing challenges from syllabic structures and tonal variances in naturalistic Mandarin speech and demonstrating the feasibility of speech brain-computer interfaces for tonal languages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93115">Intraspecific predator interference promotes biodiversity in ecosystems</a></h4>

              
                Explaining biodiversity is a fundamental issue in ecology. A long-standing puzzle lies in the paradox of the plankton: many species of plankton feeding on a limited variety of resources coexist, apparently flouting the competitive exclusion principle (CEP), which holds that the number of predator (consumer) species cannot exceed that of the resources at a steady state. Here, we present a mechanistic model and demonstrate that intraspecific interference among the consumers enables a plethora of consumer species to coexist at constant population densities with only one or a handful of resource species. This facilitated biodiversity is resistant to stochasticity, either with the stochastic simulation algorithm or individual-based modeling. Our model naturally explains the classical experiments that invalidate the CEP, quantitatively illustrates the universal S-shaped pattern of the rank-abundance curves across a wide range of ecological communities, and can be broadly used to resolve the mystery of biodiversity in many natural ecosystems.
