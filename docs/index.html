	<p>Background: Cognitive impairment poses a significant global health challenge, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and intervention. Traditional diagnostics like neuroimaging and clinical evaluations are often subjective, costly, and inaccessible, especially in resource-poor settings. Previous research has focused on speech analysis primarily conducted using English data, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. Methods: In this study, we present our results from the INTERSPEECH 2024 TAUKADIAL Challenge, where we aimed to automatically detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and predict cognitive scores for English and Chinese speakers (169 in total). Our approach leverages Whisper, a speech foundation model, to extract language-agnostic speech embeddings. We then utilize ensemble models to incorporate task-specific information. Results: Our model achieved unweighted average recall of 81.83% in an MCI classification task, and root mean squared error of 1.196 in cognitive score prediction task, which placed the model at the second and the first position, respectively, in the ranking for each task. Comparison between language-agnostic and language-specific models reveals the importance of capturing language-specific nuances for accurate cognitive impairment prediction. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of language-specific ensemble modeling with Whisper embeddings in enabling scalable, non-invasive cognitive health assessments of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, achieving state-of-the-art results in multilingual settings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent studies have investigated the effects of ketamine on fear memory in animals. However, it is unclear if ketamine might affect avoidance memory and emotional behaviors concomitantly. In this study, we compared the effects of (R,S)- and (S)-ketamine in modulating avoidance responses, and depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in stressed mice. Methods: Mice were previously exposed to inescapable footshock stress, and 24 h later, they were trained in the active avoidance task. (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-isomer was administered 1 h prior to re-exposition to the active avoidance task. Three hours after drug administration, mice were tested in the tail suspension, followed by the open field test. Results: Neither form of ketamine affected avoidance memory retrieval, while (S)-ketamine, and tangentially, (R,S) reduced avoidance responses during re-exposition to aversive stimulus. In the tail suspension test, (R,S)- and (S)-ketamine equally evoked antidepressant effects. In the open field test, the racemic mixture, but not (S)-ketamine, induced anxiolytic actions. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the therapeutic potential of ketamine for the treatment of stress-related disorders, with (R,S)-ketamine being more effective in simultaneously inducing antidepressant and anxiolytic responses and reducing avoidance responses in stressed mice.</p>

<p>This paper provides a personal history of work starting with the discovery that anxiolytic drugs reduce hippocampal theta frequency. It includes parallel work on septal elicitation of theta carried out in Jeffrey Gray's laboratory in Oxford; a statement of my original scientific perspective on the work; and a description of later work in my laboratory in New Zealand confirming the function of theta rhythmicity per se and its mediation of the effects of anxiolytic drugs on behavior. I finish with comments on risk management with such experiments and their use in larger scale theory development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23670?af=R">The Discovery of Head Direction Cells: A Personal Account</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This article is my recollection of events surrounding the discovery of head direction (HD) cells by Jim Ranck in 1984 and the first journal publications 6 years later. Ranck first described the fundamental properties of HD cells qualitatively in a <i>Society for Neuroscience</i> abstract (1984) and in the proceedings to a conference. Ranck, however, was convinced by Bob Muller, a faculty colleague in the lab, to delay writing up Jim's discovery until they developed a two-spot video tracking system, which would enable proper quantitative analyses. The development of this system was complex and was still undergoing development when I arrived in the Brooklyn lab in 1986. By this time, Jim had begun to refocus his efforts on thinking about the relationship between space and manifolds and was no longer engaged in active research. It thus befell me (unintentionally) to complete the recordings of these fascinating cells. This endeavor involved recording additional HD cells with the new video tracking system, monitoring the cells' responses following a series of environmental manipulations, and performing quantitative analyses on the data. Throughout 1987, I recorded most of the cells that would form the basis for our 1990 papers published in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>. Along the way, there were many events and emotions: luck, excitement, humor, frustration, tutorials, unintended outcomes, and long-lasting friendships. I was guided and supported during this time by both Bob Muller and John Kubie, but remain forever grateful to Jim for this wonderful opportunity.</p>

                Poluben et al. show that prostate cancer cell resistance to an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist targeting the full-length AR (ARfl) is driven by an AR spice variant (ARv7) that functions independently of ARfl but requires adaptations associated with increased chromatin accessibility and is dependent on nuclear factor I transcription factors.

                Jung et al. reveal that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released during proteasomal dysfunction activates the cGAS-STING pathway and is subsequently degraded via the DNA-PK-N-degron pathway. This process establishes a negative feedback loop that helps resolve sterile immune responses, preventing excessive inflammation.

">A modulatory attentional gate promotes recent memory expression in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Using short-term memory (STM) requires that animals can distinguish memories of recent experience from those learned previously. In Drosophila the neuromodulator octopamine (OA) specifically affects STM through adrenergic-like receptors within neurons in the Mushroom Body (MB) network. However, why OA preferentially impacts STM remains unclear. A fly brain connectome reveals that two OA-VPM3 neurons provide most OA input to the MB network. Artificial OA-VPM3 activation during olfactory learning enhances STM and can divert odor salience. -adrenergic- like receptor knock-down in MB {beta} and {gamma} lobe MB Output Neurons (MBONs) generally impaired STM, while {beta}-adrenergic-like receptor loss from  lobe MBONs enhanced memory. The identity and connectivity of the relevant MBONs suggests OA modulates an interaction between sites of STM and long-term memory (LTM) storage. Indeed, synthetic, odor, and learning-driven, OA-VPM3 activation temporarily blocks LTM expression. Therefore, OA reconfigures the MBON network so the fly prioritizes expression of recent over remote memories.

">The impact of musical expertise on disentangled and contextual neural encoding of music revealed by generative music models</a></h4>

              
                Music perception involves the intricate processing of individual notes and their contextual relationships within a piece. However, how the brain encodes and organizes these features, particularly in relation to musical expertise, remains unclear. Using noninvasive and invasive electrophysiological recordings alongside generative music models, we reveal that musicians exhibit neural encoding that is more attuned to the separation and integration of complex musical structures, with a pronounced left-hemispheric bias compared to non-musicians. Invasive recordings further highlight a hierarchical and spatially organized representation of musical features and context across brain regions. These findings advance our understanding of how the brain processes music and the role of musical training in shaping auditory cognition.

">Conversion of silent synapses to AMPA receptor-mediated functional synapses in human cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Despite the crucial role of synaptic connections and neural activity in the development and organization of cortical circuits, the mechanisms underlying the formation of functional synaptic connections in the developing human cerebral cortex remain unclear. We investigated the development of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission using human cortical organoids (hCOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Two-photon Ca2 imaging revealed an increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous activity in hCOs on day 80 compared to day 50. Additionally, spontaneous neural activity in late-stage hCOs, but not in early-stage hCOs, was blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and AMPAR antagonists. However, transsynaptic circuit tracing with G-deleted rabies viral vectors indicated a similar number of synaptic connections in early- and late-stage hCOs. Notably, chemical labeling demonstrated a significant increase in AMPAR expression on the postsynaptic membrane and colocalization with NMDAR in late-stage hCOs. These results suggest that hCOs progressively organize excitatory synaptic transmission, concurrent with the transition from silent synapses lacking AMPARs to functional synapses containing NMDARs and AMPARs. This in vitro model of human cortical circuits derived from induced pluripotent stem cells reflects the developmental programs underlying physiological transitions, providing valuable insights into human corticogenesis and neurodevelopmental disorders.

">A Vulnerable Subtype of Dopaminergic Neurons Drives Early Motor Deficits in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                In Parkinson's disease, dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the midbrain gradually degenerate, with ventral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DANs exhibiting greater vulnerability. However, it remains unclear whether specific molecular subtypes of ventral SNc DANs are more susceptible to degeneration in PD, and if they contribute to the early motor symptoms associated with the disease. We identified a subtype of Sox6+ DANs, Anxa1+, which are selectively lost earlier than other DANs, and with a time course that aligns with the development of motor symptoms in MitoPark mice. We generated a knock-in Cre mouse line for Anxa1+ DANs and showed differential anatomical inputs and outputs of this population. Further, we found that the inhibition of transmitter release in Anxa1+ neurons led to bradykinesia and tremor. This study uncovers the existence of a selectively vulnerable subtype of DANs that is sufficient to drive early motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.

">Mouse brain organoids model in vivo neurodevelopment and function and capture differences to human</a></h4>

              
                In the last decade since their emergence, brain organoids have offered an increasingly popular and powerful model for the study of early development and disease in humans. These 3D stem cell-derived models exist in a newer space at the intersection of in vivo and 2D in vitro models. Functional benchmarking has so far remained largely uncharacterised however, leaving the extent to which these models may accurately portray in vivo processes still yet to be fully realised. Here we present a standardised unguided protocol to generate brain organoids from mice, the most commonly-used in vivo mammalian model; and in parallel establish a guided protocol for generating region-specific choroid plexus mouse organoids. Both unguided and guided mouse organoids progress through neurodevelopmental stages with an in vivo-like tempo and recapitulate species-specific characteristics of neural and choroid plexus development, respectively. Neuroepithelial cells generate neural progenitors that give rise to different neural subtypes including deep-layer neurons, upper-layer neurons, and glial cells. We further adapted protocols to prolong mouse cerebral organoid (CO) cultures as slices at the air-liquid interface (ALI), enhancing accessibility for long-term studies and functional investigations. In mature mouse ALI-COs, we observed mature glia, as well as synaptic structures and long-range axon tracts projecting to distant regions, suggesting an establishment and maturation of neural circuitry. Indeed, functional analyses with high-density multi-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs) indicate comparable activity to ex vivo organotypic mouse brain slices. Having established protocols for both region-specific and unpatterned mouse brain organoids, we demonstrate that their neurodevelopmental trajectories, and resultant mature features, closely mimic the in vivo models to which they are benchmarked across multiple biochemical, morphological, and functional read-outs. We propose that mouse brain organoids are a valuable model for functional studies, and provide insight into how closely brain organoids of other species, such as human, may recapitulate their own respective in vivo development.

">The natural variability of a dexterous motor skill is stably encoded in the cortex of freely behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                The nervous system enables precise, skilled movements across diverse contexts, consistently performed day after day. However, the extent to which the brain's neural activity patterns are specific to each instance of a movement or behavior, and how similar these patterns are across days, remains unclear. To address this, we record calcium fluorescence activity in the motor cortex of freely moving mice performing a self-initiated, skilled reach-to-grasp task. The high trial counts and single-trial variability in this task allow for a rigorous statistical analysis of moment-to-moment movement encoding across matched behavioral sets over five days. We found that single neurons in motor cortex encode the single trial (reach-to-reach) details of paw, digit, and head movements, and this encoding is stable over days. This suggests that the stable contribution of individual cells in the motor circuit underlies the generation of skilled movements, even in complex sensory-driven tasks like reach-to-grasp.

">Spanning spatial scales with functional imaging in the human brain; initial experiences at 10.5 Tesla</a></h4>

              
                One of the most important new frontiers in the effort to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of imaging of human brain activity is the recent development of greater than 10 Tesla magnetic fields. Here we present initial results for 10.5 Tesla Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) based functional brain imaging (fMRI) of the human brain acquired with previously unavailable or difficult to attain spatial resolutions and functional contrast. We present data obtained with nominal isotropic resolutions ranging from 0.65 to 0.35 mm for partial brain coverage for stimulus evoked responses, and 0.75 mm for whole brain coverage to capture the spontaneous fluctuations that are the source of functional connectivity measures. The increasingly higher nominal resolutions (i.e. smaller voxel volumes and dimensions) employed in image acquisition were shown to correspond to real gains in resolution using image reconstruction methods developed to minimize blurring. Existence of supralinear gains in stimulus-evoked percent signal change and major improvements in statistical significance were evident relative to 7 Tesla, the most advanced commercially available ultrahigh magnetic field platform currently employed in human brain studies. These results were feasible due to gains in intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio, BOLD contrast, and image acceleration provided by the uniquely high magnetic field of 10.5 Tesla, and the use of novel high channel count arrays to capture these gains. The results provide a preview of the potential that will be available in the new era of greater than 10 Tesla human functional imaging, particularly for mesoscale functional organizations and connectivity.

">Energy efficiency and sensitivity benefits in a motion processing adaptive recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                Motion processing is a key function for the survival of many organisms and is initially implemented in areas V1 and MT of the primate visual cortex. Advances in machine learning approaches have led to the development of motion processing neural networks that have elucidated several aspects of this process. However, it remains unclear how adaptation, a canonical function of sensory processing, influences motion processing. In this study, we developed two recurrent neural networks to study motion processing: MotionNet-R, a baseline model, and AdaptNet, a model that employs adaptive mechanisms inspired by biological systems. Both networks were trained on natural image sequences to estimate motion vectors. We found that both networks developed response properties that resembled those of neurons found in areas V1 and MT, e.g., speed tuning, and AdaptNet recapitulated the motion aftereffect phenomenon (i.e., the waterfall illusion). We show that the emergent computational properties that implement the phenomenon in AdaptNet confirm previous theoretical hypotheses. Further, we compared the performance of the two networks and found that AdaptNet processed motion more efficiently, operationalized as reduced activation. While AdaptNet incurred reduced accuracy in response to prolonged constant input, it was both more accurate and sensitive in response to changes in motion input. These results are consistent with theoretical explanations of adaptation as neural property that supports metabolic efficiency and increased sensitivity to change in the environment. Our findings provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying motion adaptation and highlight the potential advantages of adaptive neural networks in modelling biological processes.

">Dynamic Grouping of Ongoing Activity in V1 Hypercolumns</a></h4>

              
                Neurons' spontaneous activity provides rich information about the brain. A single neuron's activity has close relationships with the local network. In order to understand such relationships, we studied the spontaneous activity of thousands of neurons in macaque V1 and V2 with two-photon calcium imaging. In V1, the ongoing activity was dominated by global fluctuations in which the activity of majority of neurons were correlated. Neurons' activity also relied on their relative locations within the local functional architectures, including ocular dominance, orientation, and color maps. Neurons with similar preferences dynamically grouped into co-activating ensembles and exhibited spatial patterns resembling the local functional maps. Different ensembles had different strengths and frequencies. This observation was consistent across all hypercolumn-sized V1 locations we examined. In V2, different imaging sites had different orientation and color features. However, the spontaneous activity in the sampled regions also correlated with the underlying functional architectures. These results indicate that functional architectures play an essential role in influencing neurons' spontaneous activity, and can be explained by a network model that integrates diverse horizontal connections among similar functional domains.

">In vivo changes in zebrafish anesthetic sensitivity in response to the loss of kif5Aa are associated with the alteration of mitochondrial motility</a></h4>

              
                Anesthetic and sedative drugs are small compounds known to bind to hundreds of proteins. One intriguing binding partner of propofol is the kinesin motor domain, kif5A, a neuronal mitochondrial transport protein. Here, we used zebrafish WT and kif5Aa KO larval behavioral assays to assess anesthetic sensitivity and combined that with zebrafish primary neuronal cell culture to probe for alteration in mitochondrial motility. We found that the loss of kif5Aa increases behavioral sensitivity to propofol and etomidate, with etomidate hypersensitivity greater than propofol. In contrast, kif5Aa KO animals were resistant to the behavioral effects of dexmedetomidine. Finally, WT and kif5Aa KO larvae responded similarly to the behavioral effects of ketamine. Propofol inhibited the anterograde motility of mitochondria in WT zebrafish neurons, while etomidate inhibited mitochondrial motility in both anterograde and retrograde directions; neither drug altered mitochondrial motility in the kif5Aa knockout (KO) neurons. In contrast, dexmedetomidine enhanced retrograde mitochondrial motility in both WT and kif5Aa KO animals. Finally, ketamine had little significant effect on mitochondrial motility in either mutant or WT animals. These data demonstrate that each anesthetic/sedative drug affects the motor protein machinery uniquely and is associated with unique changes in behavior. Understanding how different anesthetic compounds alter neuron motor proteins will be important in defining how anesthetics alter neuronal signaling and energetic dynamics.

">Dynamics of efficient ensemble coding</a></h4>

              
                Ensemble coding creates compressed representations of a stimulus array. When discriminating the ensemble average against a reference, however, items in the ensemble with feature values closer to the reference are typically weighed stronger. We have recently shown that this "robust averaging" behavior can be explained as a form of efficient coding, where the sensory encoding precision is dynamically adapted to efficiently represent ensemble stimuli according to their overall distribution relative to a trial-by-trial varying reference. However, the specific mechanisms underlying such dynamic, efficient ensemble coding remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the relative timing between the presentation of the reference and the stimulus ensemble strongly affects efficient ensemble coding. We systematically probed participants' decision behavior for varying time intervals between the presentation of the ensemble and the reference. We found that efficient ensemble coding was only clearly established when reference and ensemble were simultaneously presented. It was much weaker when the ensemble preceded the reference, and largely absent when the ensemble followed the reference. As captured by our model, reduced efficient ensemble coding thereby coincided with decreased decision accuracy in those asynchronous conditions. Our results indicate that any temporal offset between the ensemble and reference stimuli substantially disrupts the dynamic and efficient allocation of coding resource. This suggests that efficient ensemble coding is not the result of a preparatory attentional process nor due to evidence selection at the decision stage. Rather, it arises from a fast interaction between the simultaneously evoked, sensory representations of reference and ensemble stimuli.

">Photoreceptor cell death mechanism in light damage</a></h4>

              
                Light is one of the most ambient agents harmful to the retina. In Wistar rats prolonged exposure to 200 lux of LED light promotes photoreceptors cells death after 6 days. The possibility to know the cell photoreceptors death mechanism increases the likelihood to find a mixture of therapy with inhibitors or antagonists with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. This study tested the cell death mechanism to elucidate the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Adult male rats were exposed to 200 lux of LED light by different periods of constant light. The study focused on apoptosis and necroptosis pathways. Our findings reveal that necroptosis is an active pathway in retinal degeneration, occurring in both photoreceptors and glial cells, while apoptosis seem to be inactive during the studied time points.

">dFCExpert: Learning Dynamic Functional Connectivity Patterns with Modularity and State Experts</a></h4>

              
                Characterizing brain dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) patterns from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data is of paramount importance in neuroscience and medicine. Recently, many graph neural network (GNN) models, combined with transformers or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown great potential for modeling the dFC patterns. However, these methods face challenges in effectively characterizing the modularity organization of brain networks and capturing varying dFC state patterns. To address these limitations, we propose dFCExpert, a novel method designed to learn robust representations of dFC patterns in fMRI data with modularity experts and state experts. Specifically, the modularity experts optimize multiple experts to characterize the brain modularity organization during graph feature learning process by combining GNN and mixture of experts (MoE), with each expert focusing on brain nodes within the same functional network module. The state experts aggregate temporal dFC features into a set of distinctive connectivity states using a soft prototype clustering method, providing insight into how these states support different brain activities or are differentially affected by brain disorders. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing alternatives. The learned dFC representations not only show improved interpretability but also hold promise for enhancing clinical diagnosis.

">Disruptions in Primary Visual Cortex Physiology and Function in a Mouse Model of Timothy Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Timothy syndrome (TS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CACNA1C gene which encodes the L-type calcium channel -1 CaV1.2 subunit. While it is expressed throughout the body the most serious symptoms are cardiac and neurological. Classical TS1 and TS2 mutations cause prolonged action potentials (APs) in cardiomyocytes and in induced neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells taken from TS patients, but effects of TS mutations on neuronal function in vivo are not fully understood. TS is frequently associated with autistic traits, which in turn have been linked to altered sensory processing. Using the TS2-neo mouse model we analysed effects of the TS2 mutation on the visual system. We observed a widening of APs of pyramidal cells in ex vivo patch-clamp recordings and an increase in the density of parvalbumin positive (PV+) cells in the primary visual cortex. Neurons recorded extracellularly in vivo were less likely to respond to visual stimuli of low spatial frequency, but more likely to respond to visual stimuli of mid-to-high spatial frequency, compared to WT mice. These results point to a basic processing abnormality in the visual cortex of TS2-neo mice.

">Asymmetries in foveal vision</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human's visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the 1-deg foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze-contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea. Although the tested foveolar locations were only 0.3 deg away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, reversed: objects presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~4deg away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.

">Neural Mechanisms of tDCS: Insights from an In-Vivo Rodent Model with Realistic Electric Field Strengths</a></h4>

              
                Introduction:Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation method using low amplitude current (1-2 mA) to create weak electric fields (<1 V/m) in the brain, influencing cognition, motor skills, and behavior. However, the neural mechanisms remain unclear, as prior studies used high electric field strengths (10-40 V/m) unrepresentative of human tDCS. Objective:This study aimed to develop an in-vivo rat model replicating human tDCS electric field strengths to examine effects of weak electric fields on cortical neurons. Method:Currents of 0.005-0.3 mA were applied in 9 rats, generating electric fields of 0.5-35 V/m in the somatosensory cortex. Neural activity across cortical layers was recorded using a multichannel silicone probe. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) elicited by foot shocks assessed membrane polarization. Regular spiking (RS) and fast-spiking (FS) neurons were identified via spike shapes. Effects of tDCS on SSEP, spontaneous spiking activity (SSA), and evoked spiking activity (ESA) were analyzed. Results:Anodal tDCS caused hyperpolarization (SSEP increase) in superficial layers and depolarization (SSEP decrease) in deeper layers, reversing asymmetrically for cathodal stimulation. Weak fields (<1 V/m) altered SSA in RS but not FS neurons, while stronger fields affected ESA in RS neurons. Effects correlated with field strength and were well described by linear mixed-effect models. Changes in SSA were correlated with changes in SSEP. Conclusion:This study demonstrates that realistic tDCS fields induce complex cortical polarization patterns linked to SSA changes. Increasing electric field strength amplifies effects, suggesting higher amplitude tDCS could enhance efficacy in humans.

">Early-life Oxytocin Rescues Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity and Episodic Memory in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive disabilities including impairments to episodic memory are debilitating features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we report that early-life treatment with oxytocin (OXT) fully restores episodic memory and associated synaptic plasticity in a rodent model of an ASD. Fmr1-knockout (KO) mice -- which mimic the single gene mutation in Fragile X Syndrome -- failed to encode three basic elements of an episode (identity, location, and temporal order) during a first time, unrewarded encounter with a set of cues. Intranasal administration of OXT during the second postnatal week eliminated each of these impairments in mice tested in adulthood. OXT treatment during the second, but not fifth, postnatal week also corrected pronounced defects in two distinct forms of hippocampal Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). Rescue of LTP in lateral perforant path (LPP) to dentate gyrus synapses was linked to recovery of NMDAR-gated synaptic responses, which are otherwise profoundly reduced in the mutant LPP. LTP induced by a threshold theta burst stimulation protocol in CA3-CA1 synapses was severely impaired in adult Fmr1-KOs as was a previously unreported post-induction growth phase for potentiation. Both effects were restored in adult Fmr1-KOs given early OXT treatment. Infusion of OXT into adult Fmr1-KO hippocampal slices normalized LTP in CA1 but had no effect on the defective potentiation (or NMDAR-mediated EPSCs) at LPP-dentate gyrus synapses. These results show that severe, autism-related defects in cognition critical to memory, as evident in a rodent model, are reversible and that an early-life therapeutic intervention can effect an enduring restoration of function.

">Age-related Increase in Locus Coeruleus Activity and Connectivity with Prefrontal Cortex during Ambiguity Processing</a></h4>

              
                Interpreting ambiguous environmental cues, like facial expressions, becomes increasingly challenging with age, especially as cognitive resources decline. Managing these challenges requires adaptive neural mechanisms that are essential for maintaining mental well-being. The locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's main norepinephrine source, regulates attention, arousal, and stress response. With extensive cortical connections, the LC supports adapting to cognitive demands and resolving conflicting cues from environment, particularly in later life. Previous research suggests that the LC interacts with the prefrontal cortex during high-conflict tasks. However, whether LC activity and its connectivity with the PFC support emotional ambiguity processing and contributes to emotional well-being in healthy aging remains unclear. To address this gap, we used 7T-MRI to examine LC function in 75 younger (25.8 +/- 4.02 years, 35 females) and 69 older adults (71.3 +/- 4.1 years, 35 females) during facial emotion-recognition task morphed with varying ambiguity: anchor (unambiguous happy or fearful), intermediate-ambiguity (30% happy-70% fearful and 40% happy-60% fearful expressions, in either direction), and absolute-ambiguity (50% happy-fearful). Behaviorally, participants had longer response times and lower confidence in the absolute-ambiguity condition, while older adults perceived ambiguous faces as happy more frequently than younger adults. Neuroimaging results revealed older adults exhibited greater LC activity and enhanced connectivity with dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) during absolute-ambiguity compared to younger adults. This heightened connectivity in older adults was linked to better emotional resilience and mental well-being. These findings suggest greater LC activity supports managing cognitively demanding tasks, while enhanced LC-dlPFC connectivity helps maintain emotional well-being, underscoring the importance of this neural pathway for healthy aging.

                Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) suffer from a high burden of cerebrovascular lesions and cognitive impairment that vastly impact quality of life. Cerebrovascular lesions are characterized by microstructural neuroaxonal damage, but their pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we report that SCD mice (SS) have reduced expression of frataxin (FXN), a mitochondrial protein, in their astrocytes compared to control (AA) mice. Next, we generated chimeric mice with SS bone marrow and astrocyte-specific deletion of FXN (SSFXN-KO). Ex-vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistopathology of the brain showed that the SSFXN-KO mice have increased white matter neuroaxonal damage compared to the SS bone marrow chimera mice with wild-type FXN expression (SSFXN-WT). The SSFXN-KO mice also displayed poorer cognitive function as measured by the functional Y-maze and novel object recognition tests. Pharmacological induction of FXN by administration of insulin growth factor-1 improved cognitive function in the SSFXN-KO mice. Overall, our data demonstrate that FXN is a critical factor regulating neuroaxonal health and cognitive function in SCD mice. FXN may therefore be a novel pharmacologic target to prevent cerebrovascular complications in SCD.

">Neuronal representation of the decisional reference point in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                The reward reference point serves as a hidden benchmark for evaluating options in decision-making. Despite extensive behavioral evidence for reference-dependence, no neural representation of the reference point has been discovered. We analyzed single neuron activity from macaque monkeys performing a decision-making task designed to orthogonalize objective reward values from the reference point. Regression analyses of neuronal activity across six frontal brain regions identified a robust neural representation of the reference point in the ventral bank of anterior cingulate cortex (vbACC). Activity in the dorsal bank of anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in contrast, encoded the reference-dependent subjective values of the rewards offered or obtained on each trial. The temporal dynamics of these signals and connections between these regions suggest a dedicated neural circuit implementing reference-dependent reward encoding, with the vbACC serving as the reference point signal source modulating activity in other frontal value-encoding areas.

Photoreceptor cell death has been associated with high levels of cyclic guanosine-3', 5'- monophosphate (cGMP) in animal models of autosomal recessive RP (ARRP) and autosomal dominant RP (ADRP). cGMP analogues inhibiting protein kinase G (PKG) have been found to prevent rod degeneration in ARRP disease models, but their effects on ADRP are unknown. Here, we used the recently generated rhodopsin-mutant RhoI255d/+ ADRP mouse model to investigate cGMP-signaling and the effects of cGMP analogues targeting PKG. cGMP accumulation was investigated by retinal immunostaining in wild-type (WT), RhoI255d/+, and RhoI255d/I255d mice. The therapeutic efficacy of the cGMP analogues CN03 and CN238 was evaluated on organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from WT and RhoI255d/+ mice. Readouts included the TUNEL assay and immunostaining for cone arrestin-3. Downstream effectors of cell death were visualized using calpain, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and histone deacetylase (HDAC) in situ assays, as well as caspase-3 immunostaining. Photoreceptor function was assessed using micro-electroretinogram ({micro}ERG) recordings. When compared with WT, RhoI255d photoreceptors displayed cGMP accumulation in outer segments. In the RhoI255d/+ ADRP model, CN03 and CN238 significantly reduced the number of dying photoreceptors. However, the relatively small number of photoreceptors exhibiting caspase-3 activity was not changed by the treatment. Remarkably, CN238 effectively provided long-lasting neuroprotection of cone photoreceptors and preserved retinal light responsiveness of RhoI255d/+ retina. Overall, this study suggests caspase-independent but cGMP-dependent cell death as a dominant degenerative mechanism in the RhoI255d/+ ADRP mouse model. PKG inhibition demonstrated robust neuroprotection of both rod and cone photoreceptors, while the marked preservation of retinal function, especially with the compound CN238, highlighted cGMP analogues for the treatment of ADRP.

">Development and early life stress sensitivity of the rat cortical microstructural similarity network</a></h4>

              
                The rat offers a uniquely valuable animal model in neuroscience, but we currently lack an individual-level understanding of the in vivo rat brain network. Here, leveraging longitudinal measures of cortical magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) from in vivo neuroimaging between postnatal days 20 (weanling) and 290 (mid-adulthood), we design and implement a computational pipeline that captures the network of structural similarity (MIND, morphometric inverse divergence) between each of 53 distinct cortical areas. We first characterized the normative development of the network in a cohort of rats undergoing typical development (N=47), and then contrasted these findings with a cohort exposed to early life stress (ELS, N=40). MIND as a metric of cortical similarity and connectivity was validated by cortical cytoarchitectonics and axonal tract-tracing data. The normative rat MIND network had high between-study reliability and complex topological properties including a rich club. Similarity changed during post-natal and adolescent development, including a phase of fronto-hippocampal convergence, or increasing inter-areal similarity. An inverse process of increasing fronto-hippocampal dissimilarity was seen with post-adult aging. Exposure to ELS in the form of maternal separation appeared to accelerate the normative trajectory of brain development - highlighting embedding of stress in the dynamic rat brain network. Our work provides novel tools for systems-level study of the rat brain that can now be used to understand network-based underpinnings of complex lifespan behaviors and experimental manipulations that this model organism allows.

">Decreased BOLD signal variability in middle-aged and older adults on the Autism Spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk for accelerated or early-onset cognitive and neurological decline in ASD. While it is well established that brain development in children, adolescents and young adults with ASD diverges from neurotypical (NT) peers, it is unknown how brain function is impacted in older adults with ASD. Understanding age-related changes of brain function in ASD is crucial to establish best practices for cognitive and health screenings in adults with ASD and develop interventions that might reduce the risk of accelerated decline. Decreases in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability (BSV) in typical aging have been shown across multiple studies, likely reflecting declining Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) activity, and is associated with poorer cognitive performance. We hypothesized that adults with ASD would show reduced BSV compared to the NT group, with steeper negative age associations in the ASD than NT group. Methods: The study assessed BSV in a cohort of adults (40-70 years), 28 with ASD and 39 age-matched NT. General linear models tested for main effects of diagnostic group (ASD, NT), age and group-by-age interactions (controlling for RMSD). Limitations: Our cross-sectional data and small sample size highlight the need for longitudinal analyses in larger cohorts, alongside exploring links to cognitive function. Additionally, psychotropic medications used by our cohort of adults on the autism spectrum may have affected BSV. Results: Significant group-by-age interactions were observed for the right insular, left temporal occipital fusiform, right frontal orbital and right inferior lateral occipital cortex, with BSV showing strong negative associations with age in the ASD but not NT group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that BSV decreases may occur earlier in adults on the autism spectrum compared to their neurotypical peers, possibly indicating accelerated aging. However, given limited prior research, additional longitudinal analyses will be necessary to determine if the results presented truly reflect accelerated aging or arise from lifelong persistent differences in brain function.

">Human shape perception spontaneously discovers the biological origin of novel, but natural, stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Humans excel at categorizing objects by shape. This facility involves identifying shape features that objects have in common with other members of their class and relies--at least in part--on semantic/cognitive constructs. For example, plants sprout branches, fish grow fins, shoes are molded to our feet. Can humans parse shapes according to the processes that give shapes their key characteristics, even when such processes are hidden? To answer this, we investigated how humans perceive the shape of cells from the olfactory system of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. These objects are novel to most humans yet occur in nature and cluster into classes following their underlying biological function. We reconstructed 3D cell models through 3D-microscopy and photogrammetry, then conducted psychophysical experiments. Human participants performed two tasks: they arranged 3D-printed cell models by similarity and rated them along eight visual dimensions. Participants were highly consistent in their arrangements and ratings and spontaneously grouped stimuli to reflect the cell classes, unwittingly revealing the underlying processes shaping these forms. Our findings thus demonstrate that human perceptual organization mechanisms spontaneously parse the biological systematicities of never-before-seen, natural shapes. Integrating such human perceptual strategies into automated systems may enhance morphology-based analysis in biology and medicine.

">A molecularly defined brain circuit module for regulating the panic-like defensive state</a></h4>

              
                Panic is an episode of strong defensive state, characterized by intense fear and severe physical symptoms such as elevated cardiorespiratory activities. How the brain generates panic state remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a robot-based experimental paradigm to evoke panic-like defensive state in mice. When stimulated by the robot, the mice exhibited jumping escapes and elevated cardiorespiratory activities. With this paradigm, we identified Cbln2-expressing (Cbln2+) neurons in the posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PHN) as a key neuronal population essential for the induction of panic-like defensive state. Activation of Cbln2+ PHN neurons induced behavioral and physical symptoms of panic-like defensive state. These neurons were strongly activated by noxious mechanical stimuli and encode jumping escape vigor. They were synaptically innervated by anxiety-associated brain areas and provoked panic-like defensive state via their projection to the periaqueductal gray. Together, our results reveal a molecularly defined circuit module that regulates the panic-like defensive state in mice.

">Effortful control and cortical brain structure in 5-year-old children: findings from the FinnBrain birth cohort study</a></h4>

              
                The aim of this study was to explore the associations between an aspect of self-regulation (SR), effortful control (EC), and cortical brain structure in 5-year-old children. Efficient EC is a predictor of many attributes and important outcomes in life, such as social-emotional functioning, psychiatric and somatic health, finance, and criminal activity. The early brain correlates of EC are not widely studied, while a better understanding of them would aid in recognizing individuals at risk for maladaptive outcomes. Participants (N = 155) were a part of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland. T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images were processed using FreeSurfer. The data was statistically analysed with a vertex-wise general linear model. At the age of 5 years, EC and its subscales, Attentional focusing, Inhibitory control (INH), Low intensity pleasure (LIP) and perceptual sensitivity, were assessed via parental report using The Children's Behaviour Questionnaire. We found positive associations between overall EC and cortical volume in the left superior parietal region and in the right inferior temporal region. We also found positive associations between EC and surface area on the left hemisphere in the superior parietal region. The findings were driven by the EC subscales of INH and LIP with INH linking positively with left surface area and volume, and LIP linking with left cortical volume. We extended the previous literature by shedding light on early structural brain correlates of EC in a large sample of typically developing 5-year-olds. The results differed significantly from previous findings in older children, highlighting the need for longitudinal studies to better understand the neural underpinnings of SR throughout development.

">Biologically Plausible Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Brain Dynamics and Inferring Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the complex connectivity of brain networks is essential for deciphering neural function and its disruptions in neurological disorders. Traditional graph theoretical approaches have provided valuable insights into the topological properties of neural networks, yet they often overlook the temporal dynamics intrinsic to neuronal activity. In this work, we introduce Cerebrum, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates biologically plausible Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron models with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to simulate and infer synaptic connectivity in large-scale brain networks. Cerebrum leverages canonical network topologies: Erdos-Renyi, Small-World, and Scale-Free, to generate ground-truth connectivity matrices and employs advanced GNN architectures to accurately predict these connections from simulated neuronal activity patterns. By incorporating disease-specific parameter modifications, such as those mimicking Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, our framework enables the exploration of how pathological states influence network dynamics and connectivity inference. Additionally, we incorporate empirical synaptic data from C. elegans to enhance the biological fidelity of our simulations. Cerebrum is accompanied by an open-source computational toolkit, providing tools for neural dynamics simulation, connectivity inference, and interactive network perturbations. Our work represents a significant advancement in computational neuroscience, offering a biologically grounded machine learning framework for modeling and analyzing intricate brain network dynamics.

                Decision making and learning processes together enable adaptive goal-oriented behaviour. Animal studies demonstrated the importance of subcortical regions in these cognitive processes, but the human subcortical contributions remain poorly characterised. Here, we study choice and learning processes in the human subcortex, using a tailored ultra-high field 7T fMRI imaging protocol combined with joint models. Joint models provide unbiased estimates of brain-behaviour relations by simultaneously including behavioural and neural data at the participant and group level. Results demonstrate relations between subcortical regions and the adjustment of decision urgency. Value-related BOLD differences were found with opposite BOLD polarity in different parts of the striatum. Multiple sub- cortical regions showed BOLD signatures of reward prediction error processing, but contrary to expectations, these did not include the dopaminergic midbrain. Combined, this study characterises the human subcortical contributions to choice and learning, and demonstrates the feasibility and value of joint modelling in facilitating our understanding of brain-behaviour relationships.

">Sound-Evoked Plasticity Differentiates Tinnitus from Non-Tinnitus Mice</a></h4>

              
                Tinnitus is the perception of non-meaningful sound in the absence of external stimuli. Although tinnitus behavior in animal models is associated with altered central nervous system activity, it is not currently possible to identify tinnitus using neuronal activity alone. In the mouse inferior colliculus (IC), a subpopulation of neurons demonstrates a sustained increase in spontaneous activity after a long-duration sound (LDS). Here, we use the 'LDS test' to reveal tinnitus-specific differences in sound-evoked plasticity through IC extracellular recordings and the auditory brainstem response (ABRLDS) in CBA/CaJ mice after sound exposure and behavioral tinnitus assessment. Sound-exposed mice showed stronger and shorter tone-evoked responses in the IC compared to unexposed controls, but these differences were not strong predictors of tinnitus. In contrast, in the LDS test, non-tinnitus mice had a significantly stronger suppression in tone-evoked spike rate compared to tinnitus and unexposed control mice. ABR peak amplitudes also revealed robust differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus mice, with ABR peaks from non-tinnitus mice exhibiting significantly stronger suppression in the LDS test compared to tinnitus and control mice. No significant differences were seen between cohorts in ABR amplitude, latency, wave V:I ratio, wave V:III ratio, I-V intra-peak latency, and I-VI intra-peak latency. We found high-frequency tone stimuli better suited to reveal tinnitus-specific differences for both extracellular IC and ABR recordings. We successfully used the LDS test to demonstrate that tinnitus-specific differences in sound-evoked plasticity can be shown using both multi-unit near-field recordings in the IC and non-invasive far-field recordings, providing a foundation for future electrophysiological research into the causes and treatment of tinnitus.

">Time restricted feeding with or without ketosis influences metabolism-related gene expression in a tissue-specific manner in aged rats</a></h4>

              
                Many of the hallmarks of aging involve alterations in cellular and organismal metabolism. One pathway with the potential to impact several traditional markers of impaired function with aging is the PI3K/AKT metabolic pathway. Regulation of this pathway includes many aspects of cellular function, including protein synthesis, proliferation and survival, as well as many downstream targets, including mTOR and FOXOs. Importantly, this pathway is pivotal to the function of every organ system in the human body. Thus, we investigated the expression of several genes along this pathway in multiple organs, including the brain, liver and skeletal muscle, in aged subjects that had been on different experimental diets to regulate metabolic function since mid-life. Specifically, rats were fed a control ad lib diet (AL), a time restricted feeding diet (cTRF), or a time restricted feeding diet with ketogenic macronutrients (kTRF) for the majority of their adult lives (from 8-25 months). We previously reported that regardless of macronutrient ratio, TRF-fed rats in both macronutrient groups required significantly less training to acquire a biconditional association task than their ad lib fed counterparts. The current experiments expand on this work by quantifying metabolism-related gene expression across tissues and interrogating for potential relationships with cognitive performance. AKT expression was significantly reduced in kTRF fed rats within liver and muscle tissue. However, AKT expression within the perirhinal cortex (PER) was higher in kTRF rats with the best cognitive performance. Within CA3, higher levels of FOXO1 gene expression correlated with poorer cognitive performance in ad libitum fed rats. Together, these data demonstrate diet- and tissue-specific alterations in metabolism-related gene expression and their correlation with cognitive status.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain networks describe the driving and synchronous relationships among multiple brain regions and can be used to identify different emotional states. However, methods for extracting interpretable structural features from brain networks are still lacking. In the current study, a novel deep learning structure comprising both an attention mechanism and a domain adversarial strategy is proposed to extract discriminant and interpretable features from brain networks. Specifically, the attention mechanism enhances the contribution of crucial rhythms and subnetworks for emotion recognition, whereas the domain-adversarial module improves the generalization performance of our proposed model for cross-subject tasks. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method for subject-independent emotion recognition tasks with the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) and the EEGs recorded in our laboratory. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of different emotions compared with commonly used methods such as domain adversarial neural networks. On the basis of the extracted network features, we also revealed crucial rhythms and subnetwork structures for emotion processing, which are consistent with those found in previous studies. Our proposed method not only improves the classification performance of brain networks but also provides a novel tool for revealing emotion processing mechanisms.</span>

Using magnetic resonance imaging, we employed diffusion-weighted imaging and automated tract-segmentation to explore striato- and thalamo-cortical tract microstructure and volume differences between autistic (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 29) and typical comparison (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 33) adults (40 to 70 years old). Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and tract volumes were measured for 14 striato-cortical and 12 thalamo-cortical tract bundles. Data were examined using linear regressions for group by age effects and group plus age effects, and false discovery rate correction was applied. Following false discovery rate correction, volumes of thalamocortical tracts to premotor, pericentral, and parietal regions were significantly reduced in autism spectrum disorder compared to thalamo-cortical groups, but no group by age interactions were found. Uncorrected results suggested additional main effects of group and age might be present for both tract volume and mean diffusivity across multiple subcortico-cortical tracts. Results indicate parallel rather than accelerated changes during adulthood in striato-cortical and thalamo-cortical tract volume and microstructure in those with autism spectrum disorder relative to thalamo-cortical peers though thalamo-cortical tract volume effects are the most reliable.</span>

	<p>Objectives: Growing evidence suggests a link between organophosphate insecticides and depression disorder. These chemicals are metabolized and subsequently expelled through the urinary tract. The present study aims to investigate whether dialkyl phosphate metabolites associate with depression score and severity among the general population. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). All urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites were quantitatively analyzed. The survey&amp;amp;rsquo;s complex design parameters and sampling weights were considered. Results: 3035 eligible individuals were included. The estimated prevalence of mild and major depression was 18.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.9&amp;amp;ndash;19.7%) and 9.9% (95% CI: 8.7&amp;amp;ndash;11.0%). For each incremental unit in the level of urinary dimethyl phosphate (DMP), individuals were found to have a higher depression score of 0.77 and a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.13) for mild depression and 2.75 (95% CI: 2.74&amp;amp;ndash;2.76) for major depression. Conclusions: Our findings indicate positive and independent associations between urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites and an elevated risk of depression among the general population.</p>

	<p>Background: Emotions play a crucial role in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s lives, profoundly affecting their cognition, decision-making, and interpersonal communication. Emotion recognition based on brain signals has become a significant challenge in the fields of affective computing and human-computer interaction. Methods: Addressing the issue of inaccurate feature extraction and low accuracy of existing deep learning models in emotion recognition, this paper proposes a multi-channel automatic classification model for emotion EEG signals named DACB, which is based on dual attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks. DACB extracts features in both temporal and spatial dimensions, incorporating not only convolutional neural networks but also SE attention mechanism modules for learning the importance of different channel features, thereby enhancing the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. DACB also introduces dot product attention mechanisms to learn the importance of spatial and temporal features, effectively improving the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s accuracy. Results: The accuracy of this method in single-shot validation tests on the SEED-IV and DREAMER (Valence-Arousal-Dominance three-classification) datasets is 99.96% and 87.52%, 90.06%, and 89.05%, respectively. In 10-fold cross-validation tests, the accuracy is 99.73% and 84.26%, 85.40%, and 85.02%, outperforming other models. Conclusions: This demonstrates that the DACB model achieves high accuracy in emotion classification tasks, demonstrating outstanding performance and generalization ability and providing new directions for future research in EEG signal recognition.</p>

	<p>Background: Eye movement research serves as a critical tool for assessing brain function, diagnosing neurological and psychiatric disorders, and understanding cognition and behavior. Sex differences have largely been under reported or ignored in neurological research. However, eye movement features provide biomarkers that are useful for disease classification with superior accuracy and robustness compared to previous classifiers for neurological diseases. Neurological diseases have a sex specificity, yet eye movement analysis has not been specific to our understanding of sex differences. Methods: The study involved subjects recruited from 804 sites equipped with RightEye Vision Systems, primarily located in optometry practices across the United States. Subjects completed six eye movement assessments: circular smooth pursuit (CSP), horizontal smooth pursuit (HSP), vertical smooth pursuit (VSP), horizontal saccades (HS), vertical saccades (VS), and fixation stability (FS). Eye movements were analyzed and classified in accordance with age and sex by multiple t-tests and linear regression models. Results: This study represented a large sample size of 23,557 subjects, with 11,871 males and 11,686 females representing ages from birth through 80 years of age. We observed statistically significant differences for all eye movement functions between males and females. Conclusions: We demonstrate that eye movements are sex-specific and offer normative data to compare sex-specific eye movement function by age. Novel baseline metrics can be compared to individual performance, regardless of sex. This study represents significant progress in linking eye movements with brain function and clinical syndromes, allowing researchers and clinicians to stratify individuals by age and sex.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Rodents provide a useful translational model of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors. Previously stressed animals exhibit physiological and behavioral stress responses that parallel those observed in anxious humans. Patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) present with a spectrum of debilitating anxiety symptoms that result from exposure to one or more traumatic events, with individuals exposed to early adverse experiences and women having increased vulnerability for diagnoses; however, the mechanisms of this increased vulnerability remain unknown. PTSD involves a complex network of highly interconnected brain regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Serotonin (5-HT) release into the BNST yields an increased expression of both fear and anxiety, specifically through 5-HT2C receptor signaling. The present experiment addressed whether 5-HT2C receptor signaling in the BNST is necessary for the acquisition of early-life stress (ELS)-induced enhancements in adult contextual fear learning. Methods: Rats received 0 or 15 footshocks on postnatal day 17, an established model of acute ELS (aELS) that yields enhanced adult fear learning. In adulthood, rats received bilateral infusions of a vehicle, a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist (RS-102221), or a 5-HT2C receptor agonist (MK-212) into the BNST 15 min prior to one-footshock contextual fear conditioning in a novel context. The next day, rats were returned to the fear-conditioning context to assess their fear memory (freezing). Results: Females demonstrated aELS-induced enhancement in contextual fear learning, while males did not. BNST infusions of RS-102221 reduced contextual fear conditioning, independent of aELS condition and sex. Infusions of MK-212 had no effect. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that serotonergic signaling through 5-HT2C receptors in the BNST contributes to contextual fear conditioning, but not aELS-induced stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL).</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal type of cancer, frequently presenting an unfavorable prognosis. The current treatment options for this neoplasia are still limited, highlighting the need for further research evaluating new drugs to treat GBM or to serve as an adjuvant to improve the efficiency of currently used therapies. In this sense, the inhibition of A2A receptors in the brain has presented a neuroprotective role for several diseases, such as neurodegenerative conditions, and it has been suggested as a possible pharmacological target in some types of cancer; thus, it also can be underscored as a potential target in GBM. Recently, Istradefylline (IST) was approved by the FDA for treating Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, representing a safe drug that acts through the inhibition of the A2A receptor, and it has also been suggested as an antineoplastic drug. Therefore, this work aims to explore the effects of A2A receptor inhibition as a therapy for GBM and assess the feasibility of this blockage occurring through the effects of IST.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) and anxiety disorders (ADs) are highly comorbid, a co-occurrence linked to worse clinical outcomes than either condition alone. While the neurobiological mechanisms involved in SUDs and anxiety disorders are intensively studied separately, the mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remain an emerging area of interest. This narrative review explores the neurobiological processes underlying this comorbidity, using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework to map disruptions in positive valence, negative valence, and cognitive systems across the three stages of the addiction cycle: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation. Anxiety and substance use play a reciprocal role at each stage of addiction, marked by significant psychosocial impairment and dysregulation in the brain. A more thorough understanding of the neural underpinnings involved in comorbid SUDs and anxiety disorders will contribute to more tailored and effective therapeutic interventions and assessments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/12/ENEURO.0495-23.2024?rss=1">Can Information About Stiffness Perception be Inferred from Action Signals Using Models?</a></h4>

              
                <p>We use sensory feedback to form our perception, and control our movements and forces (actions). There is an ongoing debate about the relation between perception and action, with evidence in both directions. For example, there are cases in which perceptual illusions affect action signals and cases where they do not. However, even when they do, it is unknown if perceptual information can be inferred from action signals alone. To answer this question, we utilized a perceptual illusion created by artificial tactile skin stretch, which increases stiffness perception, and affects grip force. We used data recorded in a stiffness discrimination task in which participants compared pairs of virtual objects, comprised of force and artificial skin stretch and indicated which they perceived as stiffer. We explored if models could predict the participants&rsquo; perceptual responses, and the increase in stiffness perception caused by the skin stretch, solely from their recorded action signals. That is, with no information provided about the stimuli. We found that participants&rsquo; perceptual augmentation could be predicted to an extent from their action signals alone. We predicted the average augmentation effect across participants, and a general trend of increased predicted perceptual augmentation for increased real perceptual augmentation. These results indicate that at least some perceptual information is present in action signals. Furthermore, of the action signals examined, grip force was necessary for predicting the augmentation effect, and a motion signal (e.g., position) was needed for predicting human-like perception, shedding light on what information may be presented in the different signals.</p>

Fibrinolysis, the plasmin-mediated degradation of the fibrin mesh that stabilizes blood clots, is an important physiological process, and understanding mechanisms underlying lysis is critical for improved stroke treatment. Experimentalists are now able to study lysis on the scale of single fibrin fibers, but mathematical models of lysis continue to focus mostly on fibrin network degradation. Experiments have shown that while some degradation occurs along the length of a fiber, ultimately the fiber is cleaved at a single location. We built a 2-dimensional stochastic model of a fibrin fiber cross-section that uses the Gillespie algorithm to study single fiber lysis initiated by plasmin. We simulated the model over a range of parameter values to learn about patterns and rates of single fiber lysis in various physiological conditions. We also used epifluorescent microscopy to measure the cleavage times of fibrin fibers with different apparent diameters. By comparing our model results to the laboratory experiments, we were able to: 1) suggest value ranges for unknown rate constants(namely that the degradation rate of fibrin by plasmin should be ≤ 10 s<sup>−1</sup> and that if plasmin crawls, the rate of crawling should be between 10 s<sup>−1</sup> and 60 s<sup>−1</sup>); 2) estimate the fraction of fibrin within a fiber cross-section that must be degraded for the fiber to cleave in two; and 3) propose that that fraction is higher in thinner fibers and lower in thicker fibers. Collectively, this information provides more details about how fibrin fibers degrade, which can be leveraged in the future for a better understanding of why fibrinolysis is impaired in certain disease states, and could inform intervention strategies.

                <p>by Kathrin Pabst, Evripidis Gkanias, Barbara Webb, Uwe Homberg, Dominik Endres</p>

Accurate navigation often requires the maintenance of a robust internal estimate of heading relative to external surroundings. We present a model for angular velocity integration in a desert locust heading circuit, applying concepts from early theoretical work on heading circuits in mammals to a novel biological context in insects. In contrast to similar models proposed for the fruit fly, this circuit model uses a single 360° heading direction representation and is updated by neuromodulatory angular velocity inputs. Our computational model was implemented using steady-state firing rate neurons with dynamical synapses. The circuit connectivity was constrained by biological data, and remaining degrees of freedom were optimised with a machine learning approach to yield physiologically plausible neuron activities. We demonstrate that the integration of heading and angular velocity in this circuit is robust to noise. The heading signal can be effectively used as input to an existing insect goal-directed steering circuit, adapted for outbound locomotion in a steady direction that resembles locust migration. Our study supports the possibility that similar computations for orientation may be implemented differently in the neural hardware of the fruit fly and the locust.

                <p>by Melvin Bérard, Laura Merlini, Sophie G. Martin</p>

Starvation, which is associated with inactivation of the growth-promoting TOR complex 1 (TORC1), is a strong environmental signal for cell differentiation. In the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, nitrogen starvation has distinct physiological consequences depending on the presence of mating partners. In their absence, cells enter quiescence, and TORC1 inactivation prolongs their life. In presence of compatible mates, TORC1 inactivation is essential for sexual differentiation. Gametes engage in paracrine pheromone signaling, grow towards each other, fuse to form the diploid zygote, and form resistant, haploid spore progenies. To understand the signaling changes in the proteome and phospho-proteome during sexual reproduction, we developed cell synchronization strategies and present (phospho-)proteomic data sets that dissect pheromone from starvation signals over the sexual differentiation and cell–cell fusion processes. Unexpectedly, these data sets reveal phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 during sexual development, which we establish requires TORC1 activity. We demonstrate that TORC1 is re-activated by pheromone signaling, in a manner that does not require autophagy. Mutants with low TORC1 re-activation exhibit compromised mating and poorly viable spores. Thus, while inactivated to initiate the mating process, TORC1 is reactivated by pheromone signaling in starved cells to support sexual reproduction.

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vasculitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

                Background Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects a significant proportion of the global population, posing a major public health challenge. In recent years, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mental health diagnosis has garnered increasing attention. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on AI-based approaches for depression diagnosis, identifying both advancements and gaps in the literature that can guide future studies. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted across leading research databases to identify relevant studies published up to July 2024. A combination of automated and manual filtering was employed to refine the initial set of records. Eligibility criteria were applied to ensure that only studies directly addressing the use of AI for depression diagnosis were included in the final analysis. Results The initial search yielded 1,179 records. Following a rigorous selection process, 145 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review. These studies represent a diverse array of AI techniques and data sources, with a predominant focus on supervised learning algorithms. The most common data sources were social networks, followed by clinical data integrated with psychological assessments. Conclusion The results highlight the growing interest in leveraging AI for depression diagnosis, particularly through the use of supervised learning methods. Social network data has emerged as the most frequently used data source, though clinical data combined with validated psychological tests remains a key area of focus. Despite these advancements, several challenges persist, including data availability and quality, which present opportunities for future research to improve diagnostic accuracy and generalizability.

                Background The Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy was a very strict policy for COVID-19 response in the Chinese mainland, with the overarching goal of preventing imported infections and domestic flare-ups. Policy and implications The dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy has long been criticized by European and American politicians for the issue of human rights. There are some points that need to be considered with regard to these criticisms: Firstly, the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy protected millions of Chinese people from death, the outcomes of China’s COVID-19 response demonstrated the correctness and suitability of the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy, and the policy benefited the world. Secondly, freedom and health were generally conflicted and extremely difficult to be compatible in the COVID-19 pandemic, and the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy indeed exhibited several advantages in the fight against COVID-19. Thirdly, China struggled to spare no effort to save lives all the time during the COVID-19 pandemic under the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. Recommendations Appropriate restrictions on freedom and human rights are justified to protect public health and prevent harm to others in the COVID-19 pandemic, and an important premise is that the implement of these restrictions are based on law. Conclusions In summary, it is biased to censure the Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy or abandonment of the Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy based on human rights, and the great achievement of the policy and China’s efforts to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic should not be ignored.

                Background ELIXIR is a pan-European public-funded research infrastructure dedicated to life science data. As such, it must demonstrate public value to its funders and stakeholders. We present methods to inventory research publications linked to ELIXIR that have received funding and support, as well as related citation metrics, used as performance metrics for these audiences. Methods To overcome challenges inherent in ELIXIR’s distributed structure, and the fact that those publishing ELIXIR-supported work are typically working part-time on ELIXIR matters, a semi-automated approach, consisting of text-mining followed by manual curation, is presented. A country-level case study (ELIXIR Italy) refines and expands the methods, notably by introducing more granularity in the curation process (e.g. considering all national-level grants, examining affiliations to report publication per institute) and by additionally looking at the scientific impact of the resources developed and operated by the Italian Node of ELIXIR. Results Overall, the methods described in this article have shown to: (1) be repeatable with acceptable levels of accuracy and consistency (notably across curators); (2) require reasonable effort in terms of curation of monthly ‘harvests’ of publications (obtained by text-mining); and (3) to be well-adapted to ELIXIR’s distributed nature. Conclusions Concrete examples are provided of downstream uses of the inventoried publications and their citations, both for ELIXIR as a whole and for the Italian case study. Limitations of the methods are discussed, particularly the challenges associated with using an ‘Open literature’ database (Europe PMC) for the text-mining, and the constraints related to curation capacity. The methods, along with the valuable lessons learned during their development, are sufficiently generic and pragmatic enough to be readily adapted by other similar research infrastructures.

                Background Rational prescription writing is an important skill to master during internship. This Quality Improvement (QI) project aimed to understand the state of prescription writing among interns posted in the Department of Psychiatry, analyze the causes responsible for errors in prescription writing and bring about a change in the current practice. Methods The MBBS interns are posted in the Department of Psychiatry for 15 days. During day 1 to day 5 of their posting, a pre intervention phase was conducted wherein prescriptions written by interns in the Department of Psychiatry were collected. The prescriptions were scored based on 14 criteria which were selected based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and Medical Council of India (MCI) ideal prescription format. During PDSA (Plan Do Study Act) Cycle 1, an educational handout was distributed to the interns containing the MCI ideal prescription format and WHO guidelines regarding prescription writing. The brochure was also verbally explained to the interns. From day 7 to day 15 of their posting, prescriptions written by the interns were collected. The prescriptions were scored using the same criteria. Results During the pre intervention phase the mean total score of prescriptions was 9.54 ± 1.003. There was a significant improvement in the mean total score to 10.26 ± 0.746. There was a 7.54% improvement. There was also a significant improvement in several individual criteria. Conclusions The first PDSA cycle was successful in improving the quality of prescription writing among interns posted in the Department of Psychiatry. There is a need to implement more PDSA cycles to improve the quality still further.

                Background Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a progressive neurovascular-degenerative condition without specific treatment that causes lacunar stroke, most intracerebral haemorrhage, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and several neuropsychiatric conditions. Objectives To conduct a rapid multi-stage scoping review to identify licensed interventions that could be repurposed for testing in cSVD at phase-3. Methods First, we screened preclinical studies of potential relevance to cSVD and used a drug dictionary to identify studies of potential interventions. Separately, we screened clinical studies of relevance to cSVD and VCI. Following merging, we removed drugs that were unsuitable or impractical to assess long-term in the UK. We then performed mini-meta-analyses for shortlisted interventions assessing effects on cognition and scored these for their relevance to cSVD. Results The preclinical review created a long-list of 1,757 deduplicated interventions. Those that were not available in the UK, not expensive or impractical to administer long-term were merged with 62 interventions identified from 75 relevant clinical studies to create a medium-list of 52 interventions. Focussed literature review short-listed ten interventions for review by an independent scientific advisory group; they ranked three as most suitable for immediate testing: metformin, tadalafil and isosorbide mononitrate. Conclusion This rapid review identified three interventions that are suitable for testing in a late phase-3 (platform) trial involving patients with cSVD. The approach could be improved with partial automation, text mining and generative pre-trained transformer approaches which would help manage the large data volumes. Further, our data-driven approach could be combined with genetic or other mechanistic methods to further de-risk future trials.

We sequenced short read data on the 10x system to generate a reference genome 3.46Gb in size and contig N50 of 87.36Kb. Additionally, we used GeMoMa to provide and accompanying annotation for the reference genome. The generation of a reference genome for the eastern bettong provides a vital resource for the conservation of the species.

<p>The homeobox transcription factor Engrailed1 was crucial for the survival of PV neurons.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Homeobox transcription factor Engrailed1 (En1) is expressed in the ectoderm and mediates the establishment of retinotectal topography, but its role in eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation and visual function remains unclear. Parvalbumin (PV) neurons, which are widely distributed in the visual pathway, play a crucial role in visual development and function. In this study, we conditionally knocked out En1 gene in PV neurons and found an expansion of the ipsilateral eye projection, while no significant effects were observed in the contralateral eye projection. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the number of PV neurons in PV-Cre:En1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, accompanied by an increased level of cleaved caspase-3 in PV neurons. Furthermore, the genetic ablation of PV neurons in the retina through intraocular AAV-DIO-Caspase3 injection in PV-Cre mice was sufficient to disrupt retinogeniculate segregation. Finally, we observed that PV-Cre:En1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice exhibited enhanced visual depth perception in the visual cliff test. These results demonstrate that En1 in PV neurons participates in eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation through cell survival and regulates binocular vision.</p>

                Abstract The comorbidity due to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health problem, but its mechanism remains unclear. It is suspected that hyperglycemic alteration of the immune response to TB and the composition of the lung microbiota play an important role. This scoping review aimed to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by mapping evidence on the effect of hyperglycemia on physical health indicators, immune cell counts, cytokine levels, and the composition of lung microbiota in patients with the DM-TB comorbidity. A systematic search for research articles about the relationship between hyperglycemia and physical health, immune cells, and cytokine levels in humans was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus. Then, articles on the interactions between the immune cells, cytokines, and lung microbiota were identified through Google Scholar and Google search engines. Characteristics of the studies focusing on effects of hyperglycemia, the findings of the articles relevant to the research objectives, and strengths and weaknesses of the selected articles were charted in a data extraction tool. Twenty-one articles on the effects of hyperglycemia on immune mediators and health outcomes of patients with DM-TB were included. The evidence showed hyperglycemia to be associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes; altered counts and functioning of dendritic cells, monocytes, and CD4+ T cells; and changes in cytokine levels (mainly INF-γ, IL-17, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) in patients with DM-TB. The composition of the lung microbiota changed in correlation with changes in physical health outcomes, counts of immune cells, and cytokine levels. Thus, hyperglycemia, immune responses, and dysbiosis of the lung microbiota are integral in the pathogenesis of DM-TB and TB treatment outcomes. A prospective cohort study, especially in individuals with newly diagnosed DM versus known DM and concomitant latent TB versus active TB, is recommended to define causal relationships.

                Background Dental professionals are exposed to either high level of noise which often becomes annoying over a time, and it is largely related to turbines and suctions used during the procedure. We performed this study with an aim to know the need for efforts to reduce impact of noise on young. Methods The study group comprised of 102 dentists (53 males and 49 females) final year dental students, interns and board students of family dentistry, endodontics, prosthodontics was enrolled. The noise assessment device is switched on to know the base noise level in the clinics and to know hearing ability of the dentist through a pre – recorded verbal communication. When the dentist starts the procedure, the same verbal communication is re-introduced and based on his reaction the decibel level is increased to a point where he can understand it. The same is followed after the procedure. Results Using T – test the age and gender mean was assessed, while ANNOVA test was used to know the hearing impairment and its mean before, during and after procedure. We have found that there is an imminent increase of sound during the procedure and thereby associated impairment; which continues but to a lesser decibel level even after the procedure is completed for long time. Discussion and Conclusion We have highlighted few guidelines from various studies which range from reducing multiple turbine usage at a given point of treatment wherever possible to a recommendation to use ear plugs for those procedures related to high noise levels.

                Background This mixed-method action research study explores the impact of a gamified virtual learning tool on elementary students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) skills in English language acquisition. Despite the acknowledged importance of SRL in educational contexts, limited research exists on its development among young learners. The present study is one of the products of the academic unit project “Key Factors and Essential Elements for a Comprehensive Model of Bilingual Education: A Multidimensional Approach for Diverse Contexts and Areas of Knowledge” sponsored by the School of Education at Universidad de La Sabana, institution where the first author conducted her master’s studies, and the corresponding author is a professor and main researcher of the of the academic unit project. Method Six students aged 8-10 participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured observations and pre- and post-questionnaires. The tool was designed based on Zimmerman’s SRL model and included tasks structured through gamification elements. For the purpose of quantitative data analysis, descriptive statistics were used; as for qualitative data, thematic analysis was the chosen approach. Results The results revealed that guided use of the gamified tool significantly enhanced students’ use of SRL strategies, particularly in goal setting, monitoring progress, and reflecting on learning outcomes. Students demonstrated increased motivation, engagement, and confidence, although explicit instruction was required to maximize the tool’s benefits. The usability of the tool was rated positively, with participants highlighting its effectiveness for language learning and SRL skill development. Conclusions The study concludes that gamified virtual environments can effectively promote SRL skills in young language learners by fostering motivation and engagement. However, for optimal outcomes, such tools should be supplemented with explicit instruction in SRL strategies. This research contributes to understanding the integration of gamified tools in elementary education, highlighting their potential to develop foundational skills essential for lifelong learning.

                Drawing from historical accounts, cultural practices, archaeological discoveries, and indigenous technical knowledge, the research presents a critical review of varied aspects of the construction of the Konark temple and presents future research directions. To fulfill the purpose, documents were sourced from Scopus, Google Scholar, and ancient texts and palm leaves. Findings suggest the legacy of Narasimhadeva I, the Hindu monarch who remained undefeated during his reign, safeguarded the kingdom from encroaching Muslim rulers. The narrative highlights the bravery of a faithful elephant that revived the king on the battlefield. The Konark temple was built with the dual purpose of showcasing the glory of his victory and devotion to the Sun God. The ancient artisans’ knowledge, skills, and commitment were crucial in erecting this tallest temple structure. The investigation further illuminates the use of sea routes for transporting monumental stones, the ingenuity in laying the temple’s foundation, the selection of high-grade stones, the monumental task of lifting colossal stones, like the world’s heaviest stone hoisted to a height of about two hundred feet, the use of rust-resistant iron, and the application of advanced astronomical knowledge by ancient artisans. The study provides insights into ancient engineering ingenuity, encouraging further exploration of the enduring legacy of the Konark temple’s construction.

                Background The representation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is disproportionate to graduates from STEM fields. There is limited research addressing challenges facing women retention in STEM in the UAE. Methods A cross-sectional study using a validated questionnaire was conducted. A total of 165 participants were enrolled; 62% males and 35% females. Results More women believed there is gender inequality in STEM (47% versus 28%). 44% of female participants experienced gender inequality in their career. Men were significantly less likely to experience gender inequality (OR=0.06, 95% CI=0.02-0.16). Women reported lack of organizational emphasis on diversity and inclusion for promotion to leadership (44% versus 60%). Conclusion Data confirms gender-based preconceptions and biases in STEM fields. Institutional initiatives and policies to challenge stereotypes and promote gender equality are required. Governmental role is crucial in creating an inclusive environment for women scientists.

                Background/Purpose There are approximately 18.94 million visually impaired children worldwide, with 90% of them living in low-middle income countries. Research shows that visual impairment (VI) has a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of those affected. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how VI affects the daily activities of these children to develop management strategies that can help minimize its impact on their QoL. Therefore, qualitative research design was utilized to explore the perceived impact of VI on the daily activities of children living with VI. Methods Using a qualitative approach, purposive sampling was used to identify information-rich participants to partake in focus group discussions (FGDs) and address the aim of the study adequately. Identified data sources were divided into two groups: one with ‘experts’ who worked with children regularly, and another with school-going children aged 6-17 years, from three rural schools in Sekhukhune district, South Africa. The FGDs were guided by semi-structured interview questions. All sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, cleaned, coded, and analysed under ten domains, identified from the literature. Results A total of 477 statements and comments related to children’s vision were generated through the nine FGDs. Participants were nine experts working with children, and 49 children living with or without VI. Of the total number of statements, 60% (n = 287) were generated from FGDs with children, 63% (n = 299) were negative statements, and the remaining 19% (n = 92), and 18% (n = 86) were neutral and positive statements respectively. The most generated statements fell under the domains ‘Hobbies, Leisure and Sport’ 21% (n = 101), ‘Education’ 21% (n = 100), and ‘Psychological and Emotional’ 12.8% (n = 61). Conclusion This study offered comprehensive insights into the impact of VI on the daily activities of rural school-aged children and young people.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27166?af=R">Identifying Individuals in the Prodromal Phase of Parkinson's Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively evaluated how well combinations of signs and symptoms can identify individuals in the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study comprised 6,108 men who underwent repeated assessments of key prodromal features and were prospectively followed for the development of PD. Two composite measures of prodromal PD were evaluated: (i) the co-occurrence of constipation, probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), and hyposmia, and (ii) the probability of prodromal PD based on the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) research criteria. We also examined the progression and heterogeneity of the prodromal PD phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred three individuals were newly diagnosed with PD over an average follow-up of 3.4 years. Men with constipation, pRBD, and hyposmia had a 23-fold higher risk of receiving a PD diagnosis in the subsequent 3 years, compared with men without these features (risk ratio [RR] = 23.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.62–51.33). The risk of PD was 21-fold higher in men with a probability of prodromal PD ≥ 0.8 compared with those with a probability &lt; 0.2 (RR = 21.96, 95% CI = 11.17–43.17). Both the co-occurrence of the 3 non-motor features and an MDS-based probability ≥ 0.8 had comparable predictive values, and both were stronger predictors of PD than any of the features individually. We identified 2 prodromal PD subtypes where RBD and visual color impairment were key discriminators.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study demonstrates that combinations of key signs and symptoms strongly predict future clinically manifest PD. These measures may be integrated into screening strategies to identify individuals who could be targeted for enrollment into PD prevention trials. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <p>Chromatin regulation plays a crucial role in neocortical neurogenesis, and mutations in chromatin modifiers are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. RBBP4 is a core subunit of several chromatin-modifying complexes; however, its functional role and genome-wide occupancy profile in the neocortical primordium are unknown. To address this, we performed RBBP4 knockdown using CRISPR/Cas9 on neocortical progenitors derived from mice of both sexes at embryonic age 12.5 during deep layer neurogenesis. Our study demonstrates that downregulation of RBBP4 in the E12.5 neocortical progenitors reduced neuronal output, specifically affecting CTIP2-expressing neurons. We demonstrate that RBBP4 plays an essential role in regulating neocortical progenitor proliferation. However, overexpression of RBBP4 alone was not sufficient to regulate neuronal fate. Genome-wide occupancy analysis revealed that RBBP4 primarily binds to distal regulatory elements, and neuron differentiation is a significant GO biological pathway of RBBP4-bound genes. Interestingly, we found that RBBP4 binds to <I>Cdon</I>, a receptor protein in the Shh signaling pathway, and knockdown of <I>Cdon</I> phenocopies RBBP4 knockdown resulting in a significant reduction in neurogenesis, particularly CTIP2-expressing neurons. CDON overexpression could rescue the phenotype caused upon loss of RBBP4 in the neocortex, thereby suggesting the functional link between RBBP4 and its target gene CDON. Our results shed light on the cellular role of RBBP4 and identify CDON as a novel regulator of deep layer neurogenesis in the neocortical progenitors. Our findings are significant in the context of understanding how dysregulated chromatin regulation impacts cellular mechanisms in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

                <p>Delay discounting (DD) is a phenomenon where individuals devalue a reward associated with a temporal delay, with the rate of devaluation being representative of impulsive-like behavior. Here, we first sought to develop and validate a mouse DD task to study brain circuits involved in DD decision-making within short developmental time windows, given widespread evidence of developmental regulation of impulse control and risk-taking. We optimized a T-maze DD task for mice that enables training and DD trials within 2 weeks. Mice learned to choose between a large and a small reward located at opposite arms of a T-maze. Once training criteria were met, mice underwent DD whereby the large reward choice was associated with a temporal delay. Task validation showed that adolescent C57BL/6J mice display an increased preference for the small reward upon a temporal delay, confirming increased impulsivity compared with adults. We next used this DD task to explore the neural basis of decision-making. We used tyrosine hydroxylase transgenic mice (TH-Cre) to target TH-positive neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) with Cre-dependent excitatory or inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). Inhibition of transduced neurons in the NAc decreased preference for the small but immediate reward during DD. Inhibition of TH-positive neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) did not affect impulsive choice in this DD task. These results uncover a novel role for NAc TH-positive neurons in DD behavior and expand the repertoire of behavioral tasks available for studying decision-making across the lifespan.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97227">CTFFIND5 provides improved insight into quality, tilt, and thickness of TEM samples</a></h4>

              
                Images taken by transmission electron microscopes are usually affected by lens aberrations and image defocus, among other factors. These distortions can be modeled in reciprocal space using the contrast transfer function (CTF). Accurate estimation and correction of the CTF is essential for restoring the high-resolution signal in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM). Previously, we described the implementation of algorithms for this task in the <i>cis</i>TEM software package (Grant et al., 2018). Here we show that taking sample characteristics, such as thickness and tilt, into account can improve CTF estimation. This is particularly important when imaging cellular samples, where measurement of sample thickness and geometry derived from accurate modeling of the Thon ring pattern helps judging the quality of the sample. This improved CTF estimation has been implemented in CTFFIND5, a new version of the <i>cis</i>TEM program CTFFIND. We evaluated the accuracy of these estimates using images of tilted aquaporin crystals and eukaryotic cells thinned by focused ion beam milling. We estimate that with micrographs of sufficient quality CTFFIND5 can measure sample tilt with an accuracy of 3° and sample thickness with an accuracy of 5 nm.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89674">A neuronal least-action principle for real-time learning in cortical circuits</a></h4>

              
                One of the most fundamental laws of physics is the principle of least action. Motivated by its predictive power, we introduce a neuronal least-action principle for cortical processing of sensory streams to produce appropriate behavioral outputs in real time. The principle postulates that the voltage dynamics of cortical pyramidal neurons prospectively minimizes the local somato-dendritic mismatch error within individual neurons. For output neurons, the principle implies minimizing an instantaneous behavioral error. For deep network neurons, it implies the prospective firing to overcome integration delays and correct for possible output errors right in time. The neuron-specific errors are extracted in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons through a cortical microcircuit that tries to explain away the feedback from the periphery, and correct the trajectory on the fly. Any motor output is in a moving equilibrium with the sensory input and the motor feedback during the ongoing sensory-motor transform. Online synaptic plasticity reduces the somatodendritic mismatch error within each cortical neuron and performs gradient descent on the output cost at any moment in time. The neuronal least-action principle offers an axiomatic framework to derive local neuronal and synaptic laws for global real-time computation and learning in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96926">Mitochondrial respiration atlas reveals differential changes in mitochondrial function across sex and age</a></h4>

              
                Organ function declines with age, and large-scale transcriptomic analyses have highlighted differential aging trajectories across tissues. The mechanism underlying shared and organ-selective functional changes across the lifespan, however, still remains poorly understood. Given the central role of mitochondria in powering cellular processes needed to maintain tissue health, we therefore undertook a systematic assessment of respiratory activity across 33 different tissues in young (2.5 months) and old (20 months) mice of both sexes. Our high-resolution mitochondrial respiration atlas reveals: (1) within any group of mice, mitochondrial activity varies widely across tissues, with the highest values consistently seen in heart, brown fat, and kidney; (2) biological sex is a significant but minor contributor to mitochondrial respiration, and its contributions are tissue-specific, with major differences seen in the pancreas, stomach, and white adipose tissue; (3) age is a dominant factor affecting mitochondrial activity, especially across most brain regions, different fat depots, skeletal muscle groups, eyes, and different regions of the gastrointestinal tract; (4) age effects can be sex- and tissue-specific, with some of the largest effects seen in pancreas, heart, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle; and (5) while aging alters the functional trajectories of mitochondria in a majority of tissues, some are remarkably resilient to age-induced changes. Altogether, our data provide the most comprehensive compendium of mitochondrial respiration and illuminate functional signatures of aging across diverse tissues and organ systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98654">The emergence and evolution of gene expression in genome regions replete with regulatory motifs</a></h4>

              
                Gene regulation is essential for life and controlled by regulatory DNA. Mutations can modify the activity of regulatory DNA, and also create new regulatory DNA, a process called regulatory emergence. Non-regulatory and regulatory DNA contain motifs to which transcription factors may bind. In prokaryotes, gene expression requires a stretch of DNA called a promoter, which contains two motifs called –10 and –35 boxes. However, these motifs may occur in both promoters and non-promoter DNA in multiple copies. They have been implicated in some studies to improve promoter activity, and in others to repress it. Here, we ask whether the presence of such motifs in different genetic sequences influences promoter evolution and emergence. To understand whether and how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution, we start from 50 ‘promoter islands’, DNA sequences enriched with –10 and –35 boxes. We mutagenize these starting ‘parent’ sequences, and measure gene expression driven by 240,000 of the resulting mutants. We find that the probability that mutations create an active promoter varies more than 200-fold, and is not correlated with the number of promoter motifs. For parent sequences without promoter activity, mutations created over 1500 new –10 and –35 boxes at unique positions in the library, but only ~0.3% of these resulted in de-novo promoter activity. Only ~13% of all –10 and –35 boxes contribute to de-novo promoter activity. For parent sequences with promoter activity, mutations created new –10 and –35 boxes in 11 specific positions that partially overlap with preexisting ones to modulate expression. We also find that –10 and –35 boxes do not repress promoter activity. Overall, our work demonstrates how promoter motifs influence promoter emergence and evolution. It has implications for predicting and understanding regulatory evolution, de novo genes, and phenotypic evolution.

                Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) activity is crucial in the process of dental and periodontal mesenchyme regeneration facilitated by autologous platelet concentrates (APCs), such as platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and concentrated growth factors (CGF), as well as by recombinant PDGF drugs. However, it is largely unclear about the physiological patterns and cellular fate determinations of PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells in the homeostasis maintaining of adult dental and periodontal mesenchyme. We previously identified NFATc1 expressing PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells as a subtype of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) in limb bone in mice, but their roles in dental and periodontal remain unexplored. To this end, in the present study we investigated the spatiotemporal atlas of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> and PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells residing in dental and periodontal mesenchyme in mice, their capacity for progeny cell generation, and their inclusive, exclusive and hierarchical relations in homeostasis. We utilized CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to generate two dual recombination systems, which were Cre<i>-loxP</i> and Dre<i>-rox</i> combined intersectional and exclusive reporters respectively, to concurrently demonstrate the inclusive, exclusive, and hierarchical distributions of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> and PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells and their lineage commitment. By employing the state-of-the-art transgenic lineage tracing techniques in cooperating with tissue clearing-based advanced imaging and three-dimensional slices reconstruction, we systematically mapped the distribution atlas of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> and PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells in dental and periodontal mesenchyme and tracked their in vivo fate trajectories in mice. Our findings extend current understanding of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> and PDGFR-α<sup>+</sup> cells in dental and periodontal mesenchyme homeostasis, and furthermore enhance our comprehension of their sustained therapeutic impact for future clinical investigations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98552">Streamlining segmentation of cryo-electron tomography datasets with Ais</a></h4>

              
                Segmentation is a critical data processing step in many applications of cryo-electron tomography. Downstream analyses, such as subtomogram averaging, are often based on segmentation results, and are thus critically dependent on the availability of open-source software for accurate as well as high-throughput tomogram segmentation. There is a need for more user-friendly, flexible, and comprehensive segmentation software that offers an insightful overview of all steps involved in preparing automated segmentations. Here, we present Ais: a dedicated tomogram segmentation package that is geared towards both high performance and accessibility, available on <a href="https://github.com/bionanopatterning/Ais">GitHub</a>. In this report, we demonstrate two common processing steps that can be greatly accelerated with Ais: particle picking for subtomogram averaging, and generating many-feature segmentations of cellular architecture based on in situ tomography data. Featuring comprehensive annotation, segmentation, and rendering functionality, as well as an open repository for trained models at aiscryoet.org, we hope that Ais will help accelerate research and dissemination of data involving cryoET.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102222">A neurotrophin functioning with a Toll regulates structural plasticity in a dopaminergic circuit</a></h4>

              
                Experience shapes the brain as neural circuits can be modified by neural stimulation or the lack of it. The molecular mechanisms underlying structural circuit plasticity and how plasticity modifies behaviour are poorly understood. Subjective experience requires dopamine, a neuromodulator that assigns a value to stimuli, and it also controls behaviour, including locomotion, learning, and memory. In <i>Drosophila</i>, Toll receptors are ideally placed to translate experience into structural brain change. <i>Toll-6</i> is expressed in dopaminergic neurons (DANs), raising the intriguing possibility that Toll-6 could regulate structural plasticity in dopaminergic circuits. <i>Drosophila</i> neurotrophin-2 (DNT-2) is the ligand for Toll-6 and Kek-6, but whether it is required for circuit structural plasticity was unknown. Here, we show that <i>DNT-2</i>-expressing neurons connect with DANs, and they modulate each other. Loss of function for <i>DNT-2</i> or its receptors <i>Toll-6</i> and kinase-less Trk-like <i>kek-6</i> caused DAN and synapse loss, impaired dendrite growth and connectivity, decreased synaptic sites, and caused locomotion deficits. In contrast, over-expressed <i>DNT-2</i> increased DAN cell number, dendrite complexity, and promoted synaptogenesis. Neuronal activity modified DNT-2, increased synaptogenesis in DNT-2-positive neurons and DANs, and over-expression of DNT-2 did too. Altering the levels of DNT-2 or Toll-6 also modified dopamine-dependent behaviours, including locomotion and long-term memory. To conclude, a feedback loop involving dopamine and DNT-2 highlighted the circuits engaged, and DNT-2 with Toll-6 and Kek-6 induced structural plasticity in this circuit modifying brain function and behaviour.

It remains unexplored how this prosodic hierarchy is represented in the brain. We investigated this foundational question by means of an electroencephalography (EEG) study. Thirty young adults listened to German sentences containing manipulations at different levels of the prosodic hierarchy. Evaluating speech-to-brain cortical entrainment and phase-amplitude coupling revealed that prosody’s hierarchical structure is maintained at the neural level during spoken language comprehension. The faithfulness of this tracking varied as a function of the hierarchy’s degree of intactness as well as systematic interindividual differences in audio-motor synchronization abilities. The results underscore the role of complex oscillatory mechanisms in configuring the continuous and hierarchical nature of the speech signal and situate prosody as a structure indispensable from theoretical perspectives on spoken language comprehension in the brain.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Arousal states are thought to influence many aspects of cognition and behavior by broadly modulating neural activity. Many studies have observed arousal-related modulations of alpha (~8 to 15 Hz) and gamma (~30 to 50 Hz) power and coherence in local field potentials across relatively small groups of brain regions. However, the global pattern of arousal-related oscillatory modulation in local field potentials is yet to be fully elucidated. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials in numerous cortical and subcortical regions in the primate brain and assessed oscillatory activity and inter-regional coherence associated with arousal state. In high arousal states, we found a uniquely strong and coherent gamma oscillation between the amygdala and basal forebrain. In low arousal rest-like states, a relative increase in coherence at alpha frequencies was present across sampled brain regions, with the notable exception of the medial temporal lobe. We consider how these patterns of activity may index arousal-related brain states that support the processing of incoming sensory stimuli during high arousal states and memory-related functions during rest.</span>

	<p>Background: In the last few years, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has attracted attention as a promising approach to interact with ongoing oscillatory cortical activity and, consequently, to enhance cognitive and motor processes. While tACS findings are limited by high variability in young adults&amp;amp;rsquo; responses, its effects on brain oscillations in older adults remain largely unexplored. In fact, the modulatory effects of tACS on cortical oscillations in healthy aging participants have not yet been investigated extensively, particularly during movement. This study aimed to examine the after-effects of 20 Hz and 70 Hz High-Definition tACS on beta oscillations both during rest and movement. Methods: We recorded resting state EEG signals and during a handgrip task in 15 healthy older participants. We applied 10 min of 20 Hz HD-tACS, 70 Hz HD-tACS or Sham stimulation for 10 minutes. We extracted resting-state beta power and movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD) values to compare between stimulation frequencies and across time. Results: We found that 20 Hz HD-tACS induced a significant reduction in beta power for electrodes C3 and CP3, while 70 Hz did not have any significant effects. With regards to MRBD, 20 Hz HD-tACS led to more negative values, while 70 Hz HD-tACS resulted in more positive ones for electrodes C3 and FC3. Conclusions: These findings suggest that HD-tACS can modulate beta brain oscillations with frequency specificity. They also highlight the focal impact of HD-tACS, which elicits effects on the cortical region situated directly beneath the stimulation electrode.</p>

	<p>Background and objective: It is commonly known that there is a connection between heart disease and depression symptoms. Compared to heart failure patients without concurrent depression, those with depressive symptoms are more likely to have longer hospital stays and more outpatient visits following discharge. Although the exact neurobiological mechanisms causing the correlation between heart disease and depression symptoms are unknown, it is thought that vascular abnormalities may be a major factor. The purpose of this review was to examine the connection between brain networks linked to depression and heart failure (HF). Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. We included studies that reported both heart failure as well as depression and neuroimaging. Results: We identified 159 papers, but only 12 articles were included. Our findings show that reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) following HF, along with other contributing factors such as chronic inflammation and neurovascular dysfunction, can lead to significant brain tissue damage and disruption of neural networks. The resulting alteration in the brain increases the risk of developing depression, as the neural circuits responsible for emotional regulation become compromised. Conclusions: Individuals with heart failure (HF) exhibit reduced regional cerebral blood flow across multiple brain areas, many of which are critical for mood regulation and are commonly implicated in depression, such as the left frontal cortex and right hippocampus.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The circadian clockwork is implicated in the etiology of addiction, with circadian rhythm disruptions bidirectionally linked to substance abuse, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie this connection are not well known. Methods: Here, we use machine learning to reveal sex- and substance-specific associations with addiction in variants from 51 circadian-related genes (156,702 SNPs) in 98,800 participants from a UK Biobank cohort. We further analyze SNP associations in a subset of the cohort for substance-specific addictions (alcohol, illicit drugs (narcotics), and prescription drugs (opioids)). Results: We find robust (OR &amp;amp;gt; 10) and novel sex-specific and substance-specific associations with variants in synaptic transcription factors (ZBTB20, CHRNB3) and hormone receptors (RORA), particularly in individuals addicted to narcotics and opioids. Circadian-related gene variants associated with male and female addiction were non-overlapping; variants in males primarily involve dopaminergic pathways, while variants in females factor in metabolic and inflammation pathways, with a novel gene association of female addiction with DELEC1, a gene of unknown function. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the complexity of genetic pathways associated with addiction, involving core clock genes and circadian-regulated pathways, and reveal novel circadian-related gene associations that will aid the development of targeted, sex-specific therapeutic interventions for substance abuse.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive deficits and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia are poorly managed by current antipsychotics. In order to develop effective treatments, refining animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders is essential. Methods: To address their multifactorial etiology, we developed a new three-hit mouse model based on the hypoglutamatergic hypothesis of the pathology combined with early stress, offering strong construct validity. Thus, a genetic susceptibility (serine racemase deletion) was associated with an early environmental stress (24 h maternal separation at 9 days of age) and a further pharmacological treatment with phencyclidine (PCP, a glutamate receptor antagonist treatment, 10 mg/kg/day, from 8 to 10 weeks of age). The face validity of this model was assessed in female mice 1 and 6 weeks after the end of PCP treatment by a set of behavioral experiments investigating positive- and negative-like symptoms and cognitive deficits. Results: Our results showed that the three-hit mice displayed persistent hyperlocomotion (positive-like symptoms) and social behavior impairment deficits (negative-like symptoms) but non-persistent spatial working memory deficits (cognitive symptoms). Conclusions: Our work confirms the usefulness of a three-hit combination to model, particularly for negative-like symptoms associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. The model therefore gathers powerful construct and face validities and supports an involvement of glutamate dysfunction in behavioral symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1537/v1?src=rss">Protocol for conducting a scoping review on the influence of low-stakes assessment on student learning in medical education [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Rationale and Background Low-stakes assessments enhance student learning outcomes by providing a comprehensive view of performance and promoting competency-based education. Multiple low-stakes assessments encourage continuous learning and incorporate formative feedback for a realistic and long-term environment. Diverse assessment methods ensure psychometric rigor, utility and a programmatic assessment approach with multiple data points affording high-stakes decisions on progression. Objective This scoping review aims to systematically identify and map existing literature on the use of low-stakes assessments in medical education and determine their impact on student learning outcomes in terms of, motivation and engagement achievements/competencies. Methods and Analysis The review will use the Joanna Briggs Institute’s framework for scoping review studies, searching eight databases and grey literature. A presearch will be done in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using terms related to low-stakes assessment, formative assessment, continuous assessment, and programmatic assessment within the context of medical education. The Covidence Systematic Review tool will aid in screening and conflict resolution. The reference lists of included studies will be checked manually for other relevant literature. Two research team members will independently screen and extract data, resolving discrepancies with a third team member. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be refined iteratively based on key research themes. The review will follow PRISMA-P guidelines, focusing on the impact of low-stakes assessment on student learning in medical education. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required as all data will be collected from published and grey literature. Findings will be disseminated at relevant conferences and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

                <p>by Jessica James, Sebastian Towers, Jakob Foerster, Harrison Steel</p>

Directed evolution can enable engineering of biological systems with minimal knowledge of their underlying sequence-to-function relationships. A typical directed evolution process consists of iterative rounds of mutagenesis and selection that are designed to steer changes in a biological system (e.g. a protein) towards some functional goal. Much work has been done, particularly leveraging advancements in machine learning, to optimise the process of directed evolution. Many of these methods, however, require DNA sequencing and synthesis, making them resource-intensive and incompatible with developments in targeted <i>in vivo</i> mutagenesis. Operating within the experimental constraints of established sorting-based directed evolution techniques (e.g. Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting, FACS), we explore approaches for optimisation of directed evolution that could in future be implemented without sequencing information. We then expand our methods to the context of emerging experimental techniques in directed evolution, which allow for single-cell selection based on fitness objectives defined from any combination of measurable traits. Finally, we explore these alternative strategies on the GB1 and TrpB empirical landscapes, demonstrating that they could lead to up to 19-fold and 7-fold increases respectively in the probability of attaining the global fitness peak.

                <p>by Amit Basak, Supratim Sengupta</p>

Humans navigate diverse social relationships and concurrently interact across multiple social contexts. An individual’s behavior in one context can influence behavior in other contexts. Different payoffs associated with interactions in the different domains have motivated recent studies of the evolution of cooperation through the analysis of multichannel games where each individual is simultaneously engaged in multiple repeated games. However, previous investigations have ignored the potential role of network structure in each domain and the effect of playing against distinct interacting partners in different domains. Multiplex networks provide a useful framework to represent social interactions between the same set of agents across different social contexts. We investigate the role of multiplex network structure and strategy linking in multichannel games on the spread of cooperative behavior in all layers of the multiplex. We find that multiplex structure along with strategy linking enhances the cooperation rate in all layers of the multiplex compared to a well-mixed population in Prisoners’ Dilemma games, provided the network structure is identical across layers. The effectiveness of strategy linking in enhancing cooperation depends on the degree of similarity of the network structure across the layers and perception errors due to imperfect memory. Higher cooperation rates are achieved when the degree of structural overlap of the different layers is sufficiently large, and the probability of perception error is relatively low. Our work reveals how the social network structure in different layers of a multiplex can affect the spread of cooperation by limiting the ability of individuals to link strategies across different social domains.

                <p>by Qi Song, Alex Singh, John E. McDonough, Taylor S. Adams, Robin Vos, Ruben De Man, Greg Myers, Laurens J. Ceulemans, Bart M. Vanaudenaerde, Wim A. Wuyts, Xiting Yan, Jonas Schuppe, James S. Hagood, Naftali Kaminski, Ziv Bar-Joseph</p>

Age prediction based on single cell RNA-Sequencing data (scRNA-Seq) can provide information for patients’ susceptibility to various diseases and conditions. In addition, such analysis can be used to identify aging related genes and pathways. To enable age prediction based on scRNA-Seq data, we developed PolyEN, a new regression model which learns continuous representation for expression over time. These representations are then used by PolyEN to integrate genes to predict an age. Existing and new lung aging data we profiled demonstrated PolyEN’s improved performance over existing methods for age prediction. Our results identified lung epithelial cells as the most significant predictors for non-smokers while lung endothelial cells led to the best chronological age prediction results for smokers.

                <p>by Renata Retkute, William Thurston, Keith Cressman, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>

There is an urgent need for mathematical models that can be used to inform the deployment of surveillance, early warning and management systems for transboundary pest invasions. This is especially important for desert locust, one of the most dangerous migratory pests for smallholder farmers. During periods of desert locust upsurges and plagues, gregarious adult locusts form into swarms that are capable of long-range dispersal. Here we introduce a novel integrated modelling framework for use in predicting gregarious locust populations. The framework integrates the selection of breeding sites, maturation through egg, hopper and adult stages and swarm dispersal in search of areas suitable for feeding and breeding. Using a combination of concepts from epidemiological modelling, weather and environment data, together with an atmospheric transport model for swarm movement we provide a tool to forecast short- and long-term swarm movements. A principal aim of the framework is to provide a practical starting point for use in the next upsurge.

                <p>by Mengya Zhang, Qing Yu</p>

Successful goal-directed behavior requires the maintenance and implementation of abstract task goals on concrete stimulus information in working memory. Previous working memory research has revealed distributed neural representations of task information across cortex. However, how the distributed task representations emerge and communicate with stimulus-specific information to implement flexible goal-directed computations is still unclear. Here, leveraging electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human participants along with state space analyses, we provided converging evidence in support of a low-dimensional neural geometry of goal information congruent with a designed task space, which first emerged in frontal cortex during goal maintenance and then transferred to posterior cortex through frontomedial-to-posterior theta coherence for implementation on stimulus-specific representations. Importantly, the fidelity of the goal geometry was associated with memory performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that abstract goals in working memory are represented in an organized, task-congruent neural geometry for communications from frontal to posterior cortex to enable computations necessary for goal-directed behaviors.

                Background Leukemia, a heterogeneous group of blood cancers, poses significant challenges to global health due to its complexity, diverse risk factors, and variable outcomes. Accurate and early diagnosis is critical but remains a significant hurdle, particularly in low-resource settings. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing offer transformative solutions to improve leukemia detection and classification, addressing limitations in traditional diagnostic methods. Methods This study systematically reviewed over 25,000 scientific articles sourced from Scopus, employing a PRISMA-guided methodology to ensure a comprehensive and rigorous analysis. The analysis focused on the application of AI, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in diagnosing four primary leukemia types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It also examined global epidemiological trends, risk factors, and disparities in healthcare access. Results Key risk factors for leukemia include genetic syndromes like Down syndrome, environmental exposures to toxins such as benzene, ionizing radiation, and viral infections. Socio-economic disparities and geographical differences significantly impact leukemia incidence and outcomes. AI-based models, especially CNNs, demonstrated enhanced accuracy, speed, and reliability in diagnosing leukemia compared to traditional methods. However, challenges such as data variability, model scalability, and unequal access to AI technologies continue to hinder widespread adoption. Conclusion AI and image processing technologies hold immense potential to revolutionize leukemia diagnostics by enabling early detection, precise classification, and personalized treatment planning. Addressing critical challenges, including data standardization and equitable access to these technologies, will be vital for global application. This review highlights the transformative role of AI in improving leukemia outcomes and advancing precision medicine worldwide.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Variants in <i>PRKN</i> and <i>PINK1</i> are the leading cause of early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, yet many cases remain genetically unresolved. We previously identified a 7 megabases complex structural variant in a pair of monozygotic twins using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. This study aims to determine if ONT long-read sequencing can detect a second variant in other unresolved early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) cases with 1 heterozygous <i>PRKN</i> or <i>PINK1</i> variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ONT long-read sequencing was performed on EOPD patients with 1 reported <i>PRKN</i>/<i>PINK1</i> pathogenic variant, with onset age under 50. Positive controls included EOPD patients with 2 known <i>PRKN</i> pathogenic variants. Initial testing involved short-read targeted panel sequencing for single nucleotide variants and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for copy number variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 47 patients were studied (<i>PRKN</i> “one-variant,” n = 23; <i>PINK1</i> “one-variant,” n = 12; <i>PRKN</i> “two-variants,” n = 12). ONT long-read sequencing identified a second pathogenic variant in 26% of <i>PRKN</i> “one-variant” patients (6/23), but none in <i>PINK1</i> “one-variant” patients (0/12). Detected variants included 1 complex inversion, 2 structural variant overlaps, and 3 duplications. In the <i>PRKN</i> “two-variants” group, both variants were identified in all patients (100%, 12/12).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ONT long-read sequencing effectively identifies pathogenic structural variants in the <i>PRKN</i> locus missed by conventional methods. It should be considered for unresolved EOPD cases when a second variant is not detected through conventional approaches. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The Alliance for Healthier Communities is a learning health system that supports Community Health Centres (CHCs) across Ontario, Canada to provide team-based primary health care to people who otherwise experience barriers to care. This case study describes the ongoing process and lessons learned from the first Alliance for Healthier Communities’ Practice Based Learning Network (PBLN) data-driven decision support tool co-development project. Methods We employ an iterative approach to problem identification and methods development for the decision support tool, moving between discussion sessions and case studies with CHC electronic health record (EHR) data. We summarize our work to date in terms of six stages: population-level descriptive-exploratory study, PBLN team engagement, decision support tool problem selection, sandbox case study 1: individual-level risk predictions, sandbox case study 2: population-level planning predictions, project recap and next steps decision. Results The population-level study provided an initial point of engagement to consider how clients are (not) represented in EHR data and to inform problem selection and methodological decisions thereafter. We identified three initial meaningful types of decision support, with target application areas: risk prediction/screening, triaging specialized program referrals, and identifying care access needs. Based on feasibility and expected impact, we started with the goal to support earlier identification of mental health decline after diabetes diagnosis. As discussions deepened around clinical use cases associated with example prediction task set ups, the target problem evolved towards supporting the upstream task of organizational planning and advocacy for adequate mental health care service capacity to meet incoming needs. Conclusions This case study contributes towards a tool to support diabetes and mental health care, as well as lays groundwork for future CHC EHR-based decision support tool initiatives. We share lessons learned and reflections from our process that other primary health care organizations may use to inform their own co-development initiatives while we continue to work on advancing the population-level capacity planning model.

                Background The neglect of visual identity (VI) at the organizational level within higher education institutions (HEIs) has become a critical issue, while previous studies over the past decade has focused on HEI branding and reputation. This creates a potential gap in understanding HEI branding processes. Thus, this study aims to explore the relationship between VI and HEI reputation by integrating the Expressiveness Quotient (EQ) and experiential brand meaning at the organizational level. Method Using a qualitative case study approach, the study involves semi-structured interviews with 29 employees from five top-ranked universities in Indonesia. Furthermore, it analyzes the integration of experiential brand meaning across the stages of awareness, interpretation, appropriation, and communication, alongside the EQ framework to assess how visual identity impacts visibility, distinctiveness, transparency, authenticity, and consistency. Result The findings indicate that visual identity significantly influences perceptions of institutional identity and reputation. Effective management of visual identity elements enhances competitive advantage in academia and aligns internal stakeholder perceptions with external branding, which is essential for a cohesive organizational identity. Conclusion This study emphasizes the strategic importance of visual identity in enhancing institutional reputation and provides a model for universities aiming to strengthen their reputational power through effective visual identity management. The study also reveals strong awareness and acceptance of brand identity.

                Background Mirabegron is a β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) agonist notified only for the treatment of overactive bladder. Bright preclinical results desire that β3-AR agonists manage to correct corpulence-affiliated metabolic affliction by growing brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity, white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis, and insulin sensitivity. Objective to evaluate the effect of mirabegron on lipid profile (serum cholesterol and triglyceride) and BMI in patient with OAB. Materials and Methods In medical city complex (Ghazi AL-Hariri hospital) urology outpatient clinic, a prospective study of 40 patient diagnosed with OAB. These patient a took single dose of mirabegron 50 mg for 4 months and asses it’s the effect during this period on weight and fasting serum cholesterol and triglyceride. Results investigation showed that there is astatically significant reduction from baseline after 2 and 4 months’ treatment with mirabegron (P-value=0.001) in fasting Sr. Triglyceride while fasting serum cholesterol level showed increase in level after 2 and 4 months of treatment. However; this increment not statically significant after 2 months(P-value=0.227) and after 4 months(P-value=0.261) BMI showed slightly reduction after 2 and 4 months’ treatment with mirabegron but also this reduction not statically significant after 2month(P-value=0.114) and after 4 months(P-value=0.562) Conclusion Mirabegron is dependable and direct drug for situation of overactive bladder (OAB) causes useful decline in level of triglyceride and the verdicts display that human BAT metabolic endeavor maybe increased subsequently never-ending pharmacological provocation accompanying mirabegron and support the analysis of β3-AR agonists as a treatment for metabolic ailment.

                Background Dynamic foot posture assessment is essential to determine the pathomechanics of the foot during walking. Currently, there is no affordable method for assessing dynamic foot posture that can be used in a clinical setting. Kinovea, an open-access video analysis-free application, has enabled clinicians to conduct gait analysis at a relatively low cost, but its reliability in assessing dynamic foot posture has not been studied. Methods 32 observations were recorded from various angles throughout the gait cycle, each at varying speeds, and analyzed using Kinovea. Two independent examiners conducted observations to measure the medial longitudinal arch (MLA), first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP 1), ankle inclination (AI), and calcaneal angle (CA). A third examiner was tasked with comparing the results of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two examiners. Result The inter-rater reliability showed promising results despite the observations made at 2, 3, and 4 km/h. MLA and MTP 1 observations remained “excellent” at all speeds, while AI and CA had “good” reliability among observers at 2, 3 and 4 kmph, apart from 4 kmph where AI showed “excellent” reliability. Conclusion In this study, Kinovea showed good and excellent reliability among observers in measuring the MLA, MTP 1, AI, and CA at various speeds. Therefore, a suitable alternative to a 3D motion analyzer may not be readily available in certain facilities.

                Background Stool consistency is an important outcome measure to evaluate in the investigation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) is one of the most commonly used tools for evaluation of stool consistency. BSS ranges from 1-7 and each score is assigned to a given consistency of the feces. Self-reported characterizations can differ from an expert evaluation, and the reliability of BSS is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of BSS by comparing patient scores with expert scores. Methods Patients with inflammatory bowel disease collected stool samples throughout a 3-year follow-up. The stool´s consistency was evaluated with BSS by the patients and matched with an expert score. Agreement between patient and expert scores was assessed using Cohen’s kappa. Results BSS scores from 2280 fecal samples collected from 992 patients at up to five time points were included. When all samples were compared, there was good to substantial agreement between patient and expert scores (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.66-0.72). When the BSS scores were simplified and categorized as 1 (scores 1-2), 2 (scores 3-5) or 3 (scores 6-7), the agreement improved slightly (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.73-0.77). When the scores from the first sample per patient were compared, the experts were more likely to assign higher scores compared to the patient. The proportion of the lowest assigned scores (1-2) was 12.1% for patients and 8.1% for experts. Conclusions The agreement between patient and expert BSS scores is good to substantial, especially when the BSS scores are simplified into three categories.

                Background Certain risk factors have been shown to increase the mortality of patients with neonatal sepsis. This study aimed to determine the risk factors for neonatal sepsis-related mortality. Methods Google Scholar, MEDLINE, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant literature from 2014 to 2023. Observational analytical studies in English that reported the risk factors for neonatal sepsis mortality were chosen. We assessed the risk of bias by using the checklists of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Fixed-effect models were used when the number of included studies was <5; otherwise, random-effects models were employed. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot, and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Statistical significance was set at P <0.05. Analyses were conducted using the RevMan 5.4.1. Results Twelve out of 40,587 articles included a total of 2232 patients. The majority of patients were male (50.4%–70%). The I2 statistics showed no heterogeneity across studies for sex, gestational age, birth weight, or requirement for inotropic support. History of invasive ventilation (OR = 35.06 [16.84–72.99]), requirement for inotropic support (OR = 18.04 [8.38–38.81]), low 1st minute Apgar score (OR = 4.93 [2.1–11.58]), convulsive (OR = 4.69 [2.03–10.82]), poor feeding (OR = 3.95 [2.12–7.33]) episodes, preterm birth (OR = 3.63 [2.78–4.74]), low birth weight (OR = 3.02 [1.58–5.75]), early onset sepsis (OR = 2.52 [1.74–3.64]), and lethargy (OR = 2.14 [1.5–3.04]) were associated with neonatal sepsis mortality. Conclusions A history of invasive ventilation use, requirement for inotropic support, low 1st minute Apgar score, convulsions, poor feeding episodes, preterm birth, low birth weight, early onset sepsis, and lethargy were identified as significant risk factors for neonatal sepsis mortality. Clinicians must be vigilant to improve outcomes and prevent death.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>I have been incredibly fortunate to have worked in the field of hippocampal spatial coding during three of its most exciting decades, the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. During this time I had a ringside view of some of the foundational discoveries that were made which have transformed our understanding of the hippocampal system and its role in cognition (especially spatial cognition) and memory. These discoveries inspired me in my own lab over the years to pursue three broad lines of enquiry—3D spatial encoding, context and the sense of direction—which are outlined here. If some of my personal recollections are a little inaccurate (such is the nature of episodic memory!) I apologize in advance.</p>

                Kochen Rossi et al. performed proximity labeling using the two splice variants of KRAS and defined their differential interactomes. Among the KRAS4A-specific interactors is BIRC6, a large member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. BIRC6 co-localizes with KRAS4A on the Golgi and mono- and di-ubiquitinates KRAS4A but not KRAS4B.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95521">The geometric basis of epithelial convergent extension</a></h4>

              
                Shape changes of epithelia during animal development, such as convergent extension, are achieved through the concerted mechanical activity of individual cells. While much is known about the corresponding large-scale tissue flow and its genetic drivers, fundamental questions regarding local control of contractile activity on the cellular scale and its embryo-scale coordination remain open. To address these questions, we develop a quantitative, model-based analysis framework to relate cell geometry to local tension in recently obtained time-lapse imaging data of gastrulating <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. This analysis systematically decomposes cell shape changes and T1 rearrangements into internally driven, active, and externally driven, passive, contributions. Our analysis provides evidence that germ band extension is driven by active T1 processes that self-organize through positive feedback acting on tensions. More generally, our findings suggest that epithelial convergent extension results from the controlled transformation of internal force balance geometry which combines the effects of bottom-up local self-organization with the top-down, embryo-scale regulation by gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95510">Discarded sequencing reads uncover natural variation in pest resistance in Thlaspi arvense</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science, but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. Here, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress (<i>Thlaspi arvense</i>) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i.e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of <i>Thlaspi arvense</i>, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96284">Full-length direct RNA sequencing uncovers stress granule-dependent RNA decay upon cellular stress</a></h4>

              
                Cells react to stress by triggering response pathways, leading to extensive alterations in the transcriptome to restore cellular homeostasis. The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5ʹ end adapter ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and -nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5ʹ end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on deadenylation or decapping. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome while inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 rescues RNA length. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key component of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress that is dependent on stress granule formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96129">Mapping spatial patterns to energetic benefits in groups of flow-coupled swimmers</a></h4>

              
                The coordinated motion of animal groups through fluids is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion to individuals in the group. However, the connection between the spatial patterns observed in collectively moving animals and the energetic benefits at each position within the group remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we study the spontaneous emergence of cohesive formations in groups of fish, modeled as flapping foils, all heading in the same direction. We show in pairwise formations and with increasing group size that (1) in side-by-side arrangements, the reciprocal nature of flow coupling results in an equal distribution of energy requirements among all members, with reduction in cost of locomotion for swimmers flapping inphase but an increase in cost for swimmers flapping antiphase, and (2) in inline arrangements, flow coupling is non-reciprocal for all flapping phase, with energetic savings in favor of trailing swimmers, but only up to a finite number of swimmers, beyond which school cohesion and energetic benefits are lost at once. We explain these findings mechanistically and we provide efficient diagnostic tools for identifying locations in the wake of single and multiple swimmers that offer opportunities for hydrodynamic benefits to aspiring followers. Our results imply a connection between the resources generated by flow physics and social traits that influence greedy and cooperative group behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97910">Endosomal sorting protein SNX4 limits synaptic vesicle docking and release</a></h4>

              
                Sorting nexin 4 (SNX4) is an evolutionary conserved organizer of membrane recycling. In neurons, SNX4 accumulates in synapses, but how SNX4 affects synapse function remains unknown. We generated a conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model and report that SNX4 cKO synapses show enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation, while the first evoked EPSC was normal. SNX4 depletion did not affect vesicle recycling, basic autophagic flux, or the levels and localization of SNARE-protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2. However, SNX4 depletion affected synapse ultrastructure: an increase in docked synaptic vesicles at the active zone, while the overall vesicle number was normal, and a decreased active zone length. These effects together lead to a substantially increased density of docked vesicles per release site. In conclusion, SNX4 is a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle docking and release. These findings suggest a role for SNX4 in synaptic vesicle recruitment at the active zone.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99862">Dysfunctional S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the dentate gyrus drives vulnerability of chronic pain-related memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Memory impairment in chronic pain patients is substantial and common, and few therapeutic strategies are available. Chronic pain-related memory impairment has susceptible and unsusceptible features. Therefore, exploring the underlying mechanisms of its vulnerability is essential for developing effective treatments. Here, combining two spatial memory tests (Y-maze test and Morris water maze), we segregated chronic pain mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations in a chronic neuropathic pain model induced by chronic constrictive injury of the sciatic nerve. RNA-Seq analysis and gain/loss-of-function study revealed that S1P/S1PR1 signaling is a determinant for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment. Knockdown of the S1PR1 in the dentate gyrus (DG) promoted a susceptible phenotype and led to structural plasticity changes of reduced excitatory synapse formation and abnormal spine morphology as observed in susceptible mice, while overexpression of the S1PR1 and pharmacological administration of S1PR1 agonist in the DG promoted an unsusceptible phenotype and prevented the occurrence of memory impairment, and rescued the morphological abnormality. Finally, the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and biochemical evidence indicated that downregulation of S1PR1 in susceptible mice may impair DG structural plasticity via interaction with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement-related signaling pathways including Itga2 and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 cascade. These results reveal a novel mechanism and provide a promising preventive and therapeutic molecular target for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91083">Intramolecular feedback regulation of the LRRK2 Roc G domain by a LRRK2 kinase-dependent mechanism</a></h4>

              
                The Parkinson’s disease (PD)-linked protein Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) consists of seven domains, including a kinase and a Roc G domain. Despite the availability of several high-resolution structures, the dynamic regulation of its unique intramolecular domain stack is nevertheless still not well understood. By in-depth biochemical analysis, assessing the Michaelis–Menten kinetics of the Roc G domain, we have confirmed that LRRK2 has, similar to other Roco protein family members, a K<sub>M</sub> value of LRRK2 that lies within the range of the physiological GTP concentrations within the cell. Furthermore, the R1441G PD variant located within a mutational hotspot in the Roc domain showed an increased catalytic efficiency. In contrast, the most common PD variant G2019S, located in the kinase domain, showed an increased K<sub>M</sub> and reduced catalytic efficiency, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism from the kinase domain to the G domain. Autophosphorylation of the G1+2 residue (T1343) in the Roc P-loop motif is critical for this phosphoregulation of both the K<sub>M</sub> and the k<sub>cat</sub> values of the Roc-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, most likely by changing the monomer–dimer equilibrium. The LRRK2 T1343A variant has a similar increased kinase activity in cells compared to G2019S and the double mutant T1343A/G2019S has no further increased activity, suggesting that T1343 is crucial for the negative feedback in the LRRK2 signaling cascade. Together, our data reveal a novel intramolecular feedback regulation of the LRRK2 Roc G domain by a LRRK2 kinase-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, PD mutants differently change the kinetics of the GTPase cycle, which might in part explain the difference in penetrance of these mutations in PD patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88879">Bestrophin-4 relays HES4 and interacts with TWIST1 to suppress epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Bestrophin isoform 4 (<i>BEST4</i>) is a newly identified subtype of the calcium-activated chloride channel family. Analysis of colonic epithelial cell diversity by single-cell RNA-sequencing has revealed the existence of a cluster of <i>BEST4</i>+ mature colonocytes in humans. However, if the role of <i>BEST4</i> is involved in regulating tumour progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>BEST4</i> overexpression attenuates cell proliferation, colony formation, and mobility in colorectal cancer (CRC) in vitro, and impedes the tumour growth and the liver metastasis in vivo. BEST4 is co-expressed with hairy/enhancer of split 4 (<i>HES4</i>) in the nucleus of cells, and HES4 signals <i>BEST4</i> by interacting with the upstream region of the <i>BEST4</i> promoter. <i>BEST4</i> is epistatic to <i>HES4</i> and downregulates TWIST1, thereby inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC. Conversely, knockout of BEST4 using CRISPR/Cas9 in CRC cells revitalises tumour growth and induces EMT. Furthermore, the low level of the <i>BEST4</i> mRNA is correlated with advanced and the worse prognosis, suggesting its potential role involving CRC progression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96810">Cytosolic S100A8/A9 promotes Ca2+ supply at LFA-1 adhesion clusters during neutrophil recruitment</a></h4>

              
                S100A8/A9 is an endogenous alarmin secreted by myeloid cells during many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Despite increasing evidence of the proinflammatory effects of extracellular S100A8/A9, little is known about its intracellular function. Here, we show that cytosolic S100A8/A9 is indispensable for neutrophil post-arrest modifications during outside-in signaling under flow conditions in vitro and neutrophil recruitment in vivo, independent of its extracellular functions. Mechanistically, genetic deletion of S100A9 in mice caused dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures in activated neutrophils resulting in reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability at the formed LFA-1/F-actin clusters with defective β<sub>2</sub> integrin outside-in signaling during post-arrest modifications. Consequently, we observed impaired cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell polarization, and spreading, as well as cell protrusion formation in <i>S100a9<sup>-/-</sup></i> compared to wildtype (WT) neutrophils, making <i>S100a9<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells more susceptible to detach under flow, thereby preventing efficient neutrophil recruitment and extravasation into inflamed tissue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93241">N-terminus of Drosophila melanogaster MSL1 is critical for dosage compensation</a></h4>

              
                The male-specific lethal complex (MSL), which consists of five proteins and two non-coding roX RNAs, is involved in the transcriptional enhancement of X-linked genes to compensate for the sex chromosome monosomy in <i>Drosophila</i> XY males compared with XX females. The MSL1 and MSL2 proteins form the heterotetrameric core of the MSL complex and are critical for the specific recruitment of the complex to the high-affinity ‘entry’ sites (HAS) on the X chromosome. In this study, we demonstrated that the N-terminal region of MSL1 is critical for stability and functions of MSL1. Amino acid deletions and substitutions in the N-terminal region of MSL1 strongly affect both the interaction with roX2 RNA and the MSL complex binding to HAS on the X chromosome. In particular, substitution of the conserved N-terminal amino-acids 3–7 in MSL1 (MSL1<sup>GS</sup>) affects male viability similar to the inactivation of genes encoding roX RNAs. In addition, MSL1<sup>GS</sup> binds to promoters such as MSL1<sup>WT</sup> but does not co-bind with MSL2 and MSL3 to X chromosomal HAS. However, overexpression of MSL2 partially restores the dosage compensation. Thus, the interaction of MSL1 with roX RNA is critical for the efficient assembly of the MSL complex on HAS of the male X chromosome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87517">Statistical analysis supports pervasive RNA subcellular localization and alternative 3' UTR regulation</a></h4>

              
                Targeted low-throughput studies have previously identified subcellular RNA localization as necessary for cellular functions including polarization, and translocation. Furthermore, these studies link localization to RNA isoform expression, especially 3’ Untranslated Region (UTR) regulation. The recent introduction of genome-wide spatial transcriptomics techniques enables the potential to test if subcellular localization is regulated in situ pervasively. In order to do this, robust statistical measures of subcellular localization and alternative poly-adenylation (APA) at single-cell resolution are needed. Developing a new statistical framework called SPRAWL, we detect extensive cell-type specific subcellular RNA localization regulation in the mouse brain and to a lesser extent mouse liver. We integrated SPRAWL with a new approach to measure cell-type specific regulation of alternative 3’ UTR processing and detected examples of significant correlations between 3’ UTR length and subcellular localization. Included examples, <i>Timp3</i>, <i>Slc32a1</i>, <i>Cxcl14</i>, and <i>Nxph1</i> have subcellular localization in the mouse brain highly correlated with regulated 3’ UTR processing that includes the use of unannotated, but highly conserved, 3’ ends. Together, SPRAWL provides a statistical framework to integrate multi-omic single-cell resolved measurements of gene-isoform pairs to prioritize an otherwise impossibly large list of candidate functional 3’ UTRs for functional prediction and study. In these studies of data from mice, SPRAWL predicts that 3’ UTR regulation of subcellular localization may be more pervasive than currently known.
