              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Presentation of cytokine profile in relation to oxidative stress parameters in patients with severe COVID-19: a case-control pilot study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: COVID-19 can be worsened by hyper-production of cytokines accompanied by increased level of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between a set of cytokines and the markers of the oxidative stress. Methods: The levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL8, IL-10, VEGF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1α, MCP-1 and EGF were determined by using High Sensitivity Evidence Investigator™ Biochip Array technology. The oxidative stress parameters (d-ROM, PAT, OS index) were measured in serum on FRAS5 analytical photometric system. Results: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, MCP-1 and EGF were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the patients with severe COVID-19 with increased levels of IL-2, IFN-y, TNF-α and IL-1α. The d-ROM, OS index, and PAT were significantly higher (p<0.05) in severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 demonstrated the strongest correlation with all of the markers of the oxidative stress, d-ROM (r=0.9725, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.5000, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.9593, p=0.012). Similar behavior was evidenced between IFN-y and d-ROM (r=0.4006, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.6030, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.4298, p=0.012). Conclusion: The oxidative stress markers show good correlation with the tested cytokines which can be measured at the beginning of the disease in a primary care setting to predict the course of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 disease and led to the pandemic currently affecting the world has been broadly investigated. Different studies have been performed to understand the infection mechanism, and the involved human genes, transcripts and proteins. In parallel, numerous clinical extra-pulmonary manifestations co-occurring with COVID-19 disease have been reported and evidence of their severity and persistence is increasing. Whether these manifestations are linked to other disorders co-occurring with SARS-CoV-2 infection, is under discussion. In this work, we report the identification of toxin-like peptides in COVID-19 patients by application of the Liquid Chromatography Surface-Activated Chemical Ionization – Cloud Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.   Methods: Plasma, urine and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients and control individuals were analysed to study peptidomic toxins’ profiles. Protein precipitation preparation procedure was used for plasma, to remove high molecular weight proteins and efficiently solubilize the peptide fraction; in the case of faeces and urine, direct peptide solubilization was employed.   Results: Toxin-like peptides, almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals, like conotoxins, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, zinc metal proteinases, and bradykinins, were identified in samples from COVID-19 patients, but not in control samples.  Conclusions: The presence of toxin-like peptides could potentially be connected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their presence suggests a possible association between COVID-19 disease and the release in the body of (oligo-)peptides almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals. Their involvement in a large set of heterogeneous extra-pulmonary COVID-19 clinical manifestations, like neurological ones, cannot be excluded. Although the presence of each individual symptom is not selective of the disease, their combination might be related to COVID-19 by the coexistence of the panel of the here detected toxin-like peptides. The presence of these peptides opens new scenarios on the aetiology of the COVID-19 clinical symptoms observed up to now, including neurological manifestations.

	<p>Aims: To introduce resource supporting research on Gulf War illness (GWI) and related disorders, the Gulf War Veterans’ Illnesses Biorepository (GWVIB). Methods: Gulf War era veterans (GWVs) are recruited nationally and enrolled via telephone and email/postal mail. Enrolled veterans receive annual telephone and mail follow-up to collect health data until their passing. A postmortem neuropathological examination is performed, and fixed and frozen brain and spinal cord samples are banked to support research. Investigators studying GWI and related disorders may request tissue and data from the GWVIB. Results: As of September 2021, 127 GWVs from 39 states were enrolled; 60 met the criteria for GWI, and 14 met the criteria for chronic multisymptom illness (CMI). Enrollees have been followed up to six years. Postmortem tissue recoveries were performed on 14 GWVs. The most commonly found neuropathologies included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Lewy body disease. Tissue was of good quality with an average RNA integrity number of 5.8 (SD = 1.0) and ≥4.8 in all of the cases. Discussion: The availability of health data and high-quality CNS tissue from this well-characterized GWV cohort will support research on GWI and related disorders affecting GWVs. Enrollment is ongoing.</p>

Previous work has shown that imagined stimuli elicit similar representations as perceived stimuli throughout the visual cortex. However, while representations during imagery are indeed only caused by feedback processing, neural processing during perception is an interplay of both feedforward and feedback processing. This means that any representational overlap could be because of overlap in feedback processes. In the current study, we aimed to investigate this issue by characterizing the overlap between feedforward- and feedback-initiated category representations during imagined stimuli, conscious perception, and unconscious processing using fMRI in humans of either sex. While all three conditions elicited stimulus representations in left lateral occipital cortex (LOC), significant similarities were observed only between imagery and conscious perception in this area. Furthermore, connectivity analyses revealed stronger connectivity between frontal areas and left LOC during conscious perception and in imagery compared with unconscious processing. Together, these findings can be explained by the idea that long-range feedback modifies visual representations, thereby reducing representational overlap between purely feedforward- and feedback-initiated stimulus representations measured by fMRI. Neural representations influenced by feedback, either stimulus driven (perception) or purely internally driven (imagery), are, however, relatively similar.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Functional Characterization of Ovine Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons Reveal Peripheral Sensitization after Osteochondral Defect</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Knee joint trauma can cause an osteochondral defect (OD), a risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) and cause of debilitating pain in patients. Rodent OD models are less translatable because of their smaller joint size and open growth plate. This study proposes sheep as a translationally relevant model to understand the neuronal basis of OD pain. A unilateral 6-mm deep OD was induced in adult female sheep. Two to six weeks after operation, lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons were collected from the contralateral (Ctrl) and OD side of operated sheep. Functional assessment of neuronal excitability and activity of the pain-related ion channels transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) and P2X3 was conducted using electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify expression of pain-related proteins. We observed that an increased proportion of OD DRG neurons (sheep, <I>N</I> = 3; Ctrl neurons, <I>n</I> = 15, OD neurons, <I>n</I> = 16) showed spontaneous electrical excitability (Ctrl: 20.33 &plusmn; 4.5%; OD: 50 &plusmn; 10%; <I>p</I> = 0.009, unpaired <I>t</I> test) and an increased proportion fired a greater number of spikes above baseline in response to application of a TRPV1 agonist (capsaicin) application (Ctrl: 40%; OD: 75%; <I>p</I> = 0.04, <sup>2</sup> test). Capsaicin also produced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in an increased proportion of isolated OD DRG neurons (Ctrl: 25%; OD: 44%; <I>p</I> = 0.001, <sup>2</sup> test). Neither protein expression, nor functionality of the P2X3 ion channel were altered in OD neurons. Overall, we provide evidence of increased excitability of DRG neurons (an important neural correlate of pain) and TRPV1 function in an OD sheep model. Our data show that functional assessment of sheep DRG neurons can provide important insights into the neural basis of OD pain and thus potentially prevent its progression into arthritic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Intrinsic Functional Connectivity of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex Is Associated with Tolerance to Distress</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to adapt under significant adversity, defined as psychological resilience, is instrumental in preventing stress-related disorders. An important aspect of resilience is the capacity to endure affective distress when in pursuit of goals, also known as distress tolerance. Evidence that links intrinsic baseline interactions within large-scale functional networks with performance under distress remains missing. We hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) may engage in distress tolerance because of its involvement in attention and emotion regulation. Accordingly, we tested whether behavioral performance under distress is associated with baseline resting-state ACC functional connectivity (FC). Distress tolerance was measured in 97 participants using the behavioral indicator of resiliency to distress (BIRD) task. Analyses contrasted participants who quit the task before its designated termination (<I>n</I> = 51) with those who persisted throughout it (<I>n</I> = 46). Seed-based FC analysis indicated greater connectivity between the ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in subjects who persisted throughout the task, along with greater FC between the ACC and the precentral gyrus in those who quit before its termination. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying interindividual differences in the ability to handle distress.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Unbalanced Regulation of {alpha}7 nAChRs by Ly6h and NACHO Contributes to Neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>&alpha;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely expressed in the brain where they promote fast cholinergic synaptic transmission and serve important neuromodulatory functions. However, their high permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> also predisposes them to contribute to disease states. Here, using transfected HEK-tsa cells and primary cultured hippocampal neurons from male and female rats, we demonstrate that two proteins called Ly6h and NACHO compete for access to &alpha;7 subunits, operating together but in opposition to maintain &alpha;7 assembly and activity within a narrow range that is optimal for neuronal function and viability. Using mixed gender human temporal cortex and cultured hippocampal neurons from rats we further show that this balance is perturbed during Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of amyloid &beta; (A&beta;)-driven reduction in Ly6h, with severe reduction leading to increased phosphorylated tau and &alpha;7-mediated neurotoxicity. Ly6h release into human CSF is also correlated with AD severity. Thus, Ly6h links cholinergic signaling, A&beta; and phosphorylated tau and may serve as a novel marker for AD progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One of the earliest and most persistent hypotheses regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD) attributes cognitive impairment to loss of cholinergic signaling. More recently, interest has focused on crucial roles for amyloid &beta; (A&beta;) and phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that these elements are linked by Ly6h and its counterpart, NACHO, functioning in opposition to maintain assembly of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) within the physiological range. Our data suggests that A&beta; shifts the balance away from Ly6h and toward NACHO, resulting in increased assembly of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable nAChRs and thus a conversion of basal cholinergic to neurotoxic signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Constitutive Phosphorylation as a Key Regulator of TRPM8 Channel Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>In mammals, environmental cold sensing conducted by peripheral cold thermoreceptor neurons mostly depends on TRPM8, an ion channel that has evolved to become the main molecular cold transducer. This TRP channel is activated by cold, cooling compounds, such as menthol, voltage, and rises in osmolality. TRPM8 function is regulated by kinase activity that phosphorylates the channel under resting conditions. However, which specific residues, how this post-translational modification modulates TRPM8 activity, and its influence on cold sensing are still poorly understood. By mass spectrometry, we identified four serine residues within the N-terminus (S26, S29, S541, and S542) constitutively phosphorylated in the mouse ortholog. TRPM8 function was examined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and patch-clamp recordings, revealing that treatment with staurosporine, a kinase inhibitor, augmented its cold- and menthol-evoked responses. S29A mutation is sufficient to increase TRPM8 activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is a central molecular determinant of this negative regulation. Biophysical and total internal reflection fluorescence-based analysis revealed a dual mechanism in the potentiated responses of unphosphorylated TRPM8: a shift in the voltage activation curve toward more negative potentials and an increase in the number of active channels at the plasma membrane. Importantly, basal kinase activity negatively modulates TRPM8 function at cold thermoreceptors from male and female mice, an observation accounted for by mathematical modeling. Overall, our findings suggest that cold temperature detection could be rapidly and reversibly fine-tuned by controlling the TRPM8 basal phosphorylation state, a mechanism that acts as a dynamic molecular brake of this thermo-TRP channel function in primary sensory neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Post-translational modifications are one of the main molecular mechanisms involved in adjusting the sensitivity of sensory ion channels to changing environmental conditions. Here we show, for the first time, that constitutive phosphorylation of the well-conserved serine 29 within the N-terminal domain negatively modulates TRPM8 channel activity, reducing its activation by agonists and decreasing the number of active channels at the plasma membrane. Basal phosphorylation of TRPM8 acts as a key regulator of its function as the main cold-transduction channel, significantly contributing to the net response of primary sensory neurons to temperature reductions. This reversible and dynamic modulatory mechanism opens new opportunities to regulate TRPM8 function in pathologic conditions where this thermo-TRP channel plays a critical role.</p>

                <p>Previous studies have shown that infiltration of capsaicin into the surgical site can prevent incision-induced spontaneous pain like behaviors and heat hyperalgesia. In the present study, we aimed to monitor primary sensory neuron Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the intact dorsal root ganglia (DRG) using Pirt-GCaMP3 male and female mice pretreated with capsaicin or vehicle before the plantar incision. Intraplantar injection of capsaicin (0.05%) significantly attenuated spontaneous pain, mechanical, and heat hypersensitivity after plantar incision. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in <I>in vivo</I> DRG and in <I>in situ</I> spinal cord was significantly enhanced in the ipsilateral side compared with contralateral side or naive control. Primary sensory nerve fiber length was significantly decreased in the incision skin area in capsaicin-pretreated animals detected by immunohistochemistry and placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) staining. Thus, capsaicin pretreatment attenuates incisional pain by suppressing Ca<sup>2+</sup> response because of degeneration of primary sensory nerve fibers in the skin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Postoperative surgery pain is a major health and economic problem worldwide with ~235 million major surgical procedures annually. Approximately 50% of these patients report uncontrolled or poorly controlled postoperative pain. However, mechanistic studies of postoperative surgery pain in primary sensory neurons have been limited to <I>in vitro</I> models or small numbers of neurons. Using an innovative, distinctive, and interdisciplinary <I>in vivo</I> populational dorsal root ganglia (DRG) imaging (&gt;1800 neurons/DRG) approach, we revealed increased DRG neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity from postoperative pain mouse model. This indicates widespread DRG primary sensory neuron plasticity. Increased neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity occurs among various sizes of neurons but mostly in small-diameter and medium-diameter nociceptors. Capsaicin pretreatment as a therapeutic option significantly attenuates Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and postoperative pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retinal Ganglion Cell Axon Regeneration Requires Complement and Myeloid Cell Activity within the Optic Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <p>Axon regenerative failure in the mature CNS contributes to functional deficits following many traumatic injuries, ischemic injuries, and neurodegenerative diseases. The complement cascade of the innate immune system responds to pathogen threat through inflammatory cell activation, pathogen opsonization, and pathogen lysis, and complement is also involved in CNS development, neuroplasticity, injury, and disease. Here, we investigated the involvement of the classical complement cascade and microglia/monocytes in CNS repair using the mouse optic nerve injury (ONI) model, in which axons arising from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are disrupted. We report that central complement C3 protein and mRNA, classical complement C1q protein and mRNA, and microglia/monocyte phagocytic complement receptor CR3 all increase in response to ONI, especially within the optic nerve itself. Importantly, genetic deletion of <I>C1q</I>, <I>C3</I>, or <I>CR3</I> attenuates RGC axon regeneration induced by several distinct methods, with minimal effects on RGC survival. Local injections of C1q function-blocking antibody revealed that complement acts primarily within the optic nerve, not retina, to support regeneration. Moreover, C1q opsonizes and CR3<sup>+</sup> microglia/monocytes phagocytose growth-inhibitory myelin debris after ONI, a likely mechanism through which complement and myeloid cells support axon regeneration. Collectively, these results indicate that local optic nerve complement-myeloid phagocytic signaling is required for CNS axon regrowth, emphasizing the axonal compartment and highlighting a beneficial neuroimmune role for complement and microglia/monocytes in CNS repair.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the importance of achieving axon regeneration after CNS injury and the inevitability of inflammation after such injury, the contributions of complement and microglia to CNS axon regeneration are largely unknown. Whereas inflammation is commonly thought to exacerbate the effects of CNS injury, we find that complement proteins C1q and C3 and microglia/monocyte phagocytic complement receptor CR3 are each required for retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration through the injured mouse optic nerve. Also, whereas studies of optic nerve regeneration generally focus on the retina, we show that the regeneration-relevant role of complement and microglia/monocytes likely involves myelin phagocytosis within the optic nerve. Thus, our results point to the importance of the innate immune response for CNS repair.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Akt-mTOR Pathway Drives Myelin Sheath Growth by Regulating Cap-Dependent Translation</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the vertebrate CNS, oligodendrocytes produce myelin, a specialized membrane, to insulate and support axons. Individual oligodendrocytes wrap multiple axons with myelin sheaths of variable lengths and thicknesses. Myelin grows at the distal ends of oligodendrocyte processes, and multiple lines of work have provided evidence that mRNAs and RNA binding proteins localize to myelin, together supporting a model where local translation controls myelin sheath growth. What signal transduction mechanisms could control this? One strong candidate is the Akt-mTOR pathway, a major cellular signaling hub that coordinates transcription, translation, metabolism, and cytoskeletal organization. Here, using zebrafish as a model system, we found that Akt-mTOR signaling promotes myelin sheath growth and stability during development. Through cell-specific manipulations to oligodendrocytes, we show that the Akt-mTOR pathway drives cap-dependent translation to promote myelination and that restoration of cap-dependent translation is sufficient to rescue myelin deficits in mTOR loss-of-function animals. Moreover, an mTOR-dependent translational regulator was phosphorylated and colocalized with mRNA encoding a canonically myelin-translated protein <I>in vivo</I>, and bioinformatic investigation revealed numerous putative translational targets in the myelin transcriptome. Together, these data raise the possibility that Akt-mTOR signaling in nascent myelin sheaths promotes sheath growth via translation of myelin-resident mRNAs during development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the brain and spinal cord, oligodendrocytes extend processes that tightly wrap axons with myelin, a protein- and lipid-rich membrane that increases electrical impulses and provides trophic support. Myelin membrane grows dramatically following initial axon wrapping in a process that demands protein and lipid synthesis. How protein and lipid synthesis is coordinated with the need for myelin to be generated in certain locations remains unknown. Our study reveals that the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway promotes myelin sheath growth by regulating protein translation. Because we found translational regulators of the Akt-mTOR pathway in myelin, our data raise the possibility that Akt-mTOR activity regulates translation in myelin sheaths to deliver myelin on demand to the places it is needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Optogenetic Activation of V1 Interneurons Reveals the Multimodality of Spinal Locomotor Networks in the Neonatal Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the spinal cord, classes of interneurons have been studied <I>in vitro</I> to determine their role in producing or regulating locomotion. It is unclear whether all locomotor behaviors are produced by the same circuitry or engage different subsets of neurons. Here, in neonatal mice of either sex, we test this idea by comparing the actions of a class of spinal, inhibitory interneuron (V1) expressing channelrhodopsin driven by the <I>engrailed-1</I> transcription factor on the rhythms elicited by different methods. We find that, although the overall locomotor activities <I>in vitro</I> are similar, V1 interneuron depolarization produces opposite effects depending of the mode of activation of the locomotor circuitry. The differential behavior of V1 neurons suggests that their function depends on how the locomotor rhythm is activated and is consistent with the idea that the functional organization of the corresponding locomotor networks also differs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neural networks dictating the execution of fictive locomotion are located in the spinal cord. It is generally assumed that the mode of activation of these spinal networks should not change the recruitment or function of neurons. Here, we manipulated the activity of a class of interneuron (V1), which targets these networks and found that their activation induces opposite effects depending on the mode of activation. This suggests that the mode of activation of the spinal networks differentially recruits either V1 interneurons or other interneurons, or both.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Restoring the Molecular Clockwork within the Suprachiasmatic Hypothalamus of an Otherwise Clockless Mouse Enables Circadian Phasing and Stabilization of Sleep-Wake Cycles and Reverses Memory Deficits</a></h4>

              
                <p>The timing and quality of sleep-wake cycles are regulated by interacting circadian and homeostatic mechanisms. Although the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal clock, circadian clocks are active across the brain and the respective sleep-regulatory roles of SCN and local clocks are unclear. To determine the specific contribution(s) of the SCN, we used virally mediated genetic complementation, expressing Cryptochrome1 (Cry1) to establish circadian molecular competence in the suprachiasmatic hypothalamus of globally clockless, arrhythmic male <I>Cry1/Cry2</I>-null mice. Under free-running conditions, the rest/activity behavior of <I>Cry1/Cry2</I>-null controls expressing EGFP (SCN<sup>Con</sup>) was arrhythmic, whereas Cry1-complemented mice (SCN<sup>Cry1</sup>) had coherent circadian behavior, comparable to that of Cry1,2-competent wild types (WTs). In SCN<sup>Con</sup> mice, sleep-wakefulness, assessed by electroencephalography (EEG)/electromyography (EMG), lacked circadian organization. In SCN<sup>Cry1</sup> mice, however, it matched WTs, with consolidated vigilance states [wake, rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REMS (NREMS)] and rhythms in NREMS  power and expression of REMS within total sleep (TS). Wakefulness in SCN<sup>Con</sup> mice was more fragmented than in WTs, with more wake-NREMS-wake transitions. This disruption was reversed in SCN<sup>Cry1</sup> mice. Following sleep deprivation (SD), all mice showed a homeostatic increase in NREMS  power, although the SCN<sup>Con</sup> mice had reduced NREMS during the inactive (light) phase of recovery. In contrast, the dynamics of homeostatic responses in the SCN<sup>Cry1</sup> mice were comparable to WTs. Finally, SCN<sup>Con</sup> mice exhibited poor sleep-dependent memory but this was corrected in SCN<sup>Cry1</sup>mice. In clockless mice, circadian molecular competence focused solely on the SCN rescued the architecture and consolidation of sleep-wake and sleep-dependent memory, highlighting its dominant role in timing sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The circadian timing system regulates sleep-wake cycles. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal circadian clock, but the presence of multiple local brain and peripheral clocks mean the respective roles of SCN and other clocks in regulating sleep are unclear. We therefore used virally mediated genetic complementation to restore molecular circadian functions in the suprachiasmatic hypothalamus, focusing on the SCN, in otherwise genetically clockless, arrhythmic mice. This initiated circadian activity-rest cycles, and circadian sleep-wake cycles, circadian patterning to the intensity of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and circadian control of REMS as a proportion of total sleep (TS). Consolidation of sleep-wake established normal dynamics of sleep homeostasis and enhanced sleep-dependent memory. Thus, the suprachiasmatic hypothalamus, alone, can direct circadian regulation of sleep-wake.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of Pattern Completion Neurons in Neuronal Ensembles Using Probabilistic Graphical Models</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal ensembles are groups of neurons with coordinated activity that could represent sensory, motor, or cognitive states. The study of how neuronal ensembles are built, recalled, and involved in the guiding of complex behaviors has been limited by the lack of experimental and analytical tools to reliably identify and manipulate neurons that have the ability to activate entire ensembles. Such pattern completion neurons have also been proposed as key elements of artificial and biological neural networks. Indeed, the relevance of pattern completion neurons is highlighted by growing evidence that targeting them can activate neuronal ensembles and trigger behavior. As a method to reliably detect pattern completion neurons, we use conditional random fields (CRFs), a type of probabilistic graphical model. We apply CRFs to identify pattern completion neurons in ensembles in experiments using <I>in vivo</I> two-photon calcium imaging from primary visual cortex of male mice and confirm the CRFs predictions with two-photon optogenetics. To test the broader applicability of CRFs we also analyze publicly available calcium imaging data (Allen Institute Brain Observatory dataset) and demonstrate that CRFs can reliably identify neurons that predict specific features of visual stimuli. Finally, to explore the scalability of CRFs we apply them to <I>in silico</I> network simulations and show that CRFs-identified pattern completion neurons have increased functional connectivity. These results demonstrate the potential of CRFs to characterize and selectively manipulate neural circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We describe a graph theory method to identify and optically manipulate neurons with pattern completion capability in mouse cortical circuits. Using calcium imaging and two-photon optogenetics <I>in vivo</I> we confirm that key neurons identified by this method can recall entire neuronal ensembles. This method could be broadly applied to manipulate neuronal ensemble activity to trigger behavior or for therapeutic applications in brain prostheses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Impaired Refinement of Kinematic Variability in Huntington Disease Mice on an Automated Home Cage Forelimb Motor Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>The effective development of novel therapies in mouse models of neurologic disorders relies on behavioral assessments that provide accurate read-outs of neuronal dysfunction and/or degeneration. We designed an automated behavioral testing system (PiPaw), which integrates an operant lever-pulling task directly into the mouse home cage. This task is accessible to group-housed mice 24 h per day, enabling high-throughput longitudinal analysis of forelimb motor learning. Moreover, this design eliminates the need for exposure to novel environments and minimizes experimenter interaction, significantly reducing two of the largest stressors associated with animal behavior. Male mice improved their performance of this task over 1 week of testing by reducing intertrial variability of reward-related kinematic parameters (pull amplitude or peak velocity). In addition, mice displayed short-term improvements in reward rate, and a concomitant decrease in movement variability, over the course of brief bouts of task engagement. We used this system to assess motor learning in mouse models of the inherited neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington disease (HD). Despite having no baseline differences in task performance, male <I>Q175-FDN</I> HD mice were unable to modulate the variability of their movements to increase reward on either short or long timescales. Task training was associated with a decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory activity recorded from striatal medium spiny neurons in the hemisphere contralateral to the trained forelimb in WT mice; however, no such changes were observed in <I>Q175-FDN</I> mice. This behavioral screening platform should prove useful for preclinical drug trials toward improved treatments in HD and other neurologic disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In order to develop effective therapies for neurologic disorders, such as Huntington disease (HD), it is important to be able to accurately and reliably assess the behavior of mouse models of these conditions. Moreover, these behavioral assessments should provide an accurate readout of underlying neuronal dysfunction and/or degeneration. In this paper, we used an automated behavioral testing system to assess motor learning in mice within their home cage. Using this system, we were able to study motor abnormalities in HD mice with an unprecedented level of detail, and identified a specific behavioral deficit associated with an underlying impairment in striatal neuronal plasticity. These results validate the usefulness of this system for assessing behavior in mouse models of HD and other neurologic disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decoding Object-Based Auditory Attention from Source-Reconstructed MEG Alpha Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do we attend to relevant auditory information in complex naturalistic scenes? Much research has focused on detecting which information is attended, without regarding underlying top-down control mechanisms. Studies investigating attentional control generally manipulate and cue specific features in simple stimuli. However, in naturalistic scenes it is impossible to dissociate relevant from irrelevant information based on low-level features. Instead, the brain has to parse and select auditory objects of interest. The neural underpinnings of object-based auditory attention remain not well understood. Here we recorded MEG while 15 healthy human subjects (9 female) prepared for the repetition of an auditory object presented in one of two overlapping naturalistic auditory streams. The stream containing the repetition was prospectively cued with 70% validity. Crucially, this task could not be solved by attending low-level features, but only by processing the objects fully. We trained a linear classifier on the cortical distribution of source-reconstructed oscillatory activity to distinguish which auditory stream was attended. We could successfully classify the attended stream from alpha (8&ndash;14 Hz) activity in anticipation of repetition onset. Importantly, attention could only be classified from trials in which subjects subsequently detected the repetition, but not from miss trials. Behavioral relevance was further supported by a correlation between classification accuracy and detection performance. Decodability was not sustained throughout stimulus presentation, but peaked shortly before repetition onset, suggesting that attention acted transiently according to temporal expectations. We thus demonstrate anticipatory alpha oscillations to underlie top-down control of object-based auditory attention in complex naturalistic scenes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In everyday life, we often find ourselves bombarded with auditory information, from which we need to select what is relevant to our current goals. Previous research has highlighted how we attend to specific highly controlled aspects of the auditory input. Although invaluable, it is still unclear how this relates to attentional control in naturalistic auditory scenes. Here we used the high precision of magnetoencephalography in space and time to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying top-down control of object-based attention in ecologically valid sound scenes. We show that rhythmic activity in auditory association cortex at a frequency of ~10 Hz (alpha waves) controls attention to currently relevant segments within the auditory scene and predicts whether these segments are subsequently detected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Motor Cortex Causally Contributes to Vocabulary Translation following Sensorimotor-Enriched Training</a></h4>

              
                <p>The role of the motor cortex in perceptual and cognitive functions is highly controversial. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the motor cortex can be instrumental for translating foreign language vocabulary. Human participants of both sexes were trained on foreign language (L2) words and their native language translations over 4 consecutive days. L2 words were accompanied by complementary gestures (sensorimotor enrichment) or pictures (sensory enrichment). Following training, participants translated the auditorily presented L2 words that they had learned. During translation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied bilaterally to a site within the primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4) located in the vicinity of the arm functional compartment. Responses within the stimulated motor region have previously been found to correlate with behavioral benefits of sensorimotor-enriched L2 vocabulary learning. Compared to sham stimulation, effective perturbation by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation slowed down the translation of sensorimotor-enriched L2 words, but not sensory-enriched L2 words. This finding suggests that sensorimotor-enriched training induced changes in L2 representations within the motor cortex, which in turn facilitated the translation of L2 words. The motor cortex may play a causal role in precipitating sensorimotor-based learning benefits, and may directly aid in remembering the native language translations of foreign language words following sensorimotor-enriched training. These findings support multisensory theories of learning while challenging reactivation-based theories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the potential for sensorimotor enrichment to serve as a powerful tool for learning in many domains, its underlying brain mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation and a foreign language (L2) learning paradigm, we found that sensorimotor-enriched training can induce changes in L2 representations within the motor cortex, which in turn causally facilitate the translation of L2 words. The translation of recently acquired L2 words may therefore rely not only on auditory information stored in memory or on modality-independent L2 representations, but also on the sensorimotor context in which the words have been experienced.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Excitatory Contribution to Binocular Interactions in Human Visual Cortex Is Reduced in Strabismic Amblyopia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Binocular summation in strabismic amblyopia is typically reported as being absent or greatly reduced in behavioral studies and is thought to be because of a preferential loss of excitatory interactions between the eyes. Here, we studied how excitatory and suppressive interactions contribute to binocular contrast interactions along the visual cortical hierarchy of humans with strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia in both sexes, using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) over a wide range of relative contrast between the two eyes. Dichoptic parallel grating stimuli modulated at unique temporal frequencies in each eye allowed us to quantify spectral response components associated with monocular inputs (self-terms) and the response components because of interaction of the inputs of the two eyes [intermodulation (IM) terms]. Although anisometropic amblyopes revealed a similar pattern of responses to normal-vision observers, strabismic amblyopes exhibited substantially reduced IM responses across cortical regions of interest (V1, V3a, hV4, hMT+ and lateral occipital cortex), indicating reduced interocular interactions in visual cortex. A contrast gain control model that simultaneously fits self- and IM-term responses within each cortical area revealed different patterns of binocular interactions between individuals with normal and disrupted binocularity. Our model fits show that in strabismic amblyopia, the excitatory contribution to binocular interactions is significantly reduced in both V1 and extra-striate cortex, whereas suppressive contributions remain intact. Our results provide robust electrophysiological evidence supporting the view that disruption of binocular interactions in strabismus or amblyopia is because of preferential loss of excitatory interactions between the eyes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We studied how excitatory and suppressive interactions contribute to binocular contrast interactions along the visual cortical hierarchy of humans with normal and amblyopic vision, using source-imaged SSVEP and frequency-domain analysis of dichoptic stimuli over a wide range of relative contrast between the two eyes. A dichoptic contrast gain control model was used to characterize these interactions in amblyopia and provided a quantitative comparison to normal vision. Our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interactions between normal and amblyopic vision. Strabismic amblyopia significantly reduced excitatory contributions to binocular interactions, whereas suppressive contributions remained intact. Our results provide robust evidence supporting the view that the preferential loss of excitatory interactions disrupts binocular interactions in strabismic amblyopia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Critical Role of Astrocyte NAD+ Glycohydrolase in Myelin Injury and Regeneration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Western-style diets cause disruptions in myelinating cells and astrocytes within the mouse CNS. Increased CD38 expression is present in the cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models of demyelination and CD38 is the main nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-depleting enzyme in the CNS. Altered NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism is linked to both high fat consumption and multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we identify increased CD38 expression in the male mouse spinal cord following chronic high fat consumption, after focal toxin [lysolecithin (LL)]-mediated demyelinating injury, and in reactive astrocytes within active MS lesions. We demonstrate that CD38 catalytically inactive mice are substantially protected from high fat-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, oligodendrocyte loss, oxidative damage, and astrogliosis. A CD38 inhibitor, 78c, increased NAD<sup>+</sup> and attenuated neuroinflammatory changes induced by saturated fat applied to astrocyte cultures. Conditioned media from saturated fat-exposed astrocytes applied to oligodendrocyte cultures impaired myelin protein production, suggesting astrocyte-driven indirect mechanisms of oligodendrogliopathy. In cerebellar organotypic slice cultures subject to LL-demyelination, saturated fat impaired signs of remyelination effects that were mitigated by concomitant 78c treatment. Significantly, oral 78c increased counts of oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons after focal LL-induced spinal cord demyelination. Using a RiboTag approach, we identified a unique <I>in vivo</I> brain astrocyte translatome profile induced by 78c-mediated CD38 inhibition in mice, including decreased expression of proinflammatory astrocyte markers and increased growth factors. Our findings suggest that a high-fat diet impairs oligodendrocyte survival and differentiation through astrocyte-linked mechanisms mediated by the NAD<sup>+</sup>ase CD38 and highlights CD38 inhibitors as potential therapeutic candidates to improve myelin regeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin disturbances and oligodendrocyte loss can leave axons vulnerable, leading to permanent neurologic deficits. The results of this study suggest that metabolic disturbances, triggered by consumption of a diet high in fat, promote oligodendrogliopathy and impair myelin regeneration through astrocyte-linked indirect nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-dependent mechanisms. We demonstrate that restoring NAD<sup>+</sup> levels via genetic inactivation of CD38 can overcome these effects. Moreover, we show that therapeutic inactivation of CD38 can enhance myelin regeneration. Together, these findings point to a new metabolic targeting strategy positioned to improve disease course in multiple sclerosis and other conditions in which the integrity of myelin is a key concern.</p>

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the revealing manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts as probiotics on the growth performance, relative organ weight, blood parameters, and immune responses of broiler: A meta-analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The number of publications in Scopus on this topic increased from less than 50 in 1995 to more than 250 in 2015. In other hand, inconsistency in results about the correlation between yeast and lactic acid bacteria as probiotics has been evident since the early publications on use in broilers. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to determine relationship between lactic acid bacteria and yeast as probiotics to broiler diets on the growth performance, relative organ weight, blood parameters, and immune response of the broiler.  A database was designed based on published data that reported the use of probiotics on the broiler. The method used for selecting articles was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. Articles selected were taken from PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Science direct databases as well as individual. Results: The final database consists of 49 in vivo articles, 93 studies, and 225 treatments. The analysis statement in the system was a PROC MIXED procedure of SAS software. The level of probiotic increased (p <0.001) body weight, body weight gain, and feed intake of broiler. There was a reduction (p <0.01) on feed conversion ratio and mortality on the level probiotic given to broiler. Supplementation of probiotics in broiler diet increased (p <0.001) the weight of liver, spleen, gizzard, bursa of fabricius and carcass yield, while reduced (p<0.001) abdominal fat weight. The probiotic given increased the total of red and white blood cells (both at p < 0.001) but did not affect lymphocyte.  Discussion: It can be concluded the yeast act as supporting agent that serves lactic acid bacteria as probiotic increases the growth performance, relative organ weight, blood parameters, and immune response of the broiler.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modular assembly of dynamic models in systems biology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Pan, Peter J. Gawthrop, Joseph Cursons, Edmund J. Crampin</p>

It is widely acknowledged that the construction of large-scale dynamic models in systems biology requires complex modelling problems to be broken up into more manageable pieces. To this end, both modelling and software frameworks are required to enable modular modelling. While there has been consistent progress in the development of software tools to enhance model reusability, there has been a relative lack of consideration for how underlying biophysical principles can be applied to this space. Bond graphs combine the aspects of both modularity and physics-based modelling. In this paper, we argue that bond graphs are compatible with recent developments in modularity and abstraction in systems biology, and are thus a desirable framework for constructing large-scale models. We use two examples to illustrate the utility of bond graphs in this context: a model of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade to illustrate the reusability of modules and a model of glycolysis to illustrate the ability to modify the model granularity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Steady-state measures of visual suppression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel H. Baker, Greta Vilidaite, Alex R. Wade</p>

In the early visual system, suppression occurs between neurons representing different stimulus properties. This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The novel anti-CRISPR AcrIIA22 relieves DNA torsion in target plasmids and impairs SpyCas9 activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin J. Forsberg, Danica T. Schmidtke, Rachel Werther, Ruben V. Uribe, Deanna Hausman, Morten O. A. Sommer, Barry L. Stoddard, Brett K. Kaiser, Harmit S. Malik</p>

To overcome CRISPR-Cas defense systems, many phages and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) encode CRISPR-Cas inhibitors called anti-CRISPRs (Acrs). Nearly all characterized Acrs directly bind Cas proteins to inactivate CRISPR immunity. Here, using functional metagenomic selection, we describe AcrIIA22, an unconventional Acr found in hypervariable genomic regions of clostridial bacteria and their prophages from human gut microbiomes. AcrIIA22 does not bind strongly to SpyCas9 but nonetheless potently inhibits its activity against plasmids. To gain insight into its mechanism, we obtained an X-ray crystal structure of AcrIIA22, which revealed homology to PC4-like nucleic acid–binding proteins. Based on mutational analyses and functional assays, we deduced that <i>acrIIA22</i> encodes a DNA nickase that relieves torsional stress in supercoiled plasmids. This may render them less susceptible to SpyCas9, which uses free energy from negative supercoils to form stable R-loops. Modifying DNA topology may provide an additional route to CRISPR-Cas resistance in phages and MGEs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Plasmid fitness costs are caused by specific genetic conflicts enabling resolution by compensatory mutation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James P. J. Hall, Rosanna C. T. Wright, Ellie Harrison, Katie J. Muddiman, A. Jamie Wood, Steve Paterson, Michael A. Brockhurst</p>

Plasmids play an important role in bacterial genome evolution by transferring genes between lineages. Fitness costs associated with plasmid carriage are expected to be a barrier to gene exchange, but the causes of plasmid fitness costs are poorly understood. Single compensatory mutations are often sufficient to completely ameliorate plasmid fitness costs, suggesting that such costs are caused by specific genetic conflicts rather than generic properties of plasmids, such as their size, metabolic burden, or gene expression level. By combining the results of experimental evolution with genetics and transcriptomics, we show here that fitness costs of 2 divergent large plasmids in <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> are caused by inducing maladaptive expression of a chromosomal tailocin toxin operon. Mutations in single genes unrelated to the toxin operon, and located on either the chromosome or the plasmid, ameliorated the disruption associated with plasmid carriage. We identify one of these compensatory loci, the chromosomal gene <i>PFLU4242</i>, as the key mediator of the fitness costs of both plasmids, with the other compensatory loci either reducing expression of this gene or mitigating its deleterious effects by up-regulating a putative plasmid-borne ParAB operon. The chromosomal mobile genetic element Tn6291, which uses plasmids for transmission, remained up-regulated even in compensated strains, suggesting that mobile genetic elements communicate through pathways independent of general physiological disruption. Plasmid fitness costs caused by specific genetic conflicts are unlikely to act as a long-term barrier to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) due to their propensity for amelioration by single compensatory mutations, helping to explain why plasmids are so common in bacterial genomes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurodevelopmental delays and frontal lobe cortical dysmaturation are widespread among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest pool of neural stem/progenitor cells in the postnatal brain. Our aim is to determine the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on neurogenesis and cortical maturation in piglets whose SVZ development is similar to human infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three-week-old piglets (n = 29) were randomly assigned to control (no surgery), mild-CPB (34°C full flow for 60 minutes) and severe-CPB groups (25°C circulatory-arrest for 60 minutes). The SVZ and frontal lobe were analyzed with immunohistochemistry 3 days and 4 weeks postoperatively. MRI of the frontal lobe was used to assess cortical development.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SVZ neurogenic activity was reduced up to 4 weeks after both mild and severe CPB-induced insults. CPB also induced decreased migration of young neurons to the frontal lobe, demonstrating that CPB impairs postnatal neurogenesis. MRI 4 weeks after CPB displayed a decrease in gyrification index and cortical volume of the frontal lobe. Cortical fractional anisotropy was increased after severe CPB injury, indicating a prolonged deleterious impact of CPB on cortical maturation. Both CPB-induced insults displayed a significant change in densities of three major inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the frontal cortex. In addition, different CPB insults altered different subpopulations of inhibitory neurons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced neurological impairments. Further refinement of CPB hardware and techniques is necessary to improve long-term frontal cortical dysmaturation observed in children with CHD. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Background: Censoring frequently occurs in disease data analysis, which is a key characteristic of time to failure modeling. Typically, time to failure studies are conducted through non-parametric and semi-parametric modelling techniques. Parametric models provide more efficient estimates, but are seldomly used, because of some of the limitations and assumptions which need to be fulfilled to apply them. The aim of this study is to illustrate the theoretical and application limitations and performance of different flexible and standard parametric models to evaluate the prognostic value for mortality risk of breast cancer after recurrence among women. Methods: This article describes the theoretical properties of flexible parametric models and compares their performances to standard parametric models, by studying mortality in women diagnosed with breast cancer. We describe how time to failure data may be analyzed with nonlinear flexible models. In this regard, we apply fractional polynomials, spline models, piecewise exponential models, and piecewise exponential additive mixed models. We also illustrate properties of standard parametric models. All analyses have been conducted with multiple covariates to identify significant predictors. Information criteria have been used to evaluate performances of models. Results: Fractional polynomial and spline-based generalized additive models work well in capturing local fluctuations. Parameter estimation with a piecewise exponential additive mixed model (PAMM) as an extension of the piecewise exponential modelling (PEM) approach automatically penalizes model complexity, which is very helpful to avoid over fitting. Conclusions: Flexible parametric time to failure models are more efficient than standard parametric time to failure models. By incorporating time dependent covariates, PAMM is a good approach to perform in-depth studies of predictors over different finite intervals of follow-up time. Until now, this approach is rarely used in time to failure right censored studies.

                Machine learning approaches have been fruitfully applied to several neurophysiological signal classification problems. Considering the relevance of emotion in human cognition and behaviour, an important application of machine learning has been found in the field of emotion identification based on neurophysiological activity. Nonetheless, there is high variability in results in the literature depending on the neuronal activity measurement, the signal features and the classifier type. The present work aims to provide new methodological insight into machine learning applied to emotion identification based on electrophysiological brain activity. For this reason, we analysed previously recorded EEG activity measured while emotional stimuli, high and low arousal (auditory and visual) were provided to a group of healthy participants. Our target signal to classify was the pre-stimulus onset brain activity. Classification performance of three different classifiers (LDA, SVM and kNN) was compared using both spectral and temporal features. Furthermore, we also contrasted the performance of static and dynamic (time evolving) approaches. The best static feature-classifier combination was the SVM with spectral features (51.8%), followed by LDA with spectral features (51.4%) and kNN with temporal features (51%). The best dynamic feature‑classifier combination was the SVM with temporal features (63.8%), followed by kNN with temporal features (63.70%) and LDA with temporal features (63.68%). The results show a clear increase in classification accuracy with temporal dynamic features.

                Dudok et al. introduce a transgenic mouse line for selectively labeling hippocampal axo-axonic cells (AACs). AACs are activated by movements in awake, behaving mice and exert inhibitory postsynaptic effects on CA1 pyramidal cells. During a spatial navigation task, location-specific AAC silencing induces novel place fields in pyramidal cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during economic choices under variable action costs</a></h4>

              
                The role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACCd) in decision making has often been discussed but remains somewhat unclear. On the one hand, numerous studies implicated this area in decisions driven by effort or action cost. On the other hand, work on economic choices between goods (under fixed action costs) found that neurons in ACCd encoded only post-decision variables. To advance our understanding of the role played by this area in decision making, we trained monkeys to choose between different goods (juice types) offered in variable amounts and with different action costs. Importantly, the task design dissociated computation of the action cost from planning of any particular action. Neurons in ACCd encoded the chosen value and the binary choice outcome in several reference frames (chosen juice, chosen cost, chosen action). Thus, this area provided a rich representation of post-decision variables. In contrast to the OFC, neurons in ACCd did not represent pre-decision variables such as individual offer values in any reference frame. Hence, ongoing decisions are unlikely guided by ACCd. Conversely, neuronal activity in this area might inform subsequent actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Simplifying the development of portable, scalable, and reproducible workflows</a></h4>

              
                Command-line software plays a critical role in biology research. However, processes for installing and executing software differ widely. The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a community standard that addresses this problem. Using CWL, tool developers can formally describe a tool’s inputs, outputs, and other execution details. CWL documents can include instructions for executing tools inside software containers. Accordingly, CWL tools are portable—they can be executed on diverse computers—including personal workstations, high-performance clusters, or the cloud. CWL also supports workflows, which describe dependencies among tools and using outputs from one tool as inputs to others. To date, CWL has been used primarily for batch processing of large datasets, especially in genomics. But it can also be used for analytical steps of a study. This article explains key concepts about CWL and software containers and provides examples for using CWL in biology research. CWL documents are text-based, so they can be created manually, without computer programming. However, ensuring that these documents conform to the CWL specification may prevent some users from adopting it. To address this gap, we created ToolJig, a Web application that enables researchers to create CWL documents interactively. ToolJig validates information provided by the user to ensure it is complete and valid. After creating a CWL tool or workflow, the user can create ‘input-object’ files, which store values for a particular invocation of a tool or workflow. In addition, ToolJig provides examples of how to execute the tool or workflow via a workflow engine. ToolJig and our examples are available at <a href="https://github.com/srp33/ToolJig">https://github.com/srp33/ToolJig</a>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of irreversible somatic differentiation</a></h4>

              
                A key innovation emerging in complex animals is irreversible somatic differentiation: daughters of a vegetative cell perform a vegetative function as well, thus, forming a somatic lineage that can no longer be directly involved in reproduction. Primitive species use a different strategy: vegetative and reproductive tasks are separated in time rather than in space. Starting from such a strategy, how is it possible to evolve life forms which use some of their cells exclusively for vegetative functions? Here, we develop an evolutionary model of development of a simple multicellular organism and find that three components are necessary for the evolution of irreversible somatic differentiation: (i) costly cell differentiation, (ii) vegetative cells that significantly improve the organism’s performance even if present in small numbers, and (iii) large enough organism size. Our findings demonstrate how an egalitarian development typical for loose cell colonies can evolve into germ-soma differentiation dominating metazoans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Control of Arabidopsis shoot stem cell homeostasis by two antagonistic CLE peptide signalling pathways</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell homeostasis in plant shoot meristems requires tight coordiantion between stem cell proliferation and cell differentiation. In Arabidopsis, stem cells express the secreted dodecapeptide CLAVATA3 (CLV3), which signals through the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-receptor kinase CLAVATA1 (CLV1) and related CLV1-family members to downregulate expression of the homeodomain transcription factor <i>WUSCHEL</i> (<i>WUS</i>). WUS protein moves from cells below the stem cell domain to the meristem tip and promotes stem cell identity, together with <i>CLV3</i> expression, generating a negative feedback loop. How stem cell activity in the meristem centre is coordinated with organ initiation and cell differentiation at the periphery is unknown. We show here that the <i>CLE40</i> gene, encoding a secreted peptide closely related to CLV3, is expressed in the SAM in differentiating cells in a pattern complementary to that of <i>CLV3</i>. <i>CLE40</i> promotes <i>WUS</i> expression via BAM1, a CLV1-family receptor, and <i>CLE40</i> expression is in turn repressed in a <i>WUS</i>-dependent manner. Together, <i>CLE40-BAM1-WUS</i> establish a second negative feedback loop. We propose that stem cell homeostasis is achieved through two intertwined pathways that adjust WUS activity and incorporate information on the size of the stem cell domain, via <i>CLV3-CLV1</i>, and on cell differentiation via <i>CLE40-BAM1</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tbx5 drives aldh1a2 expression to regulate a RA-Hedgehog-Wnt gene regulatory network coordinating cardiopulmonary development</a></h4>

              
                The gene regulatory networks that coordinate the development of the cardiac and pulmonary systems are essential for terrestrial life but poorly understood. The T-box transcription factor Tbx5 is critical for both pulmonary specification and heart development, but how these activities are mechanistically integrated remains unclear. Here using <i>Xenopus</i> and mouse embryos, we establish molecular links between Tbx5 and retinoic acid (RA)-signaling in the mesoderm and between RA signaling and sonic hedgehog expression in the endoderm to unveil a conserved RA-Hedgehog-Wnt signaling cascade coordinating cardiopulmonary development. We demonstrate that Tbx5 directly maintains expression of <i>aldh1a2, </i>the RA-synthesizing enzyme, in the foregut lateral plate mesoderm via an evolutionarily conserved intronic enhancer. Tbx5 promotes posterior second heart field identity in a positive feedback loop with RA, antagonizing a Fgf8-Cyp regulatory module to restrict FGF activity to the anterior. We find that Tbx5/Aldh1a2-dependent RA signaling directly activates <i>shh</i> transcription in the adjacent foregut endoderm through a conserved MACS1 enhancer. Hedgehog signaling coordinates with Tbx5 in the mesoderm to activate expression of <i>wnt2/2b,</i> which induces pulmonary fate in the foregut endoderm. These results provide mechanistic insight into the interrelationship between heart and lung development informing cardiopulmonary evolution and birth defects.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A bacterial membrane sculpting protein with BAR domain-like activity</a></h4>

              
                Bin/Amphiphysin/RVS (BAR) domain proteins belong to a superfamily of coiled-coil proteins influencing membrane curvature in eukaryotes and are associated with vesicle biogenesis, vesicle-mediated protein trafficking, and intracellular signaling. Here we report a bacterial protein with BAR domain-like activity, BdpA, from <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> MR-1, known to produce redox-active membrane vesicles and micrometer-scale outer membrane extensions (OMEs). BdpA is required for uniform size distribution of membrane vesicles and influences scaffolding of OMEs into a consistent diameter and curvature. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy reveals a strain lacking BdpA produces lobed, disordered OMEs rather than membrane tubules or narrow chains produced by the wild type strain. Overexpression of BdpA promotes OME formation during planktonic growth of <i>S. oneidensis</i> where they are not typically observed. Heterologous expression results in OME production in <i>Marinobacter atlanticus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Based on the ability of BdpA to alter membrane architecture <i>in vivo</i>, we propose that BdpA and its homologs comprise a newly identified class of bacterial BAR domain-like proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter microstructural and morphometric alterations in autism: Implications for intellectual and verbal capabilities</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuroimage literature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a moderate-to-high risk of bias, partially because those combined with intellectual impairment (II) and/or minimally verbal (MV) status are generally ignored. We aimed to provide more comprehensive insights into white matter alterations of ASD, inclusive of individuals with II (ASD-II-Only) or MV expression (ASD-MV). Methods: Sixty-five participants with ASD (ASD-Whole; 16.6{+/-}5.9 years; comprising 34 intellectually able youth, ASD-IA, and 31 intellectually impaired youth, ASD-II, including 24 ASD-II-Only plus 7 ASD-MV) and 38 demographic-matched typically developing controls (TDC; 17.3{+/-}5.6 years) were scanned in accelerated diffusion-weighted MRI. Fixel-based analysis was undertaken to investigate the categorical differences in fiber density (FD), fiber cross-section (FC), and a combined index (FDC), and brain-symptom/cognition associations. Results: ASD-Whole had reduced FD in the anterior and posterior corpus callosum and left cerebellum Crus I, and smaller FDC in right cerebellum Crus II, compared to TDC. ASD-II, relative to TDC, showed almost identical alterations to those from ASD-Whole vs. TDC. ASD-II-Only had greater FD/FDC in the isthmus-splenium of callosum than ASD-MV. Autistic severity negatively correlated with FC in right Crus I. Non-verbal full-scale IQ positively correlated with FC/FDC in cerebellum VI. FD/FDC of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed a diagnosis-by-executive function interaction. Conclusions: ASD-associated white matter alterations appear driven by individuals combined with II and/or MV. Results suggest that changes in the corpus callosum and cerebellum are key for psychopathology and cognition associated with ASD. Our work highlights an essential to include understudied sub-populations on the spectrum in research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Benchmarking functional connectivity by the structure and geometry of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The brain's structural connectivity supports the propagation of electrical impulses, manifesting as patterns of co-activation, termed functional connectivity. Functional connectivity emerges from the underlying sparse structural connections, particularly through poly-synaptic communication. As a result, functional connections between brain regions without direct structural links are numerous, but their organization is not completely understood. Here we investigate the organization of functional connections without direct structural links. We develop a simple, data-driven method to benchmark functional connections with respect to their underlying structural and geometric embedding. We then use this method to re-weigh and re-express functional connectivity. We find evidence of unexpectedly strong functional connectivity within the canonical intrinsic networks of the brain. We also find unexpectedly strong functional connectivity at the apex of the unimodal-transmodal hierarchy. Our results suggest that both phenomena -- functional modules and functional hierarchies -- emerge from functional interactions that transcend the underlying structure and geometry. These findings also potentially explain recent reports that structural and functional connectivity gradually diverge in transmodal cortex. Collectively, we show how structural connectivity and geometry can be used as a natural frame of reference with which to study functional connectivity patterns in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representations of temporal community structure in hippocampus and precuneus predict inductive reasoning decisions</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the world is shaped by inferences about underlying structure. For example, at the gym, you might notice that the same people tend to arrive around the same time and infer that they are friends that work out together. Consistent with this idea, after participants are presented with a temporal sequence of objects that follows an underlying community structure, they are biased to infer that objects from the same community share the same properties. Here, we used fMRI to measure neural representations of objects after temporal community structure learning and examine how these representations support inference about object relationships. We found that community structure learning affected inferred object similarity: when asked to spatially group items based on their experience, participants tended to group together objects from the same community. Neural representations in perirhinal cortex predicted individual differences in object grouping, suggesting that high-level object representations are affected by temporal community learning. Furthermore, participants were biased to infer that objects from the same community would share the same properties. Using computational modeling of temporal learning and inference decisions, we found that inductive reasoning is influenced by both detailed knowledge of temporal statistics and abstract knowledge of the temporal communities. The fidelity of temporal community representations in hippocampus and precuneus predicted the degree to which temporal community membership biased reasoning decisions. Our results suggest that temporal knowledge is represented at multiple levels of abstraction, and that perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, and precuneus may support inference based on this knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampus-striatum wiring diagram revealed by directed stepwise polysynaptic tracing</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus and the striatum represent two major systems in the brain for learning, memory and navigation. Although they were traditionally considered as two parallel systems responsible for distinct types of learning or navigation, increasing evidence indicates a close synergetic or competitive interaction between them. Both the hippocampus and the striatum consist of multiple anatomical and functional domains. Besides the limited direct projection from the hippocampus to the ventral striatum, most of the functional interaction between them may be mediated by polysynaptic projections. Polysynaptic connectivity has been difficult to examine due to a lack of methods to continuously track the pathways in a controlled manner. Here we developed a novel approach for directed stepwise polysynaptic tracing by reconstituting a replication-deficient retrograde transneuronal virus - pseudorabies virus lacking gene IE180 (PRV{Delta}IE. We minimized PRV neurotoxicity by temporally restricting viral replication; and enabled both anatomical tracing and functional analysis of the circuits. With these tools, we delineated a hippocampus striatum wiring diagram, which consists of pathways from specific functional domains in the hippocampus to corresponding domains in the striatum via distinct intermediate regions. This polysynaptic wring diagram provides a structural foundation for further elucidation of the interaction between the hippocampus and the stratum in multiple brain functions.

                Why can't we keep as many items as we want in working memory? It has long been debated whether this resource limitation is a bug (a downside of our fallible biological system) or instead a feature (an optimal response to a computational problem). We propose that the resource limitation is a consequence of a useful feature. Specifically, we propose that flexible cognition requires time-based binding, and time-based binding necessarily limits the number of (bound) memoranda that can be stored simultaneously. Time-based binding is most naturally instantiated via neural oscillations, for which there exists ample experimental evidence. We report simulations that illustrate this theory and that relate it to empirical data. We also compare the theory to several other (feature and bug) resource theories.

                In neurons, endoplasmic reticulum forms a highly dynamic network that enters axons and presynaptic terminals and plays a central role in Ca2+ homeostasis and synapse maintenance. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in regulation of its dynamic remodeling as well as its function in axon development and presynaptic differentiation remain elusive. Here, we used high resolution microscopy and live cell imaging to investigate rapid movements of endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes in axons of cultured motoneurons after stimulation with Brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Our results indicate that the endoplasmic reticulum extends into axonal growth cone filopodia where its integrity and dynamic remodeling are regulated mainly by actin and its motor protein myosin VI. Additionally, we found that in axonal growth cones, ribosomes assemble into 80S subunits within seconds and associate with ER in response to extracellular stimuli which describes a novel function of axonal ER in dynamic regulation of local translation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intermanual transfer of visuomotor learning is facilitated by a cognitive strategy</a></h4>

              
                Humans continuously adapt their movement to a novel environment by recalibrating their sensorimotor system. Recent evidence, however, shows that explicit planning to compensate for external changes, i.e. a cognitive strategy, can also aid performance. If such a strategy is indeed planned in external space, it should improve performance in an effector independent manner. We tested this hypothesis by examining whether promoting a cognitive strategy during a visual-force adaptation task performed in one hand can facilitate learning for the opposite hand. Participants rapidly adjusted the height of visual bar on screen to a target level by isometrically exerting force on a handle using their right hand. Visuomotor gain increased during the task and participants learned the increased gain. Visual feedback was continuously provided for one group, while for another group only the endpoint of the force trajectory was presented. The latter has been reported to promote cognitive strategy use. We found that endpoint feedback produced stronger intermanual transfer of learning and slower response times than continuous feedback. In a separate experiment, we confirmed that the aftereffect is indeed reduced when only endpoint feedback is provided, a finding that has been consistently observed when cognitive strategies are used. The results suggest that intermanual transfer can be facilitated by a cognitive strategy. This indicates that the behavioral observation of intermanual transfer can be achieved either by forming an effector-independent motor representation, or by sharing an effector-independent cognitive strategy between the hands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural dynamics of illusory tactile pulling sensations</a></h4>

              
                The sensation of directional forces and their associated sensorimotor commands are inextricably intertwined, complicating the identification of brain circuits responsible for tactile pulling sensations. One hypothesis is that, like tactile frequency discrimination, pulling sensations are generated by early sensory-frontal activity. Alternatively, they may be generated later in the somatosensory association cortex. To dissociate these accounts and uncouple the pulling sensation from unrelated but correlated sensory and motor processing, we combined high-density EEG with an oddball paradigm and asymmetric vibration, which creates an illusory sensation of the hand being directionally pulled. Oddballs that created a pulling sensation in the opposite direction to common stimuli were compared to the same oddballs in the context of neutral common stimuli (symmetric vibration) and to neutral oddballs. Brain responses to having directional pulling expectations violated by directional stimuli were therefore isolated. Contrary to the sensory-frontal account, frontal N140 brain activity was actually larger for neutral than pulling oddballs. Instead, pulling sensations were associated with amplitude and latency modulations of midline P200 and P3b potentials, and specifically, to contralateral parietal lobe activity 280ms post-stimulus. The timing of this activity suggested pulling sensations involve spatial processing, such as tactile remapping between coordinate frames. Source localization showed this activity to be centered on the postcentral sulcus, superior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus, suggesting that pulling sensations arise via the processing of body position, tactile orientation and peripersonal space. Our results demonstrate how tactile illusions can uniquely disambiguate parietal contributions to somatosensation by removing unrelated sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictive regulation of cardiovascular system on emergence of auditory-motor interaction in young infants</a></h4>

              
                Humans develop auditory-motor interaction to produce a variety of rhythmic sounds using body movements, which are often produced and amplified with tools, such as drumming. The extended production of sounds allows us to express a wide range of emotions, accompanied by physiological changes. According to previous studies, even young infants exhibit movements in response to auditory feedback. However, their exhibition of physiological adaptation on emergence of auditory-motor interaction is unclear. We investigated the heart rate change associated with auditory feedback to spontaneous limb movements in 3-month-old infants. The results showed that, in response to the auditory feedback, infants begin to increase heart rate more selectively immediately before the timing of the feedback. Furthermore, they gradually suppress the peak intensity of the heart rate increase through auditory-motor experience. These findings suggest that emergence of auditory-motor interaction in young infants involves predictive regulation to implicitly maintain homeostasis in the cardiovascular system. The predictive regulation, which is referred to as allostasis, may contribute to the prolonged sound production and provide a developmental basis for more sophisticated goal-directed behavior of producing rhythmic sounds.

                Relating individual differences in cognitive traits to brain functional organization is a long-lasting challenge for the neuroscience community. Individual intelligence scores were previously predicted from whole-brain connectivity patterns, extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired at rest. Recently, it was shown that task-induced brain activation maps outperform these resting-state connectivity patterns in predicting individual intelligence, suggesting that a cognitively demanding environment improves prediction of cognitive abilities. Here, we use data from the Human Connectome Project to predict task-induced brain activation maps from resting-state fMRI, and proceed to use these predicted activity maps to further predict individual differences in a variety of traits. While models based on original task activation maps remain the most accurate, models based on predicted maps significantly outperformed those based on the resting-state connectome. Thus, we provide a promising approach for the evaluation of measures of human behavior from brain activation maps, that could be used without having participants actually perform the tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual alpha power predicts language comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Alpha power attenuation during cognitive task performing has been suggested to reflect a process of release of inhibition, increase of excitability, and thereby benefit the improvement of performance. Here, we hypothesized that changes in individual alpha power during the execution of a complex language comprehension task may correlate with the individual performance in that task. We tested this using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recorded during comprehension of German sentences of different syntactic complexity. Results showed that neither the frequency nor the power of the spontaneous oscillatory activity at rest were associated with the individual performance. However, during the execution of a sentences processing task, the individual alpha power attenuation did correlate with individual language comprehension performance. Source reconstruction localized effects in temporal-parietal regions of both hemispheres. While the effect of increased task difficulty is localized in the right hemisphere, the difference in power attenuation between tasks of different complexity exhibiting a correlation with performance was localized in left temporal-parietal brain regions known to be associated with language processing. From our results, we conclude that in-task attenuation of individual alpha power is related to the essential mechanisms of the underlying cognitive processes, rather than merely to general phenomena like attention or vigilance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fetal cerebellar development: 3D morphometric analysis of fetal postmortem MRI among Chinese fetuses.</a></h4>

              
                The development of the cerebellum starts from early gestational period and extends postnatal. Because of its protracted development, the cerebellum is susceptible to developmental anomalies such as Dandy-Walker malformations, Blakes pouch cysts and vermin hypoplasia. Measurements of fetal cerebellar parameters of a normal growing fetus in each week of gestation is important for setting up morphometric standards and hence used as clinical reference data. Any deviation from the normal cerebellar parameters alerts the clinicians for the possibility of presence of cerebellar malformations. Study objective: The objective of this study was to assess the fetal cerebellar growth by quantifying the following parameters; fetal cerebellar volume, anterior-posterior diameter and superior-inferior diameter. Methods: We used 3T and 7T MRI to scan the postmortem fetal brains at different stages of development and subsequently analyze the images using ITK-SNAP software. Results: The mean superior-inferior cerebellar diameter was found to be 19.12+2. 70mm.The linear(y=bo+b1t) model was the best fit (r2=0.996, F=32022.961) to describe the relationship between the gestational age and the superior-inferior diameter(y=5.89+0.49t). There was significant correlation between the superior-inferior cerebellar diameter and the gestation age, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.999, r=0.001. The median cerebellar volume was 8607.7mm, the mean rank high among males(78.12) as compared to female(68.25). There was no statistically significant difference of the cerebellar volume between males and females (u=2193.5,p=0.16). The quadratic(y=bo+b1t+b2t2) model was the best fit regression equation (r2=0.994,F=10791.157) describing the relationship between the cerebellar volume and the gestational age. The median anterior-posterior diameter was 12.45 mm. There was significant correlation between anterior-posterior diameter and the gestational age with Spearmans rho of (0.997, p=0.01). The linear model was the best fit the best fit model (y=bo+b1t) describing the relationship between anterior-posterior diameter and the gestational age(y=3.31+0.5t) r2=0.998, F=70646.838. Conclusion: Significant correlation between the superior-inferior cerebellar diameters, the anterior-posterior cerebellar diameter and the gestational age was found. These two linear parameters follow the first-degree polynomial in relation to the gestational age. The cerebellar volume follows the second-degree polynomial as it increases with the gestational age and correlate significantly with the gestational age. This study has provided new insight to the development of the cerebellum, and setup a benchmark data of which the deviation from it will alert the clinicians for the possibility of presence of cerebellar malformations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural and functional asymmetry of the neonatal cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Features of brain asymmetry have been implicated in a broad range of cognitive processes; however, their origins are still poorly understood. Using a new left-right symmetric, spatiotemporal cortical surface atlas, we investigated cortical asymmetries in 442 healthy newborn infants soon after birth, using structural and functional magnetic resonance images from the Developing Human Connectome Project. We identified previously unrecognised structural and functional asymmetries in auditory, visual and sensorimotor cortices, which closely resemble known asymmetries in adults. These findings show that cortical asymmetries are largely determined prenatally and suggest that they may constrain the development of lateralised functions in later life. In adults, deviations in brain asymmetry have been implicated in a broad range of developmental and psychiatric disorders, some of which have been associated with abnormal perinatal neurodevelopment. To test the hypothesis that normal cortical asymmetry is disrupted in the perinatal period by severe environmental stress, we compared cortical asymmetries between the same group of term neonates and 103 preterm neonates imaged at term-equivalent age. No significant differences were seen between these two cohorts, showing that the development of cortical asymmetries proceeds largely unaffected by preterm birth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Standardized Protocol for Quantifying the Behavioral Dynamics of Food-seeking in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Food is generally hidden in a natural environment and require free-living animals to search for it. Although such food-seeking behaviors involve motivation and exploration, previous studies examined food-seeking simply by measuring the time spent in the food zone or the frequency of pursuing food-cued context. Moreover, after discovering food, animals need to taste and smell it in order to evaluate their nutritional value or possible toxicity. However, researchers could not easily distinguish food-seeking from food-evaluating behaviors because food was visible or accessible throughout each test. Herein, we describe a behavioral protocol that triggers animals to show the behavioral dynamics of food-seeking (e.g., navigation, nose-digging, and paw-digging) and that exclusively elicits food-seeking without provoking any other food-evaluating behaviors. First, we prepared an open-field box with the floor covered with bedding. After we hid foods under the bedding of each corner, the test mice were habituated in this arena for four days (pre-test phase). On the next day (test phase), they were placed under the same conditions, but the foods previously hidden were removed. This process enabled the mice to perceive their surroundings as a food-hidden environment, which induced the animal to exhibit sustained food-seeking. In conclusion, the protocol presented here is a powerful method for provoking multiple forms of food-seeking and quantifies food-seeking independently from other food-related behavioral stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-micronized and micronized curcumin do not prevent the behavioral and neurochemical effects induced by acute stress in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Curcumin, a polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), presents neuroprotective properties and can modulate neuronal pathways related to mental disorders. However, curcumin has low bioavailability, which can compromise its use. The micronization process can reduce the mean particle diameter and improve this compound bioavailability and therapeutic potential. In this study, we compared the behavioral (in the open tank test, OTT) and neurochemical (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels) effects of non-micronized curcumin (CUR, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and micronized curcumin (MC, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) in adult zebrafish subjected to 90-minute acute restraint stress (ARS). ARS increased the time spent in the central area and the number of crossings and decreased the immobility time of the animals. These results suggest an increase in locomotor activity and a decrease in thigmotaxis behavior in the OTT. Furthermore, ARS also induced oxidative damage by increasing TBARS and decreasing NPSH levels. ARS-induced behavioral and biochemical effects were not blocked by any curcumin preparation. Therefore, we suppose that curcumin does not have anti-stress effects on the ARS in zebrafish.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct dendritic Ca2+ spike forms produce opposing input-output transformations in rat CA3 pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                Proper integration of different inputs targeting the dendritic tree of CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs) is critical for associative learning and recall. Dendritic Ca2+ spikes have been proposed to perform associative computations in other PC types, by detecting conjunctive activation of different afferent input pathways, initiating afterdepolarization (ADP) and triggering burst firing. Implementation of such operations fundamentally depends on the actual biophysical properties of dendritic Ca2+ spikes; yet little is known about these properties in dendrites of CA3PCs. Using dendritic patch-clamp recordings and two-photon Ca2+ imaging in acute slices from male rats we report that, unlike CA1PCs, distal apical trunk dendrites of CA3PCs exhibit distinct forms of dendritic Ca2+ spikes. Besides ADP-type global Ca2+ spikes, a majority of dendrites expresses a novel, fast Ca2+ spike type that is initiated locally without backpropagating action potentials, can recruit additional Na+ currents, and is compartmentalized to the activated dendritic subtree. Occurrence of the different Ca2+ spike types correlates with dendritic structure, indicating morpho-functional heterogeneity among CA3PCs. Importantly, ADPs and dendritically initiated spikes produce opposing somatic output: bursts versus strictly single action potentials, respectively. The uncovered variability of dendritic Ca2+ spikes may underlie heterogeneous input-output transformation and bursting properties of CA3PCs, and might specifically contribute to key associative and non-associative computations performed by the CA3 network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Realization of phosphorylation hypothesis of sleep by mammalian CaMKIIβ</a></h4>

              
                The reduced sleep duration observed in Camk2a and Camk2b knockout mice revealed the role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)/CAMKII{beta} as sleep-promoting kinases and lead to the phosphorylation hypothesis of sleep. However, the underlying mechanism of sleep regulation by kinases and protein phosphorylation is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation states of CaMKII{beta} regulates sleep duration and sleep needs. Importantly, the activation or inhibition of CaMKII{beta} can increase or decrease sleep duration by almost two-fold, supporting the role of CaMKII{beta} as a core sleep regulator in mammals. This sleep regulation depends on the kinase activity of CaMKII{beta} in excitatory neurons. Furthermore, CaMKII{beta} mutants mimicking different phosphorylation states can regulate various sleep steps including sleep induction, sleep maintenance, and sleep cancelation. Key CaMKII{beta} residues responsible for the mode switch undergo ordered (auto-)phosphorylation. We thus propose that ordered multi-site phosphorylation of CaMKII{beta} underlies multi-step sleep regulation in mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Specific N-glycans regulate an extracellular adhesion complex during somatosensory dendrite patterning</a></h4>

              
                N-glycans are molecularly diverse sugars borne by over 70% of proteins transiting the secretory pathway and have been implicated in protein folding, stability, and localization. Mutations in genes important for N-glycosylation result in congenital disorders of glycosylation that are often associated with intellectual disability. Here, we show that structurally distinct N-glycans regulate the activity of an extracellular protein complex involved in patterning of somatosensory dendrites in Caenorhabditis elegans. Specifically, aman-2/Golgi alpha-mannosidase II, a conserved key enzyme in the biosynthesis of specific N-glycans regulates the activity of the Menorin adhesion complex without obviously affecting protein stability and localization of its components. AMAN-2 functions cell-autonomously to ensure decoration of the neuronal transmembrane receptor DMA-1/LRR-TM with high-mannose/hybrid N-glycans. Moreover, distinct types of N-glycans on specific N-glycosylation sites regulate the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor, which together with three other extracellular proteins forms the Menorin adhesion complex. In summary, specific N-glycan structures regulate dendrite patterning by coordinating the activity of an extracellular adhesion complex suggesting that the molecular diversity of N-glycans can contribute to developmental specificity in the nervous system.

	<p>The ability to efficiently recognize the emotions on others’ faces is something that most of us take for granted. Children with callous-unemotional (CU) traits and impulsivity/conduct problems (ICP), such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, have been previously described as being “fear blind”. This is also associated with looking less at the eye regions of fearful faces, which are highly diagnostic. Previous attempts to intervene into emotion recognition strategies have not had lasting effects on participants’ fear recognition abilities. Here we present both (a) additional evidence that there is a two-part causal chain, from personality traits to face recognition strategies using the eyes, then from strategies to rates of recognizing fear in others; and (b) a pilot intervention that had persistent effects for weeks after the end of instruction. Further, the intervention led to more change in those with the highest CU traits. This both clarifies the specific mechanisms linking personality to emotion recognition and shows that the process is fundamentally malleable. It is possible that such training could promote empathy and reduce the rates of antisocial behavior in specific populations in the future.</p>

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent in children. Attention deficits are among the most common and persistent post-TBI cognitive and behavioral sequalae that can contribute to adverse outcomes. This study investigated the topological properties of the functional brain network for sustained attention processing and their dynamics in 42 children with severe post-TBI attention deficits (TBI-A) and 47 matched healthy controls. Functional MRI data during a block-designed sustained attention task was collected for each subject, with each full task block further divided into the pre-, early, late-, and post-stimulation stages. The task-related functional brain network was constructed using the graph theoretic technique. Then, the sliding-window-based method was utilized to assess the dynamics of the topological properties in each stimulation stage. Relative to the controls, the TBI-A group had significantly reduced nodal efficiency and/or degree of left postcentral, inferior parietal, inferior temporal, and fusiform gyri and their decreased stability during the early and late-stimulation stages. The left postcentral inferior parietal network anomalies were found to be significantly associated with elevated inattentive symptoms in children with TBI-A. These results suggest that abnormal functional network characteristics and their dynamics associated with the left parietal lobe may significantly link to the onset of the severe post-TBI attention deficits in children.</p>

	<p>Previous research has shown that rope jumping improves physical health; however, little is known about its impact on brain-derived monoamine neurotransmitters associated with cognitive regulation. To address these gaps in the literature, the present study compared outcomes between 15 healthy participants (mean age, 23.1 years) after a long-rope jumping exercise and a control condition. Long-rope jumping also requires co-operation between people, attention, spatial cognition, and rhythm sensation. Psychological questionnaires were administered to both conditions, and Stroop task performance and monoamine metabolite levels in the saliva and urine were evaluated. Participants performing the exercise exhibited lower anxiety levels than those in the control condition. Saliva analyses showed higher 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (a norepinephrine metabolite) levels, and urine analyses revealed higher 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a serotonin metabolite) levels in the exercise condition than in the control. Importantly, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level correlated with salivary and urinary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels in the exercise condition. Furthermore, cognitive results revealed higher Stroop performance in the exercise condition than in the control condition; this performance correlated with salivary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels. These results indicate an association between increased 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and attention in long-rope jumping. We suggest that long-rope jumping predicts central norepinephrinergic activation and related attention maintenance.</p>

	<p>People with schizophrenia often experience a profound lack of motivation for social affiliation—a facet of negative symptoms that detrimentally impairs functioning. However, the mechanisms underlying social affiliative deficits remain poorly understood, particularly under realistic social contexts. Here, we investigated subjective reports and electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity in schizophrenia during a live social interaction. Individuals with schizophrenia (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 29) completed a face-to-face interaction with a confederate while having EEG recorded. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Closeness condition designed to elicit feelings of closeness through self-disclosure or a Small-Talk condition with minimal disclosure. Compared to controls, patients reported lower positive emotional experiences and feelings of closeness across conditions, but they showed comparably greater subjective affiliative responses for the Closeness (vs. Small-Talk) condition. Additionally, patients in the Closeness (vs. Small-Talk) condition displayed a global increase in connectivity in theta and alpha frequency bands that was not observed for controls. Importantly, greater theta and alpha connectivity was associated with greater subjective affiliative responding, greater negative symptoms, and lower disorganized symptoms in patients. Collectively, findings indicate that patients, because of pronounced negative symptoms, utilized a less efficient, top-down mediated strategy to process social affiliation.</p>

	<p>Vicarious threat learning is an important pathway in learning about safety and danger in the environment and is therefore critical for survival. It involves learning by observing another person’s (the demonstrator) fearful responses to threat and begins as early as infancy. The review discusses the literature on vicarious threat learning and infers how this learning pathway may evolve over human development. We begin by discussing the methods currently being used to study observational threat learning in the laboratory. Next, we focus on the social factors influencing vicarious threat learning; this is followed by a review of vicarious threat learning among children and adolescents. Finally, we examine the neural mechanisms underpinning vicarious threat learning across human development. To conclude, we encourage future research directions that will help elucidate how vicarious threat learning emerges and how it relates to the development of normative fear and pathological anxiety.</p>

	<p>Dysprosody is a hallmark of dysarthria, which can affect the intelligibility and naturalness of speech. This includes sentence accent, which helps to draw listeners’ attention to important information in the message. Although some studies have investigated this feature, we currently lack properly validated automated procedures that can distinguish between subtle performance differences observed across speakers with dysarthria. This study aims for cross-population validation of a set of acoustic features that have previously been shown to correlate with sentence accent. In addition, the impact of dysarthria severity levels on sentence accent production is investigated. Two groups of adults were analysed (Dutch and English speakers). Fifty-eight participants with dysarthria and 30 healthy control participants (HCP) produced sentences with varying accent positions. All speech samples were evaluated perceptually and analysed acoustically with an algorithm that extracts ten meaningful prosodic features and allows a classification between accented and unaccented syllables based on a linear combination of these parameters. The data were statistically analysed using discriminant analysis. Within the Dutch and English dysarthric population, the algorithm correctly identified 82.8 and 91.9% of the accented target syllables, respectively, indicating that the capacity to discriminate between accented and unaccented syllables in a sentence is consistent with perceptual impressions. Moreover, different strategies for accent production across dysarthria severity levels could be demonstrated, which is an important step toward a better understanding of the nature of the deficit and the automatic classification of dysarthria severity using prosodic features.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Breathing is an essential function that requires both metabolic (or au-tomatic) and voluntary (behavioral) control during wakefulness but during sleep depends on metabolic control via peripheral and central chemoreceptors. Breathing during sleep disordered breathing also depends on the maturity of the neural centers and the strength of the respiratory muscles. We do not know if the response to apnea varies with age. (2) Methods: We measured the obstructive apneas and hypopneas during REM and NREM in polysomnography studies from children referred for snoring. Exclusion criteria: younger than 1 year of age, neuromuscular or syndrome comorbidity, oxygen or positive airway pressure, central apnea, and studies with loss of airflow sensors. (3) Results: Two-hundred-and-sixty-eight sleep studies were included. Mean age was 8.7 years (4.68 SD), range 1–18 years, 160 were male, and 108 were female. The 5th centile of apnea duration during NREM is above 8 s at all ages, with a tendency to increase in the oldest groups up to 10 s. During REM sleep, it shows a gradual increase from 6 s in the youngest children to 10 s in the oldest. (4) Conclusions: Apnea/hypopnea length increases with age in children and adolescents independently from sex or severity of OSA. Using adult criteria in teens seems to be accurate.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a common mental illness and a large number of researchers have been still devoted to exploring effective biomarkers for the identification of depression. Few researches have been conducted on functional connectivity (FC) during sleep in depression. In this paper, a novel depression characterization is proposed using specific spatial FC features of sleep electroencephalography (EEG). Overnight polysomnography recordings were obtained from 26 healthy individuals and 25 patients with depression. The weighted phase lag indexes (WPLIs) of four frequency bands and five sleep periods were obtained from 16 EEG channels. The high discriminative connections extracted via feature evaluation and the cross-within variation (CW)—the spatial feature constructed to characterize the different performances in inter- and intra-hemispheric FC based on WPLIs, were utilized to classify patients and normal controls. The results showed that enhanced average FC and spatial differences, higher inter-hemispheric FC and lower intra-hemispheric FC, were found in patients. Furthermore, abnormalities in the inter-hemispheric connections of the temporal lobe in the theta band should be important indicators of depression. Finally, both CW and high discriminative WPLI features performed well in depression screening and CW was more specific for characterizing abnormal cortical EEG performance of depression. Our work investigated and characterized the abnormalities in sleep cortical activity in patients with depression, and may provide potential biomarkers for assisting with depression identification and new insights into the understanding of pathological mechanisms in depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge creation in IT projects to accelerate digital innovation: two decade systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The interactivity and ubiquity of digital technologies are exerting a significant impact on the knowledge creation in information technology (KC-IT) projects. According to the literature, the critical relevance of KC-IT is highly associated with digital innovation (DI) for organisational success. However, DI is not yet a fully-fledged research subject but is an evolving corpus of theory and practise that draws from a variety of social science fields. Given the preceding setting, this study explores the interaction of KC-IT with DI. This work provides a systemic literature review (SLR) to examine the literature in KC-IT and its connection to DI. A SLR of 527 papers from 2001 to 2021 was performed across six online databases. The review encompasses quantitative and qualitative studies on KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Three major gaps were found in the SLR. Firstly, only 57 (0.23%) papers were found to examine the association between KC and IT projects. These works were analysed for theories, type of papers, KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Secondly, the convergence reviews indicate that scarce research has examined TMS and trust in KC-IT as factors. Thirdly, only 0.02% (5) core papers appeared in the search relevant to KC in IT projects to accelerate DI. The majority of the papers examined were not linked to DI. A significant gap also exists in these areas. These findings warrant the attention of the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Team Flow Is a Unique Brain State Associated with Enhanced Information Integration and Interbrain Synchrony</a></h4>

              
                <p>Team flow occurs when a group functions in a high task engagement to achieve a goal, commonly seen in performance and sports. Team flow can enable enhanced positive experiences, as compared with individual flow or regular socializing. However, the neural basis for this enhanced behavioral state remains unclear. Here, we identified neural correlates (NCs) of team flow in human participants using a music rhythm task with electroencephalogram hyperscanning. Experimental manipulations held the motor task constant while disrupting the corresponding hedonic music to interfere with the flow state or occluding the partner&rsquo;s positive feedback to impede team interaction. We validated these manipulations by using psychometric ratings and an objective measure for the depth of flow experience, which uses the auditory-evoked potential (AEP) of a task-irrelevant stimulus. Spectral power analysis at both the scalp sensors and anatomic source levels revealed higher &beta;- power specific to team flow in the left middle temporal cortex (L-MTC). Causal interaction analysis revealed that the L-MTC is downstream in information processing and receives information from areas encoding the flow or social states. The L-MTC significantly contributes to integrating information. Moreover, we found that team flow enhances global interbrain integrated information (II) and neural synchrony. We conclude that the NCs of team flow induce a distinct brain state. Our results suggest a neurocognitive mechanism to create this unique experience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of Trigeminal Sensory Neuronal Types Innervating Masseter Muscle</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Understanding masseter muscle (MM) innervation is critical for the study of cell-specific mechanisms of pain induced by temporomandibular disorder (TMDs) or after facial surgery. Here, we identified trigeminal (TG) sensory neuronal subtypes (MM TG neurons) innervating MM fibers, masseteric fascia, tendons, and adjusted tissues. A combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on TG neurons back-traced from reporter mouse MM found nine distinct subtypes of MM TG neurons. Of these neurons, 24% belonged to non-peptidergic IB-4<sup>+</sup>/TRPA1<sup>&ndash;</sup> or IB-4<sup>+</sup>/TRPA1<sup>+</sup> groups, while two TRPV1<sup>+</sup> small-sized neuronal groups were classified as peptidergic/CGRP<sup>+</sup>. One small-sized CGRP<sup>+</sup> neuronal group had a unique electrophysiological profile and were recorded from Nav1.8<sup>&ndash;</sup> or trkC<sup>+</sup> neurons. The remaining CGRP<sup>+</sup> neurons were medium-sized, could be divided into Nav1.8<sup>&ndash;</sup>/trkC<sup>&ndash;</sup> and Nav1.8<sup>low</sup>/trkC<sup>+</sup> clusters, and showed large 5HT-induced current. The final two MM TG neuronal groups were trkC<sup>+</sup> and had no Nav1.8 and CGRP. Among MM TG neurons, TRPV1<sup>+</sup>/CGRP<sup>&ndash;</sup> (somatostatin<sup>+</sup>), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)<sup>+</sup> (C-LTMR), TRPM8<sup>+</sup>, MrgprA3<sup>+</sup>, or trkB<sup>+</sup> (A-LTMR) subtypes have not been detected. Masseteric muscle fibers, tendons and masseteric fascia in mice and the common marmoset, a new world monkey, were exclusively innervated by either CGRP<sup>+</sup>/NFH<sup>+</sup> or CGRP<sup>&ndash;</sup>/NFH<sup>+</sup> medium-to-large neurons, which we found using a Nav1.8-YFP reporter, and labeling with CGRP, TRPV1, neurofilament heavy chain (NFH) and pgp9.5 antibodies. These nerves were mainly distributed in tendon and at junctions of deep-middle-superficial parts of MM. Overall, the data presented here demonstrates that MM is innervated by a distinct subset of TG neurons, which have unique characteristics and innervation patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Individual bacteria in structured environments rely on phenotypic resistance to phage</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erin L. Attrill, Rory Claydon, Urszula Łapińska, Mario Recker, Sean Meaden, Aidan T. Brown, Edze R. Westra, Sarah V. Harding, Stefano Pagliara</p>

Bacteriophages represent an avenue to overcome the current antibiotic resistance crisis, but evolution of genetic resistance to phages remains a concern. In vitro, bacteria evolve genetic resistance, preventing phage adsorption or degrading phage DNA. In natural environments, evolved resistance is lower possibly because the spatial heterogeneity within biofilms, microcolonies, or wall populations favours phenotypic survival to lytic phages. However, it is also possible that the persistence of genetically sensitive bacteria is due to less efficient phage amplification in natural environments, the existence of refuges where bacteria can hide, and a reduced spread of resistant genotypes. Here, we monitor the interactions between individual planktonic bacteria in isolation in ephemeral refuges and bacteriophage by tracking the survival of individual cells. We find that in these transient spatial refuges, phenotypic resistance due to reduced expression of the phage receptor is a key determinant of bacterial survival. This survival strategy is in contrast with the emergence of genetic resistance in the absence of ephemeral refuges in well-mixed environments. Predictions generated via a mathematical modelling framework to track bacterial response to phages reveal that the presence of spatial refuges leads to fundamentally different population dynamics that should be considered in order to predict and manipulate the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of bacteria–phage interactions in naturally structured environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trajectories of somatic drug utilization patterns in Major Depressive Disorder: A Study protocol for a Danish nationwide register study using Latent Class Analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Major Depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous, multi-etiological disorder that is associated with chronic medical conditions and a high somatic treatment burden. A better understanding of the somatic diseases and treatment burden in MDD can be provided through a mapping of the somatic drug utilization patterns over time. The objective of this study is therefore to characterize the somatic drug profiles and their transitions over time (i.e. trajectories) among MDD patients.    Methods: This descriptive study will be a nationwide register-based study including all Danish patients with an incident MDD diagnosis between 2011 and 2015. Using Latent Class Analysis, we will identify homogenous MDD patient subgroups according to somatic drug utilization (i.e. drug profiles). The development in somatic drug profiles will be depicted in four different time intervals from three years prior to the MDD diagnosis to three years after the diagnosis. Patients will be assigned to the latent class (drug profile) to which they have the highest probability of belonging using modal assignment. The treatment trajectories will be performed by cross tabulating these assignments.  Discussion: Profiles and trajectories of somatic drug use will provide a new perspective on patterns of somatic drug burden in MDD patients. Moreover, identifying homogenous subgroups of MDD patients regarding somatic drug use can contribute to a deeper understanding of MDD etiology. In the future, this knowledge could help optimizing MDD treatment by studying if different antidepressants will show different efficacy and safety depending on the profiles and trajectories of somatic diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Deep supervised hashing for gait retrieval [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gait recognition is perceived as the most promising biometric approach for future decades especially because of its efficient applicability in surveillance systems. Due to recent growth in the use of gait biometrics across surveillance systems, the ability to rapidly search for the required data has become an emerging need. Therefore, we addressed the gait retrieval problem, which retrieves people with gaits similar to a query subject from a large-scale dataset. Methods: This paper presents the deep gait retrieval hashing (DGRH) model to address the gait retrieval problem for large-scale datasets. Our proposed method is based on a supervised hashing method with a deep convolutional network. We use the ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the semantic gait features for feature representation and learn the compact hash codes with the compatible hash function. Therefore, our DGRH model combines gait feature learning with binary hash codes. In addition, the learning loss is designed with a classification loss function that learns to preserve similarity and a quantization loss function that controls the quality of the hash codes Results: The proposed method was evaluated against the CASIA-B, OUISIR-LP, and OUISIR-MVLP benchmark datasets and received the promising result for gait retrieval tasks. Conclusions: The end-to-end deep supervised hashing model is able to learn discriminative gait features and is efficient in terms of the storage memory and speed for gait retrieval.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reducing sources of variance in experimental procedures in in vitro research [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lack of reproducibility in preclinical research is a problem posing ethical and economic challenges for biomedical science. Various institutional activities from society stakeholders of leading industry nations are currently underway to improve the situation. Such initiatives usually attempt to tackle high-level organisational issues and do not typically focus on improving experimental approaches per se. Addressing these is necessary in order to increase consistency and success rates of lab-to-lab repetitions. Methods: In this project, we statistically evaluated repetitive data of a very basic and widely applied lab procedure, namely quantifying the number of viable cells. The purpose of this was to appreciate the impact of different parameters and instrumentations that may constitute sources of variance in this procedure. Conclusion: By comparing the variations of data acquired under two different procedures, featuring improved stringency of protocol adherence, our project attempts to propose guidelines on how to reduce such variations. We believe our work can contribute to tackling the repeatability crisis in biomedical research.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual pathways of the brain are organized into parallel channels that code different features of the external environment. In the current study, we investigated the anatomical organization of parallel pathways from the superior colliculus (SC) to the pulvinar nucleus in the mouse. Virus injections placed in the ipsilateral and contralateral SC to induce the expression of different fluorescent proteins defines two pulvinar zones. The lateral pulvinar (Pl) receives ipsilateral SC input and the caudal medial pulvinar (Pcm) receives bilateral SC input. To examine the ultrastructure of these projections using transmission electron microscopy, we injected the SC with viruses to induce peroxidase expression within synaptic vesicles or mitochondria. We quantitatively compared the sizes of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites, as well as the sizes of the overall population of synaptic terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites in the Pl and Pcm. Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that ipsilateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than contralateral tectopulvinar terminals. In particular, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection includes a subset of large terminals (≥ 1 μm<sup>2</sup>) that envelop dendritic protrusions of postsynaptic dendrites. We also found that both ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than the overall population of synaptic terminals in both the Pl and Pcm. Thus, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection is structurally distinct from the bilateral tectopulvinar pathway, but both tectopulvinar channels may be considered the primary or “driving” input to the Pl and Pcm.</p>

More tau in the left fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus was related to reduced proper name retrieval performance and this effect was potentiated by amyloid-β. These findings provide an explanation for a common complaint of older adults and link proper name retrieval to neural systems involved in face perception, memory, and naming.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Development of astrocyte morphology and function in mouse visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent visual thalamus has served as a powerful model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie sensory circuit formation and function. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of axon-target interactions and neural activity in orchestrating circuit formation in visual thalamus, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, is less clear. In fact, we know little about the transcriptional identity and development of astrocytes in mouse visual thalamus. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied the expression of canonical astrocyte molecules in visual thalamus using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and reporter lines. While our data suggests some level of heterogeneity of astrocytes in different nuclei of the visual thalamus, the majority of thalamic astrocytes appeared to be labelled in <i>Aldh1l1-EGFP</i> mice. This led us to use this transgenic line to characterize the neonatal and postnatal development of these cells in visual thalamus. Our data show that not only have the entire cohort of astrocytes migrated into visual thalamus by eye-opening but they also have acquired their adult-like morphology, even while retinogeniculate synapses are still maturing. Furthermore, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and functional approaches revealed that by eye-opening, thalamic astrocytes ensheath retinogeniculate synapses and are capable of efficient uptake of glutamate. Taken together, our results reveal that the morphological, anatomical, and functional development of astrocytes in visual thalamus occurs prior to eye-opening and the emergence of experience-dependent visual activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">50 years of mnemonic persistent activity: quo vadis?</a></h4>

              
                Half a century ago persistent spiking activity in the neocortex was discovered to be a neural substrate of working memory. Since then scientists have sought to understand this core cognitive function across biological and computational levels. Studies are reviewed here that cumulatively lend support to a synaptic theory of recurrent circuits for mnemonic persistent activity that depends on various cellular and network substrates and is mathematically described by a multiple-attractor network model.

                The E3 ligase TRIP12 interacts with and ubiquitinates GCase associated with the development of PD. The ubiquitinated GCase by TRIP12 leads to its functional impairment, and subsequent accumulation of α-synuclein and mitochondrial dysfunction. TRIP12 depletion promotes the expression of GCase, which blocks dopaminergic neurodegeneration due to α-synuclein preformed fibrils.

                Hagihara et al. find that lysine lactylation in brain cells is regulated by systemic changes in lactate levels, neural excitation, and social defeat stress. Sixty-three lactylated proteins are identified in the mouse brain. They provide evidence for lactylation in the brain and its regulation by neural-activity-induced lactate.

Franz et al. report that FAF1 is a dual reader of SUMO and ubiquitin targeting VCP to extract DNA replication factors from chromatin in C. elegans and human cells. Together with USP7, VCPFAF1 controls the SUMO/ubiquitin landscape during replication.

The modified sodium channels nonlinearly amplify the terminal polarization. Thus, the amplified terminal polarization further modulates presynaptic vesicles release from axon terminals.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">NuMorph: Tools for cortical cellular phenotyping in tissue-cleared whole-brain images</a></h4>

              
                Krupa et al. develop an image analysis toolbox called NuMorph that accurately quantifies all nuclei within the mouse cortex after tissue clearing and light-sheet imaging. They implement NuMorph to characterize region- and cell-type-specific deficits present in two distinct mouse models, demonstrating the advantages of a whole-brain imaging approach.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Secondary metabolites of Hülle cells mediate protection of fungal reproductive and overwintering structures against fungivorous animals</a></h4>

              
                Fungal Hülle cells with nuclear storage and developmental backup functions are reminiscent of multipotent stem cells. In the soil, Hülle cells nurse the overwintering fruiting bodies of <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i>. The genome of <i>A. nidulans</i> harbors genes for the biosynthesis of xanthones. We show that enzymes and metabolites of this biosynthetic pathway accumulate in Hülle cells under the control of the regulatory velvet complex, which coordinates development and secondary metabolism. Deletion strains blocked in the conversion of anthraquinones to xanthones accumulate emodins and are delayed in maturation and growth of fruiting bodies. Emodin represses fruiting body and resting structure formation in other fungi. Xanthones are not required for sexual development but exert antifeedant effects on fungivorous animals such as springtails and woodlice. Our findings reveal a novel role of Hülle cells in establishing secure niches for <i>A. nidulans</i> by accumulating metabolites with antifeedant activity that protect reproductive structures from animal predators.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Utility of polygenic embryo screening for disease depends on the selection strategy</a></h4>

              
                Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been offered since 2019 to screen in vitro fertilization embryos for genetic liability to adult diseases, despite a lack of comprehensive modeling of expected outcomes. Here we predict, based on the liability threshold model, the expected reduction in complex disease risk following <i>polygenic embryo screening</i> for a single disease. A strong determinant of the potential utility of such screening is the <i>selection strategy</i>, a factor that has not been previously studied. When only embryos with a very high PRS are excluded, the achieved risk reduction is minimal. In contrast, selecting the embryo with the lowest PRS can lead to substantial relative risk reductions, given a sufficient number of viable embryos. We systematically examine the impact of several factors on the utility of screening, including: variance explained by the PRS, number of embryos, disease prevalence, parental PRSs, and parental disease status. We consider both relative and absolute risk reductions, as well as population-averaged and per-couple risk reductions, and also examine the risk of pleiotropic effects. Finally, we confirm our theoretical predictions by simulating ‘virtual’ couples and offspring based on real genomes from schizophrenia and Crohn’s disease case-control studies. We discuss the assumptions and limitations of our model, as well as the potential emerging ethical concerns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative theory for the diffusive dynamics of liquid condensates</a></h4>

              
                Key processes of biological condensates are diffusion and material exchange with their environment. Experimentally, diffusive dynamics are typically probed via fluorescent labels. However, to date, a physics-based, quantitative framework for the dynamics of labeled condensate components is lacking. Here we derive the corresponding dynamic equations, building on the physics of phase separation, and quantitatively validate the related framework via experiments. We show that by using our framework we can precisely determine diffusion coefficients inside liquid condensates via a spatio-temporal analysis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. We showcase the accuracy and precision of our approach by considering space- and time-resolved data of protein condensates and two different polyelectrolyte-coacervate systems. Interestingly, our theory can also be used to determine a relationship between the diffusion coefficient in the dilute phase and the partition coefficient, without relying on fluorescence measurements in the dilute phase. This enables us to investigate the effect of salt addition on partitioning and bypasses recently described quenching artifacts in the dense phase. Our approach opens new avenues for theoretically describing molecule dynamics in condensates, measuring concentrations based on the dynamics of fluorescence intensities, and quantifying rates of biochemical reactions in liquid condensates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathogen clonal expansion underlies multiorgan dissemination and organ-specific outcomes during murine systemic infection</a></h4>

              
                The dissemination of pathogens through blood and their establishment within organs lead to severe clinical outcomes. However, the within-host dynamics that underly pathogen spread to and clearance from systemic organs remain largely uncharacterized. In animal models of infection, the observed pathogen population results from the combined contributions of bacterial replication, persistence, death, and dissemination, each of which can vary across organs. Quantifying the contribution of each these processes is required to interpret and understand experimental phenotypes. Here, we leveraged STAMPR, a new barcoding framework, to investigate the population dynamics of extraintestinal pathogenic <i>E. coli</i>, a common cause of bacteremia, during murine systemic infection. We show that while bacteria are largely cleared by most organs, organ-specific clearance failures are pervasive and result from dramatic expansions of clones representing less than 0.0001% of the inoculum. Clonal expansion underlies the variability in bacterial burden between animals, and stochastic dissemination of clones profoundly alters the pathogen population structure within organs. Despite variable pathogen expansion events, host bottlenecks are consistent yet highly sensitive to infection variables, including inoculum size and macrophage depletion. We adapted our barcoding methodology to facilitate multiplexed validation of bacterial fitness determinants identified with transposon mutagenesis and confirmed the importance of bacterial hexose metabolism and cell envelope homeostasis pathways for organ-specific pathogen survival. Collectively our findings provide a comprehensive map of the population biology that underlies bacterial systemic infection and a framework for barcode-based high-resolution mapping of infection dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decreased recent adaptation at human mendelian disease genes as a possible consequence of interference between advantageous and deleterious variants</a></h4>

              
                Advances in genome sequencing have dramatically improved our understanding of the genetic basis of human diseases, and thousands of human genes have been associated with different diseases. Despite our expanding knowledge of gene-disease associations, and despite the medical importance of disease genes, their recent evolution has not been thoroughly studied across diverse human populations. In particular, recent genomic adaptation at disease genes has not been characterized as well as purifying selection and long-term adaptation. Understanding the relationship between disease and adaptation at the gene level in the human genome is hampered by the fact that we don’t know whether disease genes have experienced more, less, or as much adaptation as non-disease genes during the last ~50,000 years of recent human evolution. Here, we compare the rate of strong recent adaptation in the form of selective sweeps between mendelian, non-infectious disease genes and non-disease genes across 26 distinct human populations from the 1,000 Genomes Project. We find that mendelian disease genes have experienced far less selective sweeps compared to non-disease genes especially in Africa. This sweep deficit at mendelian disease genes is less visible in East Asia or Europe. Investigating further the possible causes of the sweep deficit at disease genes, we find that this deficit is very strong at disease genes with both low recombination rates and with high numbers of associated disease variants, but is almost non-existent at disease genes with higher recombination rates or lower numbers of associated disease variants. Because segregating recessive deleterious variants have the ability to interfere with adaptive ones, these observations strongly suggest that adaptation has been slowed down by the presence of interfering recessive deleterious variants at disease genes.  This is further supported by population simulations that show that interference at disease genes is expected to be lower in East Asia and Europe. These results clarify the evolutionary relationship between disease genes and recent genomic adaptation, and suggest that disease genes suffer not only from a higher load of segregating deleterious mutations, but also from a transient inability to adapt as much, and/or as fast as the rest of the genome.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Linking functional and molecular mechanisms of host resilience to malaria infection</a></h4>

              
                It remains challenging to understand why some hosts suffer severe illnesses, while others are unscathed by the same infection. We fitted a mathematical model to longitudinal measurements of parasite and red blood cell density in murine hosts from diverse genetic backgrounds to identify aspects of within-host interactions that explain variation in host resilience and survival during acute malaria infection. Among eight mouse strains that collectively span 90% of the common genetic diversity of laboratory mice, we found that high host mortality was associated with either weak parasite clearance, or a strong, yet imprecise response that inadvertently removes uninfected cells in excess. Subsequent cross-sectional cytokine assays revealed that the two distinct functional mechanisms of poor survival were underpinned by low expression of either pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. By combining mathematical modelling and molecular immunology assays, our study uncovered proximate mechanisms of diverse infection outcomes across multiple host strains and biological scales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">IRAK1-dependent Regnase-1-14-3-3 complex formation controls Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay</a></h4>

              
                Regnase-1 is an endoribonuclease crucial for controlling inflammation by degrading mRNAs encoding cytokines and inflammatory mediators in mammals. However, it is unclear how Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay is controlled in interleukin (IL)-1β- or Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-stimulated cells. Here, by analyzing the Regnase-1 interactome, we found that IL-1β or TLR stimulus dynamically induced the formation of Regnase-1-β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTRCP) complex. Importantly, we also uncovered a novel interaction between Regnase-1 and 14-3-3 in both mouse and human cells. In IL-1R/TLR-stimulated cells, the Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction is mediated by IRAK1 through a previously uncharacterized C-terminal structural domain. Phosphorylation of Regnase-1 at S494 and S513 is critical for Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction, while a different set of phosphorylation sites of Regnase-1 is known to be required for the recognition by βTRCP and proteasome-mediated degradation. We found that Regnase-1-14-3-3 and Regnase-1-βTRCP interactions are not sequential events. Rather, 14-3-3 protects Regnase-1 from βTRCP-mediated degradation. On the other hand, 14-3-3 abolishes Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay by inhibiting Regnase-1-mRNA association. In addition, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Regnase-1 is abrogated by 14-3-3 interaction. Taken together, the results suggest that a novel inflammation-induced interaction of 14-3-3 with Regnase-1 stabilizes inflammatory mRNAs by sequestering Regnase-1 in the cytoplasm to prevent mRNA recognition.
