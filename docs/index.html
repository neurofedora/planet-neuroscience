              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task Demands Differentiate Regional Depth-Dependent Activity Profiles Within the Ventral Visual Pathway</a></h4>

              
                FMRI has become a key tool for human neuroscience. At ultra-high field (=> 7 Tesla) it is possible to acquire images with submillimeter spatial precision, which allows examinations of mesoscale functional organization. Studying the brain at this scale does not come without its challenges, however. To tackle some of these challenges, we propose an approach that builds upon task modulations to identical visual stimuli and the simultaneous imaging of distal areas of varying complexity across the cortical hierarchy. Specifically, we record BOLD responses elicited by face stimuli during a stimulus relevant and a stimulus irrelevant task across cortical depths in V1, Occipital Face (OFA) and Fusiform Face area (FFA). We observed that task-related top-down modulations were larger in the inner compared to the outer layers of V1; and in the outer compared to the inner layers in the FFA. Our findings are consistent with animal reports of feedback exchange between deeper and superficial layers and with the notion of apical dendritic amplification as a key mechanism of conscious perception. Our approach showcases the potential of laminar-fMRI to explore large scale network activity and represents a promising step towards characterizing laminar functional profiles in humans for complex, cognitively meaningful, and socially relevant stimuli such as faces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating methods for measuring background connectivity in slow event-related functional MRI designs</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used for measuring functional interactions between brain regions, significantly contributing to our understanding of large-scale brain networks and brain-behavior relationships. Furthermore, idiosyncratic patterns of resting-state connections can be leveraged to identify individuals and predict individual differences in clinical symptoms, cognitive abilities, and other individual factors. Idiosyncratic connectivity patters are thought to persist across task states, suggesting task-based fMRI can be similarly leveraged for individual differences analyses. Here, we tested the degree to which functional interactions occurring in the background of a task during slow event-related fMRI parallel or differ from those captured during resting-state fMRI. We compared two approaches for removing task-evoked activity from task-based fMRI: (1) applying a low-pass filter to remove task-related frequencies in the signal, or (2) extracting residuals from a general linear model (GLM) that accounts for task-evoked responses. We found that the organization of large-scale cortical networks and individual's idiosyncratic connectivity patterns are preserved during task-based fMRI. In contrast, individual differences in connection strength can vary more substantially between rest and task. Compared to low-pass filtering, background connectivity obtained from GLM residuals produced idiosyncratic connectivity patterns and individual differences in connection strength that more resembled rest. However, all background connectivity measures were highly similar when derived from the low-pass filtered signal or GLM residuals, indicating that both methods are suitable for measuring background connectivity. Together, our results highlight new avenues for the analysis of task-based fMRI datasets and the utility of each background connectivity method.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrusion of pathological synergies does not explain impaired 3D arm movements in subacute stroke</a></h4>

              
                It has long been of interest what the contribution of pathological synergies is to abnormal motor control of the arm after stroke. The flexor synergy is defined as unwanted co-activation of flexion at the shoulder and elbow joints. Here we used a video-based, marker-less 3D pose-estimation kinematic model to examine two reaching tasks with different requirements for elbow flexion. Twenty-eight sub-acute (2-12 weeks) post-stroke subjects and sixteen healthy controls performed both a cup to mouth task, requiring shoulder and elbow flexion (within flexor synergy), and a reaching task, requiring shoulder flexion and elbow extension (outside of flexor synergy). Using kinematic analysis of the hand and of elbow/shoulder joint angles, we assessed both overall task performance and intrusion of pathological synergies. Motor impairment, strength and spasticity were measured using established clinical scales. Performance in both tasks was impaired to a similar degree in the patients compared to controls. This lack of performance difference for the in- vs. out-of-flexor synergy tasks was consistent with our finding of no evidence for intrusion of a flexor synergy in the reaching task. Specifically, for the reaching task there was no difference between patients and controls either in time spent within-movement in flexor synergy or in the correlation between shoulder and elbow angles when the shoulder was flexing. A regression analysis indicated that the only significant predictor of poor task performance was degree of weakness. Notably, even though we found no kinematic evidence for post-stroke intrusive flexor synergies, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), which was devised to quantify post-stroke synergies, was markedly abnormal. This seeming contradiction is resolved by the observation that abnormal coupling at the shoulder and elbow can occur due to weakness alone, and it is this "synergy mimic" that leads to a low FMA score. The finding that FMA can be abnormal for two qualitatively distinct forms of impaired inter-joint coordination has implications for the interpretation of longitudinal studies that use this single measure. In the sub-acute stage of stroke, intrusion of abnormal synergies is not the reason for impaired reaching.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divisively normalized neuronal processing of uncertain visual feedback for visuomotor learning</a></h4>

              
                When encountering a visual error during a reaching movement, the motor system improves the motor command for the subsequent trial. The degree of improvement is well-known to be degraded with visual error uncertainty, which is considered evidence that the motor system optimally estimates the error. However, it remains unclear how such statistical computation is accomplished. Here, we propose an alternative motor learning scheme implemented with a divisive normalization (DN) mechanism. This scheme assumes that when an uncertain visual error is provided by multiple cursors, the motor system processes the error conveyed by each cursor and integrates the information using DN. The DN scheme can reproduce the patterns of learning response when 1, 2, or 3 cursors are concurrently displayed and predict how the increase in the visual error uncertainty degrades the learning response. Our proposed scheme provides a novel view of how the motor learning system updates the motor command according to visual error information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha suppression during prehension indicates neural motor drive inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Changes in alpha band activity (8-12 Hz) have been shown to indicate the inhibition of engagement of brain regions during cognitive tasks, reflecting real-time cognitive load. Despite this, its feasibility to be used in a more dynamic environment with ongoing motor corrections has not been studied. This research used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore how different brain regions are engaged during a simple grasp and lift task where unexpected changes to the properties of the object are introduced. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show alpha activity changes related to motor error correction occur only in motor-related areas (i.e. central areas), but not in error processing areas (ie. fronto-parietal network). This suggests that oscillations over motor areas could reflect inhibition of motor drive related to motor error correction, thus being a potential cortical electrophysiological biomarker for the process, and not solely as a proxy for cognitive demands. This observation is particularly relevant in scenarios where these signals are used to evaluate high cognitive demands co-occurring with high levels of motor errors and corrections, such as prosthesis use. The establishment of electrophysiological biomarkers of mental resource allocation during movement and cognition can help identify indicators of mental workload and motor drive, which may be useful for improving brain-machine interfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual homogeneity computations in the brain enable solving generic visual tasks</a></h4>

              
                Many visual tasks involve looking for specific object features. But we also often solve generic tasks where we look for a specific property, such as finding an odd item, deciding if two items are same, or if an object has symmetry. How do we solve such tasks? Building on simple neural rules, we show that displays with repeating elements can be distinguished from heterogeneous displays using a property we denote visual homogeneity. In behavior, visual homogeneity predicted response times on visual search and symmetry tasks. Brain imaging during these tasks revealed that visual homogeneity in both tasks is highly localized to a region in the object-selective cortex. Thus, a novel image property, visual homogeneity, is encoded in a localized brain region, to solve generic visual tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A cortical circuit for orchestrating oromanual food manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Cooperative forelimb and mouth movements during eating contribute to diet selection among vertebrates including the oromanual manipulatory skills in rodents and primates. Whereas spinal and brainstem circuits implement forelimb and orofacial actions, whether there is a specialized cortical circuit that flexibly assembles these to achieve cross-body and oromanual coordination for skilled manipulation remains unclear. Here we discover a cortical region and its cell-type-specific circuitry that orchestrates body postures and oromanual coordination for food manipulation in mice. An optogenetic screen of cortical areas and projection neuron types identified a rostral forelimb-orofacial area (RFO), wherein activation of pyramidal tract (PTFezf2) and intratelencephalic (ITPlxnD1) neurons induced concurrent posture, forelimb and orofacial eating-like movements. In a pasta-eating behavior, RFO PTFezf2 and ITPlxnD1 activity were closely correlated with picking up the pasta, adopting a sitting posture, oromanual manipulation, and hand-assisted biting. RFO inactivation and inhibition of RFO PTsFezf2 and ITsPlxnD1 impaired posture and oromanual coordination, leading to deficient pasta manipulation and biting. RFO is reciprocally connected to forelimb and orofacial sensorimotor areas as well as insular and visceral areas. Within this network, ITsPlxnD1 project bilaterally to the entire network and the ventrolateral striatum and PTsFezf2 project to multiple subcortical areas associated with forelimb and orofacial control. These results suggest that ITsPlxnD1 select and coordinate the feeding program involving multiple body parts and PTsFezf2 implement the fine details of movements. Our study reveals a neural circuit basis of hand-mouth coordination for object manipulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Higher-order thalamic nuclei facilitate the generalization and maintenance of spike-and-wave discharges in absence seizures</a></h4>

              
                Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), generated by the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) network, are pathological, large amplitude oscillations and the hallmark of absence seizures (ASs). SWDs begin in a cortical initiation network in both humans and animal models, including the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), where it is located in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The behavioral manifestation of an AS occurs when SWDs spread from the cortical initiation site to the whole brain, however, the mechanisms behind this rapid propagation remain unclear. Here we investigated these processes beyond the principal CTC network, in higher-order (HO) thalamic nuclei (lateral posterior (LP) and posterior (PO) nuclei) since their diffuse connectivity and known facilitation of intracortical communications make these nuclei key candidates to support SWD generation and maintenance. In freely moving GAERS, multi-site LFP in LP, PO and multiple cortical regions revealed a novel feature of SWDs: during SWDs there are short periods (named SWD-breaks) when cortical regions far from S1, such the primary visual cortex (V1), become transiently unsynchronized from the ongoing EEG rhythm. Inactivation of HO nuclei with local muscimol injections or optogenetic perturbation of HO nuclei activity increased the occurrence of SWD-breaks and the former intervention also increased the SWD propagation-time from S1. The neural underpinnings of these findings were explored further by silicon probe recordings from single units of PO which uncovered two previously unknown groups of excitatory neurons based on their burst firing dynamics at SWD onset. Moreover, a switch from tonic to burst firing at SWD onset was shown to be an important feature since it was much less prominent for non-generalized events, i.e. SWDs that remained local to S1. Additionally, one group of neurons showed a reverse of this switch during SWD-breaks, demonstrating the importance of this firing pattern throughout the SWD. In summary, these results support the view that multiple HO thalamic nuclei are utilized at SWD onset and contribute to cortical synchrony throughout the paroxysmal discharge.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by intraneuronal inclusions of alpha-synuclein (-Syn), a strong neuroinflammatory component and neurodegeneration. Human genetic association studies have shown that variants affecting quantity and quality of major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) have implications in PD susceptibility and it was recently shown that PD patients have -Syn specific T lymphocytes in circulation. The class II transactivator (Ciita) is the major regulator of MHCII expression and reduced Ciita expression has been shown to increase -Syn induced neurodegeneration and pathology in vivo. Here we show, using flow cytometry in an -Syn overexpression model combined with -Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF), that congenic rats with naturally occurring differences in Ciita expression have altered local and peripheral immune populations. Lower Ciita levels are associated with increased percentages of microglia and circulating myeloid cells being MHCII+ but with lower levels of MHCII on individual cells. Additionally, lower Ciita levels was associated to higher TNF levels in serum, trends of higher CD86 levels in circulating myeloid population and a lower CD4/CD8 T lymphocyte ratio. Taken together, these results indicate that Ciita regulates serum TNF levels and baseline immune populations which could mediate an increased susceptibility to PD-like pathology.

	<p>(1) Objective: Resting-state fMRI studies have indicated that juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) could cause widespread functional connectivity disruptions between the cerebrum and cerebellum. However, the directed influences or effective connectivities (ECs) between these brain regions are poorly understood. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the ECs between the cerebrum and cerebellum in patients with new-onset JME. (2) Methods: Thirty-four new-onset JME patients and thirty-four age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. We compared the degree centrality (DC) between the two groups to identify intergroup differences in whole-brain functional connectivity. Then, we used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to explore JME-caused changes in EC between cerebrum regions and cerebellum regions. Furthermore, we applied a correlation analysis to identify associations between aberrant EC and disease severity in patients with JME. (3) Results: Compared to HCs, patients with JME showed significantly increased DC in the left cerebellum posterior lobe (CePL.L), the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG.R) and the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG.R), and decreased DC in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.L) and the left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L). The patients also showed unidirectionally increased ECs from cerebellum regions to the cerebrum regions, including from the CePL.L to the right precuneus (PreCU.R), from the left cerebellum anterior lobe (CeAL.L) to the ITG.R, from the right cerebellum posterior lobe (CePL.R) to the IFG.L, and from the left inferior semi-lunar lobule of the cerebellum (CeISL.L) to the SFG.R. Additionally, the EC from the CeISL.L to the SFG.R was negatively correlated with the disease severity. (4) Conclusions: JME patients showed unidirectional EC disruptions from the cerebellum to the cerebrum, and the negative correlation between EC and disease severity provides a new perspective for understanding the cerebro-cerebellar neural circuit mechanisms in JME.</p>

	<p>Although emotional expressions conveyed by the eye regions are processed efficiently, little is known regarding the relationship between emotional processing of isolated eye regions and temporal attention. In this study, we conducted three rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiments with varying task demands (emotion discrimination, eye detection, eyes ignored) related to the first target (T1) to investigate how the perception of emotional valence in the eye region (T1: happy, neutral, fearful) impacts the identification of a second target (T2: neutral houses). Event-related potential (ERP) findings indicated that fearful stimuli reliably increased N170 amplitude regardless of the emotional relevance of task demands. The P3 component exhibited enhanced responses to happy and fearful stimuli in the emotion discrimination task and to happy eye regions in the eye detection task. Analysis of T2-related ERPs within the attentional blink period revealed that T2 houses preceded by fearful and happy stimuli elicited larger N2 and P3 amplitudes than those preceded by neutral stimuli only in the emotion discrimination task. Together, these findings indicate that attention to affective content conveyed by the eyes can not only amplify the perceptual analysis of emotional eye regions but also facilitate the processing of a subsequent target.</p>

	<p>Relatively little research has examined sex differences among people affected by obesity. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between negative emotions and eating behaviors, taking into account the role of biological sex. The final sample consists of 200 candidates for bariatric surgery, 62 males (31%) and 138 females (69%), aged from 18 to 60 years (M = 40.71; SD = 11.30). Participants were screened with the Binge Scale Questionnaire (BSQ) and individually evaluated with the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Correlations were calculated by splitting the sample by sex. Analyses of the relationship between negative emotions and eating behavior showed a large number of correlations in the sample of women and few correlations in men. The differences between women and men with obesity suggest the need for a different theoretical construct that explains the differentiated mechanisms of functioning and lays the foundations for specific therapeutic paths.</p>

	<p>Background: Pneumonia is common in patients with tracheostomy and dysphagia. However, the influence of dysphagia and tracheostomy on pneumonia in patients with stroke remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors related to pneumonia, and the association between dysphagia, tracheostomy and pneumonia in patients with stroke was investigated. Methods: Patients with stroke who experienced tracheostomy and dysphagia were included and divided into two groups based on record of pneumonia at discharge. Clinical manifestations and physical examination were used to diagnose pneumonia, whereas clinical swallowing examination, and videofluoroscopy swallowing studies (VFSS) were used to evaluate swallowing function. Results: There were significant differences between the pneumonia group and the no pneumonia group in total tracheostomy time (6.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.9 vs. 4.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 months, p = 0.003), number of instances of ventilator support (0.41 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.49 vs. 0.18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.38, p = 0.007), PAS score (5.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.92 vs. 4.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.79, p = 0.039), impaired or absent cough reflex (76.4 vs. 55.6%, p = 0.035), oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (60.6 vs. 40.8%, p = 0.047), length of hospital stay (36.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.2 vs. 30.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.7 days, p = 0.025) and direct medical costs (15,702.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14,244.61 vs. 10,923.99 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7250.14 United States dollar [USD], p = 0.042). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the total tracheostomy time (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.966&amp;amp;ndash;12.922, p = 0.001), impaired or absent cough reflex (95% CI, 0.084&amp;amp;ndash;0.695, p = 0.008), and oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (95% CI, 1.087&amp;amp;ndash;8.148, p = 0.034) were risk factors for pneumonia. Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis demonstrated that PAS scores were significantly correlated with cough reflex dysfunction (r = 0.277, p = 0.03), oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (r = 0.318, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and total tracheostomy time (r = 0.178, p = 0.045). The oropharyngeal phase dysfunction was significantly correlated with cough reflex (r = 0.549, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and UES opening (r = 0.643, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Tracheostomy and dysphagia increased the risk of pneumonia in patients with stroke. Total tracheostomy time, duration of ventilator support, degree of penetration and aspiration, and oropharyngeal phase dysfunction are risk factors. Given this, we also found that there may be a correlation between tracheostomy and dysphagia.</p>

	<p>Objective: This paper reports the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination features of 15 Chinese patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmunity. Methods: From June 2016 to December 2019, patients suspected to have neurological autoimmune disease after having their serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested for conventional neural antibodies were scanned for additional autoantibodies by immunohistochemistry. Samples that showed a characteristic immunoreactive pattern reminiscent of the GFAP of astrocytes were selected and confirmed by cell-based assay using cells-expressing human GFAP&amp;amp;alpha;. Results: A total of 15 patients (eight male and seven female) with a median age at onset of 53 years (range 28&amp;amp;ndash;72) were identified as GFAP-IgG-positive. Fourteen cases had GFAP-IgG detected in the CSF, while serum GFAP-IgG was detected in 11 cases. Eleven of the fifteen patients (73.3%) presented with an acute monophasic course, of which 10 (90.9%) had antecedent flu-like symptoms. The predominant phenotype was meningoencephalitis (46.7%), followed by meningoencephalomyelitis in 40% of the cases. The most common clinical features included long tract signs, brainstem symptoms, tremors, headaches, and psychiatric symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the enhancement of the meninges, the surface of the brainstem, the cerebellum, and the spinal cord as predominant. Inflammatory CSF showed mild lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis with a median of 51/&amp;amp;mu;L and elevated protein with a median of 87.5 mg/dL. Five patients had coexisting antibodies, including NMDAR-IgG in three patients and Yo and MOG-IgG in one patient each. One patient underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy, and the neuropathology diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. One patient had ovarian teratoma. Eleven of the fifteen (73.3%) patients received both intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. Among them, three patients also received immunosuppressive agents later. During a two-year follow-up, 9 of the 15 (60%) patients achieved complete clinical remission. Conclusions: The clinical presentation of GFAP astrocytopathy is heterogeneous. It can be characterized by an acute monophasic course and a chronic relapsing course. Tremors are a prominent clinical manifestation in patients with an acute monophasic course with GFAP-IgG antibodies only. Most patients responded well to immunotherapy. In patients with GFAP autoimmunity, presenting with a chronic relapsing course, one should actively search for immunogenic factors and the culprit antibodies. In the case of primary central nervous system lymphoma, GFAP autoimmunity does not always equate to autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy.</p>

	<p>Ceratonia siliqua L. (Carob tree) is a Mediterranean evergreen, well known for its medicinal properties. The different parts of Carob were proven to exert antidiabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiproliferative effects. Hence, the present paper aims to validate the positive correlation between the high antioxidant activity of carob seed peels and the improvement of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Materials &amp;amp;amp; Methods: The antioxidant activity was carried out using the &amp;amp;beta;-carotene test. Methionine and carob seed peels (CSP) extracts (50 and 100 mg/kg) were orally administrated to mice for a week. After administration, behavioral tests were assessed using the Y-maze, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests, as well as the novel object recognition task. Furthermore, the oxidative stress status was evaluated by analyzing the levels of the antioxidant enzymes: Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde levels (MDA). Results: Both extracts exhibited remarkable antioxidant activity and showed antibacterial effect against Gram-positive bacteria tested (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative). Therefore, Escherichia coli was very resistant. The behavioral tests proved the efficacy of CSP in enhancing the cognitive impairment of animal models of schizophrenia. Hence, the stated correlation between oxidative stress and schizophrenia was confirmed by the increased SOD and GPx activities and the decreased MDA level. Conclusions: The present study gave further confirmation of the potential correlation between oxidative stress and the development of psychiatric disorders and highlighted the use of natural antioxidants, especially Ceratonia siliqua L. in the improvement of cognitive impairment in the dementia of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The GAITFAST study (gait recovery in patients after acute ischemic stroke) aims to compare the effects of treadmill-based robot-assisted gait training (RTGT) and therapist-assisted treadmill gait training (TTGT) added to conventional physical therapy in first-ever ischemic stroke patients. GAITFAST (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04824482) was designed as a single-blind single-center prospective randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint of gait speed recovery up to 6 months after ischemic stroke. A total of 120 eligible and enrolled participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) in TTGT or RTGT. All enrolled patients will undergo a 2-week intensive inpatient rehabilitation including TTGT or RTGT followed by four clinical assessments (at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation 8&amp;amp;ndash;15 days after stroke onset, after 2 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after the first assessment). Every clinical assessment will include the assessment of gait speed and walking dependency, fMRI activation measures, neurological and sensorimotor impairments, and gait biomechanics. In a random selection (1:2) of the 120 enrolled patients, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data will be acquired and analyzed. This study will provide insight into the mechanisms behind poststroke gait behavioral changes resulting from intensive rehabilitation including assisted gait training (RTGT or TTGT) in early subacute IS patients.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this paper is to re-examine the relationship between grammars and processing systems in light of the various forms of experimental research (especially of an electrophysiological nature) that has been conducted in the last fifteen years or so. First, the notion of &amp;amp;lsquo;processing strategy&amp;amp;rsquo; or &amp;amp;lsquo;heuristics processing&amp;amp;rsquo; is considered followed by a discussion of structures of great morphosyntactic complexity that parsing systems seem to tackle by simply respecting complex grammatical laws, instead of by resorting to shortcuts. Then, grammatical illusions and what these can teach us about the processing of grammar are considered. It is argued that illusions allow us to discern a few explanatory principles that may redefine the way we see parser&amp;amp;ndash;grammar relations. Among these is the idea that how long illusions last in the online-to-offline transition depends in part on their &amp;amp;lsquo;templatability&amp;amp;rsquo;, that is, the ease with which they become gestaltic templates. Another key idea is that some apparent illusions are in fact nothing more than grammar contemplated at work as in slow motion.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel estimates reveal subnational heterogeneities in disease-relevant contact patterns in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Casey F. Breen, Ayesha S. Mahmud, Dennis M. Feehan</p>

Population contact patterns fundamentally determine the spread of directly transmitted airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Reliable quantitative estimates of contact patterns are therefore critical to modeling and reducing the spread of directly transmitted infectious diseases and to assessing the effectiveness of interventions intended to limit risky contacts. While many countries have used surveys and contact diaries to collect national-level contact data, local-level estimates of age-specific contact patterns remain rare. Yet, these local-level data are critical since disease dynamics and public health policy typically vary by geography. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a flexible model that can estimate age-specific contact patterns at the subnational level by combining national-level interpersonal contact data with other locality-specific data sources using multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP). We estimate daily contact matrices for all 50 US states and Washington DC from April 2020 to May 2021 using national contact data from the US. Our results reveal important state-level heterogeneities in levels and trends of contacts across the US over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for the spread of respiratory diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stability and learning in excitatory synapses by nonlinear inhibitory plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoph Miehl, Julijana Gjorgjieva</p>

Synaptic changes are hypothesized to underlie learning and memory formation in the brain. But Hebbian synaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses on its own is unstable, leading to either unlimited growth of synaptic strengths or silencing of neuronal activity without additional homeostatic mechanisms. To control excitatory synaptic strengths, we propose a novel form of synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. Using computational modeling, we suggest two key features of inhibitory plasticity, dominance of inhibition over excitation and a nonlinear dependence on the firing rate of postsynaptic excitatory neurons whereby inhibitory synaptic strengths change with the same sign (potentiate or depress) as excitatory synaptic strengths. We demonstrate that the stable synaptic strengths realized by this novel inhibitory plasticity model affects excitatory/inhibitory weight ratios in agreement with experimental results. Applying a disinhibitory signal can gate plasticity and lead to the generation of receptive fields and strong bidirectional connectivity in a recurrent network. Hence, a novel form of nonlinear inhibitory plasticity can simultaneously stabilize excitatory synaptic strengths and enable learning upon disinhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A phylogenetic approach to inferring the order in which mutations arise during cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuan Gao, Jeff Gaither, Julia Chifman, Laura Kubatko</p>

Although the role of evolutionary process in cancer progression is widely accepted, increasing attention is being given to the evolutionary mechanisms that can lead to differences in clinical outcome. Recent studies suggest that the temporal order in which somatic mutations accumulate during cancer progression is important. Single-cell sequencing (SCS) provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect that the mutation order has on cancer progression and treatment effect. However, the error rates associated with single-cell sequencing are known to be high, which greatly complicates the task. We propose a novel method for inferring the order in which somatic mutations arise within an individual tumor using noisy data from single-cell sequencing. Our method incorporates models at two levels in that the evolutionary process of somatic mutation within the tumor is modeled along with the technical errors that arise from the single-cell sequencing data collection process. Through analyses of simulations across a wide range of realistic scenarios, we show that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches for identifying mutation order. Most importantly, our method provides a unique means to capture and quantify the uncertainty in the inferred mutation order along a given phylogeny. We illustrate our method by analyzing data from colorectal and prostate cancer patients, in which our method strengthens previously reported mutation orders. Our work is an important step towards producing meaningful prediction of mutation order with high accuracy and measuring the uncertainty of predicted mutation order in cancer patients, with the potential to lead to new insights about the evolutionary trajectories of cancer.

                <p>Cerebral cortical encephalitis (CCE) is a recently described myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) phenotype. In this observational retrospective study, we characterized 19 CCE patients (6.7% of our MOGAD cohort). Headache (n = 15, 79%), seizures (n = 13, 68%), and encephalopathy (n = 12, 63%) were frequent. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed unilateral (n = 12, 63%) or bilateral (n = 7, 37%) cortical T2 hyperintensity and leptomeningeal enhancement (n = 17, 89%). N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor autoantibodies coexisted in 2 of 15 tested (13%). CCE pathology (n = 2) showed extensive subpial cortical demyelination (n = 2), microglial reactivity (n = 2), and inflammatory infiltrates (perivascular, n = 1; meningeal, n = 1). Most received high-dose steroids (n = 17, 89%), and all improved, but 3 had CCE relapses. This study highlights the CCE spectrum and provides insight into its pathogenesis.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Telemedicine is frequently used to provide remote neurological expertise for acute stroke workup and was associated with better functional outcomes when combined with a stroke unit system-of-care. We investigated whether such system-of-care yields additional benefits when implemented on top of neurological competence already available onsite.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Quality improvement measures were implemented within a “hub-and-spoke” teleneurology network in 11 hospitals already provided with onsite or telestroke expertise. Measures included dedicated units for neurological emergencies, standardization of procedures, multiprofessional training, and quality-of-care monitoring. Intervention effects were investigated in a controlled study enrolling patients insured at 3 participating statutory health insurances diagnosed with acute stroke or other neurological emergencies. Outcomes during the intervention period between November 2017 and February 2020 were compared with those pre-intervention between October 2014 and March 2017. To control for temporal trends, we compared outcomes of patients with respective diagnoses in 11 hospitals of the same region. Primary outcome was the composite of up-to-90-day death, new disability with the need of ambulatory or nursing home care, expressed by adjusted hazard ratio (aHR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,418 patients post-implementation (55% female, mean age 76.7 ± 12.8 year) and 2,306 patients pre-implementation (56%, 75.8 ± 13.0 year, respectively). The primary outcome occurred in 479/1,418 (33.8%) patients post-implementation and in 829/2,306 (35.9%) pre-implementation. The aHR for the primary outcome was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.04) with no improvement seen in non-participating hospitals between post- versus pre-implementation periods (aHR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95–1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Implementation of a multicomponent system-of-care was associated with a lower risk of poor outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Atrial Fibrillation Risk Assessment after Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of strokes are embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS). Undetected atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an important cause. Yet, oral anticoagulation in unselected ESUS patients failed in secondary stroke prevention. Guidance on effective AF detection is lacking. Here, we introduce a novel, non-invasive AF risk assessment after ESUS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Catch-Up ESUS is an investigator-initiated, observational cohort study conducted between 2018 and 2019 at the Munich University Hospital. Besides clinical characteristics, patients received ≥72 h digital electrocardiogram recordings to generate the rhythm irregularity burden. Uni- and multivariable regression models predicted the primary endpoint of incident AF, ascertained by standardized follow-up including implantable cardiac monitors. Predictors included the novel rhythm irregularity burden constructed from digital electrocardiogram recordings. We independently validated our model in ESUS patients from the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 297 ESUS patients were followed for 15.6 ± 7.6 months. Incident AF (46 patients, 15.4%) occurred after a median of 105 days (25th to 75th percentile 31–33 days). Secondary outcomes were recurrent stroke in 7.7% and death in 6.1%. Multivariable-adjusted analyses identified the rhythm irregularity burden as the strongest AF-predictor (hazard ratio 3.12, 95% confidence interval 1.62–5.80, <i>p</i> &lt; 0001) while accounting for the known risk factors age, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-Score, and NT-proBNP. Independent validation confirmed the rhythm irregularity burden as the most significant AF-predictor (hazard ratio 2.20, 95% confidence interval 1.45–3.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The novel, non-invasive, electrocardiogram-based rhythm irregularity burden may help adjudicating AF risk after ESUS, and subsequently guide AF-detection after ESUS. Clinical trials need to clarify if high-AF risk patients benefit from tailored secondary stroke prevention. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Entry of the antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, into the developing rat brain in mono- and combination therapies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Olanzapine is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in women of childbearing age. Continuation of psychotropic medications throughout pregnancy and lactation is often required as cessation could be dangerous for both mother and child. However, there is a lack of information on the transfer of these drugs into the developing brain. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats at three developmental ages: embryonic day E19, postnatal day P4 and non-pregnant adult females were administered unlabelled or radiolabelled (3H) olanzapine (0.15 mg/kg) either as monotherapy or in combination with each of seven other common medications. Similar injections were administered to pregnant E19 females to investigate placental transfer. Olanzapine in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain was measured by liquid scintillation counting after a single dose (acute) or following 5 days of treatment (prolonged). Results: Olanzapine entry into brain and CSF was not age-dependent. Prolonged olanzapine treatment reduced placental transfer from 53% to 46% (p<0.05). Co-administration of digoxin or lamotrigine with olanzapine increased its entry into the fetal brain, whereas paracetamol decreased its entry into the CSF. Placental transfer of olanzapine was increased by co-treatment with cimetidine and digoxin, whereas co-treatment with lamotrigine, paracetamol or valproate led to a substantial decrease. Repeated co-treatment of digoxin and olanzapine increased olanzapine transfer into the brain and CSF, but not across the placenta. Overall entry of olanzapine from maternally administered drugs into the fetal brain was higher after combination therapy with cimetidine and digoxin. Conclusions: Co-administration of olanzapine with some commonly used drugs affected its entry into the fetus and its developing brain to a greater extent than in adults. It appears that protection of the fetal brain for these drugs primarily comes from the placenta rather than from the fetal brain barriers. Results suggest that drug combinations should be used with caution particularly during pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Significance of visual scene‐based learning in the hippocampal systems across mammalian species</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and its associated cortical regions in the medial temporal lobe play essential roles when animals form a cognitive map and use it to achieve their goals. As the nature of map-making involves sampling different local views of the environment and putting them together in a spatially cohesive way, visual scenes are essential ingredients in the formative process of cognitive maps. Visual scenes also serve as important cues during information retrieval from the cognitive map. Research in humans has shown that there are regions in the brain that selectively process scenes and that the hippocampus is involved in scene-based memory tasks. The neurophysiological correlates of scene-based information processing in the hippocampus have been reported as “spatial view cells” in nonhuman primates. Like primates, it is widely accepted that rodents also use visual scenes in their background for spatial navigation and other kinds of problems. However, in rodents, it is not until recently that researchers examined the neural correlates of the hippocampus from the perspective of visual scene-based information processing. With the advent of virtual reality (VR) systems, it has been demonstrated that place cells in the hippocampus exhibit remarkably similar firing correlates in the VR environment compared with that of the real-world environment. Despite some limitations, the new trend of studying hippocampal functions in a visually controlled environment has the potential to allow investigation of the input–output relationships of network functions and experimental testing of traditional computational predictions more rigorously by providing well-defined visual stimuli. As scenes are essential for navigation and episodic memory in humans, further investigation of the rodents' hippocampal systems in scene-based tasks will provide a critical functional link across different mammalian species.</p>

                In a recent study, Strickland and McDannald dissected the role of brainstem networks in threat prediction. Using probabilistic threat discrimination in rats, the authors demonstrated that brainstem neurons estimate threat probability and generate positive aversive prediction errors after unexpected outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosophila SUMM4 complex couples insulator function and DNA replication control</a></h4>

              
                Asynchronous replication of chromosome domains during S phase is essential for eukaryotic genome function, but the mechanisms establishing which domains replicate early versus late in different cell types remain incompletely understood. Intercalary heterochromatin domains replicate very late in both diploid chromosomes of dividing cells and in endoreplicating polytene chromosomes where they are also underrelicated. <i>Drosophila</i> SNF2-related factor SUUR imparts locus-specific underreplication of polytene chromosomes. SUUR negatively regulates DNA replication fork progression; however, its mechanism of action remains obscure. Here we developed a novel method termed MS-Enabled Rapid protein Complex Identification (MERCI) to isolate a stable stoichiometric native complex SUMM4 that comprises SUUR and a chromatin boundary protein Mod(Mdg4)-67.2. Mod(Mdg4) stimulates SUUR ATPase activity and is required for a normal spatiotemporal distribution of SUUR <i>in vivo</i>. SUUR and Mod(Mdg4)-67.2 together mediate the activities of <i>gypsy</i> insulator that prevent certain enhancer-promoter interactions and establish euchromatin-heterochromatin barriers in the genome. Furthermore, <i>SuUR</i> or <i>mod(mdg4)</i> mutations reverse underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin. Thus, SUMM4 can impart late replication of intercalary heterochromatin by attenuating the progression of replication forks through euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries. Our findings implicate a SNF2 family ATP-dependent motor protein SUUR in the insulator function, reveal that DNA replication can be delayed by a chromatin barrier and uncover a critical role for architectural proteins in replication control. They suggest a mechanism for the establishment of late replication that does not depend on an asynchronous firing of late replication origins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differential axonal trafficking of Neuropeptide Y-, LAMP1-, and RAB7-tagged organelles in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Different organelles traveling through neurons exhibit distinct properties in vitro, but this has not been investigated in the intact mammalian brain. We established simultaneous dual color two-photon microscopy to visualize the trafficking of Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-, LAMP1-, and RAB7-tagged organelles in thalamocortical axons imaged in mouse cortex in vivo. This revealed that LAMP1- and RAB7-tagged organelles move significantly faster than NPY-tagged organelles in both anterograde and retrograde direction. NPY traveled more selectively in anterograde direction than LAMP1 and RAB7. By using a synapse marker and a calcium sensor, we further investigated the transport dynamics of NPY-tagged organelles. We found that these organelles slow down and pause at synapses. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, a significant increase of transport speed was observed after spontaneous activity and elevated calcium levels in vivo as well as electrically stimulated activity in acute brain slices. Together, we show a remarkable diversity in speeds and properties of three axonal organelle marker in vivo that differ from properties previously observed in vitro.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">m6A epitranscriptomic modification regulates neural progenitor-to-glial cell transition in the retina</a></h4>

              
                <i>N</i> <sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent mRNA internal modification and has been shown to regulate the development, physiology, and pathology of various tissues. However, the functions of the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome in the visual system remain unclear. In this study, using a retina-specific conditional knockout mouse model, we show that retinas deficient in <i>Mettl3</i>, the core component of the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex, exhibit structural and functional abnormalities beginning at the end of retinogenesis. Immunohistological and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of retinogenesis processes reveal that retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and Müller glial cells are the two cell types primarily affected by <i>Mettl3</i> deficiency. Integrative analyses of scRNA-seq and MeRIP-seq data suggest that m<sup>6</sup>A fine-tunes the transcriptomic transition from RPCs to Müller cells by promoting the degradation of RPC transcripts, the disruption of which leads to abnormalities in late retinogenesis and likely compromises the glial functions of Müller cells. Overexpression of m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated RPC transcripts in late RPCs partially recapitulates the <i>Mettl3</i>-deficient retinal phenotype. Collectively, our study reveals an epitranscriptomic mechanism governing progenitor-to-glial cell transition during late retinogenesis, which is essential for the homeostasis of the mature retina. The mechanism revealed in this study might also apply to other nervous systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation of Drosophila larva foraging in response to changes in food resources</a></h4>

              
                All animals face the challenge of finding nutritious resources in a changing environment. To maximize life-time fitness, the exploratory behavior has to be flexible, but which behavioral elements adapt and what triggers those changes remain elusive. Using experiments and modeling, we characterized extensively how <i>Drosophila</i> larvae foraging adapts to different food quality and distribution and how the foraging genetic background influences this adaptation. Our work shows that different food properties modulated specific motor programs. Food quality controls the travelled distance by modulating crawling speed and frequency of pauses and turns. Food distribution, and in particular the food-no food interphase, controls turning behavior, stimulating turns towards the food when reaching the patch border and increasing the proportion of time spent within patches of food. Finally, the polymorphism in the <i>foraging</i> gene (rover-sitter) of the larvae adjusts the magnitude of the behavioral response to different food conditions. This study defines several levels of control of foraging and provides the basis for the systematic identification of the neuronal circuits and mechanisms controlling each behavioral response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Uncertainty alters the balance between incremental learning and episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                A key question in decision making is how humans arbitrate between competing learning and memory systems to maximize reward. We address this question by probing the balance between the effects, on choice, of incremental trial-and-error learning versus episodic memories of individual events. Although a rich literature has studied incremental learning in isolation, the role of episodic memory in decision making has only recently drawn focus, and little research disentangles their separate contributions. We hypothesized that the brain arbitrates rationally between these two systems, relying on each in circumstances to which it is most suited, as indicated by uncertainty. We tested this hypothesis by directly contrasting contributions of episodic and incremental influence to decisions, while manipulating the relative uncertainty of incremental learning using a well-established manipulation of reward volatility. Across two large, independent samples of young adults, participants traded these influences off rationally, depending more on episodic information when incremental summaries were more uncertain. These results support the proposal that the brain optimizes the balance between different forms of learning and memory according to their relative uncertainties and elucidate the circumstances under which episodic memory informs decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lhx2 is a progenitor-intrinsic modulator of Sonic Hedgehog signaling during early retinal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                An important question in organogenesis is how tissue-specific transcription factors interact with signaling pathways. In some cases, transcription factors define the context for how signaling pathways elicit tissue- or cell-specific responses, and in others, they influence signaling through transcriptional regulation of signaling components or accessory factors. We previously showed that during optic vesicle patterning, the Lim-homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 has a contextual role by linking the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway to downstream targets without regulating the pathway itself. Here, we show that during early retinal neurogenesis in mice, Lhx2 is a multilevel regulator of Shh signaling. Specifically, Lhx2 acts cell autonomously to control the expression of pathway genes required for efficient activation and maintenance of signaling in retinal progenitor cells. The Shh co-receptors Cdon and Gas1 are candidate direct targets of Lhx2 that mediate pathway activation, whereas Lhx2 directly or indirectly promotes the expression of other pathway components important for activation and sustained signaling. We also provide genetic evidence suggesting that Lhx2 has a contextual role by linking the Shh pathway to downstream targets. Through these interactions, Lhx2 establishes the competence for Shh signaling in retinal progenitors and the context for the pathway to promote early retinal neurogenesis. The temporally distinct interactions between Lhx2 and the Shh pathway in retinal development illustrate how transcription factors and signaling pathways adapt to meet stage-dependent requirements of tissue formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evidence linking APOBEC3B genesis and evolution of innate immune antagonism by gamma-herpesvirus ribonucleotide reductases</a></h4>

              
                Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to antagonize host immunity such as direct inhibition and relocalization of cellular APOBEC3B (A3B) by the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) of Epstein-Barr virus. Here, we investigate the mechanistic conservation and evolutionary origin of this innate immune counteraction strategy. First, we find that human gamma-herpesvirus RNRs engage A3B via largely distinct surfaces. Second, we show that RNR-mediated enzymatic inhibition and relocalization of A3B depend upon binding to different regions of the catalytic domain. Third, we show that the capability of viral RNRs to antagonize A3B is conserved among gamma-herpesviruses that infect humans and Old World monkeys that encode this enzyme but absent in homologous viruses that infect New World monkeys that naturally lack the <i>A3B</i> gene. Finally, we reconstruct the ancestral primate A3B protein and demonstrate that it is active and similarly engaged by the RNRs from viruses that infect humans and Old World monkeys but not by the RNRs from viruses that infect New World monkeys. These results combine to indicate that the birth of <i>A3B</i> at a critical branchpoint in primate evolution may have been a driving force in selecting for an ancestral gamma-herpesvirus with an expanded RNR functionality through counteraction of this antiviral enzyme.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modular UBE2H-CTLH E2-E3 complexes regulate erythroid maturation</a></h4>

              
                The development of haematopoietic stem cells into mature erythrocytes – erythropoiesis – is a controlled process characterized by cellular reorganization and drastic reshaping of the proteome landscape. Failure of ordered erythropoiesis is associated with anaemias and haematological malignancies. Although the ubiquitin system is a known crucial post-translational regulator in erythropoiesis, how the erythrocyte is reshaped by the ubiquitin system is poorly understood. By measuring the proteomic landscape of in vitro human erythropoiesis models, we found dynamic differential expression of subunits of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that formed maturation stage-dependent assemblies of topologically homologous RANBP9- and RANBP10-CTLH complexes. Moreover, protein abundance of CTLH’s cognate E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2H increased during terminal differentiation, and UBE2H expression depended on catalytically active CTLH E3 complexes. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated inactivation of CTLH E3 assemblies or UBE2H in erythroid progenitors revealed defects, including spontaneous and accelerated erythroid maturation as well as inefficient enucleation. Thus, we propose that dynamic maturation stage-specific changes of UBE2H-CTLH E2-E3 modules control the orderly progression of human erythropoiesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Longitudinal analysis of invariant natural killer T cell activation reveals a cMAF-associated transcriptional state of NKT10 cells</a></h4>

              
                Innate T cells, including CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, are characterized by their rapid activation in response to non-peptide antigens, such as lipids. While the transcriptional profiles of naive, effector and memory adaptive T cells have been well studied, less is known about transcriptional regulation of different iNKT cell activation states. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we performed longitudinal profiling of activated murine iNKT cells, generating a transcriptomic atlas of iNKT cell activation states. We found that transcriptional signatures of activation are highly conserved among heterogeneous iNKT cell populations, including NKT1, NKT2 and NKT17 subsets, and human iNKT cells. Strikingly, we found that regulatory iNKT cells, such as adipose iNKT cells, undergo blunted activation, and display constitutive enrichment of memory-like cMAF<sup>+</sup> and KLRG1<sup>+</sup> populations. Moreover, we identify a conserved cMAF-associated transcriptional network among NKT10 cells, providing novel insights into the biology of regulatory and antigen experienced iNKT cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of mutant RAS-RAF interaction by mimicking structural and dynamic properties of phosphorylated RAS</a></h4>

              
                Undruggability of RAS proteins has necessitated alternative strategies for the development of effective inhibitors. In this respect, phosphorylation has recently come into prominence as this reversible post-translational modification attenuates sensitivity of RAS towards RAF. As such, in this study, we set out to unveil the impact of phosphorylation on dynamics of HRAS<sup>WT</sup> and aim to invoke similar behavior in HRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutant by means of small therapeutic molecules. To this end, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using phosphorylated HRAS and showed that phosphorylation of Y32 distorted Switch I, hence the RAS/RAF interface. Consequently, we targeted Switch I in HRAS<sup>G12D</sup> by means of approved therapeutic molecules and showed that the ligands enabled detachment of Switch I from the nucleotide-binding pocket. Moreover, we demonstrated that displacement of Switch I from the nucleotide-binding pocket was energetically more favorable in the presence of the ligand. Importantly, we verified computational findings in vitro where HRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/RAF interaction was prevented by the ligand in HEK293T cells that expressed HRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutant protein. Therefore, these findings suggest that targeting Switch I, hence making Y32 accessible might open up new avenues in future drug discovery strategies that target mutant RAS proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">VPS9D1-AS1 overexpression amplifies intratumoral TGF-β signaling and promotes tumor cell escape from CD8+ T cell killing in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                Efficacy of immunotherapy is limited in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) because high expression of tumor-derived transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway molecules and interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) promotes tumor immune evasion. Here, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), VPS9D1-AS1, which was located in ribosomes and amplified TGF-β signaling and ISG expression. We show that high expression of VPS9D1-AS1 was negatively associated with T lymphocyte infiltration in two independent cohorts of CRC. VPS9D1-AS1 served as a scaffolding lncRNA by binding with ribosome protein S3 (RPS3) to increase the translation of TGF-β, TGFBR1, and SMAD1/5/9. VPS9D1-AS1 knockout downregulated OAS1, an ISG gene, which further reduced IFNAR1 levels in tumor cells. Conversely, tumor cells overexpressing VPS9D1-AS1 were resistant to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killing and lowered IFNAR1 expression in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. In a conditional overexpression mouse model, VPS9D1-AS1 enhanced tumorigenesis and suppressed the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Treating tumor-bearing mice with antisense oligonucleotide drugs targeting VPS9D1-AS1 significantly suppressed tumor growth. Our findings indicate that the tumor-derived VPS9D1-AS1/TGF-β/ISG signaling cascade promotes tumor growth and enhances immune evasion and may thus serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Growth/differentiation factor 15 controls number of ependymal and neural stem cells in the ventricular/subventricular zone</a></h4>

              
                Late in neural development, the expression of growth/differentiation factor (GDF) 15 increases in the germinal epithelium of the murine ganglionic eminence (GE). However, the function of GDF15 in this region is unknown. We here show that ablation of GDF15 leads to an increase in proliferation of apically and subapically dividing progenitors in the GE. This is associated with faster cell cycle progression in both progenitor groups, and an increase in the total number of cycling progenitors. Enhanced proliferation of apically dividing progenitors leads to a permanent significant increase in the number of ependymal and apical neural stem cells (NSCs). Our data also indicate that the extra proliferation of subapically dividing progenitors causes a transient increase in the number of neuronal progenitors, which is compensated by increased apoptosis. Independent of the genotype, activity of endogenous epidermal growth factor (EGFR) signalling is essential for the proliferation of apically and subapically dividing progenitors. However, lack of GDF15 leads to a reduced cell surface expression of EGFR and altered dynamics of MAPK activation in response to EGF stimulation. Application of exogenous GDF15 rescued the effect of the genotype on the expression of EGFR and decreased proliferation in the mutant GE. Taken together, our results indicate that GDF15 modulates proliferation and growth factor responsiveness of apical progenitors in the developing GE, thereby regulating the number of total ependymal and NSCs.

                The brain is composed of disparate neural populations that communicate and interact with one another. Although fiber bundles, similarities in molecular architecture, and synchronized neural activity all represent brain connectivity, a comprehensive study of how these connectivity modes jointly reflect brain structure and function remains missing. Here we systematically integrate seven multimodal, multiscale brain connectivity profiles derived from gene expression, neurotransmitter receptor density, cellular morphology, glucose metabolism, haemodynamic activity, and electrophysiology. We uncover a compact set of universal organizational principles through which brain geometry and neuroanatomy shape emergent connectivity modes. Connectivity modes also exhibit unique and diverse connection patterns, hub profiles, dominant gradients, and modular organization. Throughout, we observe a consistent primacy of molecular connectivity modes---namely correlated gene expression and receptor similarity---that map well onto multiple phenomena including the rich club and patterns of cortical abnormalities across 13 neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Finally, we fuse all seven connectivity modes into a single multimodal network and show that it maps onto major organizational features of the brain including structural conenctivity, intrinsic functional networks, and cytoarchitectonic classes. Altogether, this work contributes to next-generation connectomics and the integrative study of inter-regional relationships.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic temporal coordination of neural activity avoids representational conflict during working memory</a></h4>

              
                Selective attention includes alternating states associated with either attentional sampling or attentional shifting, helping to avoid functional conflicts by isolating function-specific neural activity in time. We hypothesized that such rhythmic temporal coordination might also help to avoid representational conflicts during working memory. Multiple items can be simultaneously held in working memory, and these items can be represented by overlapping neural populations. Traditional theories propose that short-term storage of to-be-remembered items occurs through persistent neural activity, but when neurons are simultaneously representing multiple items, persistent activity creates a potential for representational conflicts. In comparison, more recent, activity-silent theories of working memory propose that items are stored through short-term changes in synaptic weights. Transient bursts in neural activity, rather than persistent activity, would serve to refresh these short-term synaptic changes. Here, we used EEG and response times (RTs) to test whether rhythmic temporal coordination helps to isolate neural activity associated with different to-be-remembered items, thereby avoiding representational conflicts. Consistent with this hypothesis, we report that the relative strength of different item representations alternates over time as a function of frequency-specific phase. Although RTs were linked to theta (~6Hz) and beta (~25 Hz) phase during a memory delay, the relative strength of item representations only alternated as a function of beta phase. The present findings support activity-silent theories of working memory, and inform models describing the role of oscillatory dynamics in organizing working memory. Finally, these findings support rhythmic temporal coordination as a general mechanism for avoiding either functional or representational conflicts during cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisite Thalamic Recordings to Characterize Seizure Propagation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT) has shown to be efficacious in patients with refractory focal epilepsy, but it is not uniformly effective. One important uncertainty is to what extent thalamic subregions other than the ANT are recruited earlier and more prominently in the propagation of seizures in patients with presumed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To address this unknown, we studied 11 patients with clinical manifestations of TLE planned to undergo invasive stereo-encephalography (sEEG) monitoring. We extended cortical electrodes to reach thalamic nuclear subdivisions in the anterior (ANT), middle (mediodorsal) and or posterior (pulvinar) sites. This multisite thalamic sampling was without any adverse events. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings confirmed seizure onset in medial temporal lobe, insula, orbitofrontal and temporal neocortical sites, thereby highlighting the importance of iEEG for more accurate localization of seizure foci. Visual review of EEGs documented early and prominent involvement of specific thalamic sites. Seizures originating from the same brain origin produced a stereotyped thalamic EEG signature. Visual review of EEGs, validated with single-pulse corticothalamic evoked potentials, documented early and prominent involvement of thalamic sites that would have not been predicted given the anatomy of seizure onset zones. Pulvinar was involved earlier and more prominently than other sampled nuclear subgroups in 60% of patients, even though all patients had a presumed diagnosis of TLE prior to invasive monitoring. Our findings document the feasibility and safety of multisite sampling from the human thalamus and suggest that the anatomy of thalamic involvement may not be entirely predictable on the basis of clinical information or lobar localization of seizures. Future clinical trials can establish whether offering more personalized targets for thalamic neuromodulation will lead to greater meaningful improvements in outcome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The interplay of uncertainty, relevance and learning influences auditory categorization</a></h4>

              
                Auditory perception requires categorizing sound sequences, such as speech, into classes, such as syllables. Auditory categorization depends not only on the sequences' acoustic waveform, but also on the listener's sensory uncertainty, any individual sound's relevance to the task, and learning the temporal statistics of the acoustic environment. However, whether and how these factors interact to shape categorization is unknown. Here, we measured human participants' performance on a multi-tone categorization task. Task-relevant tones contributed more to category choice than task-irrelevant tones, confirming that participants combined information about sensory features with task relevance. Conversely, poor estimates of tones' task relevance or high sensory uncertainty adversely impacted category choice. Learning temporal statistics of sound category also affected decisions. The magnitude of this effect correlated inversely with participants' relevance estimates. These results demonstrate that humans differentially weigh sensory uncertainty, task relevance and learning, providing a novel understanding of sensory decision-making under real-life behavioral demands.

                Expectations about the quality of a medical treatment influence how much an inert treatment helps to improve patient well-being. Similarly, expectations about the quality of products influence how identical goods and services are evaluated differently after their consumption. One driver for such "placebo effects" in medical treatments is social cognition in the form of trust, which may be influenced by the hormone oxytocin. An open question is whether trust and oxytocin play similar roles in marketing placebo effects. To answer this question, we combined oxytocin administration (24 IU) and trust questionnaires in a pre-registered double-blind randomized between-subjects study design (N food tasting task = 223; N cognitive performance task = 202). We could not find evidence that oxytocin and trust play a role in placebo effects of marketing actions. Together with other recent null findings from oxytocin administration studies, these findings question the role trust might play in different types of placebo effects.

                Human fetal development has been associated with brain health at later stages. It is unknown whether and how consistently growth in utero, as indexed by birth weight (BW), relates to lifespan brain characteristics and changes, and to what extent these influences are of a genetic and/or environmental nature. We hypothesized that associations of BW and structural brain characteristics persist through the lifespan, with topographically consistent effects across samples of varying age and origin, that BW is not protective against atrophy in aging, and that effects are partly environmental. The associations of BW and cortical area, thickness, volume and their change were investigated vertex-wise in developmental (ABCD), older adult and aging (UKB) and lifespan (LCBC) longitudinal samples. In total, 5794 persons (4-82 years, w/ 386 monozygotic twins), were followed for up to 8.3 years, yielding 12,088 brain MRIs. Positive associations between BW and cortical surface area and volume were remarkably stable through the lifespan, within and across samples of different origin, with spatial correlations in the range r = .51- .79. In contrast, there was modest and no consistent effect of BW on brain changes. Effects of BW discordance in the monozygotic twin subsample indicated the effects were partly environmental. In conclusion, the influence of prenatal growth on cortical topography is stable through the lifespan, and is reliably seen in development, adulthood, and aging. These findings support early life influence on the brain through the lifespan according to a threshold model of brain reserve, rather than a maintenance model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drug repurposing of dopaminergic drugs to inhibit Ataxin-3 aggregation</a></h4>

              
                The accumulation of mutant ataxin-3 (Atx3) in neuronal nuclear inclusions is a pathological hallmark of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3. Decreasing the protein aggregation burden is a possible disease-modifying strategy to tackle MJD and other neurodegenerative disorders for which only symptomatic treatments are currently available. We performed a drug repurposing screening to identify inhibitors of Atx3 aggregation with known toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiles. Interestingly, dopamine hydrochloride and other catecholamines are among the most potent inhibitors of Atx3 aggregation in vitro. Our results indicate that low micromolar concentrations of dopamine markedly delay the formation of mature amyloid fibrils of mutant Atx3 through the inhibition of the earlier oligomerization steps. Although dopamine itself does not pass the blood-brain barrier, dopamine levels in the brain can be increased by low doses of dopamine precursors and dopamine agonists commonly used to treat Parkinsonian symptoms. These findings disclose a possible application of dopaminergic drugs to halt or reduce Atx3 accumulation in the brains of MJD patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Color and Spatial Frequency Provide Functional Signatures of Retinotopic Visual Areas</a></h4>

              
                The visual cortex contains multiple retinotopic representations of the visual field. A long-standing question of visual neuroscience concerns the role of these different regions in visual computations and perception. Differences in psychophysical properties have also been noted across the visual field, varying with eccentricity and with the upper and lower hemifields. Inspired by studies that used linear-systems-defined stimuli to characterize single neuron responses, we collected fMRI data from two macaque monkeys as they passively viewed gratings that varied in color, saturation, and spatial frequency. We apply a novel variant of multivariate linear discriminant analysis to discover combinations of these features that best separated visual cortex, along three dimensions of representation: eccentricity; classic retinotopic progression (V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+); and upper vs lower visual field. As expected from prior work, eccentricity across all visual areas was characterized by responses to color and spatial frequency: foveal regions, compared to peripheral regions, showed greater responses to colors not restricted to the S-cone-axis and high spatial frequency. Retinotopic visual areas were characterized by their responses to saturation: relative to anterior visual areas (V3-V4, V3a, MT+), posterior areas (V1-V2) were more responsive to increases in saturation. And upper-vs-lower representations were distinguished by responses to colors modulating along the Daylight locus: ventral areas showed relatively higher responses to colors associated with the Daylight locus (orange/blue) as compared to responses to achromatic luminance. Together, these results provide a data driven approach that recovers functional signatures of retinotopic organization using color and spatial frequency, providing clues toward the different roles that the components of retinotopic cortex play in visual perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Species-dependent actions of the Gαob selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist BnOCPA</a></h4>

              
                We have previously reported that in rat hippocampal area CA1, the A1R-selective agonist, BnOCPA, potently inhibited excitatory synaptic transmission but did not cause membrane hyperpolarisation in CA1 pyramidal neurons, as would be expected of A1R agonists. This functional discrimination by BnOCPA may arise from its ability, in cAMP inhibition assays, to selectively activate only Gob out of the six Gi/o subtypes. This may explain why BnOCPA is a potent analgesic that does not cause sedation or cardiorespiratory depression in the rat. Since many preclinical studies are performed using mice, we have here investigated whether BnOCPA's functional discrimination extends to the mouse. While the potency of BnOCPA against the inhibition of hippocampal synaptic transmission was comparable between rats and mice, we discovered that low concentrations of BnOCPA hyperpolarised mouse CA1 neurons and reduced both their input resistance and firing rate in an A1R-dependent manner. In interleaved experiments we confirmed our previous observations in the rat that concentrations of BnOCPA equivalent to those tested in the mouse had little or no effect on membrane potential or input resistance. Using NanoBRET binding we established that BnOCPA had similar affinity at the mouse and rat A1Rs, and displayed little difference in G protein coupling, as determined using the TRUPATH assay. Thus, although the mechanism for the loss of BnOCPA functional selectivity between pre- and postsynaptic receptors in the mouse hippocampus is currently unclear, it may stem from differences in expression of the individual G proteins subunits or the coupling to murine K+ channels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Complex spatiotemporal oscillations emerge from transverse instabilities in large-scale brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Spatiotemporal oscillations underlie all cognitive brain functions. Large-scale brain models, constrained by neuroimaging data, aim to trace the principles underlying such macroscopic neural activity from the intricate and multi-scale structure of the brain. Despite substantial progress in the field, many aspects about the mechanisms behind the onset of spatiotemporal neural dynamics are still unknown. In this work we establish a simple framework for the emergence of complex brain dynamics, including high-dimensional chaos and travelling waves. The model consists of a complex network of 90 brain regions, whose structural connectivity is obtained from tractography data. The activity of each brain area is governed by a Jansen neural mass model and we normalize the total input received by each node so it amounts the same across all brain areas. This assumption allows for the existence of an homogeneous invariant manifold, i.e., a set of different stationary and oscillatory states in which all nodes behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous solutions unveils a transverse instability of the synchronized state, which gives rise to different types of spatiotemporal dynamics, such as chaotic alpha activity. Additionally, we illustrate the ubiquity of this route towards complex spatiotemporal activity in a network of next-generation neural mass models. Altogehter, our results unveil the bifurcation landscape that underlies the emergence of function from structure in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network topology in brain tumor patients with and without structural epilepsy- a prospective MEG-study</a></h4>

              
                It has been proposed that functional connectivity (FC) and network topology (NT) are altered in patients with glial brain tumors. So far there is no consensus on the pattern of these changes, furthermore data on FC in patients with brain metastases (BM) as well as on the presence and absence of tumor-related epilepsy is lacking. We aimed to analyze preoperative NT of newly diagnosed, singular, supratentorial glial brain tumors (GBT) and BMs with and without structural epilepsy. FC and NT derived from resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) were compared between patients (PAs) and matched healthy controls (HCs), between GBTs and BMs as well as between patients with and without structural epilepsy. We investigated all patients, who met our inclusion criteria from February 2019 to March 2021. Clinical data was collected from patients electronic medical charts. We analyzed whole brain (wb) connectivity in six frequency bands, calculated three different network topological parameters (node degree (ND), shortest path length (L), clustering coefficient (CC)) and performed a stratification, where differences in the power were to be found. For data analysis we used Fieldtrip, Brain Connectivity Matlab toolboxes and in-house built scripts. We consecutively included 41 patients (21 men), mean age 60.1ys (range 23- 82), who were operated on at our institution. Tumor histology included high-grade gliomas (n=18), low-grade gliomas (n=4), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET, n=1), BMs (n=14) and others (n=4). Statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease for wb ND in patients compared to healthy controls in every frequency range analyzed at the descriptive and corrected level (p1-30Hz=0.002, p(gamma)=0.002, p(beta)=0.002, p(alpha)=0.002, p(theta)=0.024, p(delta)=0.002). Furthermore, at the descriptive level, we found a significant augmentation for wb CC (p1-30Hz=0.031, p(delta)=0.013) in PAs compared to HCs, which did not persist the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. There were no differences in the networks of glial brain tumors and metastases identified. However, we found a significant increase in wb CC in patients with structural epilepsy (p(theta)= 0.048), and significantly lower wb ND (p(alpha)= 0.039) at the uncorrected level. Our data suggests that network topology is altered in brain tumor patients, which is in line with previous studies. Tumor histology per se might not influence the brain s functional network, however, tumor-related epilepsy seems to do so. Longitudinal studies and in-depth analysis of possible factors and confounders might be helpful to further substantiate these findings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channel properties underlie sustained fast AP signaling</a></h4>

              
                Human cortical pyramidal neurons are large, have extensive dendritic trees, and yet have surprisingly fast input-output properties: rapid subthreshold synaptic membrane potential changes are reliably encoded in timing of action potentials (APs). Here, we tested whether biophysical properties of voltage-gated sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) currents in human pyramidal neurons can explain their fast input-output properties. Human Na+ and K+ currents had depolarized voltage-dependence, slower inactivation and exhibited a faster recovery from inactivation than their mouse counterparts. Computational modeling showed that despite lower Na+ channel densities in human neurons, the biophysical properties of Na+ channels resulted in higher channel availability and contributed to fast AP kinetics stability. Finally, human Na+ channel properties also resulted in a larger dynamic range for encoding of subthreshold membrane potential changes. Thus, biophysical adaptations of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels enable fast input-output properties of large human pyramidal neurons.

	<p>Background: Although increased food cue reactivity is evidenced to be crucial to the development and maintenance of pediatric obesity, virtually nothing is known about the underlying neurophysiological aspects of food cue reactivity in children with obesity. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating neural characteristics in children with overweight or obesity using electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Electrophysiological brain activity was measured using EEG frequency band analysis in n = 9 children with overweight or obesity versus n = 16 children with normal weight (8&amp;amp;ndash;13 years) during the presentation of high- and low-calorie food pictures and images of appealing non-food stimuli. Results: Children with overweight or obesity showed significantly increased relative central beta band activity induced by high-calorie foods and appealing non-food stimuli compared to children with normal weight. Beyond significant effects of the scalp region on EEG activity, non-significant effects of stimulus category or weight status were seen for theta and alpha frequency bands. Conclusions: This study demonstrated elevated beta band activity in children with overweight or obesity when viewing high-calorie food stimuli. Beta band activity may, thus, be a valuable target for neuromodulatory interventions in children with overweight or obesity.</p>

	<p>Background: Multimodal postoperative pain regimens are widely used following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, there are few studies on the rehabilitation of the co-application of local infiltration analgesia (LIA) and femoral nerve block (FNB) combined with dexmedetomidine (DEX) for patients undergoing TKA. This study aimed to investigate the effect of LIA plus FNB and co-application of perioperative DEX on TKA outcomes. Methods: 95 patients were randomized into two groups. Patients in group B (n = 48) received a single preoperative FNB and LIA. Patients in group A (n = 47) received FNB and LIA, as well as continuous intravenous injection of DEX starting from the induction of anesthesia to postoperative day 2. All patients were allowed patient-controlled analgesia postoperatively. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores, knee range of motion (ROM) degrees, narcotic consumption, length of hospital stay (LOS), complications, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) scores and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B) Scores were recorded. Results: In group A, the mean VAS scores at rest and during movement were lower, the amount of rescue analgesia was decreased, first time of ambulation was reduced, ROM was improved, MoCA-B Scores were increased, LOS was shorter, HSS scores were higher postoperatively compared with group B (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Our study indicated multimodal analgesia involving a single FNB and LIA combined with DEX accelerates rehabilitation for patients undergoing TKA.</p>

	<p>Proprioceptive deficits are common following stroke, yet the white matter involved in proprioception is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that multiple cortical regions are involved in proprioception, each connected by major white matter tracts, namely: Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (branches I, II and III), Arcuate Fasciculus and Middle Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF I, SLF II, SLF III, AF and MdLF respectively). However, direct evidence on the involvement of these tracts in proprioception is lacking. Diffusion imaging was used to investigate the proprioceptive role of the SLF I, SLF II, SLF III, AF and MdLF in 26 participants with stroke, and seven control participants without stroke. Proprioception was assessed using a robotic Arm Position Matching (APM) task, performed in a Kinarm Exoskeleton robotic device. Lesions impacting each tract resulted in worse APM task performance. Lower Fractional Anisotropy (FA) was also associated with poorer APM task performance for the SLF II, III, AF and MdLF. Finally, connectivity data surrounding the cortical regions connected by each tract accurately predicted APM task impairments post-stroke. This study highlights the importance of major cortico&amp;amp;ndash;cortical white matter tracts, particularly the SLF III and AF, for accurate proprioception after stroke. It advances our understanding of the white matter tracts responsible for proprioception.</p>

	<p>Cerebral ischemia impedes the functional or metabolic demands of the central nervous system (CNS), which subsequently leads to irreversible brain damage. While recanalization of blocked vessels recovers cerebral blood flow, it can also aggravate brain injury, termed as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Exosomes, nanometric membrane vesicles, attracted wide attention as carriers of biological macromolecules. In the brain, exosomes can be secreted by almost all types of cells, and their contents can be altered during the pathological and clinical processes of cerebral I/R injury. Herein, we will review the current literature on the possible role of cargos derived from exosomes and exosomes-mediated intercellular communication in cerebral I/R injury. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched through January 2015. The studies published in English were identified using search terms including &amp;amp;ldquo;exosomes&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;brain ischemia-reperfusion injury&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;stroke&amp;amp;rdquo;. We will also focus on the potential therapeutic effects of stem cell-derived exosomes and underlying mechanisms in cerebral I/R injury. Meanwhile, with the advantages of low immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, high bioavailability, and the capacity to pass through the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier, exosomes also attract more attention as therapeutic modalities for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury.</p>

	<p>There are few clinical and electrophysiological studies on paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) with peripheral nerve damage, which brings great challenges to clinical identification and diagnosis. We analyzed the clinical and electrophysiological data of twenty-five confirmed PNS cases using peripheral nerve damage patients. The results showed the most common chief complaint was weakness (20/25, 80%), followed by numbness (13/25, 52%). Nineteen patients (76%) exhibited peripheral nervous system lesions prior to occult tumors, and the median time from symptom onset to the diagnosis of a tumor was 4 months. The electrophysiological results revealed a higher rate of abnormal amplitudes than latency or conduction velocity, especially in sensory nerves. Meanwhile, we found that, compared with patients &amp;amp;gt;65 y, patients aged &amp;amp;le;65 y exhibited more chronic onset (p = 0.01) and longer disease duration (p = 0.01), more motor nerve involvements (p = 0.02), more amplitude involvement (p = 0.01), and higher rates of the inability to walk independently at presentation (p = 0.02). The present study construed that weakness and paresthesia are common symptoms in PNS with peripheral nerve damage in some areas, and the electrophysiological results mainly changed in amplitude. Tumor screening in young and middle-aged patients with peripheral neuropathy cannot be ignored.</p>

	<p>Chronic pain is associated with abnormal cortical excitability and increased pain intensity. Research investigating the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate motor cortex excitability and reduce pain in individuals with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) yield mixed results. The present randomised, placebo-controlled study examined the impact of anodal-tDCS over left-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC) on motor cortex excitability and pain in those with CLBP. Nineteen participants with CLBP (Mage = 53.16 years, SDage = 14.80 years) received 20-min of sham or anodal tDCS, twice weekly, for 4 weeks. Short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were assessed using paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation prior to and immediately following the tDCS intervention. Linear Mixed Models revealed no significant effect of tDCS group or time, on SICI or ICF. The interactions between tDCS group and time on SICI and ICF only approached significance. Bayesian analyses revealed the anodal-tDCS group demonstrated higher ICF and SICI following the intervention compared to the sham-tDCS group. The anodal-tDCS group also demonstrated a reduction in pain intensity and self-reported disability compared to the sham-tDCS group. These findings provide preliminary support for anodal-tDCS over left-DLPFC to modulate cortical excitability and reduce pain in CLBP.</p>

	<p>Cognitive difficulties are common in people with mental health issues, including psychotic disorders, although this population may have difficulty accessing treatments due to various challenges, including transportation, remembering appointments, or discomfort in crowded or unfamiliar places. Home-based services can be crucial and effective for reaching populations with accessibility issues; one home-based intervention technique is individual cognitive stimulation (iCS), which has been shown to be an effective strategy to target and improve cognitive functioning in various samples. Using a previously established Portuguese iCS protocol, based on an initial brief cognitive assessment and the subsequent administration of cognitive stimulation materials and reflection exercises, the current randomized controlled trial explored the effectiveness of the iCS intervention on participants in Portugal with psychotic disorders. Outcome tools included measures of cognition, depression, quality of life, and functional abilities at baseline, the completion of the intervention, and post-intervention follow-up. With two well-matched groups at baseline, the results revealed significant improvements in the intervention group on cognitive functioning, depression, quality of life, and, more modestly, functional activities. These results offer an important contribution to the field of iCS protocols, in an effort to enhance the lives and well-being of various clinical populations, including those with psychotic disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current views of community and hospital pharmacists on pharmaceutical care services in the United Arab Emirates: A mixed methodological study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The profession of pharmacy has evolved significantly in recent years in terms of professional service delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the current views of pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on pharmaceutical care services and the nature of barriers encountered in practice using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among hospital and community pharmacists (n = 305) between March and May 2021, using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. In the qualitative phase, 15 interviews were conducted to explore five main criteria: patient information, inadequate patient counseling, prescribing errors prevention and identifying drug-related problems, lack of participation in health awareness programs, and barriers to pharmaceutical care implementation. In the quantitative phase, 305 consenting pharmacists completed a questionnaire on seven criteria: demographic profile, pharmacist-physician interaction, patient counseling assessment, patient reports of adverse drug events, pharmacist participation in health awareness programs, perceptions of reducing prescribing errors and identifying drug-related problems, and barriers to appropriate pharmaceutical care implementation. Results: The results of both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study revealed that pharmacists' influence on practice in the UAE is limited due to many factors, mainly lack of time and patients' ignorance of the pharmacist's role in the medical field. The mean responses regarding pharmacists' approach to patient counseling and patients' knowledge of pharmacists' role in managing adverse drug reactions were 77.1% and 59.7%, respectively. Active participation in health awareness programs was 64.8%. The mean positive response of participants in reducing prescribing errors and recognizing drug-related problems was 9.2%. Pharmacists' age and number of years in practice were the most important factors influencing the pharmaceutical care services implementation. Conclusion: The study has shown the need to shed light on the proper implementation of pharmaceutical care while maintaining a trusting relationship with physicians.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Decoding the Time Course of Spatial Information from Spiking and Local Field Potential Activities in the Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Place code representation is ubiquitous in circuits that encode spatial parameters. For visually guided eye movements, neurons in many brain regions emit spikes when a stimulus is presented in their receptive fields and/or when a movement is directed into their movement fields. Crucially, individual neurons respond for a broad range of directions or eccentricities away from the optimal vector, making it difficult to decode the stimulus location or the saccade vector from each cell&rsquo;s activity. We investigated whether it is possible to decode the spatial parameter with a population-level analysis, even when the optimal vectors are similar across neurons. Spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in the superior colliculus (SC) were recorded with a laminar probe as monkeys performed a delayed saccade task to one of eight targets radially equidistant in direction. A classifier was applied offline to decode the spatial configuration as the trial progresses from sensation to action. For spiking activity, decoding performance across all eight directions was highest during the visual and motor epochs and lower but well above chance during the delay period. Classification performance followed a similar pattern for LFP activity too, except the performance during the delay period was limited mostly to the preferred direction. Increasing the number of neurons in the population consistently increased classifier performance for both modalities. Overall, this study demonstrates the power of population activity for decoding spatial information not possible from individual neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Tree Shrews as an Animal Model for Studying Perceptual Decision-Making Reveal a Critical Role of Stimulus-Independent Processes in Guiding Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Decision-making is an essential cognitive process by which we interact with the external world. However, attempts to understand the neural mechanisms of decision-making are limited by the current available animal models and the technologies that can be applied to them. Here, we build on the renewed interest in using tree shrews (<I>Tupaia belangeri</I>) in vision research and provide strong support for them as a model for studying visual perceptual decision-making. Tree shrews learned very quickly to perform a two-alternative forced choice contrast discrimination task, and they exhibited differences in response time distributions depending on the reward and punishment structure of the task. Specifically, they made occasional fast guesses when incorrect responses are punished by a constant increase in the interval between trials. This behavior was suppressed when faster incorrect responses were discouraged by longer intertrial intervals. By fitting the behavioral data with two variants of racing diffusion decision models, we found that the between-trial delay affected decision-making by modulating the drift rate of a time accumulator. Our results thus provide support for the existence of an internal process that is independent of the evidence accumulation in decision-making and lay a foundation for future mechanistic studies of perceptual decision-making using tree shrews.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain-based learning in design and visual arts education: a bibliometric assessment of Scopus indexed literature [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to critically review, quantify, and assess research outcomes on brain-based learning with an evidence-based study on Scopus indexed literature, with a focus to understand the evolution structure and growth, detect trends, subject development, and most importantly, identify the gaps in the published body of literature that relates brain-based learning to design and visual arts education. Methods: Various scientometric tools were used to map, visualize, and analyze 186 research publications, indexed in Scopus in a twenty-year timespan ‘2001-2021’. Annual publication trends, relevant sources, prolific authors, authorship patterns, productive organizations and countries, funding agencies, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and thematic evolution mapping on brain-based learning publications were examined in this study. Results: Despite the significance to apply brain-based learning strategies in design and visual arts education to boost students’ knowledge and creative skills, the findings show a decline in quantities and growth patterns in brain-based learning research directed towards design disciplines in the past twenty years. Among the identified (186) documents published in (128) sources, with (1013) citations, the study detected only (57) research (30%) that were related to ‘design education,’ including those focusing on ‘instructional design, ‘and ‘syllabus design’ whereas only (3) articles were in ‘design and visual arts’ disciplines. Conclusion: These rather small numbers reflect the big gap in the current body of literature that associates brain-based learning with creativity-based disciplines, specifically in design and visual arts education. This infers the necessity to direct the attention of academics, researchers, and educationalists in the fields of design and arts towards brain-based learning applications, research and pedagogy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Measuring the motives of informal entrepreneurs [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Handling non-observed activities pose major challenges to the governments and other stakeholders. Non-observed activities refer to underground activities, illegal activities, informal sector and any other activities that result in goods or services consumed by the household. The impact of these non-observed activities shows that the volume of people involved in the informal sector will rapidly increase. Informal economic activities are technically illegal yet are not intended as antisocial,   thereby remaining acceptable to many individuals within the society. This research aimed to identify the factors that lead to entrepreneurial necessity and opportunity.   Methods – The data of 51 respondents who were employed as informal entrepreneurs in Klang Valley areas in Malaysia was collected with the use of a questionnaire and convenient and proportionate sampling techniques. The data were analysed using SPSS software.   Results – The two primary drivers of informal entrepreneurial activity were necessity and opportunity. The inability to find a formal job was an example of being driven by necessity. Meanwhile, individuals that are driven by opportunity chose to work independently in these informal sectors. Between necessity and engagement, refinement acted as a mediator. Often, necessity and opportunity do not automatically translate into successful entrepreneurship; further refinement is required in terms of market potential, technology usage, location preferences, and capital requirements. Improved refinement results in increased entrepreneurial engagement.  Conclusions - The role and contribution of the informal sector entrepreneurship in economic development need to be evaluated and not just observed as an opportunity for individuals who choose this type of career. Therefore, further research is required in a wider variety of contexts to evaluate whether the same remains true in different populations. The results of this study can be useful for the government to set policies to encourage the transition of informal to formal entrepreneurships in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Plausible pathway for a host-parasite molecular replication network to increase its complexity through Darwinian evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rikuto Kamiura, Ryo Mizuuchi, Norikazu Ichihashi</p>

How the complexity of primitive self-replication molecules develops through Darwinian evolution remains a mystery with regards to the origin of life. Theoretical studies have proposed that coevolution with parasitic replicators increases network complexity by inducing inter-dependent replication. Particularly, Takeuchi and Hogeweg proposed a complexification process of replicator networks by successive appearance of a parasitic replicator followed by the addition of a new host replicator that is resistant to the parasitic replicator. However, the feasibility of such complexification with biologically relevant molecules is still unknown owing to the lack of an experimental model. Here, we investigated the plausible complexification pathway of host-parasite replicators using both an experimental host-parasite RNA replication system and a theoretical model based on the experimental system. We first analyzed the parameter space that allows for sustainable replication in various replication networks ranging from a single molecule to three-member networks using computer simulation. The analysis shows that the most plausible complexification pathway from a single host replicator is the addition of a parasitic replicator, followed by the addition of a new host replicator that is resistant to the parasite, consistent with the previous study by Takeuchi and Hogeweg. We also provide evidence that the pathway actually occurred in our previous evolutionary experiment. These results provide experimental evidence that a population of a single replicator spontaneously evolves into multi-replicator networks through coevolution with parasitic replicators.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for how you can help make your lab a better place as a graduate student or postdoc</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthias C. Rillig</p>

Lab teams are dynamic entities in which a lot depends on the principal investigator (PI) and the framework set by them. However, within these parameters, there is a lot of room for lab members to contribute to a happy and productive environment. Often doctoral students or postdocs (or other staff) may underestimate how much of a difference they can really make. Here are 10 simple rules on how to help make a lab a better place; these rules are mostly aimed at building better lab communities, where people help each other, look out for each other, and take an interest in critically questioning the status quo.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten quick tips for sequence-based prediction of protein properties using machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qingzhen Hou, Katharina Waury, Dea Gogishvili, K. Anton Feenstra</p>

The ubiquitous availability of genome sequencing data explains the popularity of machine learning-based methods for the prediction of protein properties from their amino acid sequences. Over the years, while revising our own work, reading submitted manuscripts as well as published papers, we have noticed several recurring issues, which make some reported findings hard to understand and replicate. We suspect this may be due to biologists being unfamiliar with machine learning methodology, or conversely, machine learning experts may miss some of the knowledge needed to correctly apply their methods to proteins. Here, we aim to bridge this gap for developers of such methods. The most striking issues are linked to a lack of clarity: how were annotations of interest obtained; which benchmark metrics were used; how are positives and negatives defined. Others relate to a lack of rigor: If you sneak in structural information, your method is not sequence-based; if you compare your own model to “state-of-the-art,” take the best methods; if you want to conclude that some method is better than another, obtain a significance estimate to support this claim. These, and other issues, we will cover in detail. These points may have seemed obvious to the authors during writing; however, they are not always clear-cut to the readers. We also expect many of these tips to hold for other machine learning-based applications in biology. Therefore, many computational biologists who develop methods in this particular subject will benefit from a concise overview of what to avoid and what to do instead.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interneuronal network model of theta-nested fast oscillations predicts differential effects of heterogeneity, gap junctions and short term depression for hyperpolarizing versus shunting inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guillem Via, Roman Baravalle, Fernando R. Fernandez, John A. White, Carmen C. Canavier</p>

Theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus have been hypothesized to play a role in the encoding and retrieval of memories. Recently, it was shown that an intrinsic fast gamma mechanism in medial entorhinal cortex can be recruited by optogenetic stimulation at theta frequencies, which can persist with fast excitatory synaptic transmission blocked, suggesting a contribution of interneuronal network gamma (ING). We calibrated the passive and active properties of a 100-neuron model network to capture the range of passive properties and frequency/current relationships of experimentally recorded PV+ neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). The strength and probabilities of chemical and electrical synapses were also calibrated using paired recordings, as were the kinetics and short-term depression (STD) of the chemical synapses. Gap junctions that contribute a noticeable fraction of the input resistance were required for synchrony with hyperpolarizing inhibition; these networks exhibited theta-nested high frequency oscillations similar to the putative ING observed experimentally in the optogenetically-driven PV-ChR2 mice. With STD included in the model, the network desynchronized at frequencies above ~200 Hz, so for sufficiently strong drive, fast oscillations were only observed before the peak of the theta. Because hyperpolarizing synapses provide a synchronizing drive that contributes to robustness in the presence of heterogeneity, synchronization decreases as the hyperpolarizing inhibition becomes weaker. In contrast, networks with shunting inhibition required non-physiological levels of gap junctions to synchronize using conduction delays within the measured range.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Monitoring real-time transmission heterogeneity from incidence data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yunjun Zhang, Tom Britton, Xiaohua Zhou</p>

The transmission heterogeneity of an epidemic is associated with a complex mixture of host, pathogen and environmental factors. And it may indicate superspreading events to reduce the efficiency of population-level control measures and to sustain the epidemic over a larger scale and a longer duration. Methods have been proposed to identify significant transmission heterogeneity in historic epidemics based on several data sources, such as contact history, viral genomes and spatial information, which may not be available, and more importantly ignore the temporal trend of transmission heterogeneity. Here we attempted to establish a convenient method to estimate real-time heterogeneity over an epidemic. Within the branching process framework, we introduced an instant-individualheterogenous infectiousness model to jointly characterize the variation in infectiousness both between individuals and among different times. With this model, we could simultaneously estimate the transmission heterogeneity and the reproduction number from incidence time series. We validated the model with data of both simulated and real outbreaks. Our estimates of the overall and real-time heterogeneities of the six epidemics were consistent with those presented in the literature. Additionally, our model is robust to the ubiquitous bias of under-reporting and misspecification of serial interval. By analyzing recent data from South Africa, we found evidence that the Omicron might be of more significant transmission heterogeneity than Delta. Our model based on incidence data was proved to be reliable in estimating the real-time transmission heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Inorganic sulfur fixation via a new homocysteine synthase allows yeast cells to cooperatively compensate for methionine auxotrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason S. L. Yu, Benjamin M. Heineike, Johannes Hartl, Simran K. Aulakh, Clara Correia-Melo, Andrea Lehmann, Oliver Lemke, Federica Agostini, Cory T. Lee, Vadim Demichev, Christoph B. Messner, Michael Mülleder, Markus Ralser</p>

The assimilation, incorporation, and metabolism of sulfur is a fundamental process across all domains of life, yet how cells deal with varying sulfur availability is not well understood. We studied an unresolved conundrum of sulfur fixation in yeast, in which organosulfur auxotrophy caused by deletion of the homocysteine synthase Met17p is overcome when cells are inoculated at high cell density. In combining the use of self-establishing metabolically cooperating (SeMeCo) communities with proteomic, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we discovered an uncharacterized gene product YLL058Wp, herein named Hydrogen Sulfide Utilizing-1 (<i>HSU1</i>). Hsu1p acts as a homocysteine synthase and allows the cells to substitute for Met17p by reassimilating hydrosulfide ions leaked from <i>met17Δ</i> cells into O-acetyl-homoserine and forming homocysteine. Our results show that cells can cooperate to achieve sulfur fixation, indicating that the collective properties of microbial communities facilitate their basic metabolic capacity to overcome sulfur limitation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">ERK1/2 signalling dynamics promote neural differentiation by regulating chromatin accessibility and the polycomb repressive complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Claudia I. Semprich, Lindsay Davidson, Adriana Amorim Torres, Harshil Patel, James Briscoe, Vicki Metzis, Kate G. Storey</p>

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a neural inducer in many vertebrate embryos, but how it regulates chromatin organization to coordinate the activation of neural genes is unclear. Moreover, for differentiation to progress, FGF signalling must decline. Why these signalling dynamics are required has not been determined. Here, we show that dephosphorylation of the FGF effector kinase ERK1/2 rapidly increases chromatin accessibility at neural genes in mouse embryos, and, using ATAC-seq in human embryonic stem cell derived spinal cord precursors, we demonstrate that this occurs genome-wide across neural genes. Importantly, ERK1/2 inhibition induces precocious neural gene transcription, and this involves dissociation of the polycomb repressive complex from key gene loci. This takes place independently of subsequent loss of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and transcriptional onset. Transient ERK1/2 inhibition is sufficient for the dissociation of the repressive complex, and this is not reversed on resumption of ERK1/2 signalling. Moreover, genomic footprinting of sites identified by ATAC-seq together with ChIP-seq for polycomb protein Ring1B revealed that ERK1/2 inhibition promotes the occupancy of neural transcription factors (TFs) at non-polycomb as well as polycomb associated sites. Together, these findings indicate that ERK1/2 signalling decline promotes global changes in chromatin accessibility and TF binding at neural genes by directing polycomb and other regulators and appears to serve as a gating mechanism that provides directionality to the process of differentiation.

Enhanced <i>cyp46A1</i> gene expression in astrocytes requires cell activation and IL-6. Our data suggest different roles for CYP46 in both types of cells. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cholesterol-24-hydroxylase (CYP46), a member of the <i>cytochrome P450</i> superfamily of enzymes, is selectively expressed in the brain and is mainly responsible for cholesterol turnover in the central nervous system. Although increased <i>cyp46A1</i> gene expression has been linked to cognitive alterations in aging and observed in neurodegenerative diseases and after traumatic brain injury, a detailed characterization of the brain regions and cell types in which CYP46 is expressed in old individuals has not been performed. Using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, we investigated the specific regions and cell populations in the brain, in which <i>cyp46A1</i> is expressed in 24-month-old mice. We found that CYP46 is localized in the same neuronal populations in young and old brains, mainly in the hippocampus, in cortical layers, and in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. No increase in CYP46 levels was found in astrocytes in old mice brains, in primary astrocyte-neuron cocultures aged in vitro, or in primary cultures of senescent astrocytes. However, interleukin-6 treatment strongly induced <i>cyp46A1</i> expression in reactive astrocytes characterized by high GFAP levels but had no effect in nonactivated astrocytes. Our data suggest that cholesterol-24-hydroxylase expression is triggered in reactive astrocytes in response to proinflammatory signals, probably as part of a response mechanism to injury.</p>

     alt="The local and long-range input landscape of inhibitory neurons in mouse auditory cortex"/>
<p>We used monosynaptic rabies tracing to compare the presynaptic input landscape onto three inhibitory neuron subtypes, PV, SST, and VIP, in the mouse primary auditory cortex (A1). A leakless mutant of TVA receptor allowed us to compare both local patterns of monosynaptic inputs as well as long-range input patterns. Our work can be used as a resource for a quantitative comparison of the location and level of inputs impinging onto discrete populations of neurons in mouse A1.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Roughly 20% of the neurons in the mouse cortex are inhibitory interneurons (INs). Of these, the three major subtypes are parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) expressing neurons. We used monosynaptic rabies tracing to compare the presynaptic input landscape onto these three IN subtypes in the mouse primary auditory cortex (A1). We compared both local patterns of monosynaptic inputs as well as long-range input patterns. The local monosynaptic input landscape to SST neurons was more widespread as compared to PV and VIP neurons. The brain-wide input landscape was rich and heterogeneous with &gt;40 brain regions connecting to all the three INs subtypes from both hemispheres. The general pattern of the long-range input landscape was similar among the groups of INs. Nevertheless, a few differences could be identified. At low resolution, the proportion of local versus long-range inputs was smaller for PV neurons. At mesoscale resolution, we found fewer inputs from temporal association area to VIP INs, and more inputs to SST neurons from basal forebrain and lateral amygdala. Our work can be used as a resource for a quantitative comparison of the location and level of inputs impinging onto discrete populations of neurons in mouse A1.</p>

     alt="Diversity of cellular physiology and morphology of Purkinje cells in the adult zebrafish cerebellum"/><p>Simplified local circuitry of the zebrafish cerebellum based on our results. Four subtypes of Purkinje cells (Type I, II, IIIa, and IIIb) were identified based on the patterns of their dendritic arbors. Their physiology was also variable, but distinguishable from that of nearby eurydendroid cells. All subtypes of Purkinje cells receive parallel fiber (PF) inputs but in a selective manner. While Type II, IIIa, and IIIb cells respond to climbing fiber (CF) activation, it is uncertain whether Type I cells receive CF input. Like the Type I Purkinje cells, eurydendroid cells respond to PF, but not to CF activation. Thus, the zebrafish cerebellar cortex may perform different computations according to its diverse Purkinje cell subtypes, hence requiring a reevaluation of the learning rules expressed in its circuitry.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study was designed to explore the functional circuitry of the adult zebrafish cerebellum, focusing on its Purkinje cells and using whole-cell patch recordings and single cell labeling in slice preparations. Following physiological characterizations, the recorded single cells were labeled for morphological identification. It was found that the zebrafish Purkinje cells are surprisingly diverse. Based on their physiology and morphology, they can be classified into at least three subtypes: Type I, a <i>narrow spike cell</i>, which fires only narrow Na<sup>+</sup> spikes (&lt;3 ms in duration), and has a single primary dendrite with an arbor restricted to the distal molecular layer; Type II, a <i>broad spike cell</i>, which fires broad Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (5–7 ms in duration) and has a primary dendrite with limited branching in the inner molecular layer and then further radiates throughout the molecular layer; and Type III, a <i>very broad spike cell</i>, which fires very broad Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (≥10 ms in duration) and has a dense proximal dendritic arbor that is either restricted to the inner molecular layer (Type IIIa), or radiates throughout the entire molecular layer (Type IIIb). The graded paired-pulse facilitation of these Purkinje cells’ responses to parallel fiber activations and the all-or-none, paired-pulse depression of climbing fiber activation are largely similar to those reported for mammals. The labeled axon terminals of these Purkinje cells end locally, as reported for larval zebrafish. The present study provides evidence that the corresponding functional circuitry and information processing differ from what has been well-established in the mammalian cerebellum.</p>

                Liquid and elastic behaviors of tissues drives their morphology and their response to the environment. They appear as the first insight into tissue mechanics. We explore the role of individual cell properties on spheroids of mouse muscle precursor cells and investigate the role of intermediate filaments on surface tension and Young's modulus. By attening multicellular myoblast aggregates under magnetic constraint, we measure their rigidity and surface tension and show that they act as highly sensitive macroscopic reporters closely related to microscopic local tension and effective adhesion. Shedding light on the major contributions of acto-myosin contractility, actin organization and intercellular adhesions, we reveal the role of a major component of intermediate filaments in the muscle, desmin and its organization, on the macroscopic mechanics of these tissue models. Implicated in the mechanical and shape integrity of cells, intermediate filaments are found to be crucial to the mechanics of unorganized muscle tissue models even at an early stage of differentiation both in terms of elasticity and surface tension.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evaluation of in silico predictors on short nucleotide variants in HBA1, HBA2 and HBB associated with haemoglobinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Haemoglobinopathies are the commonest monogenic diseases worldwide and are caused by variants in the globin gene clusters. With over 2400 variants detected to date, their interpretation using the ACMG/AMP guidelines is challenging and computational evidence can provide valuable input about their functional annotation. While many <i>in silico</i> predictors have already been developed, their performance varies for different genes and diseases. In this study, we evaluate 31 <i>in silico</i> predictors using a dataset of 1627 variants in <i>HBA1</i>, <i>HBA2,</i> and <i>HBB</i>. By varying the decision threshold for each tool, we analyse their performance (a) as binary classifiers of pathogenicity, and (b) by using different non-overlapping pathogenic and benign thresholds for their optimal use in the ACMG/AMP framework. Our results show that CADD, Eigen-PC, and REVEL are the overall top performers, with the former reaching moderate strength level for pathogenic prediction. Eigen-PC and REVEL achieve the highest accuracies for missense variants, while CADD is also a reliable predictor of non-missense variants. Moreover, SpliceAI is the top performing splicing predictor, reaching strong level of evidence, while GERP++ and phyloP are the most accurate conservation tools. This study provides evidence about the optimal use of computational tools in globin gene clusters under the ACMG/AMP framework.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Amino acid transporter SLC38A5 regulates developmental and pathological retinal angiogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Amino acid (AA) metabolism in vascular endothelium is important for sprouting angiogenesis. SLC38A5 (solute carrier family 38 member 5), an AA transporter, shuttles neutral AAs across cell membrane, including glutamine, which may serve as metabolic fuel for proliferating endothelial cells (ECs) to promote angiogenesis. Here, we found that <i>Slc38a5</i> is highly enriched in normal retinal vascular endothelium, and more specifically, in pathological sprouting neovessels. <i>Slc38a5</i> is suppressed in retinal blood vessels from <i>Lrp5<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Ndp<sup>y/−</sup></i> mice, both genetic models of defective retinal vascular development with Wnt signaling mutations. Additionally, <i>Slc38a5</i> transcription is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Genetic deficiency of <i>Slc38a5</i> in mice substantially delays retinal vascular development and suppresses pathological neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy modeling ischemic proliferative retinopathies. Inhibition of <i>SLC38A5</i> in human retinal vascular ECs impairs EC proliferation and angiogenic function, suppresses glutamine uptake, and dampens vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Together these findings suggest that SLC38A5 is a new metabolic regulator of retinal angiogenesis by controlling AA nutrient uptake and homeostasis in ECs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Urotensin II-related peptides, Urp1 and Urp2, control zebrafish spine morphology</a></h4>

              
                The spine provides structure and support to the body, yet how it develops its characteristic morphology as the organism grows is little understood. This is underscored by the commonality of conditions in which the spine curves abnormally such as scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis. Understanding the origin of such spinal curves has been challenging in part due to the lack of appropriate animal models. Recently, zebrafish have emerged as promising tools with which to understand the origin of spinal curves. Using zebrafish, we demonstrate that the Urotensin II-related peptides (URPs), Urp1 and Urp2, are essential for maintaining spine morphology. Urp1 and Urp2 are 10-amino acid cyclic peptides expressed by neurons lining the central canal of the spinal cord. Upon combined genetic loss of Urp1 and Urp2, adolescent-onset planar curves manifested in the caudal region of the spine. Highly similar curves were caused by mutation of Uts2r3, an URP receptor. Quantitative comparisons revealed that Urotensin-associated curves were distinct from other zebrafish spinal curve mutants in curve position and direction. Last, we found that the Reissner fiber, a proteinaceous thread that sits in the central canal and has been implicated in the control of spine morphology, breaks down prior to curve formation mutants with perturbed cilia motility but was unaffected by loss of Uts2r3. This suggests a Reissner fiber-independent mechanism of curvature in Urotensin-deficient mutants. Overall, our results show that Urp1 and Urp2 control zebrafish spine morphology and establish new animal models of spine deformity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human hippocampal responses to network intracranial stimulation vary with theta phase</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal-dependent memory is thought to be supported by distinct connectivity states, with strong input to the hippocampus benefitting encoding and weak input benefitting retrieval. Previous research in rodents suggests that the hippocampal theta oscillation orchestrates the transition between these states, with opposite phase angles predicting minimal versus maximal input. We investigated whether this phase dependence exists in humans using network-targeted intracranial stimulation. Intracranial local field potentials were recorded from individuals with epilepsy undergoing medically necessary stereotactic electroencephalographic recording. In each subject, biphasic bipolar direct electrical stimulation was delivered to lateral temporal sites with demonstrated connectivity to hippocampus. Lateral temporal stimulation evoked ipsilateral hippocampal potentials with distinct early and late components. Using evoked component amplitude to measure functional connectivity, we assessed whether the phase of hippocampal theta predicted relatively high versus low connectivity. We observed an increase in the continuous phase-amplitude relationship selective to the early and late components of the response evoked by lateral temporal stimulation. The maximal difference in these evoked component amplitudes occurred across 180 degrees of separation in the hippocampal theta rhythm; i.e., the greatest difference in component amplitude was observed when stimulation was delivered at theta peak versus trough. The pattern of theta phase dependence observed for hippocampus was not identified for control locations. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal receptivity to input varies with theta phase, suggesting that theta phase reflects connectivity states of human hippocampal networks. These findings confirm a putative mechanism by which neural oscillations modulate human hippocampal function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CD47 cross-dressing by extracellular vesicles expressing CD47 inhibits phagocytosis without transmitting cell death signals</a></h4>

              
                Transgenic CD47 overexpression is an encouraging approach to ameliorating xenograft rejection and alloresponses to pluripotent stem cells, and the efficacy correlates with the level of CD47 expression. However, CD47, upon ligation, also transmits signals leading to cell dysfunction or death, raising a concern that overexpressing CD47 could be harmful. Here, we unveiled an alternative source of cell surface CD47. We showed that extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, released from normal or tumor cells overexpressing CD47 (transgenic or native) can induce efficient CD47 cross-dressing on pig or human cells. Like the autogenous CD47, CD47 cross-dressed on cell surfaces is capable of interacting with SIRPα to inhibit phagocytosis. However, ligation of the autogenous, but not cross-dressed, CD47 induced cell death. Thus, CD47 cross-dressing provides an alternative source of cell surface CD47 that may elicit its anti-phagocytic function without transmitting harmful signals to the cells. CD47 cross-dressing also suggests a previously unidentified mechanism for tumor-induced immunosuppression. Our findings should help to further optimize the CD47 transgenic approach that may improve outcomes by minimizing the harmful effects of CD47 overexpression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The evolution and biological correlates of hand preferences in anthropoid primates</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of human right-handedness has been intensively debated for decades. Manual lateralization patterns in non-human primates have the potential to elucidate evolutionary determinants of human handedness, but restricted species samples and inconsistent methodologies have so far limited comparative phylogenetic studies. By combining original data with published literature reports, we assembled data on hand preferences for standardized object manipulation in 1786 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans. Based on that, we employ quantitative phylogenetic methods to test prevalent hypotheses on the roles of ecology, brain size, and tool use in primate handedness evolution. We confirm that human right-handedness represents an unparalleled extreme among anthropoids and found taxa displaying population-level handedness to be rare. Species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates and did not strongly correlate with any of the selected biological predictors, nor with phylogeny. In contrast, we recovered highly variable patterns of hand preference strength, which show signatures of both ecology and phylogeny. In particular, terrestrial primates tend to display weaker hand preferences than arboreal species. These results challenge popular ideas on primate handedness evolution, including the postural origins hypothesis. Furthermore, they point to a potential adaptive benefit of disparate lateralization strength in primates, a measure of hand preference that has often been overlooked in the past. Finally, our data show that human lateralization patterns do not align with trends found among other anthropoids, suggesting that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences of our species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta tACS over rIFG and preSMA Improves Stopping Ability for Younger but not Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                A growing body of research suggests that changes in both structural and functional connectivity in the ageing brain contribute to cognitive declines observed in later life. In recent years, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has garnered substantial research interest as a potential tool for the modulation of functional connectivity. Here, we report the findings from a double-blind crossover study that investigated the effects of dual-site beta tACS over the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) on the response inhibition performance of healthy older (n = 15, aged 61-79 years) and healthy younger (n = 18, aged 18-34 years) adults. Two tACS conditions were administered in separate sessions: in-phase tACS, where electrical currents delivered to rIFG and preSMA have a 0{degrees} phase difference, and anti-phase tACS, where the currents have a 180{degrees} phase difference. In-phase tACS was found to significantly improve response inhibition of only younger individuals, with better inhibitory performance associated with stronger rIFG-preSMA functional connectivity. Anti-phase tACS did not result in any significant changes in response inhibition or functional connectivity for either age group. It was posited that these findings were due to the disparity of tACS-induced field strengths in the stimulated regions, inter-individual variability in the tACS-induced effects on rIFG-preSMA connectivity, and age-related brain atrophy. The current study sheds light on the complex nature of responses to non-invasive brain stimulation, which potentially contributes to the development of novel neuromodulation-based therapeutic interventions for the maintenance of cognitive function in older adults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational modeling reveals latent components of mouse behavior in the sucrose preference test</a></h4>

              
                The sucrose preference test (SPT) measures the relative preference of a sucrose solution over water to assess hedonic behaviors in rodents. The SPT involves numerous complex behaviors, including learning, motivation, and choice. Yet, it remains uncertain whether its main outcome measure, sucrose preference, can reflect these behavioral subcomponents. Here, we conducted an experimental and computational decomposition of mouse behavior in the SPT and discovered previously unrecognized behavioral subcomponents associated with changes in sucrose preference. While both acute and chronic stress reduced sucrose preference, only chronic stress evoked anhedonia. Additionally, reduced sucrose preference induced by optogenetics is not always indicative of anhedonia but can also reflect learning deficits. Even small variations in experimental conditions influence behavior, task outcome and interpretation. Thus, an ostensibly simple behavioral task can entail high levels of complexity, demonstrating the need for careful dissection of behavior into its subcomponents when studying the underlying neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biologically plausible unsupervised learning in neural networks with sparse and asymmetric connectivity</a></h4>

              
                In the search for biologically plausible but mathematically precise theories of learning in the brain, recent studies have begun to investigate how key assumptions underlying algorithms for supervised learning in artificial neural networks can be relaxed in biologically plausible ways. Turning to unsupervised learning, we develop biologically more plausible variants of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and benchmark their performance on MNIST. We show that RBMs with asymmetric connectivity can still be successfully trained with contrastive divergence, even if no two units are reciprocally connected. Furthermore, RBMs are able to learn if the forward, visible-to-hidden layer weights are kept constant and only the backward, hidden-to-visible layer weights are updated. These findings indicate that neural networks with biologically plausible connectivity support contrastive learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How gut hormones shape reward: a systematic review of the role of ghrelin and GLP-1 in human fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The gastrointestinal hormones ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) have opposite secretion patterns, as well as opposite effects on metabolism and food intake. Beyond their role in energy homeostasis, gastrointestinal hormones have also been suggested to modulate the reward system. However, the potential of ghrelin and GLP-1 to modulate reward responses in humans has not been systematically reviewed before. To evaluate the convergence of published results, we first conduct a multi-level kernel density meta-analysis of studies reporting a positive association of ghrelin (Ncomb = 353, 18 contrasts) and a negative association of GLP-1 (Ncomb = 258, 12 contrasts) and reward responses measured using task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Second, we complement the meta-analysis using a systematic literature review, focusing on distinct reward phases and applications in clinical populations that may account for variability across studies. In line with preclinical research, we find that ghrelin increases reward responses across studies in key nodes of the motivational circuit, such as the nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and the dorsal mid insula. In contrast, for GLP-1, we did not find sufficient convergence in support of reduced reward responses. Instead, our systematic review identifies potential differences of GLP-1 on anticipatory versus consummatory reward responses. Based on a systematic synthesis of available findings, we conclude that there is considerable support for the neuromodulatory potential of gut-based circulating peptides on reward responses. To unlock their potential for clinical applications, future studies may move beyond anticipated rewards to cover other reward facets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">JMJD3 is a Key Regulator of Dopamine Synthesis in Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of dopamine (DA) biosynthesis is critical for the functionalities of midbrain DA neurons. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine (DA) biosynthesis in midbrain DA neurons. Here we report that DA contents are decreased in the midbrain and striatum of DA neuron-specific JMJD3 conditional knockdown mice. Consistent results are obtained from mice underwent pharmaceutical JMJD3 inhibition. Biochemical and histological experiments reveal that TH mRNA and protein levels are specifically decreased in DA neurons residing in ventral tegmental area but not substantia nigra pars compacta. On behavioral level, JMJD3 knockdown affects inflammation-induced chronic mechanical hyperalgesia but not locomotor coordination, corresponding to DA-associated behavior in ventral tegmental area and in substantia nigra pars compacta, respectively. Mechanistically, using a midbrain DA neuron culture, we demonstrate that JMJD3 transactivates TH gene expression through direct binding onto TH promoter and catalyzing H3K27 de-methylation. In summary, our findings reveal a novel role of JMJD3 in adult midbrain DA system and suggest its functional specificity with DA subtype heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical networks relating to arousal are differentially coupled to neural activity and hemodynamics</a></h4>

              
                Even in the absence of specific sensory input or a behavioral task, the brain produces structured patterns of activity. This organized activity has been shown to be modulated by changes in arousal. Here, we use wide-field voltage imaging to establish the relationship between cortical network activity and arousal in spontaneously behaving head-fixed mice expressing the voltage sensitive fluorescent FRET sensor Butterfly 1.2. This approach allowed us to simultaneously image hemodynamic and voltage activity, and then compare fMRI analogous activity changes to the direct cortical voltage activity in relation to arousal and movement. Arousal and facial movements were assessed through analysis of face video recordings. We find that changes in pupil diameter were differentially coupled to hemodynamics and cortical voltage activity in a regionally and frequency specific way. Further this coupling changed between periods of spontaneous facial movements, and periods of rest. Our results indicate that while fMRI-like hemodynamic signals show strong relations to behavior and arousal, these relations are distinct from those shown by brain voltage activity.

                SummaryPresynaptic terminals are actively relocated during development to refine circuit function, but the underlying cell biological mechanisms are largely unknown. In C. elegans, the presynaptic boutons of GABAergic DD neurons are moved to new locations during early larval development. We show that developmentally regulated expression of a presynaptic Epithelial Na+ Channel (ENaC), UNC-8, promotes a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, resembling Activity-Dependent Bulk Endocytosis (ADBE), that dismantles presynaptic material for reassembly at nascent DD synapses. ADBE normally functions in highly active neurons to accelerate local recycling of synaptic vesicles. We show that DD presynaptic remodeling depends on canonical features of ADBE including elevated intracellular Ca2+, the phosphatase Calcineurin and its targets, dynamin and the F-BAR protein syndapin, and Arp2/3-driven actin polymerization. Thus, our findings suggest that a native mechanism (ADBE) for maintaining neurotransmitter release at local synapses has been repurposed, in this case, to dismantle presynaptic terminals for reassembly at new locations.

                Breathing is vital and must be concurrently robust and flexible. This rhythmic behavior is generated and maintained within a rostro-caudally aligned set of medullary nuclei called the Ventral Respiratory Column (VRC). The rhythmic properties of individual VRC nuclei are well known, yet technical challenges have limited the interrogation of the entire VRC population simultaneously. Here, we characterize over 13,000 VRC units using high-density electrophysiology, opto-tagging, and histological reconstruction. Population dynamics analysis reveals interactions between inspiratory and expiratory dynamical states give rise to a low-dimensional, elliptical neural manifold. The structure of this manifold is robust and maintained even during opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). However, during severe hypoxia-induced gasping, the low-dimensional dynamics of the VRC reconfigure from rotational to all-or-none, ballistic efforts.

                Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a public health crisis currently being exacerbated by increased rates of use and overdose of synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers and treatment strategies to reduce problematic fentanyl use and relapse to fentanyl taking is critical. In recent years, there has been a growing body of work demonstrating that the gut microbiome can serve as a potent modulator of the behavioral and transcriptional responses to both stimulants and opioids. Here, we advance this work to define how manipulations of the microbiome drive fentanyl intake and fentanyl seeking in a translationally relevant drug self-administration model. Additionally, we utilize global proteomic analysis of the nucleus accumbens following microbiome manipulation and fentanyl administration to define how microbiome status alters the functional proteomic landscape in this key limbic substructure. These findings establish clear relevance for gut-brain signaling in OUD, and lay foundations for further translational work in this space.

                To understand how sensory events are represented in and perceived by the brain, one must understand how varying internal brain states affect neuronal decoding of sensory input. Recent studies indicate global state changes in the brain impact the representation of haptic events in neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). It could be argued that the manipulations used so far to alter the cortical circuitry behavior were artificial and not reflective of normal information processing in the neocortex. In the present study we therefore wanted to explore if natural visual stimulation also could impact the interpretation of given tactile input patterns. We recorded the unitary extracellular responses to a set of spatiotemporal tactile input patterns presented either alone or together with simultaneously multicolor flashing lights from a large number of neurons in parallel in the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We found that the visual input, mildly but consistently altered the temporal spike outputs to tactile input patterns in S1 neurons. We argue that the visual input change the global cortical state to an extent that it affects the cortical representation of haptic events even within the S1 and that this is an indication that the cortical network in its information processing may be far more reliant on globally distributed network dynamics than traditionally thought.

                Some experiences are stronger than others: they have greater phenomenal magnitude. Although the phenomenal magnitude of experience is a familiar component of human consciousness, the computational scheme underpinning its encoding in the brain is unknown. In particular, it is unknown whether phenomenal magnitude is encoded in a "rich" manner, via the strengthening or broadcast of content-specific perceptual representations, or a "sparse" scheme, in which a content-invariant signal monitors the reliability or precision of first-order contents. In a reanalysis of existing MEG and fMRI data from two distinct studies, we operationalise phenomenal magnitude as subjective ratings of awareness and visibility to address this question. We find that phenomenal magnitude is associated with content-invariant neural signatures distributed across visual, parietal, and frontal cortices. Moreover, we show that these neural signatures exhibit similarities with other analogue magnitude codes such as number, with each rating being represented as being more similar to its neighbours, and less similar to more distant ratings. Our findings suggest a role for a content-invariant analogue magnitude code in determining the strength of perceptual experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior Knowledge Biases the Perception of Body Postures</a></h4>

              
                Body postures provide information about others' actions, intentions, and emotional states. However, little is known about how postures are represented in the brain's visual system. Considering our extensive visuomotor experience with body postures, we hypothesized that priors derived from this experience may systematically bias visual body posture representations. We examined two priors: gravity and biomechanical constraints. Gravity pushes lifted body parts downwards, while biomechanical constraints limit the range of possible postures (e.g., an arm raised far behind the head cannot go down further). We probed participants' (N = 246) memory of briefly presented postures using change discrimination and adjustment tasks. Results showed that lifted arms were misremembered as lower and as more similar to biomechanically plausible postures. Inverting the body stimuli eliminated both biases, implicating holistic body processing. Together, these findings show that knowledge shapes body posture representations, reflecting modulation from a combination of category-general and category-specific priors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding frontotemporal and cell type-specific vulnerabilities to neuropsychiatric disorders and psychoactive drugs</a></h4>

              
                Abnormalities in temporal and frontal lobes (TL and FL) have been linked to cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. While structural and functional differences between the brain lobes have been documented in disease, the cellular heterogeneity in FL and TL and its impact to the vulnerability to genetic risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders is not well studied. We hypothesize that intrinsic cellular-level differences between TL and FL explain the vulnerability of specific cell types to genetic risk factors and psychoactive drugs. To test this, we integrated single-nucleus transcriptome analysis in fresh human FL and TL with data related to genetic susceptibility and gene dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disease, and response to psychoactive drugs. We also investigate how these differences are associated with gene dysregulation in disease brain. Neuronal cell populations were the most vulnerable to psychiatric genetic risk factors, and more specifically parvalbumin interneurons (PVALB neurons). These PVALB-expressed genetic risk factors were mostly upregulated in the TL compared with FL, and dysregulated in the brain of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. We found GRIN2A and HCN1, implicated in schizophrenia by genome-wide association studies, to be significantly upregulated in PVLAB from the TL and in brain cortex from schizophrenia patients. Our analysis provides comprehensive evidence for PVALB neurons as the most vulnerable cell type that is implicated in several psychiatric disorders. PVALB neurons showed the highest vulnerability to psychoactive drug response, which was 3.6-fold higher than the vulnerability to genetic risk factors. In summary, we show high vulnerability of PVALB neurons that is specific to the temporal lobe, implying that differences between TL and FL greatly influence the cell vulnerability to genetic risk factors as well as the response to psychoactive drugs. These findings offer insights into how regional brain differences affect the cell type vulnerabilities in neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Prion-like transmission of pathology in alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinsons disease or multiple system atrophy is increasingly recognized as one potential mechanism to address disease progression. Active and passive immunotherapies targeting insoluble, aggregated alpha-synuclein are already being actively explored in the clinic with mixed outcomes so far. Here, we report the identification of 306C7B3, a highly selective, aggregate-specific alpha-synuclein antibody with picomolar affinity devoid of binding to the monomeric, physiologic protein. 306C7B3 binding is Ser129-phosphorylation independent and shows high affinity to several different aggregated alpha-synuclein polymorphs, increasing the likelihood that it can also bind to the pathological seeds assumed to drive disease progression in patients. In support of this, highly selective binding to pathological aggregates in postmortem brains of MSA patients was demonstrated, with no staining in samples from other human neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve CNS exposure of 306C7B3, an Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) based approach driving expression of the secreted antibody within the brain of (Thy-1)-[A30P]-h-alpha-Synuclein mice was used. Widespread central transduction after intrastriatal inoculation was ensured by using the AAV2HBKO serotype, with transduction being spread to areas far away from the inoculation site. Treatment of (Thy-1)-[A30P]-h-alpha-Synuclein mice at the age of 12 months demonstrated significantly increased survival, with 306C7B3 concentration reaching 3.9 nM in the cerebrospinal fluid. These results suggest that AAV-mediated expression of 306C7B3 has great potential as a disease-modifying therapy for alpha-synucleinopathies as it ensures CNS exposure of the antibody, thereby mitigating the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors are required for potentiation and depression of responses in ocular dominance plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Monocular deprivation (MD) causes an initial decrease in synaptic responses to the deprived eye in juvenile mouse primary visual cortex (V1) through Hebbian long-term depression (LTD). This is followed by a homeostatic increase, which has been attributed to synaptic scaling. However, homeostasis during other forms of visual deprivation is caused by sliding the threshold for Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) rather than scaling. We therefore asked whether the homeostatic increase during MD requires GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor activity, which is required to slide the plasticity threshold but not for synaptic scaling. Selective GluN2B blockade from 2-6d after monocular lid suture prevented the homeostatic increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude in monocular V1 of acute slices and prevented the increase in visually evoked responses in binocular V1 in vivo. The decrease in mEPSC amplitude and visually evoked responses during the first 2d of MD also required GluN2B activity. Together, these results indicate that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors first play a role in LTD immediately following eye closure, and then promote homeostasis during prolonged MD by sliding the plasticity threshold in favor of LTP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypothalamic melanocortin-4 receptors on astrocytes mediate inflammation and body weight homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                World-wide, nearly 40% of the adult population is classified as clinically obese. Central inflammation is highly correlated with obesity and increases morbidity and deterioration of health. The hypothalamus is a brain region that governs many facets of energy homeostasis, and melanocortins in the hypothalamus both decrease feeding and increase metabolism via melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs). Although MC4Rs are present on neurons and astrocytes (aMC4R) previous work has focused almost exclusively on the neuronal population with the contribution of aMC4R on these processes largely unknown. Our objective was to determine the effects of hypothalamic aMC4R deletion on central and peripheral inflammation, as well as feeding and body weight homeostasis. Adult MC4R fl/fl mice were microinjected with an astrocyte-specific promoter driving Cre-expression (AAV-GFAP-GFP-Cre) or AAV-control (AAV-GFAP-GFP; n=4-7/group/sex) to produce a hypothalamic knock-down of aMC4R (KD). Body weight and composition were monitored throughout the study, and indirect calorimetry was conducted at 1 and 4 weeks after AAV injection. Acquisition of operant self-administration of palatable food was also examined. Mice were euthanized 7-8 weeks post AAV injection and brain and tissue samples were collected. We observed a significant increase in body weight, feeding, and energy balance in the KD group compared to control group. Inflammation was significantly increased centrally in KD mice within the hypothalamus, but not peripherally within serum. Additionally, aMC4R KD mice trended towards an increased reward learning for palatable food. This is the first demonstration that hypothalamic aMC4R, independent of neuronal MC4R, is important in modulating inflammation as well as contributing to energy balance. These results provide an integral understanding of the aMC4R system that will provide the foundation for future studies investigating the role of aMC4R in various disease states.

                Mechanisms that augment dopamine (DA) signaling to compensate for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) loss and delay motor impairment in Parkinsons disease remain unidentified. The rat nigrostriatal pathway was unilaterally-lesioned by 6-OHDA to determine whether differences in DA content, TH protein, TH phosphorylation, or D1 receptor expression in striatum or substantia nigra (SN) aligned with onset of hypokinesia at two time points. At 7 days, DA and TH loss in striatum exceeded 95%, whereas DA was unaffected in SN, despite 60% TH loss. At 28 days, hypokinesia was established. At both time points, ser31 TH phosphorylation increased only in SN, corresponding to less DA versus TH loss. ser40 TH phosphorylation was unaffected in striatum or SN. By day 28, D1 receptor expression increased only in lesioned SN. These results indicate that increased ser31 TH phosphorylation and D1 receptor in the SN, not striatum, augment DA signaling against TH loss to mitigate hypokinesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Orthogonal neural encoding of targets and distractors supports multivariate cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                People can overcome a wide array of mental challenges by coordinating their neural information processing to align with their goals. Recent behavioral work has shown that people can independently control their attention across multiple features during perceptual decision-making, but the structure of the neural representations that enables this multivariate control remains mysterious. We hypothesized that the brain solves this complex coordination problem by orthogonalizing feature-specific representations of task demands and attentional priority, allowing the brain to independently monitor and adjust multiple streams of stimulus information. To test this hypothesis, we measured fMRI activity while participants performed a task designed to tag processing and control over feature-specific information that is task-relevant (targets) versus task-irrelevant (distractors). We then characterized the geometry of these neural representations using a novel multivariate analysis (Encoding Geometry Analysis), estimating where the encoding of different task features is correlated versus orthogonal. We identified feature-specific representations of task demands and attentional priority in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), respectively, consistent with differential roles for these regions in monitoring versus directing information processing. Representations of attentional priority in IPS were fully mediated by the control requirements of the task, associated with behavioral performance, and depended on connectivity with nodes in the frontoparietal control network, suggesting that these representations serve a fundamental role in supporting attentional control. Together, these findings provide evidence for a neural geometry that can enable coordinated control over multiple sources of information.

                Assessing the consistency of quantitative MRI measurements is critical for inclusion in longitudinal studies and clinical trials. Intraclass coefficient correlation and coefficient of variation were used to evaluate the different consistency aspects of diffusion- and myelin-based MRI measures. Multi-shell diffusion and inhomogeneous magnetization transfer datasets were collected from twenty healthy adults at a high-frequency of five MRI sessions. The consistency was evaluated across whole bundles and the track-profile along the bundles. The impact of the fiber populations on the consistency was also evaluated using the number of fiber orientations map. For whole and profile bundles, moderate to high reliability of diffusion and myelin measures were observed. We report higher reliability of measures for multiple fiber populations than single. The overall portrait of the most consistent measurements and bundles drawn from a wide range of MRI techniques presented here will be particularly useful for identifying reliable biomarkers capable of detecting, monitoring and predicting white matter changes in clinical applications and has the potential to inform patient-specific treatment strategies.

                The dichotomy of excitation and suppression is one of the canonical mechanisms explaining the complexity of the neural activity. Computational models of the interplay of excitation and suppression in single neurons aim at investigating how this interaction affects a neuron's spiking responses and shapes, for example, the encoding of sensory stimuli. Here, we compare the performance of three filter-based stimulus-encoding models in predicting retinal ganglion cell responses recorded from axolotl, mouse, and marmoset retina to different types of temporally varying visual stimuli. Suppression in these models is implemented via subtractive or divisive interactions of stimulus filters or by a response-driven feedback module. For the majority of ganglion cells, the subtractive and divisive models perform similarly and outperform the feedback model as well as a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with no suppression. Comparison between the subtractive and the divisive model depended on cell type, species, and stimulus components, with the divisive model generalizing best across temporal stimulus frequencies and visual contrast and the subtractive model capturing in particular responses for slow temporal stimulus dynamics and for slow axolotl cells. Overall, we conclude that the divisive and subtractive models are well suited for capturing interactions of excitation and suppression in ganglion cells and emphasize different temporal regimes of these interactions.

                TRPM8 is a non-selective cation channel expressed in primary sensory neurons and other tissues, including prostate and urothelium. Its participation in different physiological and pathological processes such as thermoregulation, pain, itch, inflammation and cancer has been widely de-scribed, making it a promising target for therapeutic approaches. The detection and quantification of TRPM8 seems crucial for advancing in the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying its role in these pathophysiological conditions. Antibody-based techniques are commonly used for protein detection and quantification, although their performance with many ion channels, including TRPM8, is suboptimal. Thus, the search for reliable antibodies is of utmost importance. In this study, we characterized the performance of six TRPM8 commercial antibodies in three immuno-detection techniques: western blot, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Different outcomes were obtained for the tested antibodies; two of them proved to be successful detecting TRPM8 in the three approaches while, in the conditions tested, the other four were acceptable only for specific techniques. Considering our results, we offer some insight into the usefulness of these antibodies for detection of TRMP8 depending on the methodology of choice.

                Dysregulated lipid homeostasis is emerging as a potential cause of neurodegenerative disorders. However, evidence of errors in lipid homeostasis as a pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration remains limited. Here, we show that the cerebellar neurodegeneration caused by SNX14 deficiency is associated with lipid metabolism defects. Recent in vitro and in silico studies indicate that SNX14 is an inter-organelle lipid transfer protein that regulates lipid droplet biogenesis and fatty acid desaturation, suggesting that human SNX14 deficiency belongs to an expanding class of cerebellar neurodegenerative disorders caused by altered cellular lipid homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mouse model that recapitulates the human SNX14 deficiency at genetic and phenotypic level. Through histological and transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cells are selectively vulnerable to SNX14 deficiency, while forebrain regions preserve their neuronal content. Ultrastructure and lipidomic studies reveal widespread lipid storage and metabolism defects in SNX14 deficient mice. Furthermore, we identify a unique lipid metabolite profile that links the accumulation of acylcarnitines with the selective cerebellar neurodegeneration in SNX14 deficiency. These findings highlight the importance of lipid homeostasis for neuronal function and survival and suggest a mechanism for selective cerebellar vulnerability to altered lipid homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Moving and static faces, bodies, objects and scenes are differentially represented across the three visual pathways</a></h4>

              
                Models of human cortex propose the existence of neuroanatomical pathways specialised for different behavioural functions. These pathways include a ventral pathway for object recognition, a dorsal pathway for performing visually guided physical actions and a recently proposed third pathway for social perception. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that different categories of moving stimuli are differentially processed across the dorsal and third pathways according to their behavioural implications. Human participants (N=30) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing moving and static stimuli from five categories (faces, bodies, scenes, objects, and scrambled objects). Whole brain group analyses showed that moving bodies and moving objects increased neural responses in bilateral V5/MT+ and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), parts of the dorsal pathway. In addition, moving faces and moving bodies increased neural responses in bilateral V5/MT+ and the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS), parts of the third pathway. This pattern of results was also supported by a separate region of interest (ROI) analysis showing that moving stimuli produced more robust neural responses for all visual object categories, particularly in lateral and dorsal brain areas. Our results suggest that dynamic naturalistic stimuli from different categories are routed along specific visual pathways that process their unique behavioural implications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural mechanisms of parasite-induced summiting behavior in 'zombie' Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                For at least two centuries, scientists have been enthralled by the zombie behaviors induced by mind-controlling parasites. Despite this interest, the mechanistic bases of these uncanny processes have remained mostly a mystery. Here, we leverage the recently established Entomophthora muscae-Drosophila melanogaster zombie fly system to reveal the molecular and cellular underpinnings of summit disease, a manipulated behavior evoked by many fungal parasites. Using a new, high-throughput behavior assay to measure summiting, we discovered that summiting behavior is characterized by a burst of locomotion and requires the host circadian and neurosecretory systems, specifically DN1p circadian neurons, pars intercerebralis to corpora allata projecting (PI-CA) neurons and corpora allata (CA), who are solely responsible for juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and release. Summiting is a fleeting phenomenon, posing a challenge for physiological and biochemical experiments requiring tissue from summiting flies. We addressed this with a machine learning classifier to identify summiting animals in real time. PI-CA neurons and CA appear to be intact in summiting animals, despite E. muscae cells invading the host brain, particularly in the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), the neuropil that contains DN1p axons and PI-CA dendrites. The blood-brain barrier of flies late in their infection was significantly permeabilized, suggesting that factors in the hemolymph may have greater access to the central nervous system during summiting. Metabolomic analysis of hemolymph from summiting flies revealed differential abundance of several compounds compared to non-summiting flies. Transfusing the hemolymph of summiting flies into non-summiting recipients induced a burst of locomotion, demonstrating that factor(s) in the hemolymph likely cause summiting behavior. Altogether, our work reveals a neuro-mechanistic model for summiting wherein fungal cells perturb fly hemolymph, activating the neurohormonal pathway linking clock neurons to juvenile hormone production in the CA, ultimately inducing locomotor activity in their host.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The evolution of whole-brain turbulent dynamics during recovery from traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Significant advances in non-linear dynamics and computational modeling have opened up the possibility of studying how whole-brain dynamics may be impacted by brain injury. Importantly, by looking at the local level of synchronization, it is possible to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal patterns affected at different spatial scales. In the current study, we applied the turbulent dynamics framework to investigate the temporal evolution in whole-brain dynamics using an open access resting state fMRI dataset from a cohort of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and healthy controls (HC). We first examined how several measures related to turbulent dynamics differ between HCs and TBI patients at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury. We found a significant reduction in these empirical measures after TBI, with the largest change at 6-months post-injury. Next, we built a Hopf whole-brain model with coupled oscillators and conducted in silico perturbations to investigate the mechanistic principles underlying the reduced turbulent dynamics found in the empirical data. This revealed a shift to lower coupling parameters in the TBI dataset and, critically, decreased susceptibility and information encoding capability. These findings confirm the potential of the turbulent framework to characterize whole-brain dynamics after TBI and suggest a mechanistic link between structural disconnection and impaired information processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Goal-directed modulation of stretch reflex gains is reduced in the non-dominant upper limb</a></h4>

              
                Most individuals experience their dominant arm as being more dexterous than the non-dominant arm, but the neural mechanisms underlying this asymmetry in motor behaviour are unclear. Using a delayed reach task, it has recently been demonstrated that there is a strong goal-directed tuning of stretch reflex gains in the dominant upper limb of human participants. Here, we used an equivalent experimental paradigm to address the neural mechanisms that underlie the preparation for reaching movements with the non-dominant upper limb. We found only minor goal-directed differences in the short latency stretch reflex of the non-dominant limb. There were consistent effects of load, preparatory delay duration and target direction on the long latency stretch reflex. However, by comparing stretch reflex responses in the non-dominant arm with those previously documented in the dominant arm, we demonstrate that goal-directed tuning of short and long latency stretch reflexes is markedly weaker in the non-dominant limb. The results indicate that the motor performance asymmetries across the two upper limbs is partly due to the more sophisticated control of reflexive stiffness in the dominant limb, likely facilitated by the superior goal-directed control of muscle spindle receptors. Our findings therefore suggest that independent fusimotor control plays a role in determining performance of complex motor behaviours and support existing proposals that the dominant arm is better supplied for executing more complex tasks, such as trajectory control.

                The Human 1.2-Mb AUTS2 locus on chromosome 7q11.22 encodes a 1259-aa full-length protein, and a 711-aa C-terminal isoform. Functions of these AUTS2 proteins are only partly known. The major traits found in patients displaying AUTS2 locus mutations are Intellectual Disabilities, microcephaly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (54%), and autistic traits. Furthermore, AUTS2 common variants were recently found associated to alcohol consumption and dyslexia using GWAS approaches. Auts2 localizes mainly in cell nuclei. We evidenced by super-resolution that Auts2 is present in dendritic spines. Auts2 interacts with Ttc3, the Akt2 E3 ligase, and negatively regulates Akt2 ubiquitination. Auts2 haploinsufficiency affects Akt/mTorc1 pathway with a decrease in AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and in synaptic currents. Akt2 injection in postsynaptic neurons is sufficient to reverse changes in synaptic currents generated by Auts2 haploinsufficiency. Using chromosome engineering based on targeted meiotic recombination, we generated two mouse models with Auts2 locus deletion and duplication. Deleted Auts2 locus mice display stereotypies (rearing), perseveration and abnormal recognition memory. Duplicated Auts2 locus mice display similar perseveration and abnormal recognition memory but also a decrease in cued and contextual fear memory. Gene dosage induce changes in brain sub-region neuronal networks. In the thalamo-lateral amygdala pathway linked to cued fear memory, we found synaptic impairments linked to AMPA receptors, with a specific decrease in pAKT/total AKT ratio in duplicated Auts2 mice. Altogether, our study thereby provides a novel mechanistic and potentially therapeutic understanding of synaptic AKT/mTORC1 deregulated signaling and its related behavioral and cognitive phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A chromatic feature detector in the retina signals visual context changes</a></h4>

              
                The retina transforms patterns of light into visual feature representations supporting behaviour. These representations are distributed across various types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose spatial and temporal tuning properties have been extensively studied in many model organisms, including the mouse. However, it has been difficult to link the potentially nonlinear retinal transformations of natural visual inputs to specific ethological purposes. Here, we discover a novel selectivity to chromatic contrast in an RGC type that allows the detection of transitions of the horizon across a retinal region. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then used this model to search in silico for stimuli that maximally excite distinct types of RGCs. This procedure predicted centre colour-opponency in transient Suppressed-by-Contrast RGCs (tSbC), a cell type whose function is being debated. We confirmed experimentally that these cells indeed responded very selectively to Green-OFF, UV-ON contrasts, which we found to be characteristic of transitions from ground to sky in the visual scene, as might be elicited by head- or eye-movements across the horizon. Because tSbCs reliably detected these transitions, we suggest a role for this RGC type in providing contextual information (i.e. sky or ground) necessary for the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to other stimuli, such as looming objects. Our work showcases how a combination of experiments with natural stimuli and computational modelling allows discovering novel types of stimulus selectivity and identifying their potential ethological relevance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional lability of brain oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) generates diversity in brain OXTR distribution and social behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) modulates social behaviors in a species-specific manner. Remarkable inter- and intraspecies variation in brain OXTR distribution are associated with diversity in social behavior. To investigate potential genetic mechanisms underlying the phylogenetic plasticity in brain Oxtr expression and its consequences on social behavior, we constructed BAC transgenic mice harboring the entire prairie vole Oxtr locus with surrounding intergenic regulatory elements. Eight independent volized (pvOxtr) mouse lines were obtained; remarkably, each line displayed a unique pattern of brain expression distinct from mice and prairie voles. Four pvOxtr lines were selected for further investigation. Despite robust differences in brain expression, Oxtr expression in mammary gland was conserved across lines, suggesting that Oxtr expression in brain, but not mammary gland, is highly sensitive to local chromosomal landscape at integration sites. Moreover, different volized mouse lines showed differences in partner preference and maternal behaviors. Our results from this cross-species study suggest that species-specific variation in regulatory elements or distribution of transcription factors are not responsible for species-typical brain Oxtr expression patterns. Thus, transcriptional hypersensitivity to surrounding sequence of brain Oxtr may be a key mechanism to generate diversity in brain OXTR distribution and social behaviors. This inherent evolvability of brain Oxtr expression constitutes a novel transcriptional mechanism to generate variability in neuropeptide receptor distribution which, through natural selection, can generate diversity in adaptive social behaviors while preserving peripheral expression. The volized Oxtr mouse lines are useful for further understanding OXTR regulation and key neural circuits/networks mediating variability in social behaviors.

                Neural networks encode information through their collective spiking activity in response to external stimuli. This population response is noisy and strongly correlated, with complex interplay between correlations induced by the stimulus, and correlations caused by shared noise. Understanding how these correlations affect information transmission has so far been limited to pairs or small groups of neurons, because the curse of dimensionality impedes the evaluation of mutual information in larger populations. Here we develop a small-correlation expansion to compute the stimulus information carried by a large population of neurons, yielding interpretable analytical expressions in terms of the neurons' firing rates and pairwise correlations. We validate the approximation on synthetic data and demonstrate its applicability to electrophysiological recordings in the vertebrate retina, allowing us to quantify the effects of noise correlations between neurons and of memory in single neurons.

	<p>Graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have attracted much attention in the task of electroencephalogram (EEG) emotion recognition. However, most features of current GCNs do not take full advantage of the causal connection between the EEG signals in different frequency bands during the process of constructing the adjacency matrix. Based on the causal connectivity between the EEG channels obtained by Granger causality (GC) analysis, this paper proposes a multi-frequency band EEG graph feature extraction and fusion method for EEG emotion recognition. First, the original GC matrices between the EEG signals at each frequency band are calculated via GC analysis, and then they are adaptively converted to asymmetric binary GC matrices through an optimal threshold. Then, a kind of novel GC-based GCN feature (GC-GCN) is constructed by using differential entropy features and the binary GC matrices as the node values and adjacency matrices, respectively. Finally, on the basis of the GC-GCN features, a new multi-frequency band feature fusion method (GC-F-GCN) is proposed, which integrates the graph information of the EEG signals at different frequency bands for the same node. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GC-F-GCN method achieves better recognition performance than the state-of-the-art GCN methods, for which average accuracies of 97.91%, 98.46%, and 98.15% were achieved for the arousal, valence, and arousal&amp;amp;ndash;valence classifications, respectively.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Obesity is thought to arise, in part, from deficits in the inhibitory control over appetitive behavior. Such motivational processes are regulated by neuromodulators, specifically acetylcholine (ACh), via &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR). These nAChR are highly enriched in the thalamus and contribute to the thalamic gating of cortico-striatal signaling, but also act on the mesoaccumbal reward system. The changes in &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability, however, have not been demonstrated in human obesity thus far. The aim of our study was, thus, to investigate whether there is altered brain &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in individuals with obesity compared to normal-weight healthy controls. Methods: We studied 15 non-smoking individuals with obesity (body mass index, BMI: 37.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.1 kg/m2; age: 39 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 years, 9 females) and 16 normal-weight controls (non-smokers, BMI: 21.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 kg/m2; age: 28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7 years, 13 females) by using PET and the &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR selective (&amp;amp;minus;)-[18F]flubatine, which was applied within a bolus-infusion protocol (294 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16 MBq). Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was performed in order to calculate the regional total distribution volume (VT). Results: No overall significant difference in VT between the individuals with obesity and the normal-weight volunteers was found, while the VT in the nucleus basalis of Meynert tended to be lower in the individuals with obesity (10.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.1 versus 11.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.2; p = 0.10), and the VT in the thalamus showed a tendency towards higher values in the individuals with obesity (26.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.5 versus 25.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.2; p = 0.09). Conclusion: While these first data do not show greater brain &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in human obesity overall, the findings of potentially aberrant &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in the key brain regions that regulate feeding behavior merit further exploration.</p>

	<p>The body of mammals harbors two distinct types of adipose tissue: while cells within the white adipose tissue (WAT) store surplus energy as lipids, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is nowadays recognized as the main tissue for transforming chemical energy into heat. This process, referred to as &amp;amp;lsquo;non-shivering thermogenesis&amp;amp;rsquo;, is facilitated by the uncoupling of the electron transport across mitochondrial membranes from ATP production. BAT-dependent thermogenesis acts as a safeguarding mechanism under reduced ambient temperature but also plays a critical role in metabolic and energy homeostasis in health and disease. In this review, we summarize the evolutionary structure, function and regulation of the BAT organ under neuronal and hormonal control and discuss its mutual interaction with the central nervous system. We conclude by conceptualizing how better understanding the multifaceted communicative links between the brain and BAT opens avenues for novel therapeutic approaches to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To determine the short- and medium-term therapeutic effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and to study the optimal position of activated contacts for RLS symptoms. Methods: We preoperatively and postoperatively assessed PD Patients with RLS undergoing STN-DBS. Additionally, we recorded the stimulation parameters that induced RLS or relieved RLS symptoms during a follow-up. Finally, we reconstructed the activated contacts&amp;amp;rsquo; position that reduced or induced RLS symptoms. Results: 363 PD patients were enrolled. At the 1-year follow-up, we found that the IRLS sum significantly decreased in the RLS group (preoperative 18.758 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.706, postoperative 8.121 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.083, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The results of the CGI score, MOS sleep, and RLS QLQ all showed that the STN-DBS improved RLS symptoms after one year. Furthermore, the activated contacts that relieved RLS were mainly located in the central sensorimotor region of the STN. Activated contacts in the inferior sensorimotor part of the STN or in the substantia nigra might have induced RLS symptoms. Conclusions: STN-DBS improved RLS in patients with PD in one year, which reduced their sleep disorders and increased their quality of life. Furthermore, the central sensorimotor region part of the STN is the optimal stimulation site.</p>

	<p>Stereotype threat arises when the activation of negative stereotypes about a group impairs performance of stigmatized individuals on stereotype relevant tasks. There is ample evidence that stereotype threat leads to performance detriments by consuming executive resources. Several studies indeed showed that working memory (WM) mediates stereotype threat effects among young adults. More recently, researchers have sought to understand whether the same mechanisms underlie age-based stereotype threat, but findings are mixed regarding the role of WM and some authors rather favor a motivational explanation based on regulatory fit. The present review critically appraises the empirical support for distinct forms of stereotype threat effects mediated by distinct mechanisms. We propose a novel approach based on one of the most recent WM models, the time-based resource sharing model, to evaluate the impact of stereotype threat on attentional resources in WM among both young and older adults.</p>

	<p>This article provides an overview of verbal lie detection research. This type of research began in the 1970s with examining the relationship between deception and specific words. We briefly review this initial research. In the late 1980s, Criteria-Based Content Analysis (CBCA) emerged, a veracity assessment tool containing a list of verbal criteria. This was followed by Reality Monitoring (RM) and Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN), two other veracity assessment tools that contain lists of verbal criteria. We discuss their contents, theoretical rationales, and ability to identify truths and lies. We also discuss similarities and differences between CBCA, RM, and SCAN. In the mid 2000s, &amp;amp;lsquo;Interviewing to deception&amp;amp;rsquo; emerged, with the goal of developing specific interview protocols aimed at enhancing or eliciting verbal veracity cues. We outline the four most widely researched interview protocols to date: the Strategic Use of Evidence (SUE), Verifiability Approach (VA), Cognitive Credibility Assessment (CCA), and Reality Interviewing (RI). We briefly discuss the working of these protocols, their theoretical rationales and empirical support, as well as the similarities and differences between them. We conclude this article with elaborating on how neuroscientists can inform and improve verbal lie detection.</p>

	<p>An obvious reason for substance uses disorders (SUDs) is drug craving and seeking behavior induced by conditioned context, which is an abnormal solid context memory. The relationship between susceptibility to SUD and learning ability remains unclear in humans and animal models. In this study, we found that susceptibility to morphine use disorder (MUD) was negatively correlated with learning ability in conditioned place preference (CPP) in C57 mice. By using behavioral tests, we identified the FVB mouse as learning impaired. In addition, we discovered that learning-relevant proteins, such as the glutamate receptor subunits GluA1, NR1, and NR2A, were decreased in FVB mice. Finally, we assessed the context learning ability of FVB mice using the CPP test and priming. We found that FVB mice had lower learning performance with respect to normal memory but higher performance of morphine-reinstatement memory. Compared to C57 mice, FVB mice are highly sensitive to MUDs. Our results suggest that SUD susceptibility is predicted by impaired learning ability in mice; therefore, learning ability can play a simple and practical role in identifying high-risk SUD groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Networks Implicated in Autobiographical Memory Training</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Training of autobiographical memory has been proposed as an intervention to improve cognitive function. The neural substrates for such improvements are poorly understood. Several brain areas have been previously linked to autobiographical recollection, including structures in the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network. Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes in connectivity within different neural networks support distinct aspects of memory improvement in response to training on a group of 59 human subjects. We found that memory training using olfactory cues increases resting-state intranetwork DMN connectivity, and this associates with improved recollection of cue-specific memories. On the contrary, training decreased resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, a decrease that correlated with improved ability for voluntary recall. Moreover, preliminary data indicate that only the decrease in sensorimotor connectivity associated with the training-induced decrease in the tumor necrosis factor &alpha; (TNF&alpha;) factor, an immune modulation previously linked to improved cognitive performance. We identified functional and biochemical factors that associate with distinct memory processes improved by autobiographical training. Pathways which connect autobiographical memory with both high-level cognition and somatic physiology are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Discounting of Future Rewards and Punishments in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temporal reward discounting describes the decrease of value of a reward as a function of delay. Decision-making between future aversive outcomes is much less studied, and there is no clear decision pattern across studies; while some authors suggest that human and nonhuman animals prefer sooner over later painful shocks, others found the exact opposite. In a series of three experiments, Long&ndash;Evans rats chose between differently timed electric shocks and rewards in a T-maze. In experiment 1, rats chose between early and late painful shocks with identical, long reward delays; in experiment 2, they chose between early reward and early shocks, or late rewards and late shocks; in experiment 3, they chose between early and late rewards, with identical, short delays to the shock. We tested the predictions of two competing hypotheses: the aversive discounting theory assumes that future shocks are discounted, and, hence, less unpleasant than early shocks. The utility from anticipation theory implies that rats derive negative utility from waiting for the shock; late shocks should, hence, be more unpleasant than early shocks. We did not find unanimous evidence for either theory. Instead, our results are more consistent with the <I>post hoc</I> idea that shocks may have negative spill-over effects on reward values, the closer in time a shock is to a subsequent reward, the stronger the reward is devalued. Interestingly and consistent with our theory, we find that, depending on the temporal shock-reward contiguity, rats can be brought to prefer later over sooner rewards of identical magnitudes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">HDAC2 in Primary Sensory Neurons Constitutively Restrains Chronic Pain by Repressing {alpha}2{delta}-1 Expression and Associated NMDA Receptor Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>&alpha;2-1 (encoded by the <I>Cacna2d1</I> gene) is a newly discovered NMDA receptor-interacting protein and is the therapeutic target of gabapentinoids (e.g., gabapentin and pregabalin) frequently used for treating patients with neuropathic pain. Nerve injury causes sustained &alpha;2-1 upregulation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which promotes NMDA receptor synaptic trafficking and activation in the spinal dorsal horn, a hallmark of chronic neuropathic pain. However, little is known about how nerve injury initiates and maintains the high expression level of &alpha;2-1 to sustain chronic pain. Here, we show that nerve injury caused histone hyperacetylation and diminished enrichment of histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2), but not HDAC3, at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter in the DRG. Strikingly, <I>Hdac2</I> knockdown or conditional knockout in DRG neurons in male and female mice consistently induced long-lasting mechanical pain hypersensitivity, which was readily reversed by blocking NMDA receptors, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDA receptor interaction at the spinal cord level. <I>Hdac2</I> deletion in DRG neurons increased histone acetylation levels at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter, upregulated &alpha;2-1 in the DRG, and potentiated &alpha;2-1&ndash;dependent NMDA receptor activity at primary afferent central terminals in the spinal dorsal horn. Correspondingly, <I>Hdac2</I> knockdown-induced pain hypersensitivity was blunted in <I>Cacna2d1</I> knockout mice. Thus, our findings reveal that HDAC2 functions as a pivotal transcriptional repressor of neuropathic pain via constitutively suppressing &alpha;2-1 expression and ensuing presynaptic NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord. HDAC2 enrichment levels at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter in DRG neurons constitute a unique epigenetic mechanism that governs acute-to-chronic pain transition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excess &alpha;2-1 proteins produced after nerve injury directly interact with glutamate NMDA receptors to potentiate synaptic NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord, a prominent mechanism of nerve pain. Because &alpha;2-1 upregulation after nerve injury is long lasting, gabapentinoids relieve pain symptoms only temporarily. Our study demonstrates for the first time the unexpected role of intrinsic HDAC2 activity at the &alpha;2-1 gene promoter in limiting &alpha;2-1 gene transcription, NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, and chronic pain development after nerve injury. These findings challenge the prevailing view about the role of general HDAC activity in promoting chronic pain. Restoring the repressive HDAC2 function and/or reducing histone acetylation at the &alpha;2-1 gene promoter in primary sensory neurons could lead to long-lasting relief of nerve pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurexin-{beta} Mediates the Synaptogenic Activity of Amyloid Precursor Protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>In addition to its role in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid precursor protein (APP) has physiological roles in synapse development and function. APP induces presynaptic differentiation when presented to axons, but the mechanism is unknown. Here we show that APP binds neurexin to mediate this synaptogenic activity. APP specifically binds &beta; not &alpha; neurexins modulated by splice site 4. Binding to neurexin heparan sulfate glycan and LNS protein domains is required for high-affinity interaction and for full-length APP to recruit axonal neurexin. The synaptogenic activity of APP is abolished by triple knockdown of neurexins in hippocampal neurons pooled from male and female rats. Based on these and previous results, our model is that a dendritic-axonal <I>trans</I> dimer of full-length APP binds to axonal neurexin-&beta; to promote synaptic differentiation and function. Furthermore, soluble sAPPs also bind neurexin-&beta; and inhibit its interaction with neuroligin-1, raising the possibility that disruption of neurexin function by altered levels of full-length APP and its cleavage products may contribute to early synaptic deficits in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The prevailing model for the basis of Alzheimer's disease is the amyloid cascade triggered by altered cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP also has physiological roles at the synapse, but the molecular basis for its synaptic functions is not well understood. Here, we show that APP binds the presynaptic organizing protein neurexin-&beta; and that neurexin is essential for the synaptogenic activity of APP. Furthermore, soluble APP forms generated by APP cleavage also bind neurexin-&beta; and can block interaction with transmembrane synaptogenic ligands of neurexin. These findings reveal a role for neurexin-APP interaction in synapse development and raise the possibility that disruptions of neurexin function may contribute to synaptic and cognitive deficits in the critical early stage of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Vulnerability of the Neonatal Connectome following Postnatal Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stress following preterm birth can disrupt the emerging foundation of the neonatal brain. The current study examined how structural brain development is affected by a stressful early environment and whether changes in topological architecture at term-equivalent age could explain the increased vulnerability for behavioral symptoms during early childhood. Longitudinal changes in structural brain connectivity were quantified using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and tractography in preterm born infants (gestational age &lt;28 weeks), imaged at 30 and/or 40 weeks of gestation (<I>N</I> = 145, 43.5% female). A global index of postnatal stress was determined based on the number of invasive procedures during hospitalization (e.g., heel lance). Higher stress levels impaired structural connectivity growth in a subnetwork of 48 connections (<I>p</I> = 0.003), including the amygdala, insula, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Findings were replicated in an independent validation sample (<I>N</I> = 123, 39.8% female, <I>n</I> = 91 with follow-up). Classifying infants into vulnerable and resilient based on having more or less internalizing symptoms at two to five years of age (<I>n</I> = 71) revealed lower connectivity in the hippocampus and amygdala for vulnerable relative to resilient infants (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.001). Our findings suggest that higher stress exposure during hospital admission is associated with slower growth of structural connectivity. The preservation of global connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus might reflect a stress-buffering or resilience-enhancing factor against a stressful early environment and early-childhood internalizing symptoms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The preterm brain is exposed to various external stimuli following birth. The effects of early chronic stress on neonatal brain networks and the remarkable degree of resilience are not well understood. The current study aims to provide an increased understanding of the impact of postnatal stress on third-trimester brain development and describe the topological architecture of a resilient brain. We observed a sparser neonatal brain network in infants exposed to higher postnatal stress. Limbic regulatory regions, including the hippocampus and amygdala, may play a key role as crucial convergence sites of protective factors. Understanding how stress-induced alterations in early brain development might lead to brain (re)organization may provide essential insights into resilient functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Object Boundary Detection in Natural Images May Depend on "Incitatory" Cell-Cell Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional "simple cells," we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes' rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified the following three basic types of cell&ndash;cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, and nonmonotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models, we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition&mdash;a compound effect we call "incitation"&mdash;can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell&ndash;boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer "delta" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell&mdash;a divisively normalized linear filter&mdash;is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell&ndash;cell interconnections in the cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Weakly Correlated Local Cortical State Switches under Anesthesia Lead to Strongly Correlated Global States</a></h4>

              
                <p>During recovery from anesthesia, brain activity switches abruptly between a small set of discrete states. Surprisingly, this switching also occurs under constant doses of anesthesia, even in the absence of stimuli. These metastable states and the transitions between them are thought to form a "scaffold" that ultimately guides the brain back to wakefulness. The processes that constrain cortical activity patterns to these states and govern how states are coordinated between different cortical regions are unknown. If state transitions were driven by subcortical modulation, different cortical sites should exhibit near-synchronous state transitions. Conversely, spatiotemporal heterogeneity would suggest that state transitions are coordinated through corticocortical interactions. To differentiate between these hypotheses, we quantified synchrony of brain states in male rats exposed to a fixed isoflurane concentration. States were defined from spectra of local field potentials recorded across layers of visual and motor cortices. A transition synchrony measure shows that most state transitions are highly localized. Furthermore, while most pairs of cortical sites exhibit statistically significant coupling of both states and state transition times, coupling strength is typically weak. States and state transitions in the thalamic input layer (L4) are particularly decoupled from those in supragranular and infragranular layers. This suggests that state transitions are not imposed on the cortex by broadly projecting modulatory systems. Although each pairwise interaction is typically weak, we show that the multitude of such weak interactions is sufficient to confine global activity to a small number of discrete states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain consistently recovers to wakefulness after anesthesia, but this process is poorly understood. Previous work revealed that, during recovery from anesthesia, corticothalamic activity falls into one of several discrete patterns. The neuronal mechanisms constraining the cortex to just a few discrete states remain unknown. Global states could be coordinated by fluctuations in subcortical nuclei that project broadly to the cortex. Alternatively, these states may emerge from interactions within the cortex itself. Here, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating that most pairs of cortical sites exhibit weak coupling. We thereby lay groundwork for future investigations of the specific cellular and network mechanisms of corticocortical activity state coupling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) Coexpression in GABAergic, Glutamatergic, and GABA/Glutamatergic Subpopulations in the Central Extended Amygdala and Ventral Pallidum of Young Male Primates</a></h4>

              
                <p>The central extended amygdala (CEA) and ventral pallidum (VP) are involved in diverse motivated behaviors based on rodent models. These structures are conserved, but expanded, in higher primates, including human. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a canonical "stress molecule" associated with the CEA and VP circuitry across species, is dynamically regulated by stress and drugs of abuse and misuse. CRF's effects on circuits critically depend on its colocation with primary "fast" transmitters, making this crucial for understanding circuit effects. We surveyed the distribution and colocalization of CRF-, VGluT2- (vesicular glutamate transporter 2), and VGAT- (vesicular GABA transporter) mRNA in specific subregions of the CEA and VP in young male monkeys. Although CRF-containing neurons were clustered in the lateral central bed nucleus (BSTLcn), the majority were broadly dispersed throughout other CEA subregions, and the VP. CRF/VGAT-only neurons were highest in the BSTLcn, lateral central amygdala nucleus (CeLcn), and medial central amygdala nucleus (CeM) (74%, 73%, and 85%, respectively). In contrast, lower percentages of CRF/VGAT only neurons populated the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEAc), ventrolateral bed nucleus (BSTLP), and VP (53%, 54%, 17%, respectively), which had higher complements of CRF/VGAT/VGluT2-labeled neurons (33%, 29%, 67%, respectively). Thus, the majority of CRF-neurons at the "poles" (BSTLcn and CeLcn/CeM) of the CEA are inhibitory, while the "extended" BSTLP and SLEAc subregions, and neighboring VP, have a more complex profile with admixtures of "multiplexed" excitatory CRF neurons. CRF's colocalization with its various fast transmitters is likely circuit-specific, and relevant for understanding CRF actions on specific target sites.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The central extended amygdala (CEA) and ventral pallidum (VP) regulate multiple motivated behaviors through differential downstream projections. The stress neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is enriched in the CEA, and is thought to "set the gain" through modulatory effects on coexpressed primary transmitters. Using protein and transcript assays in monkey, we found that CRF neurons are broadly and diffusely distributed in CEA and VP. CRF mRNA<sup>+</sup> neurons colocalize with VGAT (GABA) and VGluT2 (glutamate) mRNAs in different proportions depending on subregion. CRF mRNA was also coexpressed in a subpopulation of VGAT/VGluT2 mRNA ("multiplexed") cells, which were most prominent in the VP and "pallidal"-like parts of the CEA. Heterogeneous CRF and fast transmitter coexpression across CEA/VP subregions implies circuit-specific effects.</p>
