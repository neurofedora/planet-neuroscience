              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06640">NeuroPal: A Clinically-Informed Multimodal LLM Assistant for Mental Health Combining Sleep Chronotherapy, Cognitive Behavioral Reframing, and Adaptive Phytochemical Intervention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to time constraints, mental health professionals in China are unable to offer patients prolonged talk therapy, leaving a gap in care for patients with psychological disorders, including aberrant sleep and eating patterns, maladaptive explanatory styles, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. To bridge this gap in care and address these problems in a large-scale manner, we built NeuroPal, a large language model (LLM)-assistant that provides scalable, evidence-based interventions with three clinically validated modules: (1) a sleep chronotherapy planner to output personalized circadian rhythm correction protocols, (2) a cognitive-behavioral reframing engine grounded in CBT and humanistic principles to shift negative attributional biases, and (3) a biochemical regulation advisor to output phytotherapy formulations to regulate sleep-metabolism-gut-axis imbalances. In collaboration with Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Xiangya Hospital Central South University, we ran an RCT protocol with 513 participants with mood/anxiety disorders and showed statistically significant improvements towards primary endpoints (> p<.01). Experiment shows 37.2% drop in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 28.6% rise in positive affective word usages (LIWC analysis), and 23.4% improvement in patient-reported digestive comfort. The assistant also reached 89.1% adherence rates, significantly higher than the human-guided therapy intervention (72.3%) in matched controls. Our results indicate that an LLM-driven multimodal intervention is able to successfully bridge time-constrained clinical practice while preserving therapeutic effectiveness. For next steps, we plan to explore longitudinal outcome tracking and FDA/CFDA certification routes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06686">3D Constraints on Local Motion to Detect Moving Objects</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we move through the world, the pattern of light projected on our eyes is complex and dynamic, yet we are still able to distinguish between moving and stationary objects. We propose that humans accomplish this by exploiting constraints that self-motion imposes on retinal velocities. When an eye translates and rotates in a stationary 3D scene, the velocity at each retinal location is constrained to a line segment in the 2D space of retinal velocities. The slope and intercept of this segment is determined by the eye's translation and rotation, and the position along the segment is determined by the local scene depth. Since all possible velocities arising from a stationary scene must lie on this segment, velocities that are not must correspond to objects moving within the scene. We hypothesize that humans make use of these constraints by using deviations of local velocity from these constraint lines to detect moving objects. To test this, we used a virtual reality headset to present rich wide-field stimuli, simulating the visual experience of translating forward in several virtual environments with varied precision of depth information. Participants had to determine if a cued object moved relative to the scene. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that performance depended on the deviation of the object velocity from the constraint segment, rather than a difference between retinal velocities of the object and its local surround. We also found that the endpoints of the constraint segment reflected the precision of depth information available in the different virtual environments.

                arXiv:2505.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise timing of synaptic transmission in auditory hair cells is important to hearing and speech recognition. Neurotransmitter release is an underlying step in translating sound. Thus, understanding nature of the synaptic fusion is key to understand the hearing mechanism. Extraordinary large excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) have been observed in the auditory hair cell synapse, and its origin has been controversial. It is not known yet whether the size and shape of the EPSCs are results of a big vesicle or many small vesicles. We report our numerical simulation of the vesicular fusion process from calcium channel process to the generation of EPSC currents. Our numerical experiments indicate that the origin of the large EPSC with its mysterious form is close to the scenario of the multivesicular release. The large EPSCs might be triggered by strong calcium channeling of the calcium channel clusters.

                arXiv:2505.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) provides a theoretical framework for goal-directed movements, where the nervous system adjusts actions based on sensory feedback. In OFC, the central nervous system (CNS) not only reacts to stimuli but proactively predicts and adjusts motor commands, minimizing errors and (often energetic) costs through internal models. OFC theory assumes that there exists a cost function that is optimized throughout one's movement. It is natural to assume that mechanical quantities should be involved in cost functions. This does not imply that the mechanical principles that govern human voluntary movements are necessarily Newtonian. Indeed, the undisputed efficiency of Newtonian mechanics to model and predict the motion of non-living systems does not guarantee its relevance to model human behavior. We propose that integrating principles from Lagrangian and Hamiltonian higher-derivative mechanics, i.e. dynamical models that go beyond Newtonian mechanics, provides a more natural framework to study the constraints hidden in human voluntary movement within OFC theory.

                arXiv:2505.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment between subjective sense of time and chronological time can become skewed as a result of pharmacological interventions, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson's disease), or even in the moments preceding brain death. Despite increased understanding of mechanisms governing time perception and the activity of the "internal clock" (such as the functionality of the dopamine system in the basal ganglia of the midbrain), there currently exist no mathematical models that allow investigation of changes in time perception through formalizing the decoupling of "internal" and "external" time. Here we propose such a model using a parametrically heterogeneous power equation, and use it to investigate the critical case of indefinite increase in internal time following cardiac arrest and preceding brain death. We identify three critical parameters that determine time to brain death and provide an analysis of the relevant quantities. We hope that our model can lay foundation for further mathematical and theoretical exploration of this complex topic.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07754">Skeletonization of neuronal processes using Discrete Morse techniques from computational topology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand biological intelligence we need to map neuronal networks in vertebrate brains. Mapping mesoscale neural circuitry is done using injections of tracers that label groups of neurons whose axons project to different brain regions. Since many neurons are labeled, it is difficult to follow individual axons. Previous approaches have instead quantified the regional projections using the total label intensity within a region. However, such a quantification is not biologically meaningful. We propose a new approach better connected to the underlying neurons by skeletonizing labeled axon fragments and then estimating a volumetric length density. Our approach uses a combination of deep nets and the Discrete Morse (DM) technique from computational topology. This technique takes into account nonlocal connectivity information and therefore provides noise-robustness. We demonstrate the utility and scalability of the approach on whole-brain tracer injected data. We also define and illustrate an information theoretic measure that quantifies the additional information obtained, compared to the skeletonized tracer injection fragments, when individual axon morphologies are available. Our approach is the first application of the DM technique to computational neuroanatomy. It can help bridge between single-axon skeletons and tracer injections, two important data types in mapping neural networks in vertebrates.

                arXiv:2505.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of dementia is very crucial to ensure treatment begins on time, however it is difficult to choose appropriate cognitive assessment tools because each test is designed differently and may not be tailored to the needs of a patient. This review compares five commonly used tests the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS), Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Each test has different criteria's and vary in their coverage of cognitive domains. MMSE focuses on memory and language but lacks in the evaluation of executive and visuospatial abilities. RUDAS and SAGE focus on memory, language and visual thinking while ADAS mainly targets memory, executive function and language. The MoCA is most complete as it focuses on areas like attention, memory skills, problem solving and visual skills. This review evaluates how accurate and reliable these tools are to help doctors decide the most efficient tool for diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07620">Higher-Order Convolution Improves Neural Predictivity in the Retina</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.07620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural response prediction that incorporates higher-order operations directly within convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our model extends traditional 3D CNNs by embedding higher-order operations within the convolutional operator itself, enabling direct modeling of multiplicative interactions between neighboring pixels across space and time. Our model increases the representational power of CNNs without increasing their depth, therefore addressing the architectural disparity between deep artificial networks and the relatively shallow processing hierarchy of biological visual systems. We evaluate our approach on two distinct datasets: salamander retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses to natural scenes, and a new dataset of mouse RGC responses to controlled geometric transformations. Our higher-order CNN (HoCNN) achieves superior performance while requiring only half the training data compared to standard architectures, demonstrating correlation coefficients up to 0.75 with neural responses (against 0.80$\pm$0.02 retinal reliability). When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures, our approach consistently improves performance across different species and stimulus conditions. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that our network naturally encodes fundamental geometric transformations, particularly scaling parameters that characterize object expansion and contraction. This capability is especially relevant for specific cell types, such as transient OFF-alpha and transient ON cells, which are known to detect looming objects and object motion respectively, and where our model shows marked improvement in response prediction. The correlation coefficients for scaling parameters are more than twice as high in HoCNN (0.72) compared to baseline models (0.32).

                arXiv:2408.01350v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foraging is a crucial activity, yet the extent to which humans employ flexible versus rigid strategies remains unclear. This study investigates how individuals adapt their foraging strategies in response to resource distribution and foraging time constraints. For this, we designed a video-game-like foraging task that requires participants to navigate a four-areas environment to collect coins from treasure boxes within a limited time. This task engages multiple cognitive abilities, such as navigation, learning, and memorization of treasure box locations. Findings indicate that participants adjust their foraging strategies -- encompassing both stay-or-leave decisions, such as the number of boxes opened in initial areas and behavioral aspects, such as the time to navigate from box to box -- depending on both resource distribution and foraging time. Additionally, they improved their performance over time as an effect of both enhanced navigation skills and adaptation of foraging strategies. Finally, participants' performance was initially distant from the reward-maximizing performance of optimal agents due to the learning process humans undergo; however, it approximated the optimal agent's performance towards the end of the task, without fully reaching it. These results highlight the flexibility of human foraging behavior and underscore the importance of employing optimality models and ecologically rich scenarios to study foraging.

                arXiv:2409.02684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural activity fluctuates over a wide range of timescales within and across brain areas. Experimental observations suggest that diverse neural timescales reflect information in dynamic environments. However, how timescales are defined and measured from brain recordings vary across the literature. Moreover, these observations do not specify the mechanisms underlying timescale variations, nor whether specific timescales are necessary for neural computation and brain function. Here, we synthesize three directions where computational approaches can distill the broad set of empirical observations into quantitative and testable theories: We review (i) how different data analysis methods quantify timescales across distinct behavioral states and recording modalities, (ii) how biophysical models provide mechanistic explanations for the emergence of diverse timescales, and (iii) how task-performing networks and machine learning models uncover the functional relevance of neural timescales. This integrative computational perspective thus complements experimental investigations, providing a holistic view on how neural timescales reflect the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and behavior.

Abstract: When observing the surface patterns of objects delimited by smooth surfaces, the projections of the surface patterns to the image domain will be subject to substantial variabilities, as induced by variabilities in the geometric viewing conditions, and as generated by either monocular or binocular imaging conditions, or by relative motions between the object and the observer over time. To first order of approximation, the image deformations of such projected surface patterns can be modelled as local linearizations in terms of local 2-D spatial affine transformations.
  This paper presents a theoretical analysis of relationships between the degrees of freedom in 2-D spatial affine image transformations and the degrees of freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. For this purpose, we first describe a canonical decomposition of 2-D affine transformations on a product form, closely related to a singular value decomposition, while in closed form, and which reveals the degrees of freedom in terms of (i) uniform scaling transformations, (ii) an overall amount of global rotation, (iii) a complementary non-uniform scaling transformation and (iv) a relative normalization to a preferred symmetry orientation in the image domain. Then, we show how these degrees of freedom relate to the degrees of freedom in the affine Gaussian derivative model.
  Finally, we use these theoretical results to consider whether we could regard the biological receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals as being able to span the degrees of freedom of 2-D spatial affine transformations, based on interpretations of existing neurophysiological experimental results.

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI captures spontaneous neural activity characterized by complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Various metrics, such as local and global brain connectivity and low-frequency amplitude fluctuations, quantify distinct aspects of these dynamics. However, these measures are typically analyzed independently, overlooking their interrelations and potentially limiting analytical sensitivity. Here, we introduce the Fusion Searchlight (FuSL) framework, which integrates complementary information from multiple resting-state fMRI metrics. We demonstrate that combining these metrics enhances the accuracy of pharmacological treatment prediction from rs-fMRI data, enabling the identification of additional brain regions affected by sedation with alprazolam. Furthermore, we leverage explainable AI to delineate the differential contributions of each metric, which additionally improves spatial specificity of the searchlight analysis. Moreover, this framework can be adapted to combine information across imaging modalities or experimental conditions, providing a versatile and interpretable tool for data fusion in neuroimaging.

                arXiv:2501.18009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged with many intellectual capacities. While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore--an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty-driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Results indicate that traditional reasoning-focused LLMs, such as GPT-4o, exhibit a significantly faster and less detailed reasoning process, limiting their exploratory performance. In contrast, the DeepSeek reasoning model demonstrates prolonged, iterative thought processes marked by repetitive analysis of combinations and past trials, reflecting a more thorough and human-like exploration strategy. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.

                arXiv:2504.19657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

                arXiv:2502.02831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stroop effect refers to cognitive interference in a color-naming task: When the color and the word do not match, the response is slower and more likely to be incorrect. The Stroop task is used to assess cognitive flexibility, selective attention, and executive function. This paper implements the Stroop task with self-organizing maps (SOMs): Target color and the competing word are inputs for the semantic and lexical maps, associative connections bring color information to the lexical map, and lateral connections combine their effects over time. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 84.2%, with significantly fewer errors and faster responses in congruent compared to no-input and incongruent conditions. The model's effect is a side effect of optimizing response times, and can thus be seen as a cost associated with overall efficient performance. The model can further serve studying neurologically-inspired cognitive control and related phenomena.

                arXiv:2505.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to improve the efficiency of artificial neural networks by taking inspiration from biological neurons and leveraging temporal sparsity, spatial sparsity, and compute near/in memory. Although these approaches have shown efficiency gains, training these spiking neural networks (SNN) remains difficult. The original attempts at converting trained conventional analog neural networks (ANN) to SNNs used the rate of binary spikes to represent neuron activations. This required many simulation time steps per inference, which degraded efficiency. Intel's Loihi 2 is a neuromorphic platform that supports graded spikes which can be used to represent changes in neuron activation. In this work, we use Loihi 2's graded spikes to develop a method for converting ANN networks to spiking networks, which take advantage of temporal and spatial sparsity. We evaluated the performance of this network on Loihi 2 and compared it to NVIDIA's Jetson Xavier edge AI platform.

                arXiv:2505.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike traditional optimization algorithms focusing on finding a single optimal solution, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms illuminate a search space by finding high-performing solutions that cover a specified behavior space. However, tackling adversarial problems is more challenging due to the behavioral interdependence between opposing sides. Most applications of QD algorithms to these problems evolve only one side, thus reducing illumination coverage. In this paper, we propose a new QD algorithm, Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME), which coevolves solutions by alternating sides through a sequence of generations. Combining GAME with vision embedding models enables the algorithm to directly work from videos of behaviors instead of handcrafted descriptors. Some key findings are that (1) emerging evolutionary dynamics sometimes resemble an arms race, (2) starting each generation from scratch increases open-endedness, and (3) keeping neutral mutations preserves stepping stones that seem necessary to reach the highest performance. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that GAME can successfully illuminate an adversarial multi-agent game, opening up interesting future directions in understanding the emergence of open-ended coevolution.

                arXiv:2505.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-structured combinatorial problems in complex networks are prevalent in many domains, and are computationally demanding due to their complexity and non-linear nature. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while robust, often face obstacles due to content-shallow encoding limitations and lack of structural awareness, necessitating hand-crafted modifications for effective application. In this work, we introduce an original framework, Visual Evolutionary Optimization (VEO), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as the backbone evolutionary optimizer in this context. Specifically, we propose a context-aware encoding way, representing the solution of the network as an image. In this manner, we can utilize MLLMs' image processing capabilities to intuitively comprehend network configurations, thus enabling machines to solve these problems in a human-like way. We have developed MLLM-based operators tailored for various evolutionary optimization stages, including initialization, crossover, and mutation. Furthermore, we propose that graph sparsification can effectively enhance the applicability and scalability of VEO on large-scale networks, owing to the scale-free nature of real-world networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a well-known task in complex networks, influence maximization, and validate it on eight different real-world networks of various structures. The results have confirmed VEO's reliability and enhanced effectiveness compared to traditional evolutionary optimization.

Abstract: Attending to what is relevant is fundamental to both the mammalian brain and modern machine learning models such as Transformers. Yet, determining relevance remains a core challenge, traditionally offloaded to learning algorithms like backpropagation. Inspired by recent cellular neurobiological evidence linking neocortical pyramidal cells to distinct mental states, this work shows how models (e.g., Transformers) can emulate high-level perceptual processing and awake thought (imagination) states to pre-select relevant information before applying attention. Triadic neuronal-level modulation loops among questions ($Q$), clues (keys, $K$), and hypotheses (values, $V$) enable diverse, deep, parallel reasoning chains at the representation level and allow a rapid shift from initial biases to refined understanding. This leads to orders-of-magnitude faster learning with significantly reduced computational demand (e.g., fewer heads, layers, and tokens), at an approximate cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, where $N$ is the number of input tokens. Results span reinforcement learning (e.g., CarRacing in a high-dimensional visual setup), computer vision, and natural language question answering.

Abstract: Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) are evolving to record from thousands of neurons wirelessly but face challenges in data bandwidth, power consumption, and implant size. We propose a novel Spiking Neural Network Spike Detector (SNN-SPD) that processes event-based neural data generated via delta modulation and pulse count modulation, converting signals into sparse events. By leveraging the temporal dynamics and inherent sparsity of spiking neural networks, our method improves spike detection performance while maintaining low computational overhead suitable for implantable devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SNN-SPD achieves an accuracy of 95.72% at high noise levels (standard deviation 0.2), which is about 2% higher than the existing Artificial Neural Network Spike Detector (ANN-SPD). Moreover, SNN-SPD requires only 0.41% of the computation and about 26.62% of the weight parameters compared to ANN-SPD, with zero multiplications. This approach balances efficiency and performance, enabling effective data compression and power savings for next-generation iBMIs.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of noise on a simplified trained convolutional network. The types of noise studied originate from a real optical implementation of a neural network, but we generalize these types to enhance the applicability of our findings on a broader scale. The noise types considered include additive and multiplicative noise, which relate to how noise affects individual neurons, as well as correlated and uncorrelated noise, which pertains to the influence of noise across one layers. We demonstrate that the propagation of uncorrelated noise primarily depends on the statistical properties of the connection matrices. Specifically, the mean value of the connection matrix following the layer impacted by noise governs the propagation of correlated additive noise, while the mean of its square contributes to the accumulation of uncorrelated noise. Additionally, we propose an analytical assessment of the noise level in the network's output signal, which shows a strong correlation with the results of numerical simulations.

Abstract: Domain generalization in image classification is a crucial challenge, with models often failing to generalize well across unseen datasets. We address this issue by introducing a neuro-inspired Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN) layer which draws inspiration from neurons in the mammalian visual cortex, which aims to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures on unseen target domains by training deep learning models on a source domain. The performance of these models is considered as a baseline and then compared against models integrated with NeuRN on image classification tasks. We perform experiments across a range of deep learning architectures, including ones derived from Neural Architecture Search and Vision Transformer. Additionally, in order to shortlist models for our experiment from amongst the vast range of deep neural networks available which have shown promising results, we also propose a novel method that uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute similarity between deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuRN by showing improvement against baseline in cross-domain image classification tasks. Our framework attempts to establish a foundation for future neuro-inspired deep learning models.

Abstract: The mouse is one of the most studied animal models in the field of systems neuroscience. Understanding the generalized patterns and decoding the neural representations that are evoked by the diverse range of natural scene stimuli in the mouse visual cortex is one of the key quests in computational vision. In recent years, significant parallels have been drawn between the primate visual cortex and hierarchical deep neural networks. However, their generalized efficacy in understanding mouse vision has been limited. In this study, we investigate the functional alignment between the mouse visual cortex and deep learning models for object classification tasks. We first introduce a generalized representational learning strategy that uncovers a striking resemblance between the functional mapping of the mouse visual cortex and high-performing deep learning models on both top-down (population-level) and bottom-up (single cell-level) scenarios. Next, this representational similarity across the two systems is further enhanced by the addition of Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN) layer, inspired by the activation profile of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex. To test the performance effect of NeuRN on real-world tasks, we integrate it into deep learning models and observe significant improvements in their robustness against data shifts in domain generalization tasks. Our work proposes a novel framework for comparing the functional architecture of the mouse visual cortex with deep learning models. Our findings carry broad implications for the development of advanced AI models that draw inspiration from the mouse visual cortex, suggesting that these models serve as valuable tools for studying the neural representations of the mouse visual cortex and, as a result, enhancing their performance on real-world tasks.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have significantly advanced the field of novel view synthesis, yet their generalization across diverse scenes and conditions remains challenging. Addressing this, we propose the integration of a novel brain-inspired normalization technique Neural Generalization (NeuGen) into leading NeRF architectures which include MVSNeRF and GeoNeRF. NeuGen extracts the domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the models' generalization capabilities. It can be seamlessly integrated into NeRF architectures and cultivates a comprehensive feature set that significantly improves accuracy and robustness in image rendering. Through this integration, NeuGen shows improved performance on benchmarks on diverse datasets across state-of-the-art NeRF architectures, enabling them to generalize better across varied scenes. Our comprehensive evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, confirm that our approach not only surpasses existing models in generalizability but also markedly improves rendering quality. Our work exemplifies the potential of merging neuroscientific principles with deep learning frameworks, setting a new precedent for enhanced generalizability and efficiency in novel view synthesis.

                arXiv:2505.06907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, has reshaped the artificial intelligence landscape. As prominent examples of foundational models (FMs) built on LLMs, these models exhibit remarkable capabilities in generating human-like content, bringing us closer to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, their large-scale nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs, enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees. Overall, this survey aims to lay the groundwork for the development of API as a complement to AGI, with a particular focus on PFI as a key enabling technique.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of breaking down a target molecule into simpler precursors through a series of valid reactions, stands at the core of organic chemistry and drug development. Although recent machine learning (ML) research has advanced single-step retrosynthetic modeling and subsequent route searches, these solutions remain restricted by the extensive combinatorial space of possible pathways. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable chemical knowledge, hinting at their potential to tackle complex decision-making tasks in chemistry. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can successfully navigate the highly constrained, multi-step retrosynthesis planning problem. We introduce an efficient scheme for encoding reaction pathways and present a new route-level search strategy, moving beyond the conventional step-by-step reactant prediction. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that our LLM-augmented approach excels at retrosynthesis planning and extends naturally to the broader challenge of synthesizable molecular design.

                arXiv:2505.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-inspired computing paradigms are receiving renewed attention to enhance efficiency in compute-intensive tasks such as artificial intelligence and optimization. Similar to Hopfield neural networks, oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) minimize an Ising energy function that embeds the solutions of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite their success in solving unconstrained optimization problems, Ising machines still face challenges with constrained problems as they can get stuck at infeasible local minima. In this paper, we introduce a Lagrange ONN (LagONN) designed to escape infeasible states based on the theory of Lagrange multipliers. Unlike existing oscillatory Ising machines, LagONN employs additional Lagrange oscillators to guide the system towards feasible states in an augmented energy landscape and settles only when constraints are met. Taking the maximum satisfiability problem with three literals as a use case (Max-3-SAT), we harness LagONN's constraint satisfaction mechanism to find optimal solutions for random SATlib instances with up to 200 variables and 860 clauses, which provides a deterministic alternative to simulated annealing for coupled oscillators. We further discuss the potential of Lagrange oscillators to address other constraints, such as phase copying, which is useful in oscillatory Ising machines with limited connectivity.

                arXiv:2505.07244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying the memory capacity is the product $K \tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation property. We show that if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently small, the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE. Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by increasing the memory capacity $K\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of DDEs with positive delay $\tau>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory threshold, universal approximation holds.

                arXiv:2409.16757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most advanced algorithms in numerical black-box optimization. For noisy objective functions, several approaches were proposed to mitigate the noise, e.g., re-evaluations of the same solution or adapting the population size.
  In this paper, we devise a novel method to adaptively choose the optimal re-evaluation number for function values corrupted by additive Gaussian white noise. We derive a theoretical lower bound of the expected improvement achieved in one iteration of CMA-ES, given an estimation of the noise level and the Lipschitz constant of the function's gradient. Solving for the maximum of the lower bound, we obtain a simple expression of the optimal re-evaluation number.
  We experimentally compare our method to the state-of-the-art noise-handling methods for CMA-ES on a set of artificial test functions across various noise levels, optimization budgets, and dimensionality. Our method demonstrates significant advantages in terms of the probability of hitting near-optimal function values.

Abstract: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors for combined steering goals that empirically outperform additively combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs. Our code is available on github.com/jorispos/conceptorsteering.

                arXiv:2503.21846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly regarded for their energy efficiency, inherent activation sparsity, and suitability for real-time processing in edge devices. However, most current SNN methods adopt architectures resembling traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), leading to suboptimal performance when applied to SNNs. While SNNs excel in energy efficiency, they have been associated with lower accuracy levels than traditional ANNs when utilizing conventional architectures. In response, in this work we present LightSNN, a rapid and efficient Neural Network Architecture Search (NAS) technique specifically tailored for SNNs that autonomously leverages the most suitable architecture, striking a good balance between accuracy and efficiency by enforcing sparsity. Based on the spiking NAS network (SNASNet) framework, a cell-based search space including backward connections is utilized to build our training-free pruning-based NAS mechanism. Our technique assesses diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples using a sparsity-aware Hamming distance fitness evaluation. Thorough experiments are conducted on both static (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (DVS128-Gesture). Our LightSNN model achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, improves performance on DVS128Gesture by 4.49\%, and significantly reduces search time most notably offering a $98\times$ speedup over SNASNet and running 30\% faster than the best existing method on DVS128Gesture.

Abstract: Over the last few decades, European rail transport has undergone major changes as part of the process of liberalization set out in European regulations. In this context of liberalization, railway undertakings compete with each other for the limited infrastructure capacity available to offer their rail services. The infrastructure manager is responsible for the equitable allocation of infrastructure between all companies in the market, which is essential to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of this competitive ecosystem. In this paper, a methodology based on Jain, Gini and Atkinson equity metrics is used to solve the rail service allocation problem in a liberalized railway market, analyzing the solutions obtained. The results show that the proposed methodology and the equity metrics used allow for equitable planning in different competitiveness scenarios. These results contrast with solutions where the objective of the infrastructure manager is to maximize its own profit, without regard for the equitable allocation of infrastructure. Therefore, the computational tests support the methodology and metrics used as a planning and decision support tool in a liberalized railway market.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00788">Effective Regularization Through Loss-Function Metalearning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2010.00788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary computation can be used to optimize several different aspects of neural network architectures. For instance, the TaylorGLO method discovers novel, customized loss functions, resulting in improved performance, faster training, and improved data utilization. A likely reason is that such functions discourage overfitting, leading to effective regularization. This paper demonstrates theoretically that this is indeed the case for TaylorGLO. Learning rule decomposition reveals that evolved loss functions balance two factors: the pull toward zero error, and a push away from it to avoid overfitting. This is a general principle that may be used to understand other regularization techniques as well (as demonstrated in this paper for label smoothing). The theoretical analysis leads to a constraint that can be utilized to find more effective loss functions in practice; the mechanism also results in networks that are more robust (as demonstrated in this paper with adversarial inputs). The analysis in this paper thus constitutes a first step towards understanding regularization, and demonstrates the power of evolutionary neural architecture search in general.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06691">Fleet of Agents: Coordinated Problem Solving with Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.06691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While numerous frameworks have been developed to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there is a scarcity of methods that effectively balance the trade-off between cost and quality. In this paper, we introduce Fleet of Agents (FoA), a novel and intuitive yet principled framework utilizing LLMs as agents to navigate through dynamic tree searches, employing a genetic-type particle filtering approach. FoA spawns a multitude of agents, each exploring the search space autonomously, followed by a selection phase where resampling based on a heuristic value function optimizes the balance between exploration and exploitation. This mechanism enables dynamic branching, adapting the exploration strategy based on discovered solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark tasks, ``Game of 24'', ``Mini-Crosswords'', and ``WebShop'', utilizing four different LLMs, ``GPT-3.5'', ``GPT-4'', ``LLaMA3.2-11B'', and ``LLaMA3.2-90B''. On average across all tasks and LLMs, FoA obtains a quality improvement of ~5% while requiring only ~40% of the cost of previous SOTA methods. Notably, our analyses reveal that (1) FoA achieves the best cost-quality trade-off among all benchmarked methods and (2) FoA + LLaMA3.2-11B surpasses the Llama3.2-90B model. FoA is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/FoA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99474">Maternal behavior influences vocal practice and learning processes in the greater sac-winged bat</a></h4>

              
                Learning, particularly vocal learning, is often a social process. In human infants, it is well-established that social interactions influence speech acquisition and are hypothesized to modulate attentiveness and sensory processes, thereby affecting the speech-learning process. However, our understanding of how social interactions shape vocal ontogenetic processes in non-human mammals, particularly those which vocally learn, remains limited. In the bat <i>Saccopteryx bilineata</i>, pups acquire the adult vocal repertoire through a distinctive babbling behavior that shows interesting similarities to human infant babbling. While babbling encompasses many different syllable types, it is particularly noteworthy that pups learn song syllables by imitating adult singing males. The pups' social environment involves frequent interactions with their mothers, whereas adult males mainly serve as the primary source of acoustic input. We monitored the vocal ontogeny of wild pups, investigating whether their social environment influenced three aspects of babbling: the amount of vocal practice, the pups’ final syllable repertoire size and the production of the syllable types acquired through vocal learning. The results demonstrate that maternal behavioral displays significantly influence the amount of vocal practice, the presence and versatility of song syllable types in babbling and the percentage of mature song syllables. Our findings show that maternal feedback plays a significant role in the vocal ontogeny and learning processes of <i>S. bilineata</i>, thus enhancing our understanding of the relationship between social feedback and vocal development in mammalian vocal learners.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/79517">Observation of persister cell histories reveals diverse modes of survival in antibiotic persistence</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial persistence is a phenomenon in which a small fraction of isogenic bacterial cells survives a lethal dose of antibiotics. Although the refractoriness of persistent cell populations has classically been attributed to growth-inactive cells generated before drug exposure, evidence is accumulating that actively growing cell fractions can also generate persister cells. However, single-cell characterization of persister cell history remains limited due to the extremely low frequencies of persisters. Here, we visualize the responses of over one million individual cells of wildtype <i>Escherichia coli</i> to lethal doses of antibiotics, sampling cells from different growth phases and culture media into a microfluidic device. We show that when cells sampled from exponentially growing populations were treated with ampicillin or ciprofloxacin, most persisters were growing before antibiotic treatment. Growing persisters exhibited heterogeneous survival dynamics, including continuous growth and fission with L-form-like morphologies, responsive growth arrest, or post-exposure filamentation. Incubating cells under stationary phase conditions increased both the frequency and the probability of survival of non-growing cells to ampicillin. Under ciprofloxacin, however, all persisters identified were growing before the antibiotic treatment, including samples from post-stationary phase culture. These results reveal diverse persister cell dynamics that depend on antibiotic types and pre-exposure history.

">Cerebellar tDCS differentially modulates sensory inputs in somatosensory cortex and cerebellum.</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar transcranial direct-current stimulation (Cb-tDCS) is a promising tool for non-invasive modulation of cerebellar activity and has been proposed for the treatment of cerebellum-related disorders. However, how external currents applied to the cerebellum affect local and distant circuits remains unclear. In this study, we examined the immediate and aftereffects of Cb-tDCS on sensory inputs recorded in the cerebellar Crus I/II and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in response to whisker stimulation. We also assessed changes in the excitation/inhibition balance using vGLUT1 and GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity. Anodal and cathodal Cb-tDCS respectively induced an immediate increase and decrease in the trigeminal component in Crus I/II but no aftereffects were observed 20 minutes post-stimulation. In S1, Cb-tDCS resulted in polarity-dependent modulation of the N1 component during stimulation, which was opposite to the changes induced in Crus I/II and a sustained increase after anodal Cb-tDCS, accompanied by reduced GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity. While power spectrum analysis revealed no changes in Crus I/II, cathodal Cb-tDCS significantly modulated gamma (30-45 Hz) and high-frequency oscillations (255-300 Hz) in S1. These findings indicate that Cb-tDCS can modulate sensory inputs during stimulation and exert delayed effects in distant cortical areas, emphasizing the need to consider both online and remote network modulation in clinical applications.

                Heterozygous deletion of multiple contiguous genes associated with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS), a developmental disorder with significant risk for autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (Scz), selectively compromises neurogenic capacities of a temporally distinct cohort of cerebral cortical basal progenitors (bPs), prefiguring diminished frequency, divergent times of origin, positions, and identities of a subset of Layer 2/3 projection neuron (PN) progeny in the LgDel 22q11DS mouse model. LgDel bPs express 24/28 contiguous murine 22q11 gene orthologues at diminished levels; in parallel, cell cycle kinetics, modes of division, gene expression levels, and DNA methylation states are aberrant in LgDel bPs but not their apical progenitor precursors. Accordingly, targeted disruption of bP proliferative and transcriptional states selectively alters Layer 2/3 PN identities and frequencies, prefiguring atypical association cortico-cortical connections and behavioral deficits associated with ASD and Scz pathology in a mouse model of 22q11DS.

">Cholinergic blockade reveals role for human hippocampal theta in encoding but not retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other memory disorders. Yet, the neurophysiological mechanisms linking cholinergic signaling to memory remain poorly understood. In this study, we administered scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, to neurosurgical patients with intracranial electrodes as they performed an associative recognition memory task. When scopolamine was present at encoding, we observed disruptions to hippocampal slow theta oscillations (2-4 Hz), with selective impairments to recollection-based memory. However, when scopolamine was present during retrieval alone, we observed disruptions to slow theta without impaired memory performance. These disruptions included dose-dependent reductions in theta power, theta phase reset, and encoding-retrieval pattern reinstatement. Together, our results challenge the notion that theta oscillations are necessary for memory retrieval, and instead suggest that theta universally reflects an encoding-related neural state. These findings motivate updates to current models of acetylcholine's role in memory and may inform future therapies targeting rhythmic biomarkers of memory dysfunction.

">Developmental embedding of parvalbumin interneurons drives local and crosshemispheric prefrontal gamma synchrony</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations are a pivotal trait of cortical cognitive processing. However, the ability to generate gamma oscillations evolves with age and requires cellular adjustments of the underlying neural networks. In the prefrontal cortex, gamma oscillations emerge relatively late compared to other cortical areas, yet the developmental mechanisms leading to the generation of adult-like gamma oscillations are poorly understood. Here, we combine bilateral in vivo electrophysiology and selective optogenetic manipulations of parvalbumin- (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex along late development to investigate their role for the age-dependent maturation of gamma oscillations. We show that crosshemispheric gamma synchrony strengthens with age, in line with the previously reported increase in local gamma power. Following a similar timeline, the inhibitory effect of PV+ interneurons emerges which start to functionally operate within the classical gamma frequency range from adolescence onwards. In contrast, SOM+ interneurons show no such age-dependent functional integration and display their beta oscillation modulating inhibitory effect across age. These data identify the SOM+ to PV+ interneuron switch as a mechanism of gamma ontogeny and emergence of crosshemispheric synchrony in the developing prefrontal cortex.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has generated significant impacts on the forestry sector. Employment layoffs have led to an increase in return migration, resulting in additional labor supply and heightened family economic burdens. This research employs the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework to examine and predict sustainable forest management practices among families managing customary forests and village forests in Bali. Methods Purposive sampling was used to collect data from 71 managers of customary forests and village forests in Tenganan and Wanagiri. Partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the acquired data. Results The findings demonstrated that TPB can explain the sustainable forest management. The incorporation of an additional construct, Tri Hita Karana (THK), enhanced the model’s predictive power for both managerial intentions and behaviors in sustainable forest management. Specifically, THK influences management intentions through the mediation of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions This study established that THK, a fundamental value system in Balinese society, serves an antecedent predictor of behavioral intentions toward sustainable forest management. The relationship between THK and sustainable forest management intentions is mediated by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. This research makes significant theoretical and managerial contributions. First, it validates the established TPB framework within the context of COVID-19’s impact in Bali. Additionally, it provides scholars with insights for identifying other potential constructs that may influence forest land managers’ behavior.

                <p>Pain sensation often involves mechanical modalities. Mechanically activated (MA) ion channels on sensory neurons underly responsiveness to mechanical stimuli. MA current properties have mainly been derived from rodent sensory neurons. This study aimed to address gaps in knowledge regarding MA current properties in trigeminal (TG) neurons of a higher-order species, common marmoset nonhuman primates (NHP). MA currents triggered by a piezoactuator were recorded in patch-clamp configuration. MA responses were associated with action potential (AP) properties, such as width, dV/dt on the falling phase, and presence/absence of AP firing in NHP TG neurons. According to responsiveness to mechanical stimuli and AP properties, marmoset TG neurons were clustered into four S-type and five M-type groups. S-type TG neurons had broader AP with two dV/dt peaks on the AP falling phase. Only one S-type group of NHP TG neurons produced small MA currents. M-type TG neurons had narrow AP without two dV/dt peaks on the AP falling phase. M-type NHP TG neurons, except for one group, showed MA currents. We additionally used immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of known sensory neuronal types such as unmyelinated peptidergic CGRP<sup>+</sup>/trpV1<sup>+</sup>, unmyelinated nonpeptidergic MrgprD<sup>+</sup> and CGRP<sup>&ndash;</sup>/trpV1<sup>+</sup>, and myelinated peptidergic CGRP<sup>+</sup>/trpV1<sup>&ndash;</sup> and nonpeptidergic CGRP<sup>&ndash;</sup> and PV<sup>+</sup> NHP TG neurons. Overall, marmoset TG neurons and associated MA currents have many similarities compared with reported data from mouse sensory neurons. However, there are notable differences such as lower percentage of small NHP TG neurons responding to mechanical stimuli and absence of fast inactivating MA currents.</p>

                <p>Activation of hypothalamic paraventricular oxytocin (OXT<sup>PVN</sup>) neurons by social or stress stimuli triggers OXT release to promote social investigation and buffer adverse effects of stress, respectively. Astrocytes, a type of glial cells, can bidirectionally interact with hypothalamic neurons to participate in local activity regulation within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). It remains unknown whether contextual factors related to stimuli, as well as biological factors such as sex, influence OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neuronal or astrocyte activity and/or their interactions. To address this question, we performed dual-color fiber photometry in freely behaving male and female mice to simultaneously record Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and astrocytes during acute social (i.e., interactions with familiar vs. unfamiliar conspecifics) and stress (i.e., looming shadow) stimuli. During social stimuli, we observed the most pronounced Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons in females, revealing sex and familiarity context specificity. No astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes were detected in either sex regardless of conspecific familiarity. In contrast, looming shadow stress increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> in both OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and astrocytes in both sexes during an active escape ("run") strategy. Ca<sup>2+</sup> level changes in OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and astrocytes were significantly correlated during social investigations in both sexes regardless of conspecific familiarity. During looming shadow, this functional coupling was only observed in females during active escape. Together, our results suggest that sex, context, and behavioral strategy serve as major factors that shape the activity of OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and astrocytes, as well as their functional coupling, to potentially aid the adaptive response to social or stress stimuli.</p>

                Background The application of disinfectants on dental instruments is one way to prevent cross-infection. Cross infection can occur due to microorganisms found in blood, saliva and dental plaque which can contaminate the instruments used by dental health workers. Thus, indirect contact transmission of pathogenic microorganisms occurs from instruments that have been contaminated by dental health workers. 4.8% chloroxylenol are disinfecting agents used to disinfect medical instruments. Research on ozone water as a disinfectant is still limited and no research has been found on the use of ozone water on tooth extraction instruments. However, ozone has antibacterial properties so researchers are interested in studying the effectiveness of ozone water as a disinfectant when compared to the commonly used 4.8% chloroxylenol. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of disinfection of ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol in reducing the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments at the University of South Sumatera (USU) Dental and Oral Hospital. Methods The samples used were mandibular molar forceps that have been used in tooth extraction procedures. This study was experimental and used 30 sample with three sample groups, where each group consisted of 10 tooth extraction instruments. The treatment group used ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol and the negative control group was cleaned with distilled water. After use, each of the 10 mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps was disinfected. The ozone water group was produced with an ozone generator with a concentration of 15 mg/L for 20 minutes. Then the active side of the mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps was soaked for 30 minutes. In the 4.8% chloroxylenol (dettol®) group, the active side of the mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps was soaked in 250 mL of 4.8% chloroxylenol solution for 60 minutes. In the control group, the mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps were rinsed with distilled water without using soap or antiseptic solution at all. Then the forceps were removed from the disinfection container using tool tongs and dried with sterile gauze. After that, the sample was obtained by dipping the active side of the tooth extraction forceps into a container containing 50 ml of saline solution, then covered with aluminum foil and left for 5 minutes. The forceps are removed from the sample container and the container is closed again with plastic wrap, labeled, placed in a sterile container and then taken to the USU pharmaceutical laboratory to be counted the bacterial colonies using a bactery colony counter. The test effectiveness in this study used bacteria colony counter using the scatter cup method. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests. Results The results of the data analysis showed a p-value ≤0.001, which means that there was a significant difference in the disinfection using ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol on the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments. The results of this study show that the average number of bacterial colonies formed in the ozone water treatment group was 4.00 ± 4.32, in the 4.8% chloroxylenol treatment group, and 217.50 ± 39.24 in the negative control group (Aquadest). Conclusions From this study it can be said that ozone water is more effective in disinfecting dental extraction instruments than 4.8% chloroxylenol.

                <p>by Alberto Portela, Julio R. Banga, Marcos Matabuena</p>

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of systematically determining and characterizing the degree of confidence in computational model predictions. In systems biology, and particularly with dynamic models, UQ is critical due to the nonlinearities and parameter sensitivities that influence the behavior of complex biological systems. Addressing these issues through robust UQ enables a deeper understanding of system dynamics and more reliable extrapolation beyond observed conditions. Many state-of-the-art UQ approaches in this field are grounded in Bayesian statistical methods. While these frameworks naturally incorporate uncertainty quantification, they often require the specification of parameter distributions as priors and may impose parametric assumptions that do not always reflect biological reality. Additionally, Bayesian methods can be computationally expensive, posing significant challenges when dealing with large-scale models and seeking rapid, reliable uncertainty calibration. As an alternative, we propose using conformal predictions methods and introduce two novel algorithms designed for dynamic biological systems. These approaches can provide non-asymptotic guarantees, improving robustness and scalability across various applications, even when the predictive models are misspecified. Through several illustrative scenarios, we demonstrate that these conformal algorithms can serve as powerful complements—or even alternatives—to conventional Bayesian methods, delivering effective uncertainty quantification for predictive tasks in systems biology.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an essential role in embryonic development, wound healing, and tumor progression. Partial EMT states have been linked to metastatic dissemination and drug resistance. Several interconnected feedback loops at the RNA and protein levels control the transition between different cellular states. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental analyses in the TGFβ-responsive breast epithelial MCF10A cell model, we identify a central role for the tumor suppressor protein Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) during EMT. By extending a previous model of EMT comprising key transcription factors and microRNAs, our work shows that DLC1 acts as a positive regulator of TGFβ-driven EMT, mainly by promoting SNAIL1 expression. Our model predictions indicate that DLC1 loss impairs EMT progression. Experimental analyses confirm this prediction and reveal the acquisition of a partial EMT phenotype in DLC1-depleted cells. Furthermore, our model results indicate a possible EMT reversion to partial or epithelial states upon DLC1 loss in MCF10A cells induced toward mesenchymal phenotypes. The increased EMT plasticity of cells lacking DLC1 may explain its importance as a tumor suppressor.

                <p>by Arpit C. Swain, José A. M. Borghans, Rob J. de Boer</p>

Estimating production and loss rates of cell populations is essential but difficult. The current state-of-the-art method to estimate these rates involves mathematical modelling of deuterium labelling experiments. Current models typically assume that the labelling in the precursors of the population of interest (POI) is proportional to the deuterium enrichment in body water/glucose. This assumption is not always true and it is known that this can have a significant effect on the rates estimated from labelling experiments. Here we quantify the effect that different turnover (replacement) rates of the precursors can have on the estimated proliferation and loss rates of a POI by explicitly modelling the dynamics of the precursors. We first confirm earlier results that the labelling curve of the POI only reflects its own turnover rate if either the turnover rate of the precursors is sufficiently fast, or the contribution from the precursors is sufficiently small. Next, we describe three realistic scenarios with a slowly turning over precursor population, and show how this changes the interpretation of the different parameter estimates. Our analyses underpin that uniquely identifying the turnover rate of a POI requires measurements (or knowledge) on the turnover of its immediate precursors.

Molecular representation learning is pivotal in predicting molecular properties and advancing drug design. Traditional methodologies, which predominantly rely on homogeneous graph encoding, are limited by their inability to integrate external knowledge and represent molecular structures across different levels of granularity. To address these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift by encoding molecular graphs into heterogeneous structures, introducing a novel framework: Knowledge-aware Contrastive Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Learning. This approach leverages contrastive learning to enrich molecular representations with embedded external knowledge. KCHML conceptualizes molecules through three distinct graph views—molecular, elemental, and pharmacological—enhanced by heterogeneous molecular graphs and a dual message-passing mechanism. This design offers a comprehensive representation for property prediction, as well as for downstream tasks such as drug-drug interaction prediction. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates KCHML’s superiority over state-of-the-art molecular property prediction models, underscoring its ability to capture intricate molecular features.

Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases globally, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives each year. The disease presents substantial heterogeneity among the population, with approximately two-thirds of fatalities occurring in children under five years old. Immunity to malaria develops through repeated exposure and plays a crucial role in disease dynamics. Seasonal environmental fluctuations, such as changes in temperature and rainfall, lead to temporal heterogeneity and further complicate transmission dynamics and the utility of intervention strategies. We employ an age-structured partial differential equation model to characterize seasonal malaria transmission and assess vaccination strategies that vary by timing and duration. Our model integrates vector-host epidemiological dynamics across different age groups and nonlinear feedback between transmission and immunity. We calibrate the model to year-round and seasonal malaria settings and conduct extensive sensitivity analyses for both scenarios to systematically assess which assumptions lead to the most uncertainty. We use time-varying sensitivity indices to identify critical disease parameters during low and high transmission seasons. We further investigate the impact of vaccination and its implementation in the seasonal malaria settings. When implementing a three-dose primary vaccination series, seasonally targeted campaigns can prevent significantly more cases per vaccination than constant year-long programs in regions with strong seasonal variation in transmission. In such scenarios, the optimal vaccination interval aligns with the peak in infected mosquito abundance and precedes the peak in malaria transmission. In contrast, seasonal booster programs may provide limited advantages over year-long vaccination. Additionally, while increasing annual vaccination counts can reduce overall disease incidence, it yields marginal improvements in cases prevented per vaccination.

Living organisms rely on internal models of the world to act adaptively. These models, because of resource limitations, cannot encode every detail and hence need to compress information. From a cognitive standpoint, information compression can manifest as a distortion of latent representations, resulting in the emergence of representations that may not accurately reflect the external world or its geometry. Rate-distortion theory formalizes the optimal way to compress information while minimizing such distortions, by considering factors such as capacity limitations, the frequency and the utility of stimuli. However, while this theory explains why the above factors distort latent representations, it does not specify which specific distortions they produce. To address this question, here we investigate how rate-distortion trade-offs shape the latent representations of images in generative models, specifically Beta Variational Autoencoders (β-VAEs), under varying constraints of model capacity, data distributions, and task objectives. By systematically exploring these factors, we identify three primary distortions in latent representations: prototypization, specialization, and orthogonalization. These distortions emerge as signatures of information compression, reflecting the model’s adaptation to capacity limitations, data imbalances, and task demands. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that these distortions can coexist, giving rise to a rich landscape of latent spaces, whose geometry could differ significantly across generative models subject to different constraints. Our findings contribute to explain how the normative constraints of rate-distortion theory shape the geometry of latent representations of generative models of artificial systems and living organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012572">Capturing the emergent dynamical structure in biophysical neural models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Borjan Milinkovic, Lionel Barnett, Olivia Carter, Anil K. Seth, Thomas Andrillon</p>

Complex neural systems can display structured emergent dynamics. Capturing this structure remains a significant scientific challenge. Using information theory, we apply <i>Dynamical Independence</i> (DI) to uncover the emergent dynamical structure in a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, shaped by the interplay of two key aspects of brain organisation: integration and segregation. In our study, functional integration within the biophysical neural model is modulated by a global coupling parameter, while functional segregation is influenced by adding dynamical noise, which counteracts global coupling. Leveraging transfer entropy, DI defines a dimensionally-reduced <i>macroscopic variable</i> (e.g., a coarse-graining) as emergent to the extent that it behaves as an independent dynamical process, distinct from the micro-level dynamics. Dynamical dependence (a departure from dynamical independence) is measured by minimising the transfer entropy from microlevel variables to macroscopic variables across spatial scales. Our results indicate that the degree of emergence of macroscopic variables is relatively minimised at balanced points of integration and segregation and maximised at the extremes. Additionally, our method identifies to which degree the macroscopic dynamics are localised across microlevel nodes, thereby elucidating the emergent dynamical structure through the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic processes. We find that deviation from a balanced point between integration and segregation results in a less localised, more distributed emergent dynamical structure as identified by DI. This finding suggests that a balance of functional integration and segregation is associated with lower levels of emergence (higher dynamical dependence), which may be crucial for sustaining coherent, localised emergent macroscopic dynamical structures. This work also provides a complete computational implementation for the identification of emergent neural dynamics that could be applied both in silico and in vivo.

                <p>by Yuanqiang Sun, Ke Shui, Qinyu Li, Chenlu Liu, Wanting Jin, Jian-Quan Ni, Jian Lu, Luoying Zhang</p>

The circadian rhythm is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism with translational regulation increasingly recognized as pivotal in its modulation. In this study, we found that upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are enriched in <i>Drosophila</i> circadian rhythm genes, with particularly conserved uORFs present in core circadian clock genes. We demonstrate evidence that the uORFs of the core clock gene, <i>Clock</i> (<i>Clk</i>), rhythmically and substantially attenuate CLK protein translation in <i>Drosophila</i>, with pronounced suppression occurring during daylight hours. Eliminating <i>Clk</i> uORFs leads to increased CLK protein levels during the day and results in a shortened circadian cycle, along with a broad shift in clock gene expression rhythms. Notably, <i>Clk</i> uORF deletion also augments morning sleep by reducing dopaminergic activity. Beyond daily circadian adjustments, <i>Clk</i> uORFs play a role in modulating sleep patterns in response to seasonal daylight variations. Furthermore, the <i>Clk</i> uORFs act as an important regulator to shape the rhythmic expression of a vast array of genes and influence multifaceted physiological outcomes. Collectively, our research sheds light on the intricate ways uORFs dynamically adjust downstream coding sequences to acclimate to environmental shifts.

                <p>by Ivett Pipoly, Veronika Bókony, Jean-Michel Gaillard, Jean-François Lemaître, Tamás Székely, András Liker</p>

Sex chromosomes can determine male and female phenotypes, and the resulting sex differences may have significant impacts on ecology and life history. One manifestation of this link is that ZW/ZZ sex-determination systems are associated with more male-skewed adult sex ratio (ASR, proportion of males in the adult population) than XX/XY systems across tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals). Here, we investigate four demographic processes: male and female offspring production, sex differences in juvenile and adult mortalities and in timing of maturation that can contribute to ASR variation between XX/XY and ZW/ZZ systems, using phylogenetic analyses of a large dataset collected from tetrapod species in the wild. We show that sex differences in adult mortality reliably predict ASR that is also more male-biased in XX/XY species than in ZW/ZZ species. Sex differences in juvenile mortality and in maturation time also contribute to ASR skews, but do not differ consistently between XX/XY and ZW/ZZ systems. Phylogenetic path analyses confirm an influence of sex-determination system on ASR through sex-biased adult mortalities. Together these results infer that sex chromosomes can impact, via demographic pathways, frequency-dependent selection emerging from the relative number of males and females. We call for follow-up studies to uncover the potentially complex web of associations between sex determination, population dynamics, and social behavior.

The variant histone H2A.Z is deposited into nucleosomes immediately downstream of promoters, where it plays a critical role in transcription. The site-specific deposition of H2A.Z is catalyzed by the SWR complex, a conserved chromatin remodeler with affinity for promoter-proximal nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and histone acetylation. By comparing the genomic distribution of H2A.Z in wild-type and SWR-deficient cells, we found that SWR is also responsible for depositing H2A.Z at thousands of non-canonical sites not directly linked to NDRs or histone acetylation. To understand the targeting mechanism of H2A.Z, we presented SWR to a library of canonical nucleosomes isolated from yeast and analyzed the preferred substrates. Our results revealed that SWR preferentially deposited H2A.Z into a subset of endogenous H2A.Z sites, which are overrepresented by polyadenine tracts on the top strands of the DNA duplex at the nucleosomal entry-exit sites. Insertion of polyadenine sequences into recombinant nucleosomes near the outgoing H2A-H2B dimer enhanced SWR’s affinity for the nucleosomal substrate and increased its H2A.Z insertion activity. These findings suggest that the genome encodes sequence-based information that facilitates remodeler-mediated targeting of H2A.Z.

     alt="Modulation of GABAergic System in a Chicken Retinal Ischemic Model: The Role of Chloride Cotransporters"/>
<p>Oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) promotes GABA release and increases NKCC1 levels, which change the electrochemical chloride gradient. In these circumstances, activation of ionotropic GABA receptors would lead to cell depolarization. Thus, in the early stages of ischemia, GABA intensifies glutamate excitotoxicity by an alteration in chloride transporters, worsening cell death.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Retinal ischemia is a significant pathological condition that contributes to visual impairment and neuronal cell death in various retinopathies. Evidence suggests that GABA release during ischemic events may exhibit neuroprotective properties, but conflicting findings highlight a potential shift in its effects due to altered chloride ion homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the role of the GABAergic system in retinal ischemia, focusing on the temporal dynamics of GABA release and its impact on retinal damage. We hypothesized that ischemia-induced changes in GABA transport and chloride ion equilibrium contribute to neuronal damage, which can be mitigated by modulating GABAergic activity. Using an ex vivo chick retina model subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), during different times, we assessed morphological changes, cell death, GABA levels, transporter activity, and the levels of chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2. Pharmacological interventions, including picrotoxin and bumetanide, were used to evaluate neuroprotective effects. Our results revealed that OGD-induced significant morphological changes and cell death in the retina. GABA levels were reduced in a GAT-1-dependent manner, while picrotoxin and bumetanide demonstrated neuroprotective effects by mitigating retinal swelling and modulating the GABAergic system. Notably, OGD increased NKCC1 content, but not KCC2 levels, indicating a disruption in chloride homeostasis. These findings suggest that ischemia-induced alterations in GABAergic activity and chloride transport contribute to retinal damage. Targeting these pathways with pharmacological agents, such as bumetanide, may offer therapeutic strategies for mitigating ischemic retinal injury. Further research is recommended to explore the clinical applicability of these findings in the ischemic retina.</p>

                Background Cystocele, a form of anterior vaginal wall prolapse, remains one of the most prevalent types of pelvic organ prolapse in women, often associated with a high risk of recurrence following surgical repair. Despite advancements in surgical techniques, the failure rate remains significant, prompting the need for adjunct therapies to enhance healing. Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), an autologous blood derivative rich in growth factors, has emerged as a promising regenerative therapy known to accelerate wound healing and tissue regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of intra-fascial PRP injection during cystocele repair on systemic Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) expression, anatomical improvement based on Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) values, symptom severity assessed by the Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI) score, and recurrence risk. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 44 women aged 44 to 72 years diagnosed with stage III–IV cystocele. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: 21 underwent standard cystocele repair (control group), and 23 received the same procedure with a single 10 ml autologous PRP injection into the pubocervical fascia (PRP group). The study was conducted at RSUD Arifin Achmad Pekanbaru from March to October 2024. Blinding was applied to patients, caregivers, and assessors. PDGF levels were measured on days 0, 3, 28, and 90 postoperatively. POP-Q values and UDI scores were assessed at the same intervals. Results PRP administration significantly increased PDGF levels and improved UDI scores on days 28 and 90. Anatomical improvement was also greater in the PRP group. While recurrence rates did not differ significantly, the PRP group had fewer recurrences. Conclusions Intra-fascial PRP injection during cystocele repair improves PDGF expression, healing response, and patient-reported outcomes. Though recurrence risk was not significantly reduced, findings support further trials to assess PRP’s long-term benefits in pelvic reconstructive surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-294/v2?src=rss">Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Case series of extensive resections and reconstructions with literature review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. Head and neck involvement accounts for only 10–15% of cases. Achieving clear margins in this region is challenging owing to anatomical constraints. Such cases often require extensive resection and complex reconstructions. This study presents a case series of extensive dermatofibrosarcoma resections in the head and neck, focusing on the surgical margins, reconstruction strategies, recurrence rates, and adjuvant therapy. We report four cases of head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma involving the cheek and scalp. Surgery included wide local excision with margins of 3–5 cm, which was confirmed intraoperatively by frozen section analysis. Reconstruction involved free flaps, local flaps, and healing with secondary intention. The choice depends on the defect size and location. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to selected cases. All patients achieved negative margins. One patient developed flap necrosis that required revision surgery. No local recurrence was observed during the follow-up (1–7 years). Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma justifies aggressive surgical resection to achieve clear margins, which is the key to reducing the risk of recurrence. Free flaps and local reconstruction techniques ensure good functional and aesthetic outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated in patients with close margins or deep invasion. Long-term follow-up is essential owing to its high recurrence potential.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-488/v1?src=rss">Efficacy of auditory-visual attentional training in adults with chronic tinnitus: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Chronic tinnitus, a phantom auditory perception affecting a significant proportion of adults worldwide, is associated with attentional deficits and maladaptive neuroplasticity. While existing rehabilitation strategies often neglect multi-sensory attentional processing, this study will evaluate a novel auditory-visual attentional training protocol designed to modulate tinnitus-related neural and cognitive dysfunction. Methods Forty-five adults with chronic tinnitus will be randomly assigned to visual-only attentional training, auditory-only training, or combined auditory-visual training. Participants will complete daily 30-minute sessions via a mobile platform over three weeks. Primary outcomes included tinnitus severity, measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ), and attention performance across three domains: visual attention (Stroop test accuracy), auditory attention (Test of Attention in Listening metrics), and global attention (Attention Network Test scores). Neurophysiological assessments will comprise resting-state quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) spectral power analysis and modality-specific evoked potentials (auditory and visual P300). Data will be analyzed using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) for neural source localization and mixed-effects models for behavioral outcomes. Conclusion This trial will systematically evaluate multi-sensory attentional training by integrating behavioral and neurophysiological assessments, including resting-state qEEG dynamics and modality-specific P300 responses. Findings provide insights into the interplay between attentional plasticity, neural oscillatory patterns, and tinnitus symptom modulation, informing future targeted rehabilitation strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-487/v1?src=rss">Health policy at your fingertips? Mapping and evaluation of existing digital health policy repositories. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Digital repositories and databases facilitate faster dissemination, transparency, and stakeholder collaboration. This review aimed to map and evaluate such digital infrastructures, focusing on their scope, content, functionality, adherence to FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse) principles, and user interface and experiences (UI/UX). Methods A review of global digital health policy repositories was conducted across multiple search engines and databases. The review targeted digital repositories that systematically collate health policy documents at a global level. Two country-specific repositories with a bearing on global health policies were also included. Results The study identified 59 global health policy repositories, with 15 matching our inclusion criteria evaluated in detail. These repositories contain vast amounts of data and are generally freely accessible, rendering them immensely rich sources for health policy documents, though with significant variability in content and coverage. The majority have a health focus, including HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH); about a third are more broad and emerging health threats are often neglected. Accessibility and usability are limited, with basic user interface features such as search and filtering tools are present for almost all repositories and a notable lack of advanced analytics or artificial intelligence capabilities. Furthermore, many repositories struggle to adhere to FAIR principles, reducing their utility and potential for integration. Sustainability is also a concern, as funding often relies on short-term projects or philanthropic support, undermining long-term viability. Conclusion These issues collectively hinder the ability of digital health policy repositories to support comprehensive and timely global health policy development. To unlock the full potential of existing or new repositories for health policy, identified challenges should be tackled systematically. We provide specific recommendations aimed at driving the development of equitable, inclusive, high-functioning repositories and strengthening evidence-driven global health policy systems.

                Background Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) are a critical measure of financial health, affecting bank profitability, stability, and investor trust. This systematic review synthesizes existing research on the causes, effects, and innovative approaches to managing NPLs in the banking sector. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a thorough search of peer-reviewed journals, conference papers, and institutional reports published between 2014 and 2024. Databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate were used. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts for eligibility. Data were extracted and synthesized to identify trends and gaps in the literature. Results The review included 50 studies from various regions. Key drivers of NPLs included economic downturns, inflation, and poor credit risk management. NPLs negatively impacted bank profitability metrics such as Return on Assets (ROA) and Net Interest Margin (NIM). FinTech solutions, particularly AI-driven credit scoring, showed potential in reducing NPLs, though adoption barriers exist in underdeveloped regions. Conclusions The findings emphasize the need to combine traditional risk management practices with innovative financial technologies and policy reforms to strengthen banking sector resilience. Policymakers and financial institutions should focus on improving regulatory frameworks and investing in technological advancements to address NPL-related risks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100840">Reproducibility of in vivo electrophysiological measurements in mice</a></h4>

              
                Understanding brain function relies on the collective work of many labs generating reproducible results. However, reproducibility has not been systematically assessed within the context of electrophysiological recordings during cognitive behaviors. To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in 10 laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by individual task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90848">Seasonally migratory songbirds have different historic population size characteristics than resident relatives</a></h4>

              
                Modern genomic methods enable estimation of a lineage’s long-term effective population sizes back to its origins. This ability allows unprecedented opportunities to determine how the adoption of a major life-history trait affects lineages’ populations relative to those without the trait. We used this novel approach to study the population effects of the life-history trait of seasonal migration across evolutionary time. Seasonal migration is a common life-history strategy, but its effects on long-term population sizes relative to lineages that don’t migrate are largely unknown. Using whole-genome data, we estimated effective population sizes over millions of years in closely related seasonally migratory and resident lineages in a group of songbirds. Our main predictions were borne out: Seasonal migration is associated with larger effective population sizes (<i>N<sub>e</sub></i>), greater long-term variation in <i>N<sub>e</sub></i>, and a greater degree of initial population growth than among resident lineages. Initial growth periods were remarkably long (0.63–4.29 Myr), paralleling the expansion and adaptation phases of taxon cycles, a framework of lineage expansion and eventual contraction over time encompassing biogeography and evolutionary ecology. Heterogeneity among lineages is noteworthy, despite geographic proximity (including overlap) and close relatedness. Seasonal migration imbues these lineages with fundamentally different population size attributes through evolutionary time compared to closely related resident lineages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99229">Rtf1 HMD domain facilitates global histone H2B monoubiquitination and regulates morphogenesis and virulence in the meningitis-causing pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans</a></h4>

              
                Rtf1 is generally considered to be a subunit of the Paf1 complex (Paf1C), which is a multifunctional protein complex involved in histone modification and RNA biosynthesis at multiple stages. Rtf1 is stably associated with the Paf1C in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, but not in other species including humans. Little is known about its function in human fungal pathogens. Here, we show that Rtf1 is required for facilitating H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1), and regulates fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity in the meningitis-causing fungal pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. Rtf1 is not tightly associated with the Paf1C, and its histone modification domain (HMD) is sufficient to promote H2Bub1 and the expression of genes related to fungal mating and filamentation. Moreover, Rtf1 HMD fully restores fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity; however, it fails to restore defects of thermal tolerance and melanin production in the <i>rtf1</i>Δ strain background. The present study establishes a role for cryptococcal Rtf1 as a Paf1C-independent regulator in regulating fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity, and highlights the function of HMD in facilitating global H2Bub1 in <i>C. neoformans</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95379">Drosophila epidermal cells are intrinsically mechanosensitive and modulate nociceptive behavioral outputs</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory neurons (SSNs) that detect and transduce mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli densely innervate an animal’s skin. However, although epidermal cells provide the first point of contact for sensory stimuli, our understanding of roles that epidermal cells play in SSN function, particularly nociception, remains limited. Here, we show that stimulating <i>Drosophila</i> epidermal cells elicits activation of SSNs including nociceptors and triggers a variety of behavior outputs, including avoidance and escape. Further, we find that epidermal cells are intrinsically mechanosensitive and that epidermal mechanically evoked calcium responses require the store-operated calcium channel Orai. Epidermal cell stimulation augments larval responses to acute nociceptive stimuli and promotes prolonged hypersensitivity to subsequent mechanical stimuli. Hence, epidermal cells are key determinants of nociceptive sensitivity and sensitization, acting as primary sensors of noxious stimuli that tune nociceptor output and drive protective behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103235">Selective attention and sensitivity to auditory disturbances in a virtually real classroom</a></h4>

              
                Many people, and particularly individuals with attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (AD(H)D), find it difficult to maintain attention during classroom learning. However, traditional paradigms used to evaluate attention do not capture the complexity and dynamic nature of real-life classrooms. Using a novel virtual reality platform, coupled with measurement of neural activity, eye-gaze, and skin conductance, here we studied the neurophysiological manifestations of attention and distractibility, under realistic learning conditions. Individuals with AD(H)D exhibited higher neural responses to irrelevant sounds and reduced speech tracking of the teacher, relative to controls. Additional neurophysiological measures, such the power of alpha-oscillations and frequency of gaze-shifts away from the teacher, contributed to explaining variance in self-reported AD(H)D symptoms across the sample. These ecologically valid findings provide critical insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying individual differences in the capacity for sustained attention and the proneness to distraction and mind-wandering, experienced in real-life situations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89485">Effects of blood meal source and seasonality on reproductive traits of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae)</a></h4>

              
                Host selection by mosquitoes is a keystone in understanding viral circulation and predicting future infection outbreaks. <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes frequently feed on birds during spring and early summer, shifting into mammals towards late summer and autumn. This host switch may be due to changes in mosquito fitness. The aim of this study was to assess if the interaction effect of blood meal source and seasonality may influence reproductive traits of <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> mosquitoes. For this purpose, <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> mosquitoes were reared in simulated summer and autumn conditions and fed on two different hosts, chickens and mice, in a factorial design. Fecundity, fertility, and hatchability during two consecutive gonotrophic cycles were estimated. We found greater fecundity and fertility for mosquitoes fed upon birds than mammals. Fecundity and fertility did not vary between seasons for chicken-fed mosquitoes, whereas in autumn they decreased for mouse-fed mosquitoes. These traits decreased in the second gonotrophic cycle for mouse-fed mosquitoes, whereas they did not vary between cycles for chicken-fed mosquitoes. There was no statistically significant effect of blood meal source, seasonality or their interaction on hatchability, hence this variable was similar among treatments. Overall, these results indicate a statistically significant interaction effect of blood meal source and seasonality on fecundity and fertility. However, the pattern was opposite in relation to our hypothesis, suggesting that further studies are needed to confirm and expand our knowledge about mosquito biology and its relationship with seasonal host use shifting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101035">Molecular and spatial transcriptomic classification of midbrain dopamine neurons and their alterations in a LRRK2G2019S model of Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Several studies have revealed that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, even within a single neuroanatomical area, display heterogeneous properties. In parallel, studies using singlecell profiling techniques have begun to cluster DA neurons into subtypes based on their molecular signatures. Recent work has shown that molecularly defined DA subtypes within the substantia nigra (SNc) display distinctive anatomic and functional properties, and differential vulnerability in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Based on these provocative results, a granular understanding of these putative subtypes and their alterations in PD models, is imperative. We developed an optimized pipeline for single-nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and generated a high-resolution hierarchically organized map revealing 20 molecularly distinct DA neuron subtypes belonging to three main families. We integrated this data with spatial MERFISH technology to map, with high definition, the location of these subtypes in the mouse midbrain, revealing heterogeneity even within neuroanatomical sub-structures. Finally, we demonstrate that in the preclinical LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> knock-in mouse model of PD, subtype organization and proportions are preserved. Transcriptional alterations occur in many subtypes including those localized to the ventral tier SNc, where differential expression is observed in synaptic pathways, which might account for previously described DA release deficits in this model. Our work provides an advancement of current taxonomic schemes of the mouse midbrain DA neuron subtypes, a high-resolution view of their spatial locations, and their alterations in a prodromal mouse model of PD.

">Non-invasive mapping of the temporal processing hierarchy in the human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Vision is not instantaneous but evolves over time. However, simultaneously capturing the fine spatial details and the rapid temporal dynamics of visual processing remains a major challenge, resulting in a gap in our understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we introduce a forward modeling technique that bridges high-spatial resolution fMRI with high-temporal resolution MEG, enabling us to non-invasively measure different levels of the visual hierarchy in humans and their involvement in visual processing with millisecond precision. Using fMRI, levels of the visual hierarchy were identified by measuring individuals population receptive fields and determining visual field maps. We predicted how much the activity patterns in each visual field map would contribute to brain responses measured with MEG. By comparing these predicted responses with the measured MEG responses, we assessed how much a given visual field map contributed to the measured MEG response, and, most importantly, when. We combined information from all MEG sensors and revealed a cortical processing hierarchy across visual field maps. We validated the method using cross-validations and demonstrated that the model generalized across MEG sensor types, stimulus shapes, and was robust to the number of visual field maps included in the model. We found that the primary visual cortex captured most of the variance in the MEG sensors and did so earlier in time than extrastriate regions. We also report a processing hierarchy across extra-striate visual field maps and clusters. We effectively combined the advantages of two very different neuroimaging techniques, opening avenues for answering research questions that require recordings with high spatiotemporal detail. By bridging traditionally separate areas of research, our approach helps close longstanding gaps in our understanding of brain function.

">An intercellular signaling pathway in the mouse retina connects Kv2.1, GLT-1, and nitric oxide synthase 1 to optic nerve regeneration</a></h4>

              
                We report here that a multicellular signaling pathway in the mouse retina targeting glutamate homeostasis and nitric oxide production is activated upon optic nerve injury and modulates retinal ganglion cells' (RGCs') ability to mount a robust regenerative response. A novel highly sensitive and specific NO sensor (FL2) revealed that optic nerve injury leads to a rapid, prolonged NO elevation in the inner retina. Amacrine cell-specific genetic deletion of the neuron-specific isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS1, nNOS) or the NOS1 inhibitor N(w)-propyl-L-arginine (L-NPA) suppressed optic nerve regeneration. Steps leading to NOS1 activation are shown to include Kv2.1 phosphorylation and activation, reversal of glutamate uptake by the glutamate transporter GLT-1 (EAAT2), and subsequent NMDA receptor activation. Conditional knockout of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in bipolar cells, intraocular injection of the GLT-1 blockers dihydrokainate (DHK) or WAY213613, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-AP5), or the Kv2.1 blockers RY796 or stromatoxin all suppressed NO generation and strongly diminished RGCs' ability to respond to Pten deletion and other factors. Thus, optic nerve injury activates a sequence of pathophysiological changes in retinal interneurons that gates RGCs' ability to regenerate injured axons.

">CaMK2rep: A Highly Sensitive Genetically Encoded Biosensor for Monitoring CaMKII Activity in Mammalian Cells</a></h4>

              
                Accurately monitoring calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity in cells remains a significant challenge due to the limited sensitivity and narrow dynamic range of existing genetically encoded sensors. Here, we introduce CaMK2rep, a novel phosphorylation-based biosensor that enables robust, specific, and high-sensitivity detection of CaMKII activity. CaMK2rep is designed with two tandem CaMKII consensus sites embedded within the native sequence context of synapsin, and its phosphorylation is detected via a phospho-specific antibody, allowing both biochemical and morphological analyses. We validated CaMK2rep in HeLa cells and cultured hippocampal neurons, demonstrating a near-linear response to CaMKII expression levels and stimulation intensity, and no detectable cytotoxicity. To complement CaMK2rep measurements, we employed the live-cell CaMKAR1 reporter to monitor CaMKII activity dynamics. Using both tools, we investigated the role of neurogranin (Ng), a major postsynaptic calmodulin (CaM) binding protein, and obtained consistent evidence supporting a CaM-buffering model in which Ng limits basal CaMKII activation by sequestering CaM. These findings establish CaMK2rep as a sensitive, specific, and versatile biosensor for CaMKII signaling, particularly well-suited for immunoblot-based population analyses. They also illustrate the value of combining orthogonal genetically encoded tools to interrogate complex signaling mechanisms in both physiological and pathological contexts.

">Statistical learning drives anticipatory micro-saccades toward suppressed distractor locations</a></h4>

              
                Statistical learning enables individuals to suppress distracting but salient information, yet the mechanisms underlying this suppression remain unclear. While some suggest that suppression is proactive, occurring without first attending to distractor locations, others argue that it is reactive, requiring covert attention toward the distractor location before suppression can occur. To address this fierce debate, the current study recorded micro-saccades--an index of covert attention--during the pre-stimulus interval, alongside electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during a visual search task. Participants were instructed to ignore a salient distractor that appeared more frequently at one specific location than at others. Learning high-probability distractor locations reduced attentional capture by salient distractors, coinciding with increased micro-saccade rates and decodable representations of these locations in alpha power (8-14 Hz) before stimulus onset. Strikingly, these anticipatory micro-saccades were more frequently directed toward high-probability distractor locations than away from them, supporting a reactive suppression mechanism. Overall, these findings highlight a crucial role for the oculomotor system in encoding and responding to learned spatial regularities.

">Empirical evidence of the neuroactive potential of the gut on neurochemistry in the gut-brain axis in humans</a></h4>

              
                The gut microbiome produces a wide range of neuroactive metabolites capable of influencing brain neurotransmitter systems. While preclinical studies suggest these microbial pathways modulate cognitive and emotional processes, evidence in humans remains limited. This study investigates the relationship between gut microbiome-derived neuroactive pathways and in vivo brain neurotransmitter concentrations in healthy young females. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), we quantified GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and inferior occipital gyrus (IOG). Parallel gut microbiome profiling identified functional pathways associated with the synthesis and degradation of GABA, glutamate, short-chain fatty acids, p-cresol, and inositol. We observed significant, region-specific associations between microbial neuroactive pathways and both neurotransmitter concentrations and excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, a key regulator of neuroplasticity and mental health. Notably, microbial GABA synthesis pathways were inversely related to brain glutamate levels in the dlPFC, while glutamate synthesis pathways correlated with GABA levels in the ACC. Additional pathways, including p-cresol and SCFA metabolism, showed region-dependent relationships with brain neurochemistry and E/I ratios. These neurochemical findings were complemented by associations between the same microbial pathways and psychological outcomes, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. These findings provide new evidence of gut-derived metabolic influence on human brain neurotransmitter dynamics and mental wellbeing, highlighting the gut-brain axis as a promising target for microbiome-based interventions supporting cognitive resilience and emotional health.

">Population-Level Activity Dissociates Preparatory Overt from Covert Attention</a></h4>

              
                The neural signatures of preparing overt eye movements and directing covert spatial attention overlap as they recruit the same brain areas. Yet, these neural signatures are dissociable at the single-cell level: Specific cells within these visuo-oculomotor areas are exclusively involved in either motor preparation or covert attention. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that many cells in visuo-oculomotor areas are involved in both motor preparation and covert attention, and consequently their neural signatures should functionally overlap to a large degree. Here, we put this proposal to the test: we combined EEG with sensitive decoding techniques to investigate whether the neural signatures of preparatory overt and covert attention are dissociable across large-scale neuronal populations. We found that neural decoding reliably discerned whether overt or covert attention was shifted well before saccade initiation. Further, inverted encoding modeling revealed sharper spatially tuned activity in preparatory overt than in covert attention. We then asked whether preparatory overt attention achieved sharper spatially-tuned activity by using "more-of-the-same" covert attention, or by recruiting additional spatially selective neural processing. Cross-decoding results demonstrated that preparatory overt attention recruited at least one additional, frontal process. This additional spatially selective process emerged early and likely reflects motor preparation or predictive remapping. To summarize, we found that the neural signatures of overt and covert attention overlap, yet diverge rapidly, in part because overt attention employs an additional spatially selective neural process. Extending beyond a dissociation on the single-cell level, our findings demonstrate that population-level neural activity dissociates preparatory overt from covert attention.

">Unmasking Convergent Oxycodone Seeking and Consumption Driving Augmented Intake during Extended Access to Oral Operant Self-Administration</a></h4>

              
                Individual vulnerability to opioid intake escalation is a critical but poorly understood aspect of addiction. Using genetically diverse inbred rat strains, we investigated operant oral oxycodone self-administration, identifying Augmenter phenotypes that dramatically increased consumption during extended (16h vs. 4h) access, a vulnerability not predicted by standard motivation tests. A key innovation was applying lick microstructure analysis (LMA) to operationally distinguish 'consumption' from seeking lick clusters within the inter-reward interval. During extended access, Augmenters of both sexes exhibited a striking surge in the frequency of both consumption and seeking clusters (p<0.0001), driving their escalated intake. Notably, female Augmenters also showed larger seeking cluster sizes (p=0.006), suggesting enhanced reward value specifically linked to seeking behavior. In contrast, interlick interval (a palatability measure) did not differentiate phenotypes. This LMA-based approach reveals that an increased drive to seek out additional oxycodone, rather than altered hedonic impact alone, underlies the augmentation of opioid intake, offering a nuanced rodent model of heightened vulnerability and a powerful tool to dissect reward dynamics.

">Adolescent cannabinoid vapour exposure sex-dependently alters the relationship between vulnerability traits and ethanol self-administration and modifies naltrexone actions on ethanol intake in rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis use during adolescence is common and may predispose individuals to substance use disorders. Animal studies have explored the gateway hypothesis, but data on ethanol consumption are limited. This study aimed to investigate the potential link between adolescent cannabis exposure and ethanol self-administration, as well as the relationship between predisposing behavioural traits and ethanol consumption. Methods: Adolescent rats were exposed to vapourised {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alone or with cannabidiol (CBD) at different ratios, or to a vehicle, from postnatal day (PND) 28 to 44, every other day. Behavioural assessments, including novelty and saccharin preference, goal-tracking, elevated plus maze, and ethanol self-administration (fixed and progressive ratio, punished seeking), were conducted from PND 70. Naltrexone was administered to assess its effects on ethanol intake. Results: Cannabinoid exposure did not significantly affect behavioural traits or ethanol self-administration. However, sex differences emerged, with females showing a more vulnerable pattern of ethanol consumption and seeking. In THC-exposed males, a negative correlation was observed between sucrose preference and compulsive ethanol seeking, which was absent in vehicle-exposed males. In females, THC exposure disrupted the correlation between novelty preference and ethanol intake and was associated with a negative correlation between goal-tracking and compulsive seeking. Naltrexone was most effective in reducing ethanol intake in THC-exposed rats. Conclusions: Adolescent cannabinoid exposure has limited effects on overall alcohol risk but may alter the psychological framework of alcohol-related behaviours and increase naltrexone potency. The observed sex differences highlight the need for personalised interventions.

">Chiral shift toward D-serine reflects intrathecal inflammation in multiple sclerosis and counteracts motor impairment in a murine model</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by chronic inflammatory demyelination involving complex interplay between the central nervous and immune systems. Neuroinflammation triggers cellular reorganization requiring L-serine for sustained syntheses of membrane lipids and nucleic acids, whereas it causes aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission involving D-serine. However, significance of serine metabolism in MS pathology remains unexplored. Here we show that serine chiral homeostasis is disrupted in MS and endogenous D-serine prevents motor deficits caused by inflammatory demyelination. We found in a large cohort study that patients with MS exhibit elevated D-serine levels and the D-/total serine ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid at diagnosis. Steric deviation toward D-serine accords with emergence of the intrathecal inflammatory marker oligoclonal bands, and correlates negatively with proinflammatory cytokines. An in vivo animal model of MS, genetically engineered to exhibit distinct metabolic states of D-serine, revealed that endogenous D-serine synthesis mitigates the progression of motor deficits and suppresses proinflammatory and vascular endothelial pathogenic signaling. Moreover, pre-symptomatic oral supplementation with D-serine, but not L-serine, enhances production of extracellular matrices, preserves integrity of the blood brain barrier, attenuates demyelination, and improves motor function. Contrary to the previously recognized neurotoxic nature of D-serine, our findings reveal an unrecognized significance of D-serine metabolism in MS and a protective function of D-serine against neuroinflammation involving disruption of the blood brain barrier, which may present an untapped therapeutic target in MS.

">Retinal image motion distracts visual motion memory even when generated by eye movement</a></h4>

              
                Interference between visual short-term memory (VSTM) and task-irrelevant sensory distractors is a well-documented phenomenon across a wide range of visual features, which is believed to stem from neural interactions between mnemonic and sensory processing. An overlooked question in the ongoing debate is whether this VSTM distraction is linked to the original sensory information or the ultimate perceptual experience. Here we addressed this issue by leveraging the perceptual invariance during ocular tracking of an object (i.e., smooth pursuit), where retinal image motion induced by smooth pursuit is encoded in early visual areas involved in motion processing, including the middle temporal (MT) and the medial superior temporal (MST) areas, but is perceptually suppressed. Our results showed that retinal image motion during the VSTM maintenance (delay period) attracted the memorized motion speed, consistent with previous studies. Importantly, the impact was comparable whether the retinal image motion was due to physical displacement of objects in world coordinates or to apparent motion induced by smooth pursuit without actual motion in world coordinates. In fact, observers' responses in the VSTM task were partially predicted by retinal image motion during the delay period by a cross-condition classifier, where the distraction effect induced by the smooth pursuit-induced apparent motion was replicable using a classifier trained on data from the condition with the world-coordinate motion, and vice versa. These findings provide behavioral evidence that sensory inputs can distract VSTM without conscious perception and also suggest that the VSTM system shares neural substrates with sensory processing, but not with perception.

">Decoding hypnotic consciousness: neural and experiential insights into induced and ideomotor suggestions</a></h4>

              
                Hypnotic induction and ideomotor suggestions provide a powerful framework to investigate how verbal influence dynamically reshapes conscious experience, cognition, and motor control. We employed a multimodal approach combining high-density EEG, respiratory and behavioral monitoring, and first-person reports across three conditions: baseline resting state, progressive hypnotic induction (Light and Deep phases), and an ideomotor challenge comparing a hypnotically suggested arm catalepsy to a voluntary simulation. EEG results revealed that light hypnosis was associated with early parieto-occipital alpha suppression and increased theta-band activity. As hypnosis deepened, frontoparietal connectivity increased while parasympathetic activation declined, challenging the view of hypnosis as a passive, low-arousal state and instead pointing to active top-down reorganization of large-scale brain networks. During the ideomotor phase, participants exhibited distinct patterns of behavioral responsiveness, classified as tremblers and non-tremblers, despite reporting comparable disruptions in the sense of agency; phenomenological analyses corroborated these distinctions by uncovering divergent experiential strategies. Tremblers showed increased frontoparietal gamma activity and reduced delta connectivity, suggesting heightened sensorimotor integration and greater executive monitoring under motor conflict. Together, these findings show that hypnosis engages dynamic top-down processes that reconfigure both neural connectivity and subjective experience, supporting predictive coding accounts of agency disruption and highlighting the value of neurophenomenological methods for advancing consciousness science and informing clinical applications.

">Psilocybin-induced modulation of visual salience processing</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelic compounds significantly reshape conscious perception, yet the implications of these alterations for complex visual-guided behaviors remain poorly understood. We investigated how psilocybin modulates visual salience processing during natural scene perception. Twenty-three participants completed eye-tracking tasks under self-blinded low and high doses of psilocybin, in a naturalistic design with experimental conditions unknown to participants and researchers. Subjects viewed natural scenes while their gaze patterns were recorded and analyzed in relation to normative computational saliency maps generated using a deep learning model of visual attention. Results revealed increased fixation on salient image regions and reduced inter-fixation distance under the high-dose condition, suggesting heightened sensitivity to visual salience and more localized gaze behavior. The Shannon entropy of fixations on high-saliency regions indicated a more exploratory and less predictable visual scanning of the images. Complementary EEG recordings showed broadband spectral power reductions and increased Lempel-Ziv complexity, with delta power negatively correlating with salience metrics. These findings suggest psilocybin enhances bottom-up attentional control while weakening top-down modulation, consistent with theoretical models positing facilitated bottom-up information flow under the acute effect of psychedelics.

">Neural Mechanisms Supporting Proactive Control</a></h4>

              
                Recent prior work suggests a preferential relationship between working memory capacity (WMC) and proactive control, yet the neural mechanisms that support this relationship are still not well understood. We directly addressed this question by leveraging the Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC) project, as it employed a fMRI neuroimaging design optimized to test for individual differences (sample N > 100), with task variants that independently assessed proactive and reactive control relative to baseline conditions. Behavioral analyses replicated prior work with the AX-CPT paradigm, in which a measure of target preparation based on contextual cues (the A-cue Bias index) was both reliably increased under task conditions encouraging proactive control and positively associated with WMC. Analyses of fMRI activity indicated that A-cue Bias was selectively linked to increased cue-related neural activity in left motor cortex (lMOT). Additionally, WMC was associated with increased cue-related activation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), even when statistically controlling for baseline and reactive conditions. The relationship between these two effects was supported by a latent path analysis, which suggested that the rDLPFC-lMOT circuit preferentially mediates the WMC-A-cue Bias relationship present under proactive task conditions. The results suggest this neural circuit may translate strategic task goals into active response preparation as a mechanism of proactive control. Individuals high in WMC may be better able to implement proactive task strategies when instructed via contextual cues. The sensitivity of the rDLPFC-lMOT circuit to individual differences suggest it as a potential target for cognitive enhancement.

">Synaptic dynamics govern spatial integration in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in primary visual cortex are often suppressed by stimuli extending beyond their receptive fields. This surround suppression is proposed to reduce the redundancy of encoding large stimuli and support scene segmentation. We find that surround suppression decreases firing rates in mouse primary visual cortex by accelerating the decay of visually-evoked responses and reducing response duration. The rapid decay of visual responses at large sizes is enhanced by increased contrast, reduced by locomotion, and invariant to stimulus orientation, consistent with the engagement of a network mechanism. While fast-spiking interneurons have faster dynamics relative to neighboring pyramidal cells, the dynamics of somatostatin-expressing interneurons are delayed. At the subthreshold level, the rapid decay of visual responses with increasing size is due to a delayed removal of both synaptic excitation and inhibition below baseline levels following visual input. We propose that the delayed activation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons drives a network-wide suppression and accelerates the decay of the visual response. Thus, these data identify a key role for synaptic network dynamics in regulating both spatial and temporal integration in mouse visual cortex.

">Hippocampal reactivation of planned trajectories is required for effective goal choice in an allocentric memory task</a></h4>

              
                Abstract It still remains unclear how the brain replays stored neural information, and whether such replay merely reflects past experiences or also plans of future endeavours. Hippocampal activity provides a representation of the world around us and our movement and navigation within that world, but it is not known if and to what extent the chosen navigational reference frame can influence hippocampal representations during memory-based tasks, including those focused on future activity. Here, we develop and employ two naturalistic, carefully controlled variants of the everyday memory task to model the use of egocentric and allocentric coordinates in the same arena. By recording hippocampal neural activity through miniature microscopes in rats performing each of the two tasks, we uncover differences in the representation of space, and in the features of memory-based action planning. By also deploying optogenetic inactivation during navigational decision making, we find that hippocampal representations observed during the planning phase are necessary for solving the allocentric, but not the egocentric version of the task. Overall, our findings reveal a functional link between non-local hippocampal representations and allocentric navigation.

">Profiling metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 expression in Rett syndrome: consequences for pharmacotherapy</a></h4>

              
                We have reported that levels of metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) are dramatically decreased in brain samples from Rett syndrome patients carrying truncation mutations in the Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Additionally, we identified decreases in mGlu7 levels in Mecp2+/- female mice and demonstrated that administration of a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) with activity at mGlu7 corrected deficits in cognitive, social, and respiratory domains. Here, we expanded our studies to a larger cohort of RTT samples covering a range of mutations and evaluated expression of the three widely expressed group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4,7 and 8). We found significant decreases in mGlu7, but not mGlu4 or mGlu8, mRNA expression across this larger cohort; additionally, we identified a previously unknown and robust correlation in the expression of mGlu4 and mGlu8 in control individuals. Stratification of RTT patients into individuals with mutations that are clinically correlated with severe versus mild disease revealed statistically significant decreases in mGlu7 expression only in patients with mutations that induce more severe symptoms. We then administered the PAM VU0422288 to mice modeling the mild R306C mutation (Mecp2R306C/+) and found a significant reduction in apneas induced by VU0422888 administration despite no decreases in mGlu7 expression in the brainstem or cortex. These results provide the first evidence of potentially broad utility for mGlu7 PAMs in reducing apneas in RTT patients.

">BetaII-Spectrin Gaps and Patches Emerge from the Patterned Assembly of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane Skeleton in Human Motor Neuron Axons</a></h4>

              
                The membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), composed of F-actin and spectrin, is a cytoskeletal structure that supports axonal integrity and organization. Using high-resolution imaging, we characterized the spatial distribution and assembly dynamics of {beta}II-spectrin in human motor neuron (MN) axons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered a striking gap-and-patch pattern in the medial axon, where sharply demarcated {beta}II-spectrin gaps alternate with patches containing a well-organized MPS. These gaps lack periodic F-actin and II-spectrin and do not reflect axonal degeneration or spectrin cleavage. The pattern increases with culture time and is acutely induced by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization prevents patch formation, indicating a requirement for actin nucleation in MPS assembly. Our data supports a model in which spectrin incorporation into nascent MPS patches depletes neighboring regions, producing periodic interruptions. This study provides the first detailed nanoscale analysis of MPS organization in human MNs, offering new insights into cytoskeletal remodeling in axons and its potential relevance to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Key words: iPSCs, MPS, actin, spectrin, cytoskeleton, motor neurons, staurosporine.

">Predicting cochlear synaptopathy in mice with varying degrees of outer hair cell dysfunction using auditory evoked potentials</a></h4>

              
                Human temporal bones suggest a steady decline of cochlear synapses with age and greater synapse loss in adults with a history of military or occupational noise exposure. However, there is currently no validated method of diagnosing this type of cochlear deafferentation in living humans. Animal models indicate that cochlear synaptopathy is associated with reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave 1 amplitude and envelope following response (EFR) magnitude for a sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tone. However, translating the SAM EFR to humans is complicated because it is difficult to obtain this measurement in humans using the same modulation frequency that showed the strongest relationship with synaptopathy in mice (1000 Hz). Computational modeling suggests that EFR magnitude measured with a rectangular amplitude modulated (RAM) tone may be a more sensitive measure of synaptopathy than the SAM EFR. In addition, because synaptopathy likely co-occurs with outer hair cell dysfunction, a diagnostic assay for synaptopathy needs to be robust even when auditory thresholds are abnormal. This study compared the relative ability of the ABR, SAM EFR, and RAM EFR to predict synapse numbers in mice with a large range of auditory thresholds and degrees of synaptopathy. The results indicate that the RAM EFR modulated at 1000 Hz is the single best predictor of synapse number when there is a broad loss of synapses across frequency, while combining RAM EFR and ABR further improves synapse prediction. In contrast, focal synaptopathy is best predicted by ABR wave 1 amplitude.

">Brain-derived synaptic vesicles have an intrinsic ability to sequester tubulin</a></h4>

              
                The presence and function of microtubules within the synaptic bouton has long been under investigation. In recent years evidence has accumulated that connects the synaptic vesicle cluster to the local dynamics of microtubule ends. Nonetheless, one question remains open, namely whether the vesicles influence the availability of tubulin within the synaptic compartment. An analysis of previously published live imaging experiments indicates that tubulin is strongly enriched in the synaptic vesicle cluster. To analyze the vesicle-tubulin interaction directly, we isolated vesicles from the mouse brain and imaged them together with fluorescent tubulin in vitro. We found that soluble tubulin is collected by synaptic vesicles in physiological buffers, resulting in the formation of tubulin-rich regions (TRRs) on the respective vesicle clusters. We conclude that the synaptic vesicle cluster is indeed able to recruit soluble tubulin.

">Atlas-independent brain connectome analysis at voxel-level granularity: graph convolutional networks for etiology classification in newborns</a></h4>

              
                Early identification of altered brain networks in neonates at risk for neurodevelopmental impairments is critical for timely intervention and improving outcomes. This study explores the potential of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) applied to structural brain connectomes at the voxel level granularity to classify neonatal connectomes by their underlying etiology: 51 children with congenital heart disease (CHD), 100 children born very preterm (PB), and 43 children with spina bifida aperta (SBA). Leveraging the flexibility of voxel-level parcellation, we captured fine-grained connectomic differences that improved classification performance (F1 = 0.78) compared to both atlas-based methods (F1 = 0.62) and a multilayer perceptron baseline model (F1 = 0.69). This approach enables subject-specific parcellation without the need for predefined anatomical templates, facilitating the analysis of diverse brain morphologies and age ranges. Attribution analysis using integrated gradients provided interpretable insights into etiology-specific connectomic patterns, highlighting regions of potential neurodevelopmental importance, such as the Rolandic operculum, inferior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus. Lateralized attribution patterns in PB reflected known neurodevelopmental alterations, underscoring the value of interpretable graph learning for understanding etiology-specific connectomic features. This work represents an important step toward atlas-independent connectome analysis, offering a novel framework for studying diverse neonatal populations and advancing our understanding of early brain development.

">Spatially Organized IGF1 mTOR Signaling Controls Human Forebrain Progenitor Fate Through Coordinated Transcriptional and Translational Programs</a></h4>

              
                The specification and maintenance of human forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs) depend on both intrinsic gene networks and spatially localized niche signals, but the interplay between these cues remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify a spatially organized, paracrine IGF1 signaling architecture that regulates human FOXG1 positive NPCs through multilayered transcriptional and translational control. Using a pluripotent stem cell derived forebrain model, we show that FOXG1 positive NPCs express IGF1 receptors but lack endogenous IGF1, instead depending on neighboring epithelial-like domains that secrete IGF1. IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation, clonal expansion, and vertical tissue growth by activating PI3K AKT mTOR and MEK ERK pathways. Ribosome profiling and 5-UTR reporter assays reveal that mTOR signaling selectively enhances translation of neurodevelopmental and biosynthetic transcripts including GSX1, a ventral fate determinant implicated in interneuron specification and autism. These findings uncover a human-specific regulatory mechanism in which spatially restricted IGF1 mTOR signaling integrates niche signals with translational output to support progenitor identity, biosynthetic capacity, and developmental resilience.

                Studying dopamine signaling in non-model organisms is crucial for understanding the broad range of behaviors not represented in traditional model systems. However, exploring new species is often hindered by a scarcity of tools suitable for non-genetic models. In this work, we introduce near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to investigate dopamine dynamics in meadow voles, a rodent species that exhibits distinct changes in social behavior and neurobiology across photoperiods. We observe increased dopamine release and release site density in social voles under short photoperiods, suggesting adaptations linked to environmental changes. Moreover, pharmacological and extracellular manipulations demonstrate that social voles exhibit heightened responsiveness to dopamine-increasing interventions and resilience against suppressive conditions. These findings highlight a significant association between dopamine signaling and photoperiod-driven changes in social behavior and establish nIRCats as an effective tool for expanding our understanding of dopamine dynamics across non-model organisms.

                This study examines how multi-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) relate to cognitive and behavioral functions in adolescents, focusing on attention/vigilance, working memory, and behavioral regulation. Leveraging the NeuroMark 2.2 multi-scale ICN template obtained from over 100,000 subjects, we obtained multi-scale ICNs from baseline resting-state fMRI data from the ABCD Study. For this study, we are interested in "the fronto- thalamo-cerebellar (FTC) circuitry" and choose the subdomains of Neuromark 2.2 that cover it: Cerebellar (CB), Subcortical - Extended Thalamic (SC-ET), Higher Cognition - Insular Temporal (HC-IT), and Higher Cognition - Frontal (HC-FR), previously identified as relevant to cognitive and behavioral functions. Employing a multivariate approach combining principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we examined associations between these multi-scale ICNs and cognitive-behavioral outcomes. Our findings revealed significant associations, particularly for one of the estimated canonical components, linking multi-scale ICNs to cognitive and behavioral measures across both discovery and replication sets. This connectivity pattern may serve as a potential marker for attention, working memory, and behavioral regulation, offering new insights into a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

">Resting state periodic and aperiodic brain oscillations from birth to preschool years: Aperiodic maturity predicts developmental course</a></h4>

              
                The non-invasive assessment of resting-state (RS) neural activity via electrophysiology provides information on brain function and brain health. Our understanding of RS neural activity in older children and adults is limited by our poor understanding of the maturation of RS activity (oscillatory and non-oscillatory) from infancy to preschool ages. The present study used MEG with source imaging and an adapted Dark Room eyes-open task to assess oscillatory and non-oscillatory RS activity. 107 typically developing children 2 to 68 months were enrolled. For the Dark-Room eyes-open task, each child alternated between viewing an Inscapes video without audio for 20s and then resting with their eyes open for 30s in total darkness. This was repeated for 6 cycles. Whole-brain RS activity maps were computed using Minimum Norm Estimates, with RS power spectra divided into estimates of periodic measures (dominant frequency and power) and aperiodic measures (the exponent - slope of the 1/f function; the offset - vertical displacement of the 1/f function). An infant dominant peak was observed more often in the Dark-Room (94% of children) than in the Video-On condition (83% of children). The Dark-Room condition elicited a 36% increase in dominant oscillation activity than the Video-On condition. The maturation of the parietal-occipital periodic dominant frequency increased non-linearly as a function of age. The maturation of aperiodic measures decreased nonlinearly as a function of age, with aperiodic measures as well as their maturation rate differing across the brain. Finally, more mature aperiodic values predicted better adaptive behaviors and daily living skills. Present findings demonstrate that (1) the use of an appropriate Dark-Room eyes-open task provides measures of young child RS periodic activity with excellent SNR, (2) an understanding of the development of infant RS activity is best achieved via obtaining measures in brain source space in order to detect regional differences in aperiodic activity, and (3) a more mature aperiodic value predicts higher developmental behavior scores.

It has been shown that structural changes occur in the brain due to late-onset blindness, including cortical thinning in visual cortical regions. Following vision restoration, it is not yet known whether visual regions are reinvigorated and regain a normal cortical thickness or retain the diminished thickness from blindness.We evaluated the cortical thicknesses of 10 Argus II participants, 10 blind participants, and 13 sighted participants. The Argus II patients on average had a thicker left cuneus cortex and lateral occipital cortex relative to the blind patients. The duration of the Argus II use significantly partially correlated with thicker visual cortical regions in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, in the 2 case studies (scanned before and after implantation), the patient with longer device use (44.5 months) had an increase in the cortical thickness of visual regions, whereas the shorter-using patient did not (6.5 months).Overall, the Argus II participants’ cortical thickness was on average significantly rejuvenated in 2 higher visual regions, and participants using the implant for a longer duration had thicker visual regions. This research raises the possibility of structural plasticity reversing visual cortical atrophy in vision restoration participants.</span>

Working memory—the capacity to hold a limited amount of information online for a short period—has a central role in cognition, and this ability is also impaired in older individuals. Here, we investigated the relationship between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sup>+</sup>) levels and a composite measure of glutamate/glutamine (Glx) in the hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and how these neurochemical markers relate to working memory in younger and older adults. Across age groups, we found a significant positive association between working memory accuracy and Glx in the IFG, as well as a significant negative association between GABA<sup>+</sup> in this region and proactive interference. Age-stratified analyses demonstrated significant positive associations between components of working memory and hippocampal/IFG Glx, as well as a significant negative association between IFG GABA<sup>+</sup> and proactive interference in older adults only. These results provide novel evidence for a specific involvement of excitatory Glx and working memory accuracy as well as inhibitory GABA<sup>+</sup> for control of proactive interference in working memory, and how these effects are differentially affected by age.</span>

">Sleep stage-specific effects of 0.75 Hz phase-synchronized rTMS and tACS on delta frequency activity during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Slow oscillatory activity during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep plays a crucial role in both physical health and cognitive functions. Enhancing slow oscillatory activity during sleep has the potential to benefit these domains, yet an optimal stimulation protocol has not been established. This study aimed to investigate whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), synchronized with the trough phase of 0.75 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can modulate EEG activity in the delta frequency range during sleep and enhance cognitive functions. Healthy adults participated in a within-subject, counterbalanced study design comparing real and sham stimulation conditions. Combined rTMS and tACS was applied over the bilateral prefrontal cortex before sleep. We evaluated (1) power spectral density and functional connectivity within the delta frequency range during resting state and sleep, (2) retention of declarative memory learned before sleep, and (3) sleep parameters including spindle activity, sleep stage ratios, sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency. The combined rTMS and tACS protocol significantly increased delta oscillatory activity during the N3 sleep stage compared to sham. Functional connectivity, as measured by global efficiency, was enhanced during the N2 sleep stage. However, the stimulation did not improve declarative memory retention, spindle activity or other sleep parameters. These findings demonstrate the potential of combined rTMS and tACS as a non-invasive method to enhance delta oscillatory activity during sleep. While the stimulation did not improve memory performance, its ability to modulate delta activity during sleep suggests potential clinical applications for addressing pathological alterations in slow wave activity during sleep.

">Lifestyle, Early-life, and Genetic Health Risk Factors Underlying the Brain Age Gap: A Mega-Analysis Across 3,934 Individuals from the ENIGMA MDD Consortium</a></h4>

              
                Background: Large-scale studies show that adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) generally have a higher imaging-predicted age relative to their chronological age (i.e., positive brain age gap) compared to controls, though considerable within-group variation exists. This study examines lifestyle, early-life, and genetic health risk factors contributing to the brain age gap. Identifying risk and resilience factors could help protect brain and mental health. Methods: Using an established model trained on FreeSurfer-derived brain regions (www.photon-ai.com/enigma_brainage), we generated brain age predictions for 1,846 controls and 2,088 individuals with MDD (aged 18-75) from 12 international cohorts. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for major depression, C-reactive protein, and body mass index (BMI) using large-scale GWAS results. Linear mixed models were applied to assess lifestyle (BMI, smoking, education), early-life childhood trauma, and genetic (PRS) health risk associations with the brain age gap. Additionally, we evaluated the link between the brain age gap and peripheral biological age indicators (epigenetic clocks). Results: Higher brain age gaps were significantly associated with BMI ({beta}=0.01, PFDR=0.02) and smoking ({beta}=0.11, PFDR=0.02), while lower brain age gaps were linked to higher education ({beta}=-0.02, PFDR=0.02). Higher childhood trauma scores predicted a higher brain age gap ({beta}=0.04, P=0.01). Higher brain age gaps were positively associated with all PRS ({beta}s=0.04-0.16, PsFDR=0.02-0.03). There were no significant interactions between diagnosis and assessed factors on the brain age gap. In a multivariable model, only modifiable health factors (BMI, smoking, and education) remained uniquely associated with brain age gaps. Conclusions: Genetic liability for depression and related traits is linked to poorer brain health, but health behaviors potentially offer a key opportunity for intervention. This study underscores the importance of targeting modifiable lifestyle factors to mitigate poor brain health in depressed individuals, an approach perhaps under-recognized in clinical practice.

Here, we describe the major effective connectivity between the hippocampal memory system and the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) semantic memory system in humans. Then, we present and model a theory of how semantic representations may be formed in the human ATL using slow associative learning in semantic attractor networks that receive inputs from the hippocampal episodic memory system. The hypothesis is that if one category of semantic representations is being processed for several seconds, then a slow short-term memory trace associative biologically plausible learning rule will enable all the components during that time to be associated together in a semantic attractor network. This benefits from the binding of components provided by the hippocampal episodic memory system. The theory is modeled in a four-layer network for view-invariant visual object recognition, followed by a semantic attractor network layer that utilizes a temporal trace associative learning rule to form semantic categories based on the inputs that occur close together in time, using inputs from the hippocampal system or from the world.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Key questions for understanding hippocampal function in memory and navigation in humans are the type and source of visual information that reaches the human hippocampus. We measured bidirectional pairwise effective connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging between 360 cortical regions while 956 Human Connectome Project participants viewed scenes, faces, tools, or body parts. We developed a method using deterministic dynamical graphs to define whole cortical networks and the flow in both directions between their cortical regions over timesteps after signal is applied to V1. We revealed that a ventromedial cortical visual “Where” network from V1 via the retrosplenial and medial parahippocampal scene areas reaches the hippocampus when scenes are viewed. A ventrolateral “What” visual cortical network reaches the hippocampus from V1 via V2–V4, the fusiform face cortex, and lateral parahippocampal region TF when faces/objects are viewed. There are major implications for understanding the computations of the human vs rodent hippocampus in memory and navigation: primates with their fovea and highly developed cortical visual processing networks process information about the location of faces, objects, and landmarks in viewed scenes, whereas in rodents the representations in the hippocampal system are mainly about the place where the individual is located and self-motion between places.</span>

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

                Background Shaken Baby Syndrome describes serious cranial trauma inflicted upon infants and young children, potentially leading to significant injury or death. This study aims to evaluate parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding Shaken Baby Syndrome in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Al-Ahsa, focusing on all reachable parents of young children by using convenience sampling from June 2024 to August 2024, and data was collected using a pre-structured questionnaire. Results A total of 572 eligible parents participated, with ages ranging from 20 to over 40 years. The predominant gender of responders was female, comprising 433 (75.7%). A significant proportion of participants 432 (75.5%) displayed poor overall knowledge of Shaken Baby Syndrome, whereas 140 (24.5%) indicated competent knowledge and awareness. Female gender and parents with multiple children had a significant correlation with parents' understanding of Shaken Baby Syndrome (P< 0.05). Conclusion The study indicated that only around one-quarter of parents demonstrated a competent comprehension of Shaken Baby Syndrome, with mothers exhibiting more awareness. Consequently, health authorities must increase efforts to enhance public awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome.

                The WWC1 (KIBRA) gene has been repeatedly implicated in cognitive performance, with carriers of the favorable allele showing enhanced episodic memory, spatial ability, and achievements in chess and STEM fields. However, gene-level associations do not reveal the underlying biological mechanisms. Here, we applied a modern proteomic assay coupled with an AI-based protein complex quantification method to elucidate the protein interaction phenotype involving WWC1 in a Scottish cohort (Viking Genes; N = 200). Although the bulk plasma level of WWC1 was not significantly associated with cognitive g factor, several WWC1-containing protein complexes, including the DDR1-WWC1 and the DDR1-PRKCZ-WWC1 complex scores, demonstrated significant associations with cognitive performance. In particular, one standard deviation increase in the normalized DDR1-WWC1 complex score corresponded to about 14% decrease in cognitive g factor (P = 0.024), even with educational attainment adjusted. These findings validate previous genetic studies and highlight the importance of protein-protein interactions in mediating the cognitive effects of WWC1.

                <p>by Jan Babič, Tjasa Kunavar, Erhan Oztop, Mitsuo Kawato</p>

Our study explores how ecological aspects of motor learning enhance survival by improving movement efficiency and mitigating injury risks during task failures. Traditional motor control theories mainly address isolated body movements and often overlook these ecological factors. We introduce a novel computational motor control approach, incorporating ecological fitness and a strategy that alternates between success-driven movement efficiency and failure-driven safety, akin to win-stay/lose-shift tactics. In our experiments, participants performed squat-to-stand movements under novel force perturbations. They adapted effectively through various adaptive motor control mechanisms to avoid falls, reducing failure rates rapidly. The results indicate a high-level ecological controller in human motor learning that switches objectives between safety and movement efficiency, depending on failure or success. This approach is supported by policy learning, internal model adaptation, and adaptive feedback control. Our findings offer a comprehensive perspective on human motor control, integrating risk management in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for real-world environments.

                <p>by Debby D. Wang, Yuting Huang</p>

With a burgeoning number of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in various fields, biomolecular science has also given a big welcome to advanced AI techniques in recent years. In this broad field, scoring a protein-ligand binding structure to output the binding strength is a crucial problem that heavily relates to computational drug discovery. Aiming at this problem, we have proposed an efficient scoring framework using deep learning techniques. This framework describes a binding structure by a high-resolution atomic graph, places a focus on the inter-molecular interactions and learns the graph in a rational way. For a protein-ligand binding complex, the generated atomic graph reserves key information of the atoms (as graph nodes), and focuses on inter-molecular interactions (as graph edges) that can be identified by introducing multiple distance ranges to the atom pairs within the binding area. To provide more confidence in the predicted binding strengths, we have interpreted the deep learning model from the model level and in a post-hoc analysis. The proposed learning framework has been demonstrated to have competitive performances in scoring and screening tasks, which will prospectively promote the development of related fields further.

                <p>by Xiaoxiao Cheng, Shixian Shen, Ekaterina Ivanova, Gerolamo Carboni, Atsushi Takagi, Etienne Burdet</p>

Humans activate muscles to shape the mechanical interaction with their environment, but can they harness this control mechanism to best sense the environment? We investigated how participants adapt their muscle activation to visual and haptic information when tracking a randomly moving target with a robotic interface. The results exhibit a differentiated effect of these sensory modalities, where participants’ muscle coactivation increases with the haptic noise and decreases with the visual noise, in apparent contradiction to previous results. These results can be explained when considering muscle spring-like mechanics, where stiffness increases with coactivation to regulate motion guidance. Increasing coactivation to more closely follow the motion plan favors accurate visual over haptic information, while decreasing it filters visual noise and relies more on accurate haptic information. We formulated this active sensing mechanism as the optimization of visuo-haptic information and effort. This optimal information and effort (OIE) model can explain the adaptation of muscle activity to unimodal and multimodal sensory information when interacting with fixed or dynamic environments, or with another human, and can be used to optimize human-robot interaction.

                <p>by Elvis A. F. Martis, Stéphane Téletchéa</p>

Molecular docking is a useful method for predicting the binding affinity and conformation of small chemical entities to support lead optimisation. It is also used to virtually screen a large chemical database to find new chemical entities. There are several docking programs available with different algorithms and varying preparation steps. We identify ten quick tips that apply to molecular docking irrespective of the program one might choose. Our objective is to provide the beginners with important things to keep in mind while using molecular docking for their research. We aim to ensure that experts and beginners can perform molecular docking to yield biologically relevant and reproducible results.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012285">Parallel synapses with transmission nonlinearities enhance neuronal classification capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuru Song, Marcus K. Benna</p>

Cortical neurons often establish multiple synaptic contacts with the same postsynaptic neuron. To avoid functional redundancy of these parallel synapses, it is crucial that each synapse exhibits distinct computational properties. Here we model the current to the soma contributed by each synapse as a sigmoidal transmission function of its presynaptic input, with learnable parameters such as amplitude, slope, and threshold. We evaluate the classification capacity of a neuron equipped with such nonlinear parallel synapses, and show that with a small number of parallel synapses per axon, it substantially exceeds that of the Perceptron. Furthermore, the number of correctly classified data points can increase superlinearly as the number of presynaptic axons grows.
When training with an unrestricted number of parallel synapses, our model neuron can effectively implement an arbitrary aggregate transmission function for each axon, constrained only by monotonicity. Nevertheless, successful learning in the model neuron often requires only a small number of parallel synapses.
We also apply these parallel synapses in a feedforward neural network trained to classify MNIST images, and show that they can increase the test accuracy. This demonstrates that multiple nonlinear synapses per input axon can substantially enhance a neuron’s computational power.

AI-ready health datasets can be exploited to generate many research articles with potentially limited scientific value. A study in PLOS Biology highlights this problem, by describing a recent, sudden explosion in papers analyzing the NHANES health dataset.

A new study by Suchak et al. describes a sudden, recent explosion in papers analyzing the NHANES health dataset, where similar manuscripts have been described as overwhelming processes at some journals. In this accompanying Primer article, we summarize the study's findings and recommendations. We outline practical steps that publishers, journals, peer reviewers and readers can take to better recognize similarly formulaic, low-value submissions and publications to reduce their research impacts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-173/v2?src=rss">An integrated data pipeline for semantic data representation of the flame spray pyrolysis process [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Ongoing digitalization and data-driven developments in materials science and engineering (MSE) emphasize the growing importance of reusing research data and enabling machine accessibility, which requires robust data management and consistent semantic data representation. Ontologies have emerged as powerful tools for establishing interoperable and reusable data structures from inconsistent data structures. Despite advancements in semantic data representation for specific applications, integrating application ontologies with primary data repositories, such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), to feed world data remains an open task. As a use case in the MSE domain, this work presents a system based on semantic technologies from the point of view of engineers, developed with the help of information scientists, and unraveled on a small scale. The development of an application ontology (AO) was elaborated for flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) processes with the implementation of a data pipeline. The proposed FSP application ontology emerges from experimental in-house best-practice procedures and is adapted to the mid-level Project Material Digital core ontology (PMDco) to allow interoperability within the MSE domain. The pipeline retrieves manually acquired experimental data from an ELN, translates it into a machine-actionable format, and converts it into a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format to support semantic interoperability. The latter was stored in a triple store with a SPARQL interface, enabling findable and accessible datasets that are searchable and traceable. By creating semantically linked data structures in line with FAIR principles, this approach allows traceable and findable experimental results between stakeholders through both human-readable and machine-actionable formats. Seamless integration of the modular microservices of the data pipeline within established lab practices minimizes disruption while maintaining the software framework. The present work demonstrates the practical implementation of a FAIR data pipeline within a laboratory setting, paving the way for future data-centric science.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-482/v1?src=rss">The perceived barriers to data sharing in health and life sciences: a survey at the University of Bristol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sharing research data is critical for study validation and reuse, yet challenges persist across disciplines, such as psychology1 and biomedical science2. While global initiatives promote open science, understanding localized barriers in specific academic contexts is vital to implementing effective solutions. Objective To investigate the main perceived barriers and reasons preventing data sharing within the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences (FHLS) at the University of Bristol, a research-intensive university in the UK. Methods We distributed a comprehensive survey to FHLS researchers, addressing logistical, technical, and cultural challenges. A total of 143 participants provided insights into their experiences with data sharing. Results The primary obstacles identified were time constraints and the complexity of the preparation process, with 34% reporting they “usually” or “always” lack sufficient time to adequately prepare their data for sharing. Additional barriers included not having the rights to share (27%), insufficient technical support (15%), and limited incentives within research teams. Moreover, qualitative responses highlighted a lack of confidence in data sharing infrastructure and guidance. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions to enhance data-sharing practices. Solutions should prioritize data preparation processes, clarify data ownership policies, and offer tailored training programs. Integrating data-sharing requirements into research workflows from the outset could significantly alleviate these challenges. Our study provides actionable recommendations to inform the development of resources and infrastructure that support a culture of open science within the FHLS at the University of Bristol.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1307/v2?src=rss">Terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in the second specialty programs of a dental school over seven years [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Terminal efficiency (TE), the proportion of students completing academic programs within the expected timeframe, is a critical metric for assessing postgraduate health education quality, yet it remains underexplored in Latin American dental specialties. Efficient training is vital for producing competent professionals to meet regional healthcare demands. This study aimed to determine the TE of Peruvian university students in second specialty dental programs at a Peruvian university from 2017 to 2023. Methods A longitudinal, cross-sectional analysis was conducted using 257 complete records from the university institutional repository. Inclusion criteria encompassed full documentation of admission, academic status, and graduation dates. TE was calculated as the time from document submission to graduation, categorized as ≤1 year or ≥2 years. Statistical analyses included Chi-square tests, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests, Poisson regression, and hierarchical multiple linear regression on log-transformed TE. Results: Mean TE was 0.93 years (SD=1.22), with 72.37% of students (n=186) completing within ≤1 year. Significant variations were observed by submission year (p=0.001) and specialty (p<0.001), with Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (0.30 years) outperforming Periodontics and Implantology (1.76 years). The submission year was the only significant predictor of mean TE (β=0.144, p<0.001). Conclusion Dental programs of a Peruvian university demonstrate robust TE, though specialty-specific and temporal disparities highlight areas for improvement. Targeted interventions, such as streamlined thesis processes and specialty-specific support, could enhance efficiency, informing educational policy in Latin America.
