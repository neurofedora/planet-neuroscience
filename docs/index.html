              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09765">Brian Intensify: An Adaptive Machine Learning Framework for Auditory EEG Stimulation and Cognitive Enhancement in FXS</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by disrupted cortical oscillatory activity, particularly in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09949">Imaging the Topology of Dynamic Brain Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional brain connectivity changes dynamically over time, making its representation challenging for learning on non-Euclidean data. We present a framework that encodes dynamic functional connectivity as an image representation of evolving network topology. Persistent graph homology summarizes global organization across scales, yielding Wasserstein distance-preserving embeddings stable under resolution changes. Stacking these embeddings forms a topological image that captures temporal reconfiguration of brain networks. This design enables convolutional architectures and transfer learning from pretrained foundational models to operate effectively under limited and imbalanced data. Applied to early Alzheimer's detection, the approach achieves clinically meaningful accuracy, establishing a principled foundation for imaging dynamic brain topology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10261">Representation learning in cerebellum-like structures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals use past experiences to adapt future behavior. To enable this rapid learning, vertebrates and invertebrates have evolved analogous neural structures like the vertebrate cerebellum or insect mushroom body. A defining feature of these circuits is a large expansion layer, which re-codes sensory inputs to improve pattern separation, a prerequisite to learn non-overlapping associations between relevant sensorimotor inputs and adaptive changes in behavior. However, classical models of associative learning treat expansion layers as static, assuming that associations are learned through plasticity at the output synapses. Here, we review emerging evidence that also highlights the importance of plasticity within the expansion layer for associative learning. Because the underlying plasticity mechanisms and principles of this representation learning are only emerging, we systematically compare experimental data from two well-studied circuits for expansion coding -- the cerebellum granule layer and the mushroom body calyx. The data indicate remarkably similar interneuron circuits, dendritic morphology and plasticity mechanisms between both systems that hint at more general principles for representation learning. Moreover, the data show strong overlap with recent theoretical advances that consider interneuron circuits and dendritic computations for representation learning. However, they also hint at an interesting interaction of stimulus-induced, non-associative and reinforced, associative mechanisms of plasticity that is not well understood in current theories of representation learning. Therefore, studying expansion layer plasticity will be important to elucidate the mechanisms and full potential of representation learning for behavioral adaptation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10184">Theoretical Analysis of Resource-Induced Phase Transitions in Estimation Strategies</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organisms adapt to volatile environments by integrating sensory information with internal memory, yet their information processing is constrained by resource limitations. Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04802">Shaping manifolds in equivariant recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.04802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recordings of increasingly large neural populations have revealed that the firing of individual neurons is highly coordinated. When viewed in the space of all possible patterns, the collective activity forms non-linear structures called neural manifolds. Because such structures are observed even at rest or during sleep, an important hypothesis is that activity manifolds may correspond to continuous attractors shaped by recurrent connectivity between neurons. Classical models of recurrent networks have shown that continuous attractors can be generated by specific symmetries in the connectivity. Although a variety of attractor network models have been studied, general principles linking network connectivity and the geometry of attractors remain to be formulated. Here, we address this question by using group representation theory to formalize the relationship between the symmetries in recurrent connectivity and the resulting fixed-point manifolds. We start by revisiting the classical ring model, a continuous attractor network generating a circular manifold. Interpreting its connectivity as a circular convolution, we draw a parallel with feed-forward CNNs. Building on principles of geometric deep learning, we then generalize this architecture to a broad range of symmetries using group representation theory. Specifically, we introduce a new class of equivariant RNNs, where the connectivity is based on group convolution. Using the group Fourier transform, we reduce such networks to low-rank models, giving us a low-dimensional description that can be fully analyzed to determine the symmetry, dimensionality and stability of fixed-point manifolds. Our results underline the importance of stability considerations: for a connectivity with a given symmetry, depending on parameters, several manifolds with different symmetry subgroups can coexist, some stable and others consisting of saddle points.

                arXiv:2511.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural solvers have demonstrated remarkable success in combinatorial optimization, often surpassing traditional heuristics in speed, solution quality, and generalization. However, their efficacy deteriorates significantly when confronted with complex constraints that cannot be effectively managed through simple masking mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce Universal Constrained Preference Optimization (UCPO), a novel plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates preference learning into existing neural solvers via a specially designed loss function, without requiring architectural modifications. UCPO embeds constraint satisfaction directly into a preference-based objective, eliminating the need for meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Leveraging a lightweight warm-start fine-tuning protocol, UCPO enables pre-trained models to consistently produce near-optimal, feasible solutions on challenging constraint-laden tasks, achieving exceptional performance with as little as 1\% of the original training budget.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10233">Bridging Synthetic and Real Routing Problems via LLM-Guided Instance Generation and Progressive Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

                arXiv:2304.11954v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative to artificial neural networks, due to their event-driven spiking computation. However, some foundation SNN backbones (including Spikformer and SEW ResNet) suffer from non-spike computations (integer-float multiplications) caused by the structure of their residual connections. These non-spike computations increase SNNs' power consumption and make them unsuitable for deployment on mainstream neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we analyze the spike-driven behavior of the residual connection methods in SNNs. We then present Spikingformer, a novel spiking transformer backbone that merges the MS Residual connection with Self-Attention in a biologically plausible way to address the non-spike computation challenge in Spikformer while maintaining global modeling capabilities. We evaluate Spikingformer across 13 datasets spanning large static images, neuromorphic data, and natural language tasks, and demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of Spikingformer, setting a vital benchmark for spiking neural networks. In addition, with the spike-driven features and global modeling capabilities, Spikingformer is expected to become a more efficient general-purpose SNN backbone towards energy-efficient artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2507.22787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.

Here, we show that with a simple modification, the PR task can be transformed into an optimization problem reminiscent of the patch-leaving foraging scenario, which has been analyzed extensively by behavioral ecologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. In the PR with reset (PRR) task, male and female rats performed the PR task on one lever but could press a second lever to reset the current ratio requirement back to its lowest value at the cost of enduring a reset delay, during which both levers were retracted. Rats used the reset lever adaptively on the PRR task, and their ratio reset decisions were sensitive to the cost of the reset delay. We derived an approach for computing the optimal bout length&mdash;the number of rewards to earn before pressing the reset lever that produces the greatest long-term rate of reward&mdash;and found that rats flexibly changed their behavior to approximate the optimal strategy. However, rats showed a systematic bias for bout lengths that exceeded the optimal length, an effect reminiscent of "overharvesting" in patch-leaving tasks. The PRR task thus represents a novel means of testing how rats adapt to the cost&ndash;benefit structure of the environment in a way that connects deeply to the broader literature on associative learning and optimal foraging theory.</p>

                <p>Imagine yourself in a car race waiting for the traffic light to go green. Impulsivity could push you to accelerate when the light is still red. In contrast, temporally guided anticipation could lead you to accelerate at the time the light goes green. Whether these two types of early responses rely on the same or different neural processes is an open question. This question was investigated using an oculomotor task where the delay between a warning and an imperative visual stimuli was predictable. The spatial uncertainty of the "go" signal was also varied. On average, 10% of experimental trials were associated with a response before the "go" signal ("early saccade"). After the offset of the warning stimulus, the latency distribution of early saccades was bimodal, with a first mode peaking after 200&nbsp;ms (1st mode saccades) and a second one starting to build-up after 375&nbsp;ms (2nd mode saccades). With increasing delay duration: the number of 1st mode responses decreased whereas the number of 2nd mode responses remained approximately constant; the latency and variance of 2nd mode saccades increased; the maximum velocity of 2nd mode responses decreased. In general, the amplitude of 2nd mode responses was larger. These results show that there are probably two independent processes taking place before an expected event: an unintentional release of inhibition evoking an impulsive 1st mode saccade and an anticipatory process leading to a 2nd mode saccade.</p>

                Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves summarising trends within a dataset to help uncover data quality issues and generate hypotheses. However, identifying relationships between multiple features often requires extensive coding, manual inspection and statistical modelling. Here, we introduce the ggEDA R package, which streamlines multidimensional data exploration by providing two turnkey and complementary visualisation strategies. ggEDA generates interactive parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) well suited for examining large datasets with mostly quantitative features, and introduces tiled one-dimensional plots that more effectively show missingness and reveal categorical relationships in smaller datasets. ggEDA reduces the amount of code and time required to detect multi-feature relationships that may otherwise require statistical modelling or thorough manual review to identify. To make ggEDA visualisations accessible to a wider audience we also developed interactiveEDA, a web app that enables non-programmers to explore and interpret data patterns interactively. ggEDA and interactiveEDA are available at https://github.com/CCICB/ggEDA and https://github.com/CCICB/interactiveEDA respectively.

                Background Antimicrobial drug resistance is of great concern today. Infections by the antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli, including enteropathogenic as well as enterotoxigenic strains have been reported as a major cause of deaths, especially among young children in low- and middle-income countries. This has been augmented by antimicrobial misuse, over the counter availability and poor sanitation especially in low income areas. This study aimed at characterizing antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli isolated from sanitation environments of the Majengo slum in Meru County, Kenya Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 61 samples from soil, water and drains swabs. These were tested against five antimicrobial drugs by the Kirby disk diffusion method. Results A total of 42 (69%) of the samples had Escherichia coli.These recorded antimicrobial drug susceptibility as follows: Out of the five antimicrobial agents used, ceftazidime 28 (66.67%) showed the highest sensitivity followed by ciprofloxacin 26 (61.90%) and imepenem 25 (59.52%) respectively. cefotaxime and cefoxitin showed least sensitivity at 14 (33.33%) and 13 (30.95%) respectively. In intermediate imepenem and ciprofloxacin were the highest with 12 (28.57%) followed by cefotaxime 10 (23.81%). The least intermediate was observed in ceftazidime and cefoxitin both at 7 (16.67%). The highest resistance was observed in cefoxitin 22 (52.38%), followed by cefotaxime at 18 (42.86%). Ciprofloxacin, imepenem and ceftazidime had the lowest resistance 4 (9.52%), 5 (11.91%) and 7 (16.67%) respectively. The p-value <0.05 was considered significant to the study. Conclusions This study showed that Escherichia coli isolated from Majengo is pathogenic and resistant to antibiotics. Detection of Escherichia coli poses a great risk in the spread of resistant strains in human. Proper sanitation and hygiene awareness practices should be provided through education to the residents of this area.

                Background Access to justice, enshrined as a fundamental human right in international conventions, includes the right to a fair trial and to just compensation. This dimension of justice is particularly crucial in contexts of armed conflict, where victims of military aggression require effective reparation mechanisms. Historically, both judicial and quasi-judicial bodies have been created to address mass claims, from restitution in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Kuwait to processes in post-authoritarian or post-communist states. Such mechanisms highlight the need for specialised institutions, as ordinary courts are often unable to manage the volume and complexity of conflict-related claims. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, reparations have become central to legal and political debate. Methods This study employed an empirical approach, combining systematic data collection with comparative legal analysis. Sources included UN and Council of Europe acts, reports by international organisations (CoE, OSCE), NGO publications, and scholarly works. Three compensation models were examined in depth: the UN Compensation Commission, Kosovo property claims mechanisms, and Bosnia’s Commission for Real Property Claims. These were selected for their effectiveness, European relevance, and addressed harms. Comparative analysis evaluated their procedures, accessibility, and recognition of harm, contrasted with Ukraine’s emerging compensation mechanism. Results The study highlights lessons from the UNCC, Kosovo, and Bosnia, focusing on mandates, procedures, accessibility, and types of harm recognised. It identifies best practices and challenges, offering comparative insights for designing Ukraine’s future compensation system. Conclusions International commissions share key features: defined jurisdiction, politically sensitive and lengthy processes, and reliance on transparent procedures to ensure legitimacy. For Ukraine, enabling direct individual claims is essential to uphold the right to reparation. Yet enforcement challenges and risks of duplicative proceedings remain. Adapting global experience to Ukraine’s context is crucial for developing an effective and trusted compensation mechanism.

                Background HER2-positive breast carcinomas are a heterogeneous group with various clinicopathological characteristics depending on hormone receptor (HR) status. This study aimed to analyze and compare the clinical and histopathological features of HER2-positive breast carcinomas across three subgroups: Group 1: Triple-positive (ER+/PR+/HER2+), Group 2:ER-positive only (ER+/PR-/HER2+), and Group 3: HER2-enriched (ER-/PR-/HER2+). Methods This was a single-institution, retrospective, cross-sectional study conducted over 42 months (January 2021–June 2024) at a tertiary care center comprising of 117 HER2-positive breast carcinoma cases. The demographic, clinical, and histopathological parameters were studied retrospectively. Statistical analysis was performed via SPSS Version 29.0, employing ANOVA and chi-square tests, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results Among 117 HER2-positive breast cancer patients, left and right breast involvement was nearly equal. Most were diagnosed via core biopsy (83.8%), with the upper outer quadrant most commonly affected (42.9%). Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type was the predominant subtype. The HER2-enriched group (Group 3) had the highest mean age (57.28 years; p = 0.001) and the most Grade 3 tumors (36.1%; p = 0.005). Although Group 2 (ER-positive) had the largest mean tumor size (4.31 cm), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.143). Lymphovascular invasion, necrosis, Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and skin involvement showed no significant differences across groups. ANOVA showed significant variation in age and grade, and post-hoc analysis confirmed that Group 1 vs Group 3 differed significantly in both age (p = 0.001) and grade (p = 0.004). Conclusion HER2-positive breast carcinomas show variability by HR status. The HER2-enriched subtype is associated with older age, higher histological grade, and advanced nodal stage, suggesting a more aggressive phenotype. Recognizing these patterns aids in accurate prognostication and guiding individualized therapy.

                <p>by Sankarasubramanian Jagadesan, Chittibabu Guda</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized biological research by enabling a through exploration of cellular heterogeneity. However, the complexity of data processing pipelines and the need for programming expertise create barriers for many biologists to explore scRNA-seq data. To address this, we developed Single-cell RNA Data Analysis and Visualization (ScRDAVis), an interactive, browser-based R Shiny application tailored for biologists with no programming expertise. ScRDAVis integrates widely used analysis packages, such as <i>Seurat</i>, <i>CellChat</i>, <i>Monocle3</i>, <i>clusterProfiler</i> and <i>hdWGCNA</i> to provide a user-friendly interface for single-cell data analysis. The application supports single-sample, multiple-sample and group-based analyses, along with features such as marker discovery, cell type annotation, subclustering analysis, and advanced functional studies. Key functionalities include cell-cell communication analysis, trajectory and pseudotime inference, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and transcription factor (TF) regulatory network analysis. ScRDAVis stands out as the first GUI-based platform offering hdWGCNA for co-expression network and TF regulatory network analysis using scRNA-seq data. ScRDAVis provides publication-ready visualizations with data download options in different formats empowering researchers to extract meaningful biological insights and democratizing the analytical capabilities required to comprehensively analyze scRNA-seq studies. ScRDAVis can be freely downloaded from GitHub at https://github.com/GudaLab/ScRDAVis or accessed from any browser at https://www.gudalab-rtools.net/ScRDAVis.

                <p>by Tianjiao Zhang, Haibin Zhu</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deciphers cell type-specific co-expression networks to resolve biological functions but remains constrained by data sparsity and compositional biases. Conventional metacells construction strategies mitigate sparsity by aggregating transcriptionally similar cells but often neglect systematic biases introduced by compositional data. This problem leads to spurious co-expression correlations and obscuring biologically meaningful interactions. Through mathematical modeling and simulations, we demonstrate that uncontrolled library size variance in traditional metacells inflates false-positive correlations and distorts co-expression networks. Here, we present LSMetacell (Library Size-stabilized Metacells), a computational framework that explicitly stabilizes library sizes across metacells to reduce compositional noise while preserving cellular heterogeneity. LSMetacell addresses this by stabilizing library sizes during metacells aggregation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of downstream analyses such as Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Applied to a postmortem Alzheimer’s disease brain scRNA-seq dataset, LSMetacell revealed robust, cell type-specific co-expression modules enriched for disease-relevant pathways, outperforming the conventional metacells approach. Our work establishes a principled strategy for resolving compositional biases in scRNA-seq data, advancing the reliability of co-expression network inference in studying complex biological systems. This framework provides a generalizable solution for improving transcriptional analyses in single-cell studies.

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have enabled multi-modal systems to model and translate diverse information spaces. Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal Deep Learning model for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data, rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates good performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute the most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.

                <p>by Pantelis Vafidis, Antonio Rangel</p>

Animals learn to predict external contingencies from experience through a process of conditioning. A natural mechanism for conditioning is stimulus substitution, whereby the neuronal response to the CS becomes increasingly identical to that of the US. We propose a recurrent neural network model of stimulus substitution which leverages two forms of inductive bias pervasive in the cortex: representational inductive bias in the form of mixed stimulus representations, and architectural inductive bias in the form of two-compartment pyramidal neurons that have been shown to serve as a fundamental unit of cortical associative learning. The properties of these neurons allow for a biologically plausible learning rule that implements stimulus substitution, utilizing only information available locally at the synapses. We show that the model generates a wide array of conditioning phenomena, and can learn large numbers of associations with an amount of training commensurate with animal experiments, without relying on parameter fine-tuning for each individual experimental task. In contrast, we show that commonly used Hebbian rules fail to learn generic stimulus-stimulus associations with mixed selectivity, and require task-specific parameter fine-tuning. Our framework highlights the importance of multi-compartment neuronal processing in the cortex, and showcases how it might confer cortical animals the evolutionary edge.

Benchmarking, which involves collecting reference datasets and demonstrating method performance, is a requirement for the development of new computational tools, but also becomes a domain of its own to achieve neutral comparisons of methods. Although a lot has been written about how to design and conduct benchmark studies, this Perspective sheds light on a wish list for a computational platform to orchestrate benchmark studies. We discuss various ideas for organizing reproducible software environments, formally defining benchmarks, orchestrating standardized workflows, and how they interface with computing infrastructure.

The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems, as they provide a formal scaffold around which to build a quantitative understanding of emergence and emergent properties. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel - with limited interdisciplinary cross-talk between them. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the goal of assessing the similarities, and differences, between how the frameworks define “higher-order structures.” We begin with toy examples with known topologies (spheres, toroids, planes, and knots), before turning to more complex, naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in an embedded point cloud: shapes such as spheres and hollow toroids are synergy-dominated, regardless of how the data is rotated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.

                <p>by Mousumi Roy, Hannah E. Clapham, Swapnil Mishra</p>

Human mobility plays a critical role in the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, influencing both their spread and the effectiveness of control measures. In the process of quantifying the real-time situation of an epidemic, the instantaneous reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> appears to be one of the useful metrics widely used by public health researchers, officials, and policy makers. Since individuals can contract infections both within their region of origin and in other regions they visit, ignoring human mobility in the estimation process overlooks its impact on transmission dynamics and can lead to biased estimates of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, potentially misrepresenting the true epidemic situation. Our study explicitly integrates human mobility into a renewal-equation based disease transmission model to capture the mobility-driven effect on transmission. By incorporating pathogen-specific generation-time distribution, observational delay, the framework is epidemiologically informed and flexible to a wide range of diseases. We primarily validate the approach using simulated data, and demonstrate the limitations of estimating <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> without considering mobility. We then apply it to two real-world mobility settings using SARS-CoV-2 mortality data: the regions of England and the LTLAs of North East region of England, and uncover the mobility driven effect on transmission at different spatial resolutions. This framework uses non-identifiable and widely accessible publicly available datasets, demonstrating its practical applicability and supporting better-informed and more targeted public health measures.

                <p>by Young-Hwan Jo</p>

The liver communicates with the brain by transmitting interoceptive signals, including nutrients, hormones, and cytokines, potentially via the liver-innervating vagal sensory neurons. This communication is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and emotional stability.

Interoceptive signals from visceral organs, such as heart, lungs and gut, are known to influence many aspects of organismal physiology and behavior. This Perspective argues that liver signaling via the vagal nerve is another avenue of body-brain communication that shapes metabolism and mood.

Interoception may be a key mechanism in “Whole Person Health.” More and better technologies, tools, and mechanistic research are needed to fully understand its role, as well as new interventions to promote healthy physiological self-regulation through interoceptive signals.

Decoding the body’s internal signals could revolutionize Whole Person Health. This Perspective suggests a research framework linking brain, body and behavior to foster resilience, self-regulation and holistic well-being.

                <p>by Guanhua Sun, Tomoyuki Mano, Shoi Shi, Alvin Li, Koji L Ode, Alex Rosi-Andersen, Erica Pedron, Steven A. Brown, Hiroki R Ueda, Konstantinos Kompotis, Daniel B. Forger</p>

The mouse brain’s activity changes drastically over a day despite being generated from the same neurons and physical connectivity. To better understand this, we develop an experimental-computational pipeline to determine which neurons and networks are most active at different times of the day. We genetically mark active neurons of freely behaving mice at four times of the day with a c-Fos activity-dependent TRAP2 system. Neurons are imaged and digitized in 3D, and their molecular properties are inferred from the latest brain spatial transcriptomic dataset. We then develop a new computational method to analyze the network formed by the identified active neurons. Applying this pipeline, we observe region and layer-specific activation of neurons in the cortex, especially activation of layer five neurons at the end of the dark (wake) period. We also observe a shift in the balance of excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons versus inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons across the whole brain, especially in the thalamus. Moreover, as the dark (wake) period progresses, the network formed by the active neurons becomes less modular, and the hubs switch from subcortical regions, such as the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, to cortical regions in the default mode network. Taken together, we present a pipeline to understand which neurons and networks may be most activated in the mouse brain during an experimental protocol, and use this pipeline to understand how brain activity changes over the course of a day.

                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy can be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, has increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

                Background Recently, the dynamics of gender and entrepreneurship have received more attention; however, the subtleties of how gender affects entrepreneurial intentions remain a challenge, despite empowerment through skills and formal training. This study seeks to establish gender differences in entrepreneurial intentions in educational settings as well as the broader context of gender equity in achieving financial independence among finalist undergraduate students. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of gender-related factors that influence entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate students. Methodology This was a cross-sectional and quantitative study. The study site was the town campus of Mbarara University of Science and Technology. The study population consisted of finalist businesses and students. The data were managed and analyzed using STATA version 17. T-tests of independent samples and means were used for data analysis. Results Of the 404 respondents, the majority were males (56.2%). Entrepreneurial Intentions were higher among females with a history of business ownership (M = 22.7, SD = 5.1) than among those without a history of business ownership (M = 19.5, SD = 6.9), at t = 2.25, p <0.05. Further, entrepreneurial intentions were lower among male students whose male caretakers or parents had business as an occupation (M = 19.5, SD = 6.9) than their counterparts whose male parents were not in business (M = 21.5, SD = 5.6) at t = 2.31, p <0.05. No other gender differences were found across other socio-demographic variables (p <0.05). Conclusion Entrepreneurial Intentions differed among females with a history of business ownership. We argue that the complex interplay of gender demographic gaps in shaping undergraduate students’ entrepreneurial aspirations cannot be significantly improved based on family background without conclusive equal opportunity training approaches. Designing a hands-on and role-modeling entrepreneurship curriculum can shape gender-mainstream intentions.

                Background Mexico’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda requires reliable forecasts of sustainability performance. Anticipating trends can help target interventions and allocate resources effectively. Methods An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained on historical national time-series data to forecast three composite indicators through 2030: the Sustainable Development Index (SDI), the UN Sustainable Development Goals Index (ISDG), and the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). The model jointly learned patterns across indices to capture interdependencies relevant to sustainability outcomes. Results The ANN indicates interconnected dynamics among sustainability dimensions and suggests that measurable progress toward the SDGs by 2030 will depend on targeted policy effort in three domains: (1) education outcomes, (2) economic diversification that moves production toward higher-complexity activities, and (3) environmental strategies that mitigate ecological pressures. Forecasts underscore that gains in one area can reinforce others, but also that uneven advances may constrain aggregate progress. Conclusions Despite constraints—including a relatively short training series and omission of potentially important exogenous variables—the ANN provides a useful decision-support tool for refining sustainability policy. Future research should incorporate additional drivers (e.g., socio-economic, environmental, and governance covariates) and optimize ANN parameters to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability, helping ensure Mexico remains on track to meet its SDG commitments by 2030.

Schools offer a platform for mental health promotion, yet few well-documented, adolescent-focused awareness programs exist. This scoping review aimed to map available scientific evidence on mental health awareness promotion programs targeting adolescents in South Africa. Methodology The scoping review followed Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, and a systematic search was conducted in Sabinet, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Wiley Online Library, covering English-language studies published between January 2020 and January 2025. A total of 4881 records were identified, including 20 from manual searches, with 39 articles meeting the inclusion criteria for final synthesis. The study was registered on prospero: CRD420251174673 Results Study findings discovered several programs in South Africa to enhance mental health awareness among adolescents. The Integrated School Health Policy was implemented across all nine provinces which provides comprehensive school health and psychosocial support through collaboration among various stakeholders. The Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions program which targets 10-15 with internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression was implemented in 4 Cape Town schools. In Khayelitsha, the Health Action in Schools for Thriving Adolescent Generation program was implemented to support learners aged 11-15 by fostering thriving school environments and peer support. Despite these efforts, challenges including inconsistent attendance, logistical barriers, insufficient resources, concerns about sustainability, and inadequate school capacity addressing critical learner vulnerabilities were identified. Resulting in the high prevalence of anxiety and depression. Conclusion The review highlights a clear gap in the implementation and evaluation of structured mental health awareness programs for adolescents in South Africa. Strengthening school-based mental health initiatives, training educators, and addressing systemic barriers are essential steps toward improving adolescent mental health outcomes and closing the existing treatment gap.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1243/v1?src=rss">Decentralisation in Action: Understanding Organisational Culture and Employee Performance in Local Governments – A Multicontext Review for Advancing Sustainable Development Goal 16 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In this narrative review, we examine the role of organisational culture in shaping employee performance within local governments, addressing a critical gap in synthesised evidence connecting cultural elements to practical performance outcomes across diverse contexts. We focus on how leadership practices, change management, performance management, communication patterns, and employee engagement, within an organisational culture framework, collectively influence institutional capacity and foster inclusive, transparent, and accountable governance aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 16. Anchored in Schein’s Organisational Culture Theory, we conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed articles, government reports, and case studies published between 2015 and 2025. We searched multidisciplinary databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select high-quality studies relevant to organisational culture and performance in local government contexts. Data were analysed thematically to identify patterns and relationships among the key variables influencing performance outcomes. Our findings show that ethical and participatory leadership cultivates trust and alignment with institutional objectives, adaptive change management promotes responsiveness to technological and policy reforms, and data-driven performance management strengthens goal attainment and continuous improvement. We also found that inclusive communication patterns foster transparency and collaboration, while meaningful employee engagement drives motivation, equity, and professional growth. By integrating these elements, we establish a clear link between cultural practices and tangible governance outcomes, offering actionable insights for policymakers, institutional leaders, and stakeholders seeking to enhance local government performance. We contribute to the body of knowledge by providing a consolidated evidence base that informs strategies to strengthen institutional culture, advance accountability, and promote inclusive, effective, and sustainable public service delivery, supporting both theoretical understanding and practical interventions in local government contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-83/v2?src=rss">Is rationality a cognitive faculty? [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Rationality in the standard (economics) sense cannot be a form of intelligence or any other cognitive faculty, such as memory, language, or mathematical skills. To establish this thesis, this paper uses a distinction from set theory, namely, the distinction between “binary relators” and “binary operators”. Rationality, in the standard sense, acts as a binary relator in the sense that it is an optimization method, whereas cognitive ability acts as a binary operator in the sense that it is a transformational function. Rationality as an optimization method (binary relator) does not differ from the neo-Darwinian notion of natural selection: either method seeks to find the best choice or fit trait given the constraints. A cognitive faculty as a transformational function (binary operator) simply translates inputs into outputs. The distinction between standard rationality and cognitive functions has wide-ranging implications for the theory of evolution.

They reveal a key epithelial-immune cell crosstalk involving IL-17-producing T lymphocytes and neutrophils as essential for the dysplasia-carcinoma progression.

PGF formation is associated with neutrophil degranulation. GAGs were identified as central components supporting PGF fibrillar structure and antimicrobial activity.

                Wagner et al. demonstrate that RNase H1 only removes a subset of R-loops in vivo. In yeast, overexpressed RNH1 acts more frequently at dysregulated R-loops and infrequently, if at all, at other RNA-DNA hybrids. Endogenous Rnh1 is induced in a Rad53-dependent manner at transcription-replication conflicts to promote replication completion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107406">Integration of multi-level dental diversity links macro-evolutionary patterns to ecological strategies across sharks</a></h4>

              
                The exceptional dental diversity in sharks is frequently used as a proxy for ecological function. However, functional inferences from morphology need to consider morphological features across different organizational scales and spatial resolutions. Here, we compare morphological features ranging from sub-dental patterns to whole dentitions within a large ensemble of species encompassing all extant shark orders. Although taxa scoring high for different heterodonty measures are distributed throughout the phylogeny, the two shark superorders show a different degree of modularity between mono- and dignathic heterodonty as well as substantial differences in ecological niches. Intriguingly, we observe two alternative ways of increasing dental complexity: either at the tooth- or dentition-level. Correlating heterodonty and single-tooth complexity with ecological and life-history traits, we find that pelagic and demersal species evolve dental complexity in different ways. We track trait variability as a function of genetic distance, thus quantifying dental trait adaptability at different resolutions. Overall, intermediate resolution levels, namely the degree of monognathic heterodonty, predict ecological traits best but carry a relatively low phylogenetic signal, suggesting a more dynamic adaptability on shorter evolutionary timescales. This raises macro-evolutionary interpretations about the evolvability of nested modular phenotypic structures, with important implications for paleo-ecological inferences from sequentially homologous traits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97621">Engineered migrasomes provide a robust and thermally stable vaccination platform</a></h4>

              
                The growing ability of pathogens and tumor cells to evade immune surveillance underscores the urgent need for new vaccine platforms that harness diverse biological mechanisms. Logistical constraints associated with cold-chain transport further limit vaccine accessibility, particularly in resource-limited settings. Migrasomes—specialized organelles produced during cell migration—are inherently stable and enriched with immune-modulating molecules. To overcome the low yield of natural migrasomes, we engineered migrasome-like vesicles (eMigrasomes) using hypotonic shock combined with cytoskeletal disruption to promote vesicle formation. eMigrasome biogenesis depends on core migrasome machinery and recapitulates the biophysical and molecular features of native migrasomes while achieving higher production efficiency. In murine models, eMigrasomes loaded with a model antigen elicited potent antibody responses and retained structural integrity and immunogenicity at room temperature. Moreover, eMigrasomes displaying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein induced strong humoral responses and conferred protection against viral challenge in mice. These results establish eMigrasomes as an innovative, thermally stable, and broadly applicable vaccine platform derived from migrasome biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102288">Conformational dynamics and asymmetry in multimodal inhibition of membrane-bound pyrophosphatases</a></h4>

              
                Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are homodimeric proteins that hydrolyse pyrophosphate and pump H<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> across membranes. They are crucial for the virulence of protist pathogens, making them attractive drug targets. In this study, we investigate the inhibitory effects of seven distinct bisphosphonates against <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> mPPase to explore their mode of action and assist in future small molecule inhibitor development. We solved two structures of mPPase bound to the inhibitors in the enzyme active sites and probed the conformational dynamics of mPPase under multiple inhibitors and functionally relevant conditions by double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. We found that mPPase adopts distinct conformational equilibria in solution in the presence of different inhibitors, including states consistent with asymmetric binding in the active site (closed-open), but a symmetric apo-like conformation on the periplasmic side (open-open). Combined with solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology recordings, this revealed that during catalysis, one monomer of the dimer remains open, and Na<sup>+</sup> can only be pumped in a closed state. These results further support symmetry-breaking across the membrane, consistent with half-of-the-sites-reactivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107042">Repeated vaccination with homologous influenza hemagglutinin broadens human antibody responses to unmatched flu viruses</a></h4>

              
                The ongoing diversification of influenza virus necessitates annual vaccine updating. The vaccine antigen, the viral spike protein hemagglutinin (HA), tends to elicit strain-specific neutralizing activity, predicting that sequential immunization with the same HA strain will boost antibodies with narrow coverage. However, repeated vaccination with homologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eventually elicits neutralizing activity against highly unmatched variants, questioning this immunological premise. We evaluated a longitudinal influenza vaccine cohort, where each year the subjects received the same, novel H1N1 2009 pandemic vaccine strain. Repeated vaccination gradually enhanced receptor-blocking antibodies (HAI) to highly unmatched H1N1 strains within individuals with no initial memory recall against these historical viruses. An in silico model of affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs) integrated with a model of differentiation and expansion of memory cells outside GCs during a recall response provides insight into the potential mechanisms underlying these results and shows how repeated exposure to the same immunogen can broaden the antibody response against diversified targets.

We recorded high-density EEG while autistic children aged 8 to 13 (AU; n=40), unaffected siblings of autistic children (SIB; n=26), and non-autistic controls (NA; n=36) performed a simple reaction-time task to auditory (A), visual (V), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli. Analyses targeted event-related potentials (ERPs; P1/N1/P2), alpha-band event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), and long-range theta-band functional connectivity (weighted phase-lag index, wPLI). Across all unisensory measures (ERPs, alpha-ERD, and connectivity), groups did not differ, indicating broadly comparable unisensory processing. By contrast, multisensory integration (MSI; operationalized for ERPs and alpha-ERD as AV - (A+V)) differed across groups: NA children showed significant ERP MSI over parieto-central sites that was absent in AU and SIB; and alpha-ERD MSI was present in all groups but significantly reduced in AU, with SIB showing an intermediate profile. Connectivity analyses revealed that AV theta-band fronto-parieto-occipital coupling was reduced in autistic relative to non-autistic children, consistent with weaker large-scale coordination during multisensory processing. Together, these results point to a multisensory-specific deficit in autism spanning early sensory encoding, posterior alpha-ERD, and fronto-posterior coupling. The convergence of results supports a mechanistic account of disrupted multisensory influences on sensory processing due to reduced multisensory attentional orientation. Intermediate SIB profiles suggest inherited liability for these neural phenotypes. These results help explain well-documented behavioral MSI differences in autism by linking impaired early enhancement with attenuated top-down control of sensory cortex.

">A Common Neural Signal of Evidence Accumulation for Perceptual and Mnemonic Decisions</a></h4>

              
                Humans frequently make decisions based on sensory input from the external environment or information retrieved from memory. The centro-parietal positivity (CPP), an event-related EEG potential, has recently been identified as a neural correlate of sensory evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this component also reflects evidence accumulation during decisions based on long-term memory. The present study investigated whether the CPP serves as a domain-general signal of evidence accumulation across both perception and semantic memory-based decisions. We designed a visual discrimination task in which participants discriminated between the luminance of two alphanumeric strings across three levels of difficulty defined by the luminance difference. In a semantic memory task, participants discriminated between the populations of two different U.S. states, binned into three difficulty levels using US census data. After each decision, participants rated their confidence on a scale from 1 (very low) to 4 (very high). We observed a CPP component in both tasks, the slope of which scaled with the sensory or mnemonic evidence in both stimulus- and response-locked analyses. Furthermore, these CPP slopes were sensitive to reaction times (RT) and confidence in both tasks. Finally, the peak height of the CPP just prior to the response, indicative of one's decision boundary, was strongly correlated across tasks, suggesting that a common threshold was applied to the abstract evidence quantity being accumulated. Our results indicate that the CPP can be used to track the unfolding dynamics underlying decisions made both on the basis of external sensory evidence and internal mnemonic evidence.

">Processing of Emotional Faces Has Unique Functional and Cytoarchitectural Associations in those with an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis.</a></h4>

              
                Those with an autism spectrum diagnosis (ASD) have been found to process emotional faces differently than other populations. Processing of emotional faces requires engagement of temporal, frontal, occipital, and limbic brain regions. Functional activity has been shown to differ in those with an ASD, particularly in the amygdala, inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and temporal brain regions. However, the consistency and direction of these associations have been inconsistent across studies. Recent findings have demonstrated that measures of neuron density differ in those with an ASD. Some of these regional differences in cytoarchitecture coincide with regions important to emotional facial processing. Therefore, the interaction between cytoarchitecture and functional activity may be important in elucidating unique neurophysiology in ASD. The present study uses diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the relationship between cytoarchitecture and functional activity during emotional face processing in those with an ASD. 75 individuals with a reported ASD and 6,396 individuals with no reported diagnosis of an ASD (nASD) were identified. The emotional n-back (EN-Back) task was administered during fMRI acquisition, activating regions of the brain associated with processing emotional faces. Neuron cell body density was positively correlated with functional activation in the left amygdala in the ASD group but not the nASD group. These findings suggest that a unique relationship may exist between neuron cell body density in the left amygdala and functional activity while processing emotional faces in those with an ASD.

">Expansion of Working Memory Capacity Supports Early Skill Learning</a></h4>

              
                Real-world motor skills depend on the precise spatiotemporal coordination of action sequences refined through practice. Working memory, which transiently maintains and manipulates task-relevant information, supports skill acquisition expanding with extensive training, as shown in expert domains such as in master chess players. Yet, the temporal dynamics of working memory emergence and expansion during the rapid performance gains that define early skill learning remain unclear. We addressed this question across three experiments in which participants learned various naturalistic sequential keypress skills. Within each practice trial, we observed segments of high-initial-skill (HIS)--transient periods of elevated performance followed by skill drops--that persisted throughout training. The keypress content of HIS segments scaled with execution speed and systematically increased with practice, reflecting an expansion of keypress chunk content consistent with the progressive enlargement of working memory capacity. Importantly, HIS segment keypress content continued to rise even after overall performance plateaued. Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling ({theta}/{gamma} PAC) and beta ({beta})-band bursts, mechanisms implicated in maintaining and binding individual actions into sequences in working memory, were elevated during HIS segments with hippocampal {theta}/{gamma} PAC predicting HIS segment content. Our results suggest that working memory capacity expands during early learning of a naturalistic skill and continues strengthening with practice after skill plateau is reached, possibly supported by hippocampal theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling.

">Inhibition of oxytocin neurons during key periods of development has long-term behavioural and body composition effects</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin (OT) is a neuromodulator of social behaviour in mammals and accumulative data support the concept of a critical period for OT action during infancy. However, it is possible that the specific functions of OT depend on different time periods of action. In this study, we aimed to determine whether there are developmental stages during which OT-expressing neurons play a decisive role with long-term consequences. To this end, we chemogenetically inhibited OT-expressing neurons during three critical periods of development (in infants, juveniles, and young adults) in male and female mice, followed by a longitudinal study to assess behaviour and metabolic perturbations. The most pronounced behavioural effects are observed after inhibition during infancy in both sexes. Notably, social memory is consistently impaired in males, regardless of the inactivation period. From a metabolic perspective, in adulthood, an increase in body weight is observed in all cohorts of males but fat mass and adipocyte size increase after inhibition of OT-expressing neurons during juvenile period. In addition, we observed a significant delay in the day of birth and an alteration in feeding behaviour in neonates after inhibiting OT-expressing neurons around the time of birth. Thus, inhibition of OT neurons during three postnatal periods has direct, distinct, and long-lasting consequences on social behaviour and metabolism, depending on the sex and on the timing of inactivation. Our results also demonstrate a role of foetal/neonate oxytocin neurons in the timing of birth and in early feeding behaviour.

">Multivariate environmental exposures are reflected in whole-brain functional connectivity and cognition in youth</a></h4>

              
                Each individual's complex, multidimensional environment, known as their 'exposome', plays an essential role in shaping cognitive neurodevelopment. Understanding the mechanisms whereby children's exposome influences their development is crucial to facilitate the design of interventions to foster positive developmental trajectories for all youth. Recent work has identified a general exposome factor associated with socio-economic inequality that is strongly related to cognition and individual differences in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in youth. Building on these findings, the current study explores whether alterations in functional connectivity may represent a potential mechanism linking variation in the exposome to cognitive performance. We apply a data-driven, cross-validated, whole-brain machine learning approach, connectome-based statistical inference, to identify patterns of functional connectivity associated with exposome scores among early adolescents enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using data collected during three cognitive tasks and during rest. Additionally, we investigate whether the identified patterns of functional connectivity relate to individual differences in cognitive performance across three domains: General Cognition, Executive Functioning, and Learning/Memory. Models incorporating 10-fold cross-validation over 100 iterations identified consistent functional connections associated with the exposome across task and rest conditions (model performance: ns = 6,137-8,391, rs = 0.34 - 0.44, ps <.001). Results were robust across data collection sites and functional connections common across all significant models were associated with cognitive performance across domains (ps < 0.0009). Collectively, these findings reveal that multidimensional environmental exposures are reflected in patterns of functional connectivity and relate to cognitive functioning among youth.

">A dynamic causal inference framework for perception-action loops</a></h4>

              
                Causal inference, the process of inferring the causes of our sensory input, is central to multisensory perception. While most computational models of causal inference focus on static perceptual tasks with no temporal or motor components, real-world behavior unfolds dynamically and often involves closed-loop control. Here, we introduce and validate a general modeling framework that unifies multisensory causal inference with optimal feedback control by casting the problem as inference and action in a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS). Our framework combines approximate inference over latent causal structures with a mixture-of-controllers approach, in which each controller is optimized for a specific causal model and weighted by the current belief in that model. We show that classical static models of multisensory perception are special cases of our framework, and extend them to dynamic, action-oriented settings where inference and control evolve over time. Using simulations of previously published behavioral tasks, including visuo-vestibular heading discrimination and path integration with interception, we show that the model reproduces key empirical findings, such as S-shaped biases in heading estimation and motor strategies based on inferred object motion. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach in novel task extensions, including motion in depth, latent switching dynamics, and multi-objective motor control. Together, our results provide a principled, general-purpose computational account of how causal inference and motor behavior interact in dynamic, uncertain environments, offering a bridge between theories of perception and action.

">Observing being touched enhances the neural processing and perception of digital gentle stroking</a></h4>

              
                Observing touch activates similar brain regions as experiencing an actual touch, suggesting that visual information can cross-modally influence tactile perception. This electroencephalography (EEG) study investigated how observing being touched affects the processing and perception of digitally delivered tactile stimuli resembling affective stroking or non-affective tapping. Thirty-three participants received touch patterns on their left forearm via a wearable sleeve while viewing spatiotemporally aligned videos of touch or a photo of an arm. Continuity and pleasantness ratings were higher for stroking than tapping. Correlations between continuity and pleasantness ratings for stroking or tapping conditions were stronger when presented with touch videos than with photos. Analysis of evoked brain activity revealed cross-modal effects after 0.6 seconds at centro-parietal and frontal electrodes for stroking, which differed from the effects observed for tapping. Visual modulation of pleasantness ratings correlated positively with processing differences between stroking and tapping in two right frontal clusters in later time windows around 1.36 and 1.8 s. These results suggest that visual inputs influence tactile pleasantness through somatosensory and multisensory processing, as well as frontal valuation of pleasantness. Our study extends previous research on affective touch by demonstrating informative visual cross-modal influences on digitally actuated touch at behavioural and neural levels.

">Sub-strain-Dependent Differences in Gut Barrier Permeability, Bacterial Translocation and Post-Stroke Inflammation in Wistar Rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stroke induces profound neuroinflammation and systemic immune dysregulation, including disturbances in gut homeostasis. Experimental evidence suggests that intestinal barrier permeability (IBP) and bacterial translocation (BT) critically influence stroke outcomes. However, biological variability among commonly used rodent sub-strains has received limited attention. Methods: In this pilot study, we compared post-stroke immune responses in two Wistar rat sub-strains obtained from different suppliers: RccHan (Envigo) and RjHan (Janvier). Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, animals were assessed 72 hours later and stratified according to the presence or absence of BT. Immune cell populations in blood and bone marrow were analyzed by flow cytometry, and leukocyte infiltration into ischemic brain tissue was quantified by immunohistochemistry. Results: Both sub-strains developed significant infarcts and neurological deficits. RccHan rats displayed larger infarct volumes and more extensive BT across multiple organs. In contrast, RjHan rats exhibited BT mainly confined to mesenteric lymph nodes but showed greater IBP. Although dissemination was broader in RccHan rats, overall bacterial burden was slightly lower compared with RjHan, and extra-intestinal bacterial composition differed between groups. Notably, RjHan rats presented stronger systemic and central immune activation, with marked alterations in lymphocyte and monocyte populations and enhanced granulocyte and T cell infiltration within ischemic lesions. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that sub-strain origin profoundly influences post-stroke intestinal barrier integrity, bacterial dissemination, and immune responses. Considering sub-strain-related variability is essential to improve reproducibility and translational relevance in preclinical stroke research.

">Increased striatal coupling one week after ischemic stroke revealed by ultrafast functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                Background: Network reorganization following ischemic stroke is thought to play a role in recovery. Although cortico-cortical reorganization is widely established, changes in interhemispheric striatal connections following ischemia remain poorly understood, even when stroke occurs in motor areas. Given the importance of the striatum to motor function, we investigated network-level striatal coupling in stroke using ultrafast resting-state fMRI, which has recently been shown to facilitate the dissection of synchronous oscillatory activity better than its conventional ~1 sec time-resolution counterparts. Methods: A cohort of (N=18) sedated rats were randomized and N=9 rats underwent unilateral photothrombotic ischemic lesioning in motor cortex. One week after the lesion, when plasticity and recovery are well established, all animals were scanned on a 9.4T MRI scanner using a cryogenic coil using an ultrafast resting-state functional MRI sequence with temporal resolution of 90 ms. Data were collected for 24 minutes, and spectral power, phase locking, and functional connectivity were quantified. Histology was performed to confirm lesion extent. Results: While cortico-cortical power, connectivity and synchrony were diminished one week post-stroke as expected, we surprisingly found increased striato-striatal power, synchrony and functional connectivity in the stroked group compared with the control group. In stroked animals, the spectral power in the ultraslow oscillation frequency band (0.02-0.4 Hz) significantly increased in the striatum while decreasing in the cortex. When data were undersampled to "conventional" fMRI temporal resolution (900 ms), the striatal effects were lost, revealing the power of ultrafast fMRI approaches in unveiling such phenomena. Conclusions: Increased striato-striatal coupling, in the form of increased synchrony, spectral power, and functional connectivity, was revealed by ultrafast resting-state fMRI, but not conventional temporal resolution resting-state fMRI. Our findings suggest more involvement of subcortical areas in network reorganization than previously thought.

">Non-canonical, ligand-independent basal mGluR1 signaling tunes Kv1.2 surface expression through PKA</a></h4>

              
                Voltage gated potassium channels are major determinants of excitability of Purkinje cell (PC) neurons in the cerebellum. We have previously shown that in the cerebellum, activation of mGluR1 with agonist DHPG leads to reduced surface expression of Kv1.2 and that Kv1.2 co-immunoprecipitates with PKC-{gamma} and CaMKII which are known interactors of mGluR1. However, mGluR1 can also signal independently of agonist through a constitutively active, protein kinase A-dependent pathway. Here we show that in HEK293 cells, co-expression of mGluR1 increases the surface expression levels of Kv1.2. This effect occurs in absence of mGluR1 agonists and in the presence of an mGluR1 inhibitor. Co-expression of known downstream effectors of the agonist driven mGluR1 pathway, including PKC-{gamma} and CaMKII, had no effect on Kv1.2 surface expression or on the ability of mGluR1 agonist to modulate that expression. In contrast, the inverse agonist BAY 36-7620 significantly reduced the mGluR1 effect on Kv1.2 surface expression, as did pharmacological inhibition of PKA with KT5720.

">Paw posture is a robust indicator for injury, pain, and age.</a></h4>

              
                Inferring biological states from animal behavior is a crucial but challenging step in biomedical discovery that is constrained by variability and labour-intensive assays, even with AI-powered tools. Here, we show that simple images of static paws, analyzed by our custom keypoint segmentation AI-tool provide accurate read-outs for a wide array of physiological states. Without invasive testing, our method detects postural changes associated with nerve injury, acute pain, aging, and the genetic loss of kpna4, a regulator of paw innervation. Leveraging the toe-spread-reflex, a spinal-circuit driven response, the approach requires no habituation and shows low behavioral variability. Individual digits emerge as biomarkers for internal states with digit V indicating neuropathic pain during nerve damage and digit I reflecting loss of kpna4. Our model is freely available and can readily be adapted to other tasks or species. These findings establish unstimulated paw posture as a scaleable, low-cost, readout for biological states.

">Cross-task, explainable, and real-time decoding of human emotion states by integrating grey and white matter intracranial neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Decoding human emotion states from neural activity has significant applications in human-computer interfaces, psychiatric diagnostics, and neuromodulation therapies. Intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) provides a promising modality for decoding by balancing temporal, spatial, and noise resolutions. However, real-world application of decoding requires high performance that integrates neural activity from both grey and white matter, stable generalization across different contexts, sufficient neural encoding explainability, and robust real-time implementation, all of which remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously recorded iEEG and abundant self-rated valence and arousal scores--measuring the two primitive dimension of emotion--across two emotion-eliciting tasks in eighteen epilepsy subjects. We developed self-supervised deep learning models that achieved high-performance decoding by integrating grey and white matter signals, generalizing across tasks. The models provided strong explainability by revealing shared and preferred mesolimbic-thalamo-cortical subnetworks encoding valence and arousal, as well as the structural connectivity basis underlying grey and white matter integration. Finally, the models were implemented online and realized robust real-time decoding in four new subjects. Our results have implications for advancing emotion decoding neurotechnology and understanding emotion encoding mechanisms.

">Interpretable and Brain-Inspired Recurrent Model of Hierarchical Decision-Making Capturing Trial-by-Trial Variability</a></h4>

              
                Humans often make decisions in hierarchical environments, where low-level perceptual judgments inform high-level strategies. Understanding how the brain computationally navigates such multi-level decisions remains an open challenge. While existing models offer statistical insights, they often fall short in capturing the neural mechanisms and trial-by-trial variability underlying individual choices. To address this gap, we developed a neurocomputational model that integrates a biologically inspired attractor network for low-level perceptual decisions with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for high-level strategic adjustments. With minimal architectural constraints, the RNN receives only raw firing rates, feedback, and prior environment, learning to infer environment-switching strategies without explicit access to confidence or stimulus strength. In a hierarchical task combining motion discrimination and bandit decisions (N = 9; ~10,800 trials), the model successfully reproduced three hallmark behavioral patterns observed in humans. Unlike previous models, the model also captured trial-to-trial variability in switching decisions and implicitly learned to estimate decision confidence. For interpretability, we used representational and sensitivity analyses. Representational analyses revealed internal dynamics consistent with evidence accumulation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), while sensitivity analysis identified feedback as the dominant influence on strategy, modulated by recent trial history. This framework combines interpretability and predictive power, moving beyond simple data fitting to provide mechanistic insights into how the brain integrates confidence and feedback to guide adaptive behavior in hierarchical decision-making.

">When Brain Models Are not Universal: Benchmarking of Ethnic Bias in MRI-Based Cognitive Prediction Across Modalities</a></h4>

              
                Predictive neuroimaging models promise precision medicine but risk exacerbating health inequities if they perform unevenly across ethnic/racial groups. Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development data, we benchmarked ethnic/racial bias in models predicting cognitive functioning from 81 MRI phenotypes across four training strategies. Models trained on one ethnicity performed best within that group. Models trained on participants sampled without regard to ethnicity, a common practice, performed better on White participants, likely because the ABCD sample was predominantly White. Training on equal-sized White and African American subsamples reduced disparities without accuracy loss. Structural MRI exhibited the greatest bias, whereas task-based fMRI phenotypes were more equitable. Stronger brain-cognition associations generalized more equitably, but multimodal stacking despite enhancing prediction, did not improve fairness. Increasing representation of African American participants improved performance up to balanced sampling, with diminishing returns beyond. This first modality-wide benchmark reveals pervasive, modality dependent ethnic bias in cognitive prediction and identifies key factors shaping equity in neuroimaging models.

">The antiviral Interferon pathway drives astrocyte aging and motor decline</a></h4>

              
                Aging encompasses low-level inflammation and motor decline. Astrocytes are neuroregulatory glial cells that change in aging, particularly in the cerebellum, which is essential for movement coordination. Regulation and functionality of cerebellar astrocytes in aging is unknown. We show that antiviral type I Interferons (IFN-I) drive motor deficits and regional astrocyte aging. Transcriptomics reveal that cerebellar astrocytes, but not cortical, exhibit an antiviral state that intensifies with age, with increased expression of Stat1. Aged mice display motor deficits similar to humans that improve after peripheral IFN-I receptor neutralization, whereas astrocyte Stat1 induces motor deficits during chronic inflammation in adults. While strong systemic inflammation induces astrocyte antiviral state, in aging, chromatin de-repression of Stat1 and nucleotide sensors in cerebellar astrocytes amplifies local IFN-I signaling. We identify functional interaction between a classical immune pathway and astrocytes, representing an actionable strategy to preserve motor function in aging.

">Head stabilization behavior and underlying circuit mechanisms in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Head stabilization is essential for animal survival, enabling stable sensory input and effective motor coordination. Animals stabilize their heads in response to vestibular stimuli through the vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR). While the VCR has been characterized in tetrapod vertebrates, it remains unknown whether fish, which lack an anatomical neck, employ a comparable behavior. Here, we demonstrate that larval zebrafish exhibit VCR-like behaviors: they adjust their head orientation relative to the body by rostral body flexion during pitch tilts. The rostral body flexed ventrally during head-up posture, whereas it flexed dorsally during head-down posture. These flexions partially compensated for the head pitch changes, thereby contributing to head stabilization. We also identified the muscles and neural circuits responsible for these two types of body flexions. Both the dorsal and ventral flexions were mediated by the same vestibular nucleus, but neural signals were transmitted through distinct pathways, either involving or bypassing a class of reticulospinal neurons. The dorsal and ventral flexions were ultimately produced by specialized dorsal and ventral muscles in the rostral body, respectively. The neural circuits underlying these body flexions in fish share similarities with those underlying the mammalian VCR. Together, our results demonstrate that fish exhibit a VCR-like behavior through comparable circuit mechanisms, suggesting that the VCR is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates.

The collection assembles multiscale vEM datasets (FIB-SEM, SBF-SEM, ssSEM) spanning diverse tissues and species, with expert-verified instance labels emphasizing biologically difficult scenarios, including dense mitochondrial packing, hyperfused networks, and thin filamentous connections with ambiguous boundaries. All releases include native-resolution volumes and standardized processed versions, per-volume metadata (voxel size, modality, tissue, splits), and official train/validation/test partitions to enable reproducible benchmarking. Annotations follow a consistent protocol with quality checks and instance reindexing. Data are provided in NIfTI with nnU-Net-compatible layout, alongside machine-readable split files and checksums. Baseline scripts support common training pipelines and size-stratified evaluation. By consolidating challenging volumes and harmonized labels, MitoEM 2.0 facilitates robust model development and fair comparison across methods while supporting reuse in bioimage analysis, algorithm benchmarking, and teaching.

">Central role for fast nociceptors in mechanical nocifensive behavior and sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptors, primary afferent nerve fibers that signal noxious stimuli, are broadly divided into slowly conducting unmyelinated C fibers and fast-conducting myelinated A fibers. Whereas C-nociceptors have been extensively studied, considerably less is known about the function of A-nociceptors. To address this gap, we developed an intersectional genetic approach for robust and selective interrogation and manipulation of mechanically responsive A-nociceptors (A-MNs) in mice. Optogenetic A-MN stimulation induced rapid and precise withdrawal reflexes as well as place aversion and facial expression changes consistent with pain affect, while inhibition strongly impaired mechanical nociceptive withdrawal reflexes, demonstrating that A-MNs are necessary and sufficien t for rapid avoidance of noxious mechanical stimuli. Prolonged A-MN activation induced mechanical allodynia and central sensitization. In a rare individual lacking thickly myelinated A{beta} fibers, mechanical withdrawal reflexes were completely absent, and pain perception reduced. Together, these findings identify fast-conducting mechano-nociceptors as essential drivers of nocifensive behaviors in mice and humans.

                Recent advances in human intracranial EEG (iEEG) have enabled new investigations into the role of the thalamus in human brain functions. In this study, we applied direct intracranial electrical stimulation (iES) to the mediodorsal (MD) subregion of the thalamus using both high-frequency (50 Hz, iESHF) and low-frequency (0.5 Hz, iESLF) procedures to examine its impact on conscious experience and causal brain connectivity in 30 patients with focal refractory epilepsy (128 electrode contacts). iESHF of the MD elicited reportable changes in conscious experience in 11 of 12 patients (39 sites; 83 stimulations across 27 unique pairs) - predominantly in the visceral, emotional, or somatosensory domains and often described as unpleasant without any lateralization effect. Our connectivity analyses based on iESLF revealed that the cingulate and insular cortices produced stronger electrophysiological responses in the MD (inflow connectivity) than did the sites in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) within the same individuals. Moreover, MD stimulation showed its strongest outflow connectivity to the cingulate, insular, and PFC regions, all significantly stronger than to medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. Notably, inflow from both MTL and insula sites to the MD were significantly stronger than their reverse directions, indicating clear asymmetry in connectivity. These findings provide direct evidence that stimulation of the human thalamus can modulate conscious experience. They also highlight the extensive bidirectional connectivity between the MD and cingulate and insular cortices along with asymmetric connectivity between the MD and MTL and insula sites in the human brain.

                1.1 Background The glymphatic system facilitates clearance of metabolic waste and pathological proteins from the brain, and its dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. The diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has been proposed as a non-invasive MRI marker of glymphatic flow, although its biological specificity remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify the determinants of DTI-ALPS and evaluate whether it primarily reflects white matter (WM) microstructure rather than glymphatic flow in the context of neurodegeneration. 1.2 Methods We examined 100 individuals referred to the Memory Clinic of the Policlinico Hospital in Milan for suspected dementia. All participants underwent a 3T-MRI protocol including 3D-T1-weighted and 3D-FLAIR imaging, double-shell diffusion-weighted imaging (b=1000/2000 s/mm2), and multi-echo gradient-echo sequences for quantitative susceptibility mapping. Within standard DTI-ALPS ROIs, we extracted DTI-ALPS values together with fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and mode of anisotropy (MA) at both b-values, as well as neurite orientation and density imaging (NODDI) metrics, particularly the orientation dispersion index (ODI). WM microstructure was further characterized using the T1/FLAIR ratio and diamagnetic component of susceptibility (DCS). 1.3 Results and conclusions DTI-ALPS correlated inversely with MA (r = -0.84 at b = 1000; r = -0.86 at b = 2000) and positively with ODI (r = 0.73). Moderate correlations with the T1/FLAIR ratio and DCS supported sensitivity to WM alterations. Factor analysis indicated that DTI-ALPS clustered with MA and ODI rather than forming a distinct factor, suggesting that DTI-ALPS primarily reflects WM diffusion dispersion and heterogeneity rather than glymphatic flow in the context of neurodegeneration.

">Hyperthermic Seizure Susceptibility and Focal Decreases in Parvalbumin-Expressing Cortical Interneurons in a Mouse Model of PCDH19-Clustering Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Protocadherin-19 (PCDH19)-clustering epilepsy (PCE) is a severe genetic epilepsy that manifests with early-onset cluster seizures often triggered by fever, intellectual disability, autistic features, and later neuropsychiatric risk. PCDH19 is an X-linked gene critical for brain development. PCE predominantly affects females and rare mosaic males, but not hemizygous males, likely due to cellular mosaicism arising from random X-inactivation and resultant segregation of wild-type and mutant neurons (so-called cellular interference) during development. We generated a novel PCE mouse model and explored neuronal segregation, seizure susceptibility and cortical interneuron distributions. Methods: Female Pcdh19+/- mice were crossed with X-GFP males to visualize random X-inactivation patterns. Seizure susceptibility was assessed in juvenile mice using hyperthermia and flurothyl exposure. Behavioral testing evaluated cognitive domains. Interneuron distribution in hippocampus and cortex was examined histologically by immunolabeling and crosses with parvalbumin reporter mice. Results: Juvenile Pcdh19+/- females lacked spontaneous seizures but displayed lower seizure thresholds and more severe seizures during hyperthermia. Seizure susceptibility did not differ from controls after flurothyl exposure. Pcdh19+/- females also exhibited segregation of GFP+ cells in the cortex, hippocampal CA1 region and medial ganglionic eminence, with a marked reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the CA1 hippocampal region. Although parvalbumin interneuron density was unchanged in the Pcdh19+/- female cortex overall, localized decreases arose in GFP- (Pcdh19 knockout) cortical stripes. Interpretation: Juvenile PCE mice exhibit seizure susceptibility to hyperthermia and disrupted the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the hippocampus and cortex. These findings suggest focal parvalbumin interneuron alterations may contribute to PCE pathophysiology.

">Pre-existing and emergent cortical neuronal assembly sequences during learning</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal assemblies--groups of co-active neurons--support memory consolidation and retrieval. In the hippocampus, assemblies can pre-exist learning and contribute to memory through sequential activation. Whether similar principles apply to higher cortical areas for flexible memory storage like the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) remains unclear. Using a novel ground truth-validated clustering approach, we investigated the activity of longitudinally tracked mouse OFC neurons during cue-reward memory acquisition and maintenance. Assemblies active after learning pre-existed the learning and exhibited two distinct sequential dynamics suggestive of memory consolidation or retrieval. Consolidation sequences emerged during learning, while retrieval sequences partly recruited pre-existing reward sequences. These findings demonstrate that OFC learning recruits pre-existing networks flexibly repurposed for new associations, revealing circuit motifs that may enable cortical memory storage.

">Inhibitory inputs to avian ITD circuits</a></h4>

              
                In birds, detection of sound source azimuth begins in the nucleus laminaris (NL), which computes interaural time differences (ITDs). Inhibition has been proposed to protect NL neurons from losing ITD sensitivity with increasing sound level, although the nature of this inhibition is incompletely understood. Anatomical studies show GABAergic synapses throughout NL and the first order nuclei, while in vitro studies in chicken NL showed that depolarizing, GABAergic IPSPs shorten membrane time constants, perhaps to allow the membrane potential to follow rapid synaptic currents accurately over a range of sound levels. Given the importance of inhibition in regulating auditory brainstem activity, we examined the nature of the inhibitory input to NL in vivo. The Superior Olivary Nucleus (SON) is the major source of descending GABAergic inhibition to the ipsilateral nucleus magnocellularis (NM), nucleus angularis (NA) and NL, and receives excitatory input from NA and NL. We used viral tracers to reveal projections from SON to NL, and characterized response types within SON. In NL, we isolated inhibitory synaptic currents from extracellular field potentials through the iontophoretic application of blockers of GABA (gabazine) or glycine (strychnine). These blockers increase the onset and offset responses evoked by tonal stimuli, but did not shift best ITD. The co-application of gabazine and strychnine revealed supra-linear summation of GABA and glycine. Profiles of synaptic activation revealed more prominent inhibition following stimulus offset, suggesting inputs to NL originate from both the sustained and offset response types of the SON. These heterogeneous responses may represent separate SON neuronal populations.

">Characterizing neuronal population geometry with AI equation discovery</a></h4>

              
                The visual cortex contains millions of neurons, whose combined activity forms a population code representing visual stimuli. There is, however, a discrepancy between our understanding of this code at the single neuron and population levels: direct measurements suggest that the population code is high-dimensional, but current understanding of single-cell tuning curves implies low dimensionality. To reconcile this discrepancy, we used AI to find a new parsimonious, interpretable equation for tuning curves to oriented stimuli. Candidate equations were expressed as short computer programs, and evolved using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their fits to single-cell tuning. This resulted in an equation that not only improved single-cell fits, but also accurately modelled the population code's high-dimensional structure, even though population dimensionality was not the AI system's objective. This high-dimensionality occurred because the AI-derived tuning curves were not smooth at their peaks, which we proved is mathematically required for high-dimensional population coding of low-dimensional stimuli. We used the AI-generated tuning equation to demonstrate the advantages of high-dimensional codes in a simulated hyperacuity task, and showed that non-smooth peaks are also present in other brain systems, leading to high-dimensional population coding in head direction cells. These results suggest that the smoothness of neuronal tuning curves has an important role in setting the dimensionality of the population code, and demonstrate how AI equation discovery can accelerate scientific theory building in neuroscience and beyond.

">Stress resilience is associated with transcriptional remodeling in the VTA</a></h4>

              
                Individual responses to chronic stress vary, with some individuals remaining resilient while others exhibit susceptibility. The ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region involved in reward learning, and the lateral habenula (LHb), a region involved in aversive learning, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders. Here, we seek to understand the molecular adaptations in these regions at the level of single cells that mediate susceptibility versus resilience. In particular, it remains unclear whether, at the level of gene expression, different cell types within different brain regions mediate stress susceptibility versus resilience, or if these phenotypes are mediated by distinct trajectories within the same cell types. To address this gap, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of LHb and VTA of mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress. While we found minimal gene expression changes in the LHb after stress, the VTA exhibited widespread, cell type-specific transcriptional remodeling in resilient individuals and few gene expression changes in susceptible individuals. Across VTA cell types, resilience was associated with the coordinated upregulation of genes involved in intercellular signaling and neural communication, with maintenance of receptor-ligand interaction strength in resilience that was not present in susceptibility. Within VTA neurons, gene expression changes were most prominent in glutamatergic and dopaminergic clusters. Multivariate analyses of dopamine and glutamate subclusters showed that resilient neurons diverged more from control than susceptible neurons, but along a similar trajectory, supporting a model in which resilience reflects greater stress-related adaptations in these cell types. Together, these findings highlight the VTA as a key site of molecular plasticity in stress resilience and therefore a potential therapeutic target.

">The neuroscience of highly stable, positive, and refined states of consciousness during jhana-type advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J)</a></h4>

              
                Humans can experience a rich array of conscious experience, including highly stable, positive, and refined states of non-ordinary perception that can be elicited through advanced meditation. Here, we present the first group-level, ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI study of jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J). We combined local (regional homogeneity), mesoscale (connectivity gradients), and global (geometric eigenmodes) human brain mapping with diverse and detailed phenomenology, meditative traits, behaviorally assessed cognitive functions, and extensive publicly available psychobehavioral affinity maps. Across eight successive states of ACAM-J, we observed reproducible neural trajectories marked by anterior-to-posterior reorganization, flattening of cortical hierarchies, nonlinear reconfiguration of global harmonics, and tight coupling between brain metrics and equanimity, attentional stability, and behavior. Neurosynth decoding further associate ACAM-J with reduced suffering-related processes and more with attentional monitoring. These findings suggest ACAM-J is a distinct, structured mode of awareness that persists despite radically reduced narrative thought and sensory content. Our findings also inform boundary conditions for current models of consciousness. More broadly, this research indicates that advanced meditation is a powerful framework for understanding psychological transformation, and for potential new opportunities for supporting human well-being and flourishing.

">Characterization of mechanical tissue properties in post-mortem human brain using magnetic resonance elastography</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious health condition that can cause neurological dysfunction to varying degrees depending on the nature of the mechanical insult. In biomechanical studies of TBI under high loading conditions, post-mortem human subjects (PMHS) are often used since ethical concerns prohibit such experiments in living human subjects. Because PMHS brains undergo significant changes following death, it is important to understand the relationship between the mechanical properties of PMHS brain tissue and living tissue. In this study, we performed magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) on three PMHS specimens to estimate the material properties of the cadaveric brain, namely the storage modulus and the loss modulus, as well as the resulting shear stiffness and damping ratio. We also performed longitudinal MRE scans on one of the PMHS over the span of two months to investigate the evolution of tissue properties with post-mortem degradation. In comparison to in vivo subjects of age range 70-75 years, a substantially higher stiffness (mean: 5.96kPa) and lower damping ratio (mean: 0.09) were found in PMHS models. This study also revealed an initial increase in shear stiffness up to the seventh day post-mortem, followed by a steady decrease by the fifty-eighth day. However, the damping ratio displayed an opposite trend to that of shear stiffness. These changes were heterogeneous across brain regions. The collected measurements and analysis elucidate the changes in mechanical properties in post-mortem subjects, and can be used to build and validate computational models of TBI.

">Slow waves generation and propagation in a model of brain lesions</a></h4>

              
                Slow waves (SWs), the hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, reflect the periodic occurrence of transient silent periods in cortical neurons (Down states). During NREM, SWs and Down states physiologically disrupt large-scale network interactions. Since early EEG studies, SWs have also been observed in awake patients after brain injury. Emerging evidence indicates that these intrusions of sleep-like activity interfere with ongoing network activity and contribute to motor and cognitive deficits; yet, the mechanisms governing the generation and spread of post-lesional SWs remain unclear. Here, we extend a neural mass model of EEG to capture transitions between wake-like and sleep-like dynamics and embed it in connectome-based networks with virtual lesions. This model supports that local disfacilitation, topology-dependent propagation, and synchrony-dependent amplification throughout the connectome are sufficient to produce post-lesional SWs. These mechanisms reproduce the spatial gradients of post-lesional SWs seen in patients and identify actionable targets for neuromodulation and rehabilitation.

">Endosomal MrGPRX1 signaling sensitizes TRPV1 to enhance itch</a></h4>

              
                G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and TRPV (transient receptor potential vanilloid) channels are crucial for signal transduction in physiological processes, including neurotransmission, pain, and itch. Downstream effectors of GPCR signaling can directly stimulate TRPV channels or enhance their sensitivity to stimuli, a process known as TRPV sensitization. Traditionally, GPCRs are activated at the cell surface by extracellular agonists, triggering signaling cascades. Recent evidence suggests GPCRs continue to signal from intracellular organelles. The human Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor X1 (MrGPRX1) is a GPCR expressed in primary sensory neurons involved in nociception and pruritus. Recent studies demonstrated how intracellular GPCR signaling regulates neuronal activity. However, there is no evidence characterizing MrGPRX1 trafficking or intracellular signaling. Herein, we characterized MrGPRX1 signaling within the endosomal network and its role in sensitizing TRPV1 channels to enhance itch signaling. Utilizing subcellular targeted biosensors, we demonstrated MrGPRX1 can traffic and signal from endosomes. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that MrGPRX1 internalizes following BAM8-22 stimulation. BRET assays revealed that MrGPRX1 activation induces Gq and {beta}-arrestin-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and early endosomes. Inhibition of dynamin or clathrin blocked BAM8-22-induced MrGPRX1 endocytosis and decreased nuclear extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Calcium signaling confirmed that MrGPRX1-mediated TRPV1 sensitization is mediated by protein kinase C and ERK activation. Our findings reveal a novel role for MrGPRX1 endosomal signaling in TRPV1 sensitization. Understanding the mechanisms of MrGPRX1 signaling offers valuable insights into differentiating between pain and itch pathways, aiding in the development of targeted therapies for chronic pain and persistent itch.

Such prior work has largely used conventional dMRI analysis methods, including the traditional microstructure model, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, these methods are limited in their ability to precisely map microstructural differences and accurately resolve complex fiber configurations. In our study, we investigated white matter microstructure alterations in autism using the refined along-tract analytic approach, BUndle ANalytics (BUAN), with both an advanced microstructure model, the tensor distribution function (TDF) and DTI. We analyzed dMRI data from 365 autistic and neurotypical participants (5 to 24 yr; 34% female) from 10 cohorts to examine commissural and association tracts. Autism was associated with lower fractional anisotropy and higher diffusivity in localized portions of nearly every commissural and association tract examined; these tracts inter-connected a wide range of brain regions, including frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Taken together, BUAN and TDF allow robust and spatially precise mapping of microstructural properties in autism. Our findings rigorously demonstrate that white matter microstructure alterations in autism may be greater within specific regions of individual tracts, and that the implicated tracts are distributed across the brain.</span>

                <p>Diverse network oscillations, thought to represent different information processing modes of cortical networks, are accompanied by synchronous neuronal activity at various temporal scales. Sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, supporting memory consolidation in the hippocampus, are among the fastest physiological oscillations characterized by strong interneuronal synchrony. In contrast, when hippocampal activity turns epileptic, pathological fast-ripple oscillations appear. The distinction of the two oscillations is diagnostically relevant; however, how differential mechanisms of the same network generate the two activities is not well understood. Here we addressed this question using an in vitro hippocampal model that allowed targeted recording of cell types and local pharmacological manipulations in mice of either sex. We showed that inhibition did not contribute to current and rhythm generation of fast-ripples, unlike physiological ripple oscillations. Instead, pathological fast-ripples emerged when perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing basket cells collapsed and depended on the quasi-simultaneous onset of stereotypical pyramidal cell (PC) bursts leading to pseudosynchrony. This was accompanied by a loss of spatial coherence. In epileptogenic conditions, deep CA3 PCs selectively ramped up their burst activity before fast-ripple onset, while normally nonbursting superficial PCs acquired burst capability. These results point to PC pseudosynchrony as the underlying mechanism of fast-ripples, with differential contribution of known PC types.</p>

                <p>Spontaneous thoughts, occupying much of one's awake time in daily life, are often colored by emotional qualities. While spontaneous thoughts have been associated with various neural correlates, the relationship between subjective qualities of ongoing experiences and the brain's sensitivity to bodily signals (i.e., interoception) remains largely unexplored. Given the well-established role of interoception in emotion, clarifying this relationship may elucidate how processes relevant to mental health, such as arousal and anxiety, are regulated. We used EEG and ECG to measure the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), an index of interoceptive processing, while 51 adult participants (34 males, 20 females) visually fixated on a cross image and let their minds wander freely. At pseudorandom intervals, participants reported their momentary level of arousal. This measure of affective arousal was highly variable within and between individuals but was statistically unrelated to several markers of physiological arousal, including the heart rate, heart rate variability, time on task, and EEG alpha power at posterior electrodes. A cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that the HEP amplitude was increased during low relative to high affective arousal in a set of frontal electrodes during the 340&ndash;356&nbsp;ms window after heartbeat onset. This HEP effect was more pronounced in individuals who reported high, relative to low, levels of trait anxiety. Together, our results offer novel evidence that at varying levels of trait anxiety, the brain differentially modulates sensitivity to bodily signals in coordination with the momentary, spontaneous experience of affective arousal&mdash;a mechanism that may operate independently of physiological arousal.</p>

                <p>Music makes people move. This human propensity to coordinate movement with musical rhythm requires multiscale temporal integration, allowing fast sensory events composing rhythmic input to be mapped onto slower, behavior-relevant, internal templates such as periodic beats. Relatedly, beat perception has been shown to involve an enhanced representation of the beat periodicities in neural activity. However, the extent to which this ability to move to the beat and the related "periodized" neural representation are shared across the senses beyond audition remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question by recording separately the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses and finger tapping to a rhythm conveyed either through acoustic or tactile inputs in healthy volunteers of either sex. The EEG responses to the acoustic rhythm, spanning a low-frequency range (below 15&nbsp;Hz), showed enhanced representation of the perceived periodic beat, compatible with behavior. In contrast, the EEG responses to the tactile rhythm, spanning a broader frequency range (up to 25&nbsp;Hz), did not show significant beat-related periodization and yielded less stable tapping. Together, these findings suggest a preferential role of low-frequency neural activity in supporting neural representation of the beat. Most importantly, we show that this neural representation, as well as the ability to move to the beat, is not systematically shared across the senses. More generally, these results, highlighting multimodal differences in beat processing, reveal a process of multiscale temporal integration that allows the auditory system to go beyond mere tracking of onset timing and to support higher-level internal representation and motor entrainment to rhythm.</p>

                <p>Shank3 is an autism spectrum disorder-associated postsynaptic scaffold protein that links glutamate receptors to trafficking and signaling networks within the postsynaptic density. Shank3 is required for synaptic scaling, a form of homeostatic plasticity that bidirectionally modulates postsynaptic strength to stabilize neuronal activity. Shank3 undergoes activity-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at S1586/S1615, and dephosphorylation at these sites is critical for enabling synaptic upscaling. Here, we probe the molecular machinery downstream of Shank3 dephosphorylation that allows for synaptic upscaling in cultured rat neurons of either sex. We first show that a phosphomimetic mutant of Shank3 has reduced binding ability and interaction with long-form Homer1, a postsynaptic protein also crucial for scaling and a known binding partner of Shank3. Since metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been shown to associate with Shank3 through long-form Homer1, we manipulated mGluR1 and mGluR5 signaling with either noncompetitive or competitive inhibitors and found that only competitive inhibition (which targets agonist-dependent signaling) impairs synaptic upscaling. Furthermore, we found that mGluR5 activation rescues synaptic upscaling in the presence of phosphomimetic Shank3 and thus is downstream of Shank3 phosphorylation. Finally, we identify signaling pathways downstream of Group I mGluRs that are necessary for upscaling. Altogether, these data show that activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Shank3 remodels the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR signaling pathway to favor agonist-dependent mGluR signaling, which is necessary to enable synaptic upscaling. More broadly, because downscaling is thought to require agonist-independent mGluR5 signaling, these findings demonstrate that synaptic up- and downscaling rely on distinct functional configurations of the same signaling elements.</p>

                <p>The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian neocortex&mdash;especially in primates&mdash;underpins the emergence of advanced cognitive abilities. This process involved not only increased cortical surface area and neuronal output but also enhanced structural adaptations, such as cortical folding and glial morphological complexity. In this review, we examine the central roles of radial glia (RG) and astrocytes in driving neocortical expansion and evolution. We highlight the emergence of primate- and human-specific genes, which contribute to enhanced RG proliferation and neurogenesis in these species. We further explore how epigenetic regulation and dynamic chromatin architecture modulate RG behavior across species. At the cellular level, we discuss how morphological features&mdash;particularly the basal processes and specialized protrusions of RG&mdash;facilitate access to diverse extrinsic signals, promoting proliferative capacity and cortical complexity. We then turn to cortical folding, focusing on the role of astrocytes, and the functional relevance of folds in supporting brain homeostasis. Finally, we address astrocyte diversity, development, and evolutionary adaptation, with special emphasis on sex differences and primate-specific features. Comparative transcriptomic and morphological studies reveal that human astrocytes exhibit unique molecular signatures, expanded metabolic capacity, and higher morphological complexity. Together, these insights underscore the multifaceted contributions of RG and astrocytes to the evolutionary elaboration of the neocortex. They further provide a framework for understanding how cellular innovations shaped the modern primate brain in general, and human brain specifically.</p>

                <p>The ventral hippocampus (vHPC), initially implicated in anxiety regulation, is now recognized for its broader role in integrating emotional, motivational, and contextual information. This review synthesizes recent insights from rodent research presented at our 2025 Society for Neuroscience minisymposium, detailing how local inhibitory microcircuits, long-range projection&ndash;defined pathways, and neuromodulatory inputs interact to shape fear, anxiety, and reward behaviors. We emphasize how distinct circuits segregate fear and anxiety, resolve approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts, and integrate reward history. Serotonergic modulation, particularly from the median raphe, emerges as a critical regulator of vHPC dynamics, with pronounced sex-specific functional implications. Finally, we examine how vCA1 ensemble activity encodes emotionally salient stimuli and supports latent state inference, thereby enabling flexible decision-making under uncertainty. Collectively, these findings recast the vHPC as a modular, computationally rich structure essential for adaptive behavior, which may provide new insights into circuit-level dysfunction in affective disorders.</p>

                <p>Pain is a symptom common to a wide variety of conditions and one that severely impacts an individual's everyday life, as well as having broader socioeconomic repercussions. In recent years, there has been spectacularly rapid progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of sensory neuron function and pain in preclinical models. However, the number of analgesics interacting with novel targets that have received regulatory approval in recent years has been limited. Examples include monoclonal antibody and small molecule therapies disrupting calcitonin gene-related peptide signaling for treating migraine and, most recently, suzetrigine, a small molecular inhibitor of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.8 subunit. In this review, we step away from focusing on the sensory neuron as the transmitter of nociceptive information and examine the role of non-neuronal cells in modulating sensory neuron activity. One potential appeal of disrupting the activity of peripherally located non-neuronal cells is the likely bypassing of side effects associated with modulating a target receptor that is expressed by neurons within both the peripheral and central nervous systems, although targeting of peripheral, non-neuronal cells will not of course necessarily be side effect-free. Here, we examine the key roles of non-neuronal cells in orchestrating pain across a diverse set of conditions, from joint pain to bone pain, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, Fabry disease, and chronic pain in general.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is essential for monitoring ongoing behavior, regulating affect, and guiding social interactions. Altered ACC structure and function are implicated in a host of psychiatric disorders, most notably major depressive disorder. Thus, cross talk between basic and translational research is needed to drive the next generation of treatments. The human and nonhuman primate ACC is large and can be subdivided based on anatomical structure and connectivity. Increasingly, studies of the ACC point to unique functions for its distinct areas. This review highlights recent work aimed at understanding of the structure and function of distinct portions of the ACC and the role of these regions in cognition and affect in higher species. We focus on the roles and subregions that might guide the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders. This includes discussion of in-depth anatomical investigations that have revealed that distinct portions of the subgenual and perigenual ACC areas are driven by unique afferent paths. Furthermore, we describe neurophysiological recordings of single-neuron and local field potential activity, combined with carefully designed behavioral tasks or novel approaches to discerning affective states, which have revealed the neural mechanisms engaged in ACC during affective experience and assessment of conspecifics. We present noninvasive and invasive neuromodulation approaches that target the ACC to treat depression and have been shown to be most effective when they change activity within subgenual parts of ACC and may structurally remodel the connections of this area. Finally, we review new approaches to uncover upstream drivers and downstream effectors of ACC activity in higher species, including functional changes implicated in health, disease, and recovery.</p>

                <p>Successful navigation and interactions with objects in a complex, three-dimensional (3D) world are essential to survival, yet studies of the neural basis of visual perception and action often treat the world as a flat, two-dimensional (2D) canvas. Here, we review recent discoveries about how the visual systems of different mammals have adapted under the constraint of a 3D world. Many neurons in primate visual cortex are sensitive to 3D depth cues constructed from input differences to the two eyes (binocular disparities). Similar neuronal selectivity has recently been characterized in tree shrews and mice, though constrained anatomically and functionally. Disparity-sensitive receptive field structures can now be assessed noninvasively across human visual cortex and functionally linked to depth perception. At later stages in the nonhuman primate (NHP) ventral ("what") pathway, supporting object recognition, complex 3D objects are represented as spatial configurations of geometric parts. In studies of the dorsal ("where"/"how") pathway of NHPs, underlying visuospatial processing, the inclusion of 3D structure in visual tasks has established tighter links between neuronal mechanisms and perception. This has also revealed neuronal representations of 3D object position and orientation that are tolerant to 3D gaze location, providing a basis for robust perception and action. The cross-species analysis presented here provides new perspectives on neural coding mechanisms underpinning the richness of 3D visual experience. Elucidation of these mechanisms will be essential for understanding the neural basis of cognition and behavior, which in turn will enable the development of therapies and neuroprosthetics for those suffering from visual impairments.</p>

                <p>The visual system is a complex hierarchical structure that processes diverse visual information to guide cognition and behavior. Elucidating the principles that govern the development and function of the visual system's circuitry is a central goal in visual neuroscience. This review examines connectivity, computation, and plasticity within the early mammalian visual system, focusing on three key structures: the retina, the superior colliculus (SC), and the primary visual cortex (V1). The retina serves as the initial site for visual information processing, culminating in activation of highly selective retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which convey all visual information to the brain. The SC is a primary retinorecipient region that integrates visual information to guide appropriate behavioral responses, exhibiting visual processing both similar to and distinct from RGCs. Retinal information is also relayed via the thalamus to V1, which extracts detailed visual features through spatial and temporal integration, forming the basis of conscious visual perception. The development of these structures involves a coarse-to-fine maturation of functional networks driven by intrinsic mechanisms, including molecular cues and spontaneous patterns of activity. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity in the SC and V1 allows the visual system to adapt to changes of sensory inputs during development. Recent work has significantly advanced our understanding of the complex neuronal computations executed in these early visual regions and the molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying development and plasticity. This knowledge has significant implications for both basic neuroscience and clinical applications, particularly in the context of visual system disorders.</p>

                <p>Hebbian synaptic plasticity is currently the main framework to relate neuronal activity, network structure, and learning and memory. However, recent experimental and computational modeling studies have revealed a new form of synaptic plasticity termed behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). It is triggered by dendritic plateau potentials associated with somatic burst firing, causes large changes in synaptic strength in a single shot, and operates on the timescale of seconds. Here we review the recent advances in our understanding of the circuit, cellular, and molecular mechanisms of BTSP, its prevalence in the brain, its role in shaping neuronal representations, and the emerging ideas regarding its contribution to different forms of learning.</p>

                <p>Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) affect millions annually, leading to devastating neurobehavioral consequences and increasing risk for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. However, therapies are lacking. Starting in 2018, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome was identified as an acute, and potentially chronic, pathology originating from TBI. Recent studies established that the microbiome contributes to the evolution of TBI pathology and functional impairments. The gut microbiome is the collection of microorganisms that inhabit the stomach through colon and is indicated as a contributor to myriad neurological and psychiatric conditions. This makes it an intriguing target to understand in the context of TBI. Thus, this review focuses on the evidence establishing the gut as a modulator of TBI and the major potential mechanisms by which this occurs. This includes regulation of food processing into host-usable nutrients, inflammatory signaling, and vagus nerve modulation. Each of these areas provides potential for future therapeutic development and intervention but there are also multiple areas where microbiome-TBI science could be improved.</p>

                <p>Perception and action are deeply intertwined processes that require the nervous system to distinguish between self-generated (reafferent) and externally generated (exafferent) sensory inputs. To maintain accurate perception during movement, the brain must attenuate predictable sensory consequences of its own actions while remaining sensitive to unexpected external events. Reafference attenuation is a temporally precise process that suppresses expected feedback, facilitating the detection of novel stimuli. This review examines reafference attenuation across species (rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans) and sensory systems (vestibular, auditory, and tactile). We also discuss sensory gating (or sensory suppression), a broader and often less selective mechanism that inhibits both self- and externally generated inputs. Although both mechanisms reduce sensory inflow during movement, they differ in function, specificity, and temporal dynamics, and despite growing insight into their underlying circuitry, important questions remain about their generality and implementation.</p>

                <p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse essential for effective motor neuron&ndash;muscle communication and is increasingly recognized as a vulnerable site in aging and neuromuscular disease. While traditionally considered a final common pathway for motor deficits, accumulating evidence demonstrates that NMJ dysfunction is an early and critical driver of disease onset and progression in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Charcot&ndash;Marie&ndash;Tooth disease. This review highlights shared and disease-specific mechanisms contributing to NMJ impairment, including presynaptic, postsynaptic, and perisynaptic Schwann cell defects in these diseases. We also discuss age-related changes at the NMJ, emphasizing its role in sarcopenia and muscle weakness in older adults. Furthermore, we explore emerging molecular drivers of NMJ dysfunction uncovered through studies in congenital myasthenic syndromes, autoimmune disorders, and advanced omics approaches. By integrating insights across diseases and aging, we underscore the potential for shared therapeutic strategies aimed at stabilizing NMJ function. Promising interventions targeting presynaptic neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic excitability, and perisynaptic Schwann cells are discussed as avenues to improve neuromuscular transmission and maintain muscle strength. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in translating these mechanistic insights into clinical therapies and highlight how novel human neuromuscular organoid models and advanced molecular profiling can bridge this gap. Together, these insights establish the NMJ as a critical, modifiable target for preserving motor function across neuromuscular diseases and aging.</p>

                <p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for our ability to rapidly and flexibly adapt our behavior in new environments based on our previous experience. Despite its importance, the neural substrates and mechanisms by which the PFC supports this function have long remained enigmatic. Recent advances, however, have begun to change this. An increasingly large body of work suggests the PFC represents structured relationships&mdash;both among states of the outside world and between internally generated actions. In this review, we describe work from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans to draw attention to the breadth of such representations and how they support flexible behavior. Across species, the PFC appears to represent the relational structure of problems: how stimuli relate to one another in cognitive maps or how different behaviors relate to one another when pursuing a goal. These results have started to reveal shared computational principles for PFC that generalize from rodents to humans and have inspired formal computational models and simulations. By reviewing experimental work showing both correlation and causation through invasive and noninvasive methods, along with theoretical work using artificial neural networks, we aim to highlight similarities and differences between species and models to provide a common language for interpreting findings in PFC. This will move us closer to a mechanistic understanding of the PFC that scales across tasks and species.</p>

                <p>Down syndrome (DS) is a common and recognizable genetic condition. Altered neurodevelopmental programs caused by trisomy 21 lead to the hallmark intellectual disability in early life. The increased lifespan of individuals with DS in the latter half of the twentieth century revealed the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) earlier and with a higher prevalence in individuals with DS than in the general population. Thus, neuropathology in DS progresses along a continuum from prenatal disruptions to the manifestations of age-related conditions and AD. This review discusses our current understanding of the mechanisms of altered neurodevelopment and the precocious onset of AD in DS. We highlight the gaps in our understanding of how neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration are linked and describe how advancements in molecular technology and computational modeling are revealing molecular neuropathology in DS across the lifespan.</p>

                <p>First discovered by Golgi, perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrices that surround various neuron types in the nervous system. They have been found to emerge at the end of developmental critical periods and serve as "molecular brakes" on plasticity. Perineuronal nets have traditionally been studied in the context of sensory and cognitive plasticity, but recent studies extend their contributions to brain plasticity involved in substance use disorders, metabolism, neurodegeneration, and more. This review will summarize recent discoveries about the functions of PNNs across diverse circuits, contexts, and species, across different stages of life, and between disease and nondisease states and will integrate fundamental and clinical studies to identify conserved and novel functions of PNNs. Given the recent map of extensive PNN expression, we hope to encourage investigators researching diverse neural systems to examine PNN contributions to circuit function and behavior.</p>

In addition, growing attention has been directed toward the molecular mechanisms governing adenosine production and its downstream signaling pathways, both of which hold great promise as therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights recent progress in detecting adenosine, unraveling its signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo, and understanding how it regulates brain function under physiological and pathological conditions.</p>

                <p>Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the major lipid transport protein in the brain. Produced primarily by astrocytes and microglia, it delivers cholesterol and other lipids for membrane repair, synaptic maintenance, and immune regulation. Through interactions with specific lipid receptors, APOE maintains neuronal and vascular health. The <I>APOE</I> 4 allele (APOE4), carried by approximately one-quarter of the population, has an altered protein conformation, which reduces lipid transport efficiency and modifies receptor binding. These changes disrupt lipid homeostasis, increase risk of chronic unresolved neuroinflammation and vascular inflammation, and cause breakdown of the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB), thus increasing neuronal vulnerability to disease pathology and elevating risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we organize the effects of APOE4 into three interconnected "hits" that modulate disease progression: disrupted lipid handling, neurovascular inflammation, and neuronal dysfunction. These interconnected hits help explain why amyloid- and tau-directed therapies alone have modest success in treating AD, particularly in APOE4 carriers. We review emerging APOE-related therapeutic strategies designed to address these mechanisms directly, including structure correctors to restore normal protein folding, agents that enhance lipidation and receptor-mediated lipid transport, approaches that modulate downstream inflammatory responses, and gene therapies aimed at isoform switching or allele silencing. By aligning therapeutic strategies with specific aspects of APOE4 biology, such approaches have the potential to provide broader and safer benefits, complement existing disease-modifying therapies, and improve outcomes for individuals at heightened genetic risk of AD.</p>

                <p>Inspired by recent discoveries of neural populations that track time for specific moments (time cells) and elapsed durations (temporal context and periodic time cells), this review, based on a minisymposium presented at the 2025 annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, brings together macro-, meso-, and micro-scale neural evidence to formulate hypotheses about how episodic time&mdash;the tracking and organizing of events in time as we experience, store, and retrieve them from memory&mdash;is coded and processed in the mammalian brain. We also discuss computational principles and relationships to other related phenomena such as memory replay and emotional states.</p>

                <p>Perceptual decision-making is the process by which sensory evidence is combined with prior knowledge and transformed into possible movement plans according to a rule or policy. Classic studies suggested that perceptual decisions emerge from a feedforward hierarchy of brain areas with distinct functions and fairly homogeneous neural representations. However, more recent findings argue that decisions emerge from distributed, recurrent computations across many brain areas (a "heterarchy") with complex, heterogeneous representations. How can we make sense of these findings in a way that preserves the computational elegance of the conventional view? In this review, we describe how a new generation of studies is leveraging high-density electrophysiology, incisive task designs, causal manipulations (e.g., optogenetics) and statistical approaches for probing inter-area communication, and theoretical methods that connect population dynamics with representational geometry to build a modern framework for understanding perceptual decisions.</p>

                <p>During development, inner hair cells (IHCs) in the mammalian cochlea are unresponsive to acoustic stimuli but instead exhibit spontaneous activity. During this same period, neurons originating from the medial olivocochlear (MOC) complex transiently innervate IHCs, regulating their firing pattern which is crucial for the correct development of the auditory pathway. Although the MOC-IHC is a cholinergic synapse, previous evidence indicates the widespread presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling markers, including presynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R). In this study, we explore the source of GABA by optogenetically activating either cholinergic or GABAergic fibers. The optogenetic stimulation of MOC terminals from GAD;ChR2-eYFP and ChAT;ChR2-eYFP mice (of either sex) evoked synaptic currents in IHCs, which were blocked by &alpha;-bungarotoxin. This suggests that GABAergic fibers release acetylcholine (ACh) and activate &alpha;9&alpha;10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Additionally, MOC cholinergic fibers release not only ACh but also GABA, as the effect of GABA on ACh response amplitude was prevented by applying a GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R blocker. Using optical neurotransmitter detection and calcium imaging techniques, we examined the extent of GABAergic modulation at the single synapse level. Our findings suggest heterogeneity in GABA modulation, as only 15 out of 31 recorded synaptic sites were modulated by applying the GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R specific antagonist, CGP 35348 (100&ndash;200&nbsp;&micro;M). In conclusion, we provide evidence indicating that GABA and ACh are co-released from at least a subset of MOC terminals. In this circuit, GABA functions as a negative feedback mechanism, locally regulating the extent of cholinergic inhibition at certain efferent-&gt;IHC synapses during an immature stage.</p>

                <p>Social animals compete for rewards to survive, yet the neural circuits underlying reward-based social competition remain unclear. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in reward processing and social dominance, but whether its subregions contribute differently to competitions for reward remains unknown. Using c-Fos mapping in male CD1 mice, we examined reward-induced neural activation in mPFC subregions and key interconnected subcortical areas across social and nonsocial reward contexts. Noncompetitive social contexts produced global c-Fos activation relative to competitive contexts. Cross-regional correlation analyses revealed that receiving rewards in isolation involved widespread network coordination, while social contexts exhibited distinct, sparse correlation patterns. Surprisingly, social rank effects on neural activity were most pronounced during isolated reward experiences rather than during competition, with dominant mice showing increased anterior cingulate, basolateral amygdala, and hippocampal activation when alone. Different dominance ranks (reward-based, territorial, and agonistic) correlated with distinct neural activity patterns across contexts. Overall, our results show that social context fundamentally reorganizes prefrontal&ndash;subcortical networks during reward processing in a social rank-dependent manner. These results provide new insights into how social rank shapes the neural basis of reward processing across different social contexts.</p>

                Background The theory of Observational Relativity (OR), as a new theory in human-developed physics, has revealed the essence of the relativistic effects of Einstein theory of relativity, and moreover, has generalized and unified Newton’s classical mechanics and Einstein’s relativity theory. However, the original intention of OR research is not to establish the theory of OR, but to give photons a little rest mass. According to Einstein special relativity, an object of matter moving in inertial spacetime has two types of mass: the rest mass; the moving mass. However, Einstein claimed that photons had no the rest mass. In fact, the moving mass depends on observation and is not objectively real. So, photons would have no mass if they had no the rest mass. Methods According to the materialist view of nature, the natural world is a world of matter, and all matter or material particles, including photons, have the objectively intrinsic mass. Naturally, the objectively real mass must be independent of observation. OR serial report 1 has elucidate the theoretical validity and empirical basis of OR. Now, OR serial report 2 will report the logical consequence of OR: photons have the rest mass. Results The theory of Inertial OR (IOR) has theoretically proved that photons possess the rest mass; the theory of Gravitational OR (GOR) has theoretically calculated and predicted that the rest mass of a photon with the frequency f is mo = hf/c 2. Conclusions The logical consequence that photons has the rest mass are in line with the materialist view of nature: all matter or material particles must possess the objectively real mass; an object of matter, whether it is a massive star or a tiny photon, must possess the rest mass of its own if it exists objectively; otherwise, it does not exist.

                <p>by Lin Yuan, Boyuan Meng, Qingxiang Wang, Chunyu Hu, Cuihong Wang, De-Shuang Huang</p>

The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) has made it possible to effectively integrate gene expression and spatial information of cells and accurately identify spatial domains. A large number of deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to perform spatial domain identification and achieved impressive results. However, these methods have some limitations. First, these methods rely on a fixed similarity metric and cannot fully utilize neighborhood information. Second, they cannot efficiently and adaptively integrate key information when fusing and reconstructing gene expression using purely additive methods. Finally, these methods ignore key nonlinear features and introduce noise during clustering. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DL model SpaMWGDA based on multi-view weighted fused graph convolutional network (GCN) and data augmentation. By modeling spatial information using different similarity metrics, the model is able to successfully capture comprehensive neighborhood information of the spot features. By combining data augmentation and contrastive learning, SpaMWGDA is able to learn key gene expressions. SpaMWGDA uses a multi-view GCN encoder to model the similarities between spatial information and gene features, and uses a view-level attention mechanism for weighted fusion to adaptively learn the dependencies between them and learn the key features of each view. Experimental results not only demonstrate that SpaMWGDA outperforms competing methods in spatial domain identification and trajectory inference but also show the ability of SpaMWGDA to analyse tissue structure and function. The source code for SpaMWGDA is available at https://github.com/nathanyl/SpaMWGDA .

                <p>by Quentin Bateux, Jonathan Koss, Patrick W. Sweeney, Erika Edwards, Nelson Rios, Aaron M. Dollar</p>

The digitization of natural history collections over the past three decades has unlocked a treasure trove of specimen imagery and metadata. There is great interest in making this data more useful by further labeling it with additional trait data, and modern “deep learning” machine learning techniques utilizing convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and similar networks show particular promise to reduce the amount of required manual labeling by human experts, making the process much faster and less expensive. However, in most cases, the accuracy of these approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling, typically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and validate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by examining the “confidence” that the network has in the generated label as well as utilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen level. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can achieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the labels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher confidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the statistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to move these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to being an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of ways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000 herbarium specimens. The analysis of the results points at under-investigated correlations as well as general alignment with known trends. By sharing this new dataset alongside this work, we want to allow biologists to gather insights for their own research questions, at their chosen point of accuracy/coverage trade-off.

                <p>by P. Catalina Chaparro-Pedraza, Claudia Bank</p>

To what extent is biodiversity shaped by environmental conditions, and to what extent is it the result of self-organization? Both natural processes and organismal properties may contribute to promoting diversity. Here, we show that one such process, namely natural selection, and an organismal property, namely life history, interact in a feedback mechanism that promotes the emergence of diversity. We illustrate how this mechanism operates using various models of ecological diversification driven by intraspecific resource competition, in which both a niche trait that determines resource use and a life history trait can evolve. We find that natural selection acting on life history traits leads to increased competition, which, in the presence of ecological opportunity, facilitates niche diversification. As a consequence, the environmental conditions for diversification are more restrictive in the absence of life history evolution than in its presence. Our findings indicate a strong influence of life history evolution on ecological processes that in turn shape the origin of biodiversity. Our results call for a better integration of life history evolution and niche diversification in both theoretical and empirical realms.

                <p>by Tahnée Engelen, Teresa Schuhmann, Alexander T. Sack, Catherine Tallon-Baudry</p>

Interoception refers to the brain’s sensing of internal body state and encompasses various bodily systems, notably the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms. Beyond their roles in physiological regulation and emotional states, each of these visceral rhythms has been shown to influence brain activity and cognition, prompting for the development of various interpretative functional frameworks. However, both experimental data and functional hypothesis leave it unclear whether and how each visceral rhythm acts simultaneously and independently on brain activity. Here, we address this question by measuring in human participants how the corticospinal excitability of the motor system varies with the phase of each of the three visceral rhythms. We applied single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand region in primary motor cortex to elicit Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs), whose amplitude reflects corticospinal excitability, and tested whether MEP amplitude depends on the phase of the simultaneously measured cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms. All three visceral rhythms were coupled to motor excitability with similar effect sizes at the group level. However, we found no relation between coupling strengths: participants displaying high coupling with one organ did not necessarily display high coupling to the other organs. These results indicate that independent mechanisms could underly the coupling between the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms and motor excitability. We further introduce the concept of individual interoceptive profiles and show that such interoceptive profiles obtained from objective coupling strength measures were not explained by self-reported awareness of the organ. Altogether, our results call for refined specifications of the frameworks offering a functional or clinical interpretation of viscera–brain coupling taking into account both independent mechanisms and individual interoceptive profiles.

                <p>by Pierre-Yves Barelle, Fabienne Schaller, Soyoung Park, Emilie Caron, Jessica Klucznik, Phillipe Ciofi, Françoise Muscatelli, Sebastien G. Bouret</p>

The hypothalamus is crucial for regulating essential bodily functions, including energy balance. It is an exceedingly complex and heterogeneous brain region that contains a variety of neuronal systems that are interconnected with each other. Among these, the melanocortin system, which comprises pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, displays a remarkable anatomical relationship with oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVH). Here, we demonstrate that OT neurons are instrumental in the development of the melanocortin system in mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of OT neurons during the first postnatal week selectively disrupts POMC and AgRP projections to the PVH, without affecting other target nuclei like the dorsomedial nucleus. This developmental role is age-dependent, as silencing OT neurons in juvenile or adult stages has no impact on melanocortin circuits. OT neurons release various neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, and their secretion can be modulated by chemogenetic manipulation. Expressing the botulinum toxin serotype B light chain in OT neurons reveals that their developmental actions rely on SNARE-mediated exocytosis. Moreover, administering an OT receptor antagonist during the first postnatal week leads to similar melanocortin circuit defects and long-term metabolic effects. Furthermore, neonatal chemogenetic activation of OT neurons rescues POMC circuit deficits in a mouse model of Prader–Willi Syndrome. These findings reveal that OT acts as a paracrine neurotrophic factor orchestrating the development of melanocortin circuits during a restricted neonatal critical period.

<p>Nematodes possess simple nervous systems yet show broad ecological diversity. In the fungal-feeding plant-parasitic nematode <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, we identified type V neurons in the amphid. These neurons, likely associated with the stylet, have trifurcated cilia and may have a potential mechanosensory role in triggering stylet-thrusting behavior against fungal or plant cells.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Understanding how animals perceive environmental stimuli is essential for reconstructing the evolution of their sensory systems. Nematodes provide a useful model for studying sensory adaptation due to their relatively simple nervous systems and broad ecological diversity. The amphid, the primary sensory organ in nematodes, has been well characterized in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and other bacterivorous species. However, comparatively little is known about amphid structures in nematodes with different ecological niches.​ In this study, we performed serial section transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of amphid neurons in <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, a fungal-feeding, plant-parasitic nematode. We identified 13 amphid neurons, five of which showed a distinct morphology and are designated as type V neurons.These neurons were previously described as outer accessory cilia in other stylet-bearing nematodes, and had not been observed in bacterivorous species. Type V neurons exhibited trifurcated cilia that extended toward each lip and were structurally reminiscent of mechanosensory neurons.​ The presence of type V neurons only in stylet-bearing nematodes is consistent with the hypothesis that these neurons may have evolved in association with the stylet. Their trifurcated cilia suggest a potential role in detecting mechanical cues during lip contact with substrates, which could trigger stylet ejection. Alternatively, they may also contribute to other sensory modalities. Our findings reveal that fungal-feeding plant-parasitic nematodes possess amphid sensory architectures that differ markedly from those of bacterivorous species.</p>
