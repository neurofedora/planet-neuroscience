                arXiv:2409.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how external stimuli propagate in neural systems is an important challenge in the fields of neuroscience and nonlinear dynamics. Despite extensive studies over several decades, this problem remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine a simple "toy model" of an excitable medium, a linear chain of diffusely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons, and analyze the transmission of a sinusoidal signal injected into one of the neurons at the ends of the chain. We measure to what extent the propagation of the wave reaching the opposite end is affected by the frequency and amplitude of the signal. To quantify these effects, we measure the cross-correlation between the time-series of the membrane potentials of the end neurons.This measure allows, for instance, to detect threshold values of the parameters, delimiting regimes where wave propagation occurs or not.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16533">The signal synchronization function of myelin</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The myelinated axons are widely present in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Its unique compact spiraling structure poses significant challenges to understanding its biological functions and developmental mechanisms. Conventionally, myelin is considered as an insulating layer to achieve saltatory conduction for the enhancement of the neural signal speed, which serves as the foundation of neuroscience. However, this insulating hypothesis is inadequate to account for various experimental observations, especially the long unmyelinated tract observed in the cortex. We here show non-random distributions in three ultrastructural features of myelin: the non-random spiraling directions, the localization preferences of myelin outer tongues, and the radial components along boundaries between oppositely spiraled myelin sheaths. These phenomena are predicted by a novel concept of myelin biological function, which we propose as the signal synchronization function. Our findings demonstrate that cytoplasmic channels within myelin may act as coiled inductors, facilitating electromagnetic induction between adjacent myelin sheaths, and thereby promoting signal synchronization between axons. This, in turn, explains the non-random ultrastructural features observed. We believe these insights lay the foundation for a new understanding of myelin inductive function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16552">Device for detection of activity-dependent changes in neural spheroids at MHz and GHz frequencies</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracellular processes triggered by neural activity include changes in ionic concentrations, protein release, and synaptic vesicle cycling. These processes play significant roles in neurological disorders. The beneficial effects of brain stimulation may also be mediated through intracellular changes. There is a lack of label-free techniques for monitoring activity-dependent intracellular changes. Electromagnetic (EM) waves at frequencies larger than 1x10^6 Hz (1 MHz) were previously used to probe intracellular contents of cells, as cell membrane becomes transparent at this frequency range. EM waves interact with membranes of intracellular organelles, proteins, and water in the MHz-GHz range. In this work, we developed a device for probing the interaction between intracellular contents of active neurons and EM waves. The device used an array of grounded coplanar waveguides (GCPWs) to deliver EM waves to a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid of rat cortical neurons. Neural activity was evoked using optogenetics, with synchronous detection of propagation of EM waves. Broadband measurements were conducted in the MHz-GHz range to track changes in transmission coefficients. Neuronal activity was found to reversibly alter EM wave transmission. Pharmacological suppression of neuronal activity abolished changes in transmission. Time constants of changes in transmission were in the range of seconds to tens of seconds, suggesting the presence of relatively slow, activity-dependent intracellular processes. This study provides the first evidence that EM transmission through neuronal tissue is activity-dependent in MHz-GHz range. Device developed in this work may find future applications in studies of the mechanisms of neurological disorders and the development of new therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16322">Towards Within-Class Variation in Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Spontaneous Speech</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.16322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection has emerged as a promising research area that employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Unlike conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Given that many AD detection tasks lack fine-grained labels, simplistic binary classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class differences and instance-level imbalance. The former compels the model to map AD samples with varying degrees of impairment to a single diagnostic label, disregarding certain changes in cognitive function. While the latter biases the model towards overrepresented severity levels. This work presents early efforts to address these challenges. We propose two novel methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve detection accuracy. Further analysis reveals that SoTD effectively harnesses the strengths of multiple component models, while InRe substantially alleviates model over-fitting. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and reliable AD detection models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16422">Is All Learning (Natural) Gradient Descent?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.16422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that a wide class of effective learning rules -- those that improve a scalar performance measure over a given time window -- can be rewritten as natural gradient descent with respect to a suitably defined loss function and metric. Specifically, we show that parameter updates within this class of learning rules can be expressed as the product of a symmetric positive definite matrix (i.e., a metric) and the negative gradient of a loss function. We also demonstrate that these metrics have a canonical form and identify several optimal ones, including the metric that achieves the minimum possible condition number. The proofs of the main results are straightforward, relying only on elementary linear algebra and calculus, and are applicable to continuous-time, discrete-time, stochastic, and higher-order learning rules, as well as loss functions that explicitly depend on time.

                arXiv:2409.16838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at clean image classification, they struggle to classify images corrupted with different common corruptions, limiting their real-world applicability. Recent work has shown that incorporating a CNN front-end block that simulates some features of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Here, we expand on this approach by introducing two novel biologically-inspired CNN model families that incorporate a new front-end block designed to simulate pre-cortical visual processing. RetinaNet, a hybrid architecture containing the novel front-end followed by a standard CNN back-end, shows a relative robustness improvement of 12.3% when compared to the standard model; and EVNet, which further adds a V1 block after the pre-cortical front-end, shows a relative gain of 18.5%. The improvement in robustness was observed for all the different corruption categories, though accompanied by a small decrease in clean image accuracy, and generalized to a different back-end architecture. These findings show that simulating multiple stages of early visual processing in CNN early layers provides cumulative benefits for model robustness.

Abstract: In this paper we present a concise mathematical description of active inference in discrete time. The main part of the paper serves as a basic introduction to the topic, including a detailed example illustrating the theory on action selection. In the appendix the more subtle mathematical details are discussed. This part is aimed at readers who have already studied the active inference literature but struggle to make sense of the mathematical details and derivations. Throughout the whole manuscript, special attention has been paid to adopting notation that is both precise and in line with standard mathematical texts. All equations and derivations are linked to specific equation numbers in other popular text on the topic. Furthermore, Python code is provided that implements the action selection mechanism described in this paper and is compatible with pymdp environments.

Abstract: We present a multi-scale differentiable brain modeling workflow utilizing BrainPy, a unique differentiable brain simulator that combines accurate brain simulation with powerful gradient-based optimization. We leverage this capability of BrainPy across different brain scales. At the single-neuron level, we implement differentiable neuron models and employ gradient methods to optimize their fit to electrophysiological data. On the network level, we incorporate connectomic data to construct biologically constrained network models. Finally, to replicate animal behavior, we train these models on cognitive tasks using gradient-based learning rules. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance and speed in fitting generalized leaky integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley single neuron models. Additionally, training a biologically-informed network of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons on working memory tasks successfully replicates observed neural activity and synaptic weight distributions. Overall, our differentiable multi-scale simulation approach offers a promising tool to bridge neuroscience data across electrophysiological, anatomical, and behavioral scales.

                arXiv:2409.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most advanced algorithms in numerical black-box optimization. For noisy objective functions, several approaches were proposed to mitigate the noise, e.g., re-evaluations of the same solution or adapting the population size.
  In this paper, we devise a novel method to adaptively choose the optimal re-evaluation number for function values corrupted by additive Gaussian white noise. We derive a theoretical lower bound of the expected improvement achieved in one iteration of CMA-ES, given an estimation of the noise level and the Lipschitz constant of the function's gradient. Solving for the maximum of the lower bound, we obtain a simple expression of the optimal re-evaluation number.
  We experimentally compare our method to the state-of-the-art noise-handling methods for CMA-ES on a set of artificial test functions across various noise levels, optimization budgets, and dimensionality.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in solving both linear and nonlinear systems of equations, comparing their performance to traditional methods such as Gaussian Elimination, Newton's Method, and Levenberg-Marquardt. The GA consistently delivered accurate solutions across various test cases, demonstrating its robustness and flexibility. A key advantage of the GA is its ability to explore the solution space broadly, uncovering multiple sets of solutions -- a feat that traditional methods, which typically converge to a single solution, cannot achieve. This feature proved especially beneficial in complex nonlinear systems, where multiple valid solutions exist, highlighting the GA's superiority in navigating intricate solution landscapes.

                arXiv:2409.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.

Abstract: Designing a cost-effective sensor placement plan for sewage surveillance is a crucial task because it allows cost-effective early pandemic outbreak detection as supplementation for individual testing. However, this problem is computationally challenging to solve, especially for massive sewage networks having complicated topologies. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a multi-objective optimization problem to consider the conflicting objectives and put forward a novel evolutionary greedy algorithm (EG) to enable efficient and effective optimization for large-scale directed networks. The proposed model is evaluated on both small-scale synthetic networks and a large-scale, real-world sewage network in Hong Kong. The experiments on small-scale synthetic networks demonstrate a consistent efficiency improvement with reasonable optimization performance and the real-world application shows that our method is effective in generating optimal sensor placement plans to guide policy-making.

Abstract: Training machine learning models based on neural networks requires large datasets, which may contain sensitive information. The models, however, should not expose private information from these datasets. Differentially private SGD [DP-SGD] requires the modification of the standard stochastic gradient descent [SGD] algorithm for training new models. In this short paper, a novel regularization strategy is proposed to achieve the same goal in a more efficient manner.

                arXiv:2405.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common goal in evolutionary multi-objective optimization is to find suitable finite-size approximations of the Pareto front of a given multi-objective optimization problem. While many multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have proven to be very efficient in finding good Pareto front approximations, they may need quite a few resources or may even fail to obtain optimal or nearly approximations. Hereby, optimality is implicitly defined by the chosen performance indicator. In this work, we propose a set-based Newton method for Hausdorff approximations of the Pareto front to be used within multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. To this end, we first generalize the previously proposed Newton step for the performance indicator for the treatment of constrained problems for general reference sets. To approximate the target Pareto front, we propose a particular strategy for generating the reference set that utilizes the data gathered by the evolutionary algorithm during its run. Finally, we show the benefit of the Newton method as a post-processing step on several benchmark test functions and different base evolutionary algorithms.

                arXiv:2409.14248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions, has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higherorder-ReLU (HR), which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, Bsplines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential to physicsinformed neural networks. We name such KANs with Higher-order-ReLU (HR) as their activations, HRKANs. Our detailed experiments on two famous and representative PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLU-KANs and HRKANs. The codes to replicate our experiments are available at https://github.com/kelvinhkcs/HRKAN.

                <p>Conscious reportability of visual input is associated with a bimodal neural response in the primary visual cortex (V1): an early-latency response coupled to stimulus features and a late-latency response coupled to stimulus report or detection. This late wave of activity, central to major theories of consciousness, is thought to be driven by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), responsible for "igniting" it. Here we analyzed two electrophysiological studies in mice performing different stimulus detection tasks and characterized neural activity profiles in three key cortical regions: V1, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and PFC. We then developed a minimal network model, constrained by known connectivity between these regions, reproducing the spatiotemporal propagation of visual- and report-related activity. Remarkably, while PFC was indeed necessary to generate report-related activity in V1, this occurred only through the mediation of PPC. PPC, and not PFC, had the final veto in enabling the report-related late wave of V1 activity.</p>

                <p>Recording and analysis of neural activity are often biased toward detecting sparse subsets of highly active neurons, masking important signals carried in low-magnitude and variable responses. To investigate the contribution of seemingly noisy activity to odor encoding, we used mesoscale calcium imaging from mice of both sexes to record odor responses from the dorsal surface of bilateral olfactory bulbs (OBs). The outer layer of the mouse OB is comprised of dendrites organized into discrete "glomeruli," which are defined by odor receptor-specific sensory neuron input. We extracted activity from a large population of glomeruli and used logistic regression to classify odors from individual trials with high accuracy. We then used add-in and dropout analyses to determine subsets of glomeruli necessary and sufficient for odor classification. Classifiers successfully predicted odor identity even after excluding sparse, highly active glomeruli, indicating that odor information is redundantly represented across a large population of glomeruli. Additionally, we found that random forest (RF) feature selection informed by Gini inequality (RF Gini impurity, RFGI) reliably ranked glomeruli by their contribution to overall odor classification. RFGI provided a measure of "feature importance" for each glomerulus that correlated with intuitive features like response magnitude. Finally, in agreement with previous work, we found that odor information persists in glomerular activity after the odor offset. Together, our findings support a model of OB odor coding where sparse activity is sufficient for odor identification, but information is widely, redundantly available across a large population of glomeruli, with each glomerulus representing information about more than one odor.</p>

                <p>Oligodendrocyte myelination and remyelination after injury are intricately regulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including transcriptional regulators. Among these, the zinc-finger protein ZFP488 is an oligodendrocyte-enriched transcriptional regulator that promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation in the developing neural tube and in oligodendroglial cell lines. However, the specific in vivo genetic requirements for ZFP488 during oligodendrocyte development and remyelination have not been defined. To address this gap, we generated a lineage-traceable <I>ZFP488</I> knock-out mouse line, wherein an <I>H2b-GFP</I> reporter replaces the <I>ZFP488</I>-coding region. Using these mice of either sex, we examined the dynamics of <I>ZFP488</I> expression from the endogenous promoter in the developing central nervous system (CNS). We observed a unique expression pattern in the oligodendrocyte lineage, with <I>ZFP488</I> expression particularly enriched in differentiated oligodendrocytes. ZFP488 loss resulted in delayed myelination in the developing CNS and impaired remyelination after demyelinating injury in the brain. Integrated transcriptomic and genomic profiling further revealed that ZFP488 loss decreased the expression of myelination-associated genes but not oligodendrocyte progenitor&ndash;associated genes, suggesting that ZFP488 serves as a positive regulator of myelination by regulating maturation programs. Thus, our genetic loss-of-function study revealed that ZFP488 regulates a stage-dependent differentiation program that controls the timing of CNS myelination and remyelination.</p>

                <p>Nerve injury can induce aberrant changes in the spine; these changes are due to, or at least partly governed by, transcription factors that contribute to the genesis of neuropathic allodynia. Here, we showed that spinal nerve ligation (SNL, a clinical neuropathic allodynia model) increased the expression of the transcription factor Tbx5 in the injured dorsal horn in male Sprague Dawley rats. In contrast, blocking this upregulation alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia, and there was no apparent effect on locomotor function. Moreover, SNL-induced Tbx5 upregulation promoted the recruitment and interaction of GATA4 and Brd4 by enhancing its binding activity to H3K9Ac, which was enriched at the <I>Trpv1</I> promotor, leading to an increase in TRPV1 transcription and the development of neuropathic allodynia. In addition, nerve injury-induced expression of Fbxo3, which abates Fbxl2-dependent Tbx5 ubiquitination, promoted the subsequent Tbx5-dependent epigenetic modification of TRPV1 expression during SNL-induced neuropathic allodynia. Collectively, our findings indicated that spinal Tbx5-dependent TRPV1 transcription signaling contributes to the development of neuropathic allodynia via Fbxo3-dependent Fbxl2 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, we propose a potential medical treatment strategy for neuropathic allodynia by targeting Tbx5.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/39/e0542242024?rss=1">A Multidimensional Neural Representation of Face Impressions</a></h4>

              
                <p>From a glimpse of a face, people form trait impressions that operate as facial stereotypes, which are largely inaccurate yet nevertheless drive social behavior. Behavioral studies have long pointed to dimensions of trustworthiness and dominance that are thought to underlie face impressions due to their evolutionarily adaptive nature. Using human neuroimaging (<I>N </I>= 26, 19 female, 7 male), we identify a two-dimensional representation of faces&rsquo; inferred traits in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a region involved in domain-general conceptual processing including the activation of social concepts. The similarity of neural-response patterns for any given pair of faces in the bilateral MTG was predicted by their proximity in trustworthiness&ndash;dominance space, an effect that could not be explained by mere visual similarity. This MTG trait-space representation occurred automatically, was relatively invariant across participants, and did not depend on the explicit endorsement of face impressions (i.e., beliefs that face impressions are valid and accurate). In contrast, regions involved in high-level social reasoning (the bilateral temporoparietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus; TPJ&ndash;pSTS) and entity-specific social knowledge (the left anterior temporal lobe; ATL) also exhibited this trait-space representation but only among participants who explicitly endorsed forming these impressions. Together, the findings identify a two-dimensional neural representation of face impressions and suggest that multiple implicit and explicit mechanisms give rise to biases based on facial appearance. While the MTG implicitly represents a multidimensional trait space for faces, the TPJ&ndash;pSTS and ATL are involved in the explicit application of this trait space for social evaluation and behavior.</p>

                <p>Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to motivationally relevant cues, and circuit-specific signaling drives different aspects of motivated behavior. Orexin (ox; also known as hypocretin) and dynorphin (dyn) are coexpressed lateral hypothalamic (LH) neuropeptides that project to the VTA. These peptides have opposing effects on the firing activity of VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons via orexin 1 (Ox1R) or kappa opioid (KOR) receptors. Given that Ox1R activation increases VTA<sup>DA</sup> firing, and KOR decreases firing, it is unclear how the coreleased peptides contribute to the net activity of DA neurons. We tested if optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> neuromodulates VTA<sup>DA</sup> neuronal activity via peptide release and if the effects of optically driven LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> release segregate based on VTA<sup>DA</sup> projection targets including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the lateral or medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (lAcbSh, mAchSh). Using a combination of circuit tracing, optogenetics, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in male and female orexin<sup>cre</sup> mice, we showed a diverse response of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> optical stimulation on VTA<sup>DA</sup> neuronal firing, which is not mediated by fast transmitter release and is blocked by antagonists to KOR and Ox1R signaling. Additionally, where optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> inputs in the VTA inhibited firing of the majority of BLA-projecting VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons, optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> inputs in the VTA bidirectionally affects firing of either lAcbSh- or mAchSh-projecting VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons. These findings indicate that LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> corelease may influence the output of the VTA by balancing ensembles of neurons within each population which contribute to different aspects of reward seeking.</p>

                <p>Growth-associated protein of 43&nbsp;kDa (GAP43) is a key cytoskeleton-associated component of the presynaptic terminal that facilitates neuroplasticity. Downregulation of GAP43 expression has been associated to various psychiatric conditions in humans and evokes hippocampus-dependent memory impairments in mice. Despite the extensive studies conducted on hippocampal GAP43 in past decades, however, very little is known about its roles in modulating the excitatory versus inhibitory balance in other brain regions. We recently generated conditional knock-out mice in which the <I>Gap43</I> gene was selectively inactivated in either telencephalic glutamatergic neurons (<I>Gap43<sup>fl/fl</sup></I>;<I>Nex1<sup>Cre</sup></I> mice, hereafter Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice) or forebrain GABAergic neurons (<I>Gap43<sup>fl/fl</sup></I>;<I>Dlx5/6<sup>Cre</sup></I> mice, hereafter GABA-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice). Here, we show that Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> but not GABA-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice of either sex show a striking hyperactive phenotype when exposed to a novel environment. This behavioral alteration of Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice was linked to a selective activation of dorsal-striatum neurons, as well as to an enhanced corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission and an abrogation of corticostriatal endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression. In line with these observations, GAP43 was abundantly expressed in corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals of wild-type mice. The novelty-induced hyperactive phenotype of Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice was abrogated by chemogenetically inhibiting corticostriatal afferences with a G<SUB>i</SUB>-coupled "designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs" (DREADDs), thus further supporting that novelty-induced activity is controlled by GAP43 at corticostriatal excitatory projections. Taken together, these findings show an unprecedented regulatory role of GAP43 in the corticostriatal circuitry and provide a new mouse model with a delimited neuronal-circuit alteration for studying novelty-induced hyperactivity, a phenotypic shortfall that occurs in diverse psychiatric diseases.</p>

                <p>Understanding how spontaneous brain activity influences the response to neurostimulation is crucial for the development of neurotherapeutics and brain&ndash;computer interfaces. Localized brain activity is suggested to influence the response to neurostimulation, but whether fast-fluctuating (i.e., tens of milliseconds) large-scale brain dynamics also have any such influence is unknown. By stimulating the prefrontal cortex using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography, we examined how dynamic global brain state patterns, as defined by microstates, influence the magnitude of the evoked brain response. TMS applied during what resembled the canonical Microstate C was found to induce a greater evoked response for up to 80&nbsp;ms compared with other microstates. This effect was found in a repeated experimental session, was absent during sham stimulation, and was replicated in an independent dataset. Ultimately, ongoing and fast-fluctuating global brain states, as probed by microstates, may be associated with intrinsic fluctuations in connectivity and excitation&ndash;inhibition balance and influence the neurostimulation outcome. We suggest that the fast-fluctuating global brain states be considered when developing any related paradigms.</p>

                <p>Circadian rhythms in conditioned threat extinction emerge from a tissue-level circadian timekeeper, or local clock, in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Yet it remains unclear how this local clock contributes to extinction-dependent adaptations. Here we used single-unit and local field potential analyses to interrogate neural activity in the male rat vmPFC during repeated extinction sessions at different times of day. In association with superior recall of a remote extinction memory during the circadian active phase, vmPFC putative principal neurons exhibited phasic firing that was amplified for cue presentations and diminished at transitions in freezing behavior. Coupling of vmPFC gamma amplitude to the phase of low-frequency oscillations was greater during freezing than mobility, and this difference was augmented during the active phase, highlighting a time-of-day dependence in the organization of freezing- versus mobility-associated cell assemblies. Additionally, a greater proportion of vmPFC neurons were phase-locked to low-frequency oscillations during the active phase, consistent with heightened neural excitability at this time of day. Our results suggest that daily fluctuations in vmPFC excitability precipitate enhanced neural recruitment into extinction-based cell assemblies during the active phase, providing a potential mechanism by which the vmPFC local clock modulates circuit and behavioral plasticity during conditioned threat extinction.</p>

                <p>Communication in the form of nonverbal, social vocalization, or crying is evolutionary conserved in mammals and is impaired early in human infants that are later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Defects in infant vocalization have been proposed as an early sign of ASD that may exacerbate ASD development. However, the neural mechanisms associated with early communicative deficits in ASD are not known. Here, we expressed a constitutively active mutant of Rheb (Rheb<sup>S16H</sup>), which is known to upregulate two ASD core pathways, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and ERK1/2, in Layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the neocortex of mice of either sex. We found that cellular mosaic expression of Rheb<sup>S16H</sup> in L2/3 pyramidal neurons altered the production of isolation calls from neonatal mice. This was accompanied by an expected misplacement of neurons and dendrite overgrowth, along with an unexpected increase in spine density and length, which was associated with increased excitatory synaptic activity. This contrasted with the known decrease in spine density in Rheb<sup>S16H</sup> neurons of 1-month-old mice. Reducing the levels of the actin cross-linking and adaptor protein filamin A (FLNA), known to be increased downstream of ERK1/2, attenuated dendrite overgrowth and fully restored spine properties, synaptic connectivity, and the production of pup isolation calls. These findings suggest that upper-layer cortical pyramidal neurons contribute to communicative deficits in a condition known to affect two core ASD pathways and that these mechanisms are regulated by FLNA.</p>

                <p>The lateral habenula (LHb) has emerged as a pivotal brain region implicated in depression, displaying hyperactivity in human and animal models of depression. While the role of LHb efferents in depressive disorders has been acknowledged, the specific synaptic alterations remain elusive. Here, employing optogenetics, retrograde tracing, and ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, we investigated synaptic transmission in male mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at three major LHb neuronal outputs: the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). Our findings uncovered distinct synaptic adaptations in LHb efferent circuits in response to CSDS. Specifically, CSDS induced in susceptible mice postsynaptic potentiation and postsynaptic depression at the DRN and VTA neurons, respectively, receiving excitatory inputs from the LHb, while CSDS altered presynaptic transmission at the LHb terminals in RMTg in both susceptible and resilient mice. Moreover, whole-cell recordings at projection-defined LHb neurons indicate decreased spontaneous activity in VTA-projecting LHb neurons, accompanied by an imbalance in excitatory&ndash;inhibitory inputs at the RMTg-projecting LHb neurons. Collectively, these novel findings underscore the circuit-specific alterations in LHb efferents following chronic social stress, shedding light on potential synaptic adaptations underlying stress-induced depressive-like states.</p>

                Background Digital servitization is a strategic transformation where companies adopt a service-focused approach in response to the prevailing trend of digitalization. Utilizing digital technology, businesses manage product and service operations and develop new value propositions. Further research into digital servitization is essential for maintaining competitiveness and meeting evolving market demands globally. This study aims to comprehend the evolution of digital services from theoretical and practical viewpoints and examines how these challenges are tackled. Methods Utilizing a systematic literature review methodology, the study adopts the PRISMA approach to identify 26 pertinent articles from a pool of 340 papers obtained through a SCOPUS database search. These papers were published between 2019 and 2024 and were retrieved using the keywords (‘digitalization OR digital AND servitization OR servitization’). The selection process involved scrutinizing titles, abstracts, and keywords based on predefined criteria. Results The findings reveal that current digital servitization research emphasizes five determinant variables: digitization, servitization, manufacturing servitization, process innovation, and product innovation. Additionally, response variables influenced by digital servitization were identified, including firm competitiveness, firm performance, financial performance, firm profitability, and sustainable performance. Discussion The results of this review point to inconsistencies, underscoring the necessity for additional research into the factors influencing digital servitization across companies beyond the manufacturing sector. This highlights the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of digital servitization strategies and their impacts across various industries. By expanding the scope of research to include a broader range of sectors, researchers can provide more comprehensive insights into the complexities and nuances of digital servitization adoption. This broader perspective enables a more thorough examination of the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing digital servitization strategies, ultimately contributing to a richer understanding of its implications for businesses across diverse industries.

                <p>by Adrielli Tina Lopes Rego, Joshua Snell, Martijn Meeter</p>

Although word predictability is commonly considered an important factor in reading, sophisticated accounts of predictability in theories of reading are lacking. Computational models of reading traditionally use cloze norming as a proxy of word predictability, but what cloze norms precisely capture remains unclear. This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can fill this gap. Contextual predictions are implemented via a novel parallel-graded mechanism, where all predicted words at a given position are pre-activated as a function of contextual certainty, which varies dynamically as text processing unfolds. Through reading simulations with OB1-reader, a cognitive model of word recognition and eye-movement control in reading, we compare the model’s fit to eye-movement data when using predictability values derived from a cloze task against those derived from LLMs (GPT-2 and LLaMA). Root Mean Square Error between simulated and human eye movements indicates that LLM predictability provides a better fit than cloze. This is the first study to use LLMs to augment a cognitive model of reading with higher-order language processing while proposing a mechanism on the interplay between word predictability and eye movements.

                <p>by Karin B. Jensen</p>

The role of dopamine in reward expectancy has led to the hypothesis that it is crucial for forming treatment expectations and placebo effects. However, a new study in PLOS Biology presents robust evidence against the causal role of dopamine in these processes.

                Background Expression proteomics involves the global evaluation of protein abundances within a system. In turn, differential expression analysis can be used to investigate changes in protein abundance upon perturbation to such a system. Methods Here, we provide a workflow for the processing, analysis and interpretation of quantitative mass spectrometry-based expression proteomics data. This workflow utilises open-source R software packages from the Bioconductor project and guides users end-to-end and step-by-step through every stage of the analyses. As a use-case we generated expression proteomics data from HEK293 cells with and without a treatment. Of note, the experiment included cellular proteins labelled using tandem mass tag (TMT) technology and secreted proteins quantified using label-free quantitation (LFQ). Results The workflow explains the software infrastructure before focusing on data import, pre-processing and quality control. This is done individually for TMT and LFQ datasets. The application of statistical differential expression analysis is demonstrated, followed by interpretation via gene ontology enrichment analysis. Conclusions A comprehensive workflow for the processing, analysis and interpretation of expression proteomics is presented. The workflow is a valuable resource for the proteomics community and specifically beginners who are at least familiar with R who wish to understand and make data-driven decisions with regards to their analyses.

                Background Bacterial infections continue to pose a global health challenge, driven by antibiotic resistance and septicemia. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in bacterial infections versus non-infectious causes of inflammation. Methods A prospective study included 164 adult patients who were divided into two groups: a group of patients with confirmed bacterial infections and a second group of patients with other diagnoses (inflammatory pathologies, neoplasms, venous thromboembolic diseases, etc.). NLR and PLR values were compared between the bacterial infection group and the non-infectious causes group and the diagnostic performances of NLR and PLR for detecting bacterial infections were evaluated in comparison with other infection markers. Results NLR and PLR were significantly higher in bacterial infections (p < 10^-6), and NLR was correlated positively with inflammation markers. NLR and PLR demonstrated significant potential in diagnosing bacterial infections, with an AUC of 0.72 and 0.60, respectively, using the following cutoff values: 4.3 for NLR and 183 for PLR. Conclusion These findings underscore the importance of NLR and PLR as adjunctive tools for bacterial infection diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1093/v1?src=rss">The effect of chiropractic spinal manipulation on the H-reflex and muscle strength in children with cerebral palsy: A feasibility study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have deficits in various aspects of motor control, including motor neuron excitability, which can affect muscle strength, gait, and ability to perform activities of daily living. Previous research on chiropractic spinal manipulation in healthy adults, athletes, and a brain-injured population has indicated improvements in motor neuron excitability, muscle strength, and various aspects of motor control. Thus, chiropractic spinal manipulation may improve motor control in children with CP. Methods Children with spastic diplegic CP, aged 8-13 years, were recruited for a randomized, controlled feasibility study. Feasibility was assessed in terms of recruitment strategy and rate, data collection procedures, equipment, intervention, and compliance. Results Three children completed the data collection comprising pre- and post-measurements of the H reflex, V-wave, and muscle strength. The recruitment strategy and rate were not feasible. The data collection procedures were appropriate and complied with, except for the V-wave measurements. The H-reflex threshold decreased and s50 and slope increased in the participants who received chiropractic spinal manipulation; the opposite was seen in the control group. The changes in MVC force were inconsistent between subjects. Conclusion This study answered some important feasibility questions regarding conducting a large-scale randomized controlled study with the same design. Some aspects proved feasible, such as H-reflex recordings, and some aspects, such as recruitment methods and V-wave recordings, need to be altered for future research in this area.

                RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can undergo phase separation and form condensates, processes that, in turn, can be critical for their functionality. In a recent study, Huang, Ellis, and colleagues show that cellular stress can trigger transient alterations in nuclear TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), leading to changes crucial for proper neuronal function. These findings have implications for understanding neurological TDP-43 proteinopathies.

                Recent research by Parks, Schneider, and colleagues demonstrates that brain states during rodent sleep can be predicted from neural activity on millisecond and micrometer scales. These findings contradict the traditional view that defines sleep by brain-wide oscillations. Instead, this work posits that nonoscillatory activity governs different brain states.

Placenta-specific Sod3 knockout dams exhibited impaired maternal behavior and decreased prolactin levels. SOD3 promotes prolactin expression through the activation of an αKG/IDH/TET axis, resulting in epigenetic changes to FGF/FGFR signals in the pituitary tissue of the dam.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88608">A neural network model of differentiation and integration of competing memories</a></h4>

              
                What determines when neural representations of memories move together (integrate) or apart (differentiate)? Classic supervised learning models posit that, when two stimuli predict similar outcomes, their representations should integrate. However, these models have recently been challenged by studies showing that pairing two stimuli with a shared associate can sometimes cause differentiation, depending on the parameters of the study and the brain region being examined. Here, we provide a purely unsupervised neural network model that can explain these and other related findings. The model can exhibit integration or differentiation depending on the amount of activity allowed to spread to competitors — inactive memories are not modified, connections to moderately active competitors are weakened (leading to differentiation), and connections to highly active competitors are strengthened (leading to integration). The model also makes several novel predictions — most importantly, that when differentiation occurs as a result of this unsupervised learning mechanism, it will be rapid and asymmetric, and it will give rise to anticorrelated representations in the region of the brain that is the source of the differentiation. Overall, these modeling results provide a computational explanation for a diverse set of seemingly contradictory empirical findings in the memory literature, as well as new insights into the dynamics at play during learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91849">Antigenic drift and subtype interference shape A(H3N2) epidemic dynamics in the United States</a></h4>

              
                Influenza viruses continually evolve new antigenic variants, through mutations in epitopes of their major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Antigenic drift potentiates the reinfection of previously infected individuals, but the contribution of this process to variability in annual epidemics is not well understood. Here, we link influenza A(H3N2) virus evolution to regional epidemic dynamics in the United States during 1997—2019. We integrate phenotypic measures of HA antigenic drift and sequence-based measures of HA and NA fitness to infer antigenic and genetic distances between viruses circulating in successive seasons. We estimate the magnitude, severity, timing, transmission rate, age-specific patterns, and subtype dominance of each regional outbreak and find that genetic distance based on broad sets of epitope sites is the strongest evolutionary predictor of A(H3N2) virus epidemiology. Increased HA and NA epitope distance between seasons correlates with larger, more intense epidemics, higher transmission, greater A(H3N2) subtype dominance, and a greater proportion of cases in adults relative to children, consistent with increased population susceptibility. Based on random forest models, A(H1N1) incidence impacts A(H3N2) epidemics to a greater extent than viral evolution, suggesting that subtype interference is a major driver of influenza A virus infection ynamics, presumably via heterosubtypic cross-immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91680">The exchange dynamics of biomolecular condensates</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of biomolecular condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation is that they dynamically exchange material with their surroundings, and this process can be crucial to condensate function. Intuitively, the rate of exchange can be limited by the flux from the dilute phase or by the mixing speed in the dense phase. Surprisingly, a recent experiment suggests that exchange can also be limited by the dynamics at the droplet interface, implying the existence of an ‘interface resistance’. Here, we first derive an analytical expression for the timescale of condensate material exchange, which clearly conveys the physical factors controlling exchange dynamics. We then utilize sticker-spacer polymer models to show that interface resistance can arise when incident molecules transiently touch the interface without entering the dense phase, i.e., the molecules ‘bounce’ from the interface. Our work provides insight into condensate exchange dynamics, with implications for both natural and synthetic systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98238">A Ctnnb1 enhancer transcriptionally regulates Wnt signaling dosage to balance homeostasis and tumorigenesis of intestinal epithelia</a></h4>

              
                The β-catenin-dependent canonical Wnt signaling is pivotal in organ development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer. Here, we identified an upstream enhancer of <i>Ctnnb1</i> – the coding gene for β-catenin, named ieCtnnb1 (<i>i</i>ntestinal <i>e</i>nhancer of <i>Ctnnb1</i>), which is crucial for intestinal homeostasis. ieCtnnb1 is predominantly active in the base of small intestinal crypts and throughout the epithelia of large intestine. Knockout of ieCtnnb1 led to a reduction in <i>Ctnnb1</i> transcription, compromising the canonical Wnt signaling in intestinal crypts. Single-cell sequencing revealed that ieCtnnb1 knockout altered epithelial compositions and potentially compromised functions of small intestinal crypts. While deletion of ieCtnnb1 hampered epithelial turnovers in physiologic conditions, it prevented occurrence and progression of Wnt/β-catenin-driven colorectal cancers. Human ieCTNNB1 drove reporter gene expression in a pattern highly similar to mouse ieCtnnb1. ieCTNNB1 contains a single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with <i>CTNNB1</i> expression levels in human gastrointestinal epithelia. The enhancer activity of ieCTNNB1 in colorectal cancer tissues was stronger than that in adjacent normal tissues. HNF4α and phosphorylated CREB1 were identified as key trans-factors binding to ieCTNNB1 and regulating <i>CTNNB1</i> transcription. Together, these findings unveil an enhancer-dependent mechanism controlling the dosage of Wnt signaling and homeostasis in intestinal epithelia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89725">Arp2/3 complex activity enables nuclear YAP for naïve pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the transitions of human embryonic stem cells between distinct stages of pluripotency relies predominantly on regulation by transcriptional and epigenetic programs with limited insight on the role of established morphological changes. We report remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as they transition from primed to naïve pluripotency which includes assembly of a ring of contractile actin filaments encapsulating colonies of naïve hESCs. Activity of the Arp2/3 complex is required for the actin ring, to establish uniform cell mechanics within naïve colonies, promote nuclear translocation of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ, and effective transition to naïve pluripotency. RNA-sequencing analysis confirms that Arp2/3 complex activity regulates Hippo signaling in hESCs, and impaired naïve pluripotency with inhibited Arp2/3 complex activity is rescued by expressing a constitutively active, nuclear-localized YAP-S127A. Moreover, expression of YAP-S127A partially restores the actin filament fence with Arp2/3 complex inhibition, suggesting that actin filament remodeling is both upstream and downstream of YAP activity. These new findings on the cell biology of hESCs reveal a mechanism for cytoskeletal dynamics coordinating cell mechanics to regulate gene expression and facilitate transitions between pluripotency states.

Using data from the ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) repository, we found significant underconnectivity between the posterior and middle STS (pSTS-mSTS) in the right hemisphere in children with ASD compared to TD children. Weaker connectivity in this region of the pathway correlated with more severe social impairment symptoms in ASD and reduced social function across both ASD and TD groups. These findings suggest a specific disruption in the right hemisphere social visual pathway in ASD, potentially contributing to social deficits observed in the disorder.

">Directional motion sensitivity in people with Visual Snow Syndrome is modulated by the presence of trailing-type palinopsia</a></h4>

              
                Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS) is characterized by visual perceptual distortions, potentially linked to increased neural excitability. We hypothesized that this hyperexcitability might affect motion direction sensitivity in VSS, particularly in those with trailing-type palinopsia (TTP), an atypical perception of visual motion. Using a spatial suppression paradigm, we assessed motion duration discrimination thresholds for small (1 degrees), medium (2.5 degrees), and large (12 degrees) high-contrast gratings in 23 VSS and 27 control participants. Spatial Suppression Index (SSI) quantified size-dependent increases in duration thresholds. Visual Discomfort Questionnaire scores and VSS symptom ratings including TTP, afterimages, photophobia, etc. were also collected. VSS patients reported higher visual discomfort and perceptual disturbances. However, no group differences were found in duration thresholds or SSI. Notably, higher TTP scores were associated with lower duration thresholds, indicating a facilitatory effect of TTP on motion sensitivity. These findings suggest that 'visual snow,' the core symptom of VSS, is not linked to abnormal directional sensitivity or center-surround suppression associated with visual motion. However, the dependence of directional sensitivity on TTP emphasizes the heterogeneity of VSS, which should be considered in future neurophysiological and clinical models.

">Neural Maturation Provides the Stability of Representation and the Solution for Understanding Complex Concepts</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms of the human mind remain a major mystery for science. Progress in these efforts has come from psychology, behavioral science, physiology, and biology. Especially in the past 40 years, advances in molecular biology have expanded significantly. Despite these numerous expansions in understanding the mechanisms of higher brain functions, there are still significant gaps in integrating each research result. In particular, the gaps between gene function and the overall phenotypes related to the mind have not been elucidated at all. Recent technological progress in realizing human-like brain functions provided by artificial intelligence has progressed day by day. However, major parts of the current astonishing progress in AI do not necessarily require an understanding of modern molecular biology. Here, we examine the significance of neural maturation in neural network-based information processing models. In both supervised and reinforcement learning paradigms, immature transmission could learn properties similar to normal high-fidelity conditions before reaching catastrophe points. However, continuous long-term learning induced a loss of learning results. Then, I looked for genes with physiological significance for neuronal transmission fidelity. I found that the candidate gene KCNH7 is expressed at higher levels during the development of the mouse brain. In the simulated neural model with the KCNH7 channel property, the excitation threshold increased, providing a linear response property. These properties enhanced the stability of representation recall and enabled the understanding of complex concepts in unsupervised learning models. These results demonstrate the significance of neural maturation in achieving higher recognition abilities in adults.

">Hebbian induction adds AMPA-labile signaling units to CA3-CA1 synapses in the developing hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                In the 2nd postnatal week hippocampus, Hebbian-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA receptor-mediated transmission in CA3-CA1 synapses is not a genuine potentiation. Instead, it is a de-depression (unsilencing) and temporary stabilization of postsynaptically AMPA-labile synapses silenced by a prior test pulse (0.03 - 0.2 Hz) stimulation. In addition to such an LTP, Hebbian induction at these synapses also results in a labile potentiation that becomes depotentiated by test pulse stimulation, thus appearing as an Hebbian-induced short-term potentiation (STP). Although the induction of this labile potentiation was blocked in the combined presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor antagonists, the depotentiation was not affected by these drugs. The labile potentiation was not associated with a change in paired-pulse ratio and was, after a depotentiation, fully re-established by a 20 min interruption of test pulse stimulation. These properties are shared with the silencing of previously non-stimulated (naive) AMPA-labile synapses by such test pulse stimulation. However, the depotentiation following an Hebbian induction is not a re-silencing of naive AMPA labile synapses since there is no correlation between the magnitudes of depotentiation and preceding silencing of naive synapses. The present results suggest that Hebbian induction at these neonatal CA3-CA1 synapses, in addition to unsilencing and temporary stabilization of AMPA-labile transmission, creates a labile potentiation based on the insertion/activation of an additional AMPA-labile signaling unit to a pre-existing synapse.

	<p>Background/Objectives: In languages with within-word segmentation cues, the removal or replacement of these cues in a text hinders reading and lexical recognition, and adversely affects saccade target selection during reading. However, the outcome of artificially introducing visual word segmentation cues into a language that lacks them is unknown. Tibetan exemplifies a language that does not provide visual cues for word segmentation, relying solely on visual cues for morpheme segmentation. Moreover, previous studies have not examined word segmentation in the Tibetan language. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of artificially incorporated visual word segmentation cues and basic units of information processing in Tibetan reading. Methods: We used eye-tracking technology and conducted two experiments with Tibetan sentences that artificially incorporated interword spaces and color alternation markings as visual segmentation cues. Conclusions: The results indicated that interword spaces facilitate reading and lexical recognition and aid in saccade target selection during reading. Color alternation markings facilitate reading and vocabulary recognition but do not affect saccade selection. Words are more likely to be the basic units of information processing and exhibit greater psychological reality than morphemes. These findings shed light on the nature and rules of Tibetan reading and provide fundamental data to improve eye movement control models for reading alphabetic writing systems. Furthermore, our results may offer practical guidance and a scientific basis for improving the efficiency of reading, information processing, and word segmentation in Tibetan reading.</p>

	<p>Background: In contrast to most other languages, where the spoken and written words are similar, children that have mastered Spoken Arabic (SA) learn to read a new written form of Arabic usually called Literary Arabic (LA). This phenomenon is called &amp;amp;ldquo;diglossia&amp;amp;rdquo;. Methods: Based on a series of studies comparing monolingual Arabic speaking and bilingual children, it has been suggested that Arabic speaking individuals develop metacognitive abilities that are considered bilinguals de facto. Some of the cognitive functions that would seem to benefit from fluency in more than one language are metalinguistic and metacognitive awareness. Results: This review article summarizes the results of studies on the relationship between bilingualism, diglossia and executive functions (EFs) which involve metacognitive awareness, selective attention, control of inhibition and cognitive flexibility as well as working memory (phonemic manipulation and metalingual performances). Conclusions: The findings are in line with research results that have shown that bilingualism has a positive effect on the functioning of an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s attentional system across the lifespan. The neural basis of diglossia in Arabic, as well as the conclusions and implications drawn from the impact of diglossia on EF and on reading in Arabic, are discussed.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autistic people employ various social strategies to form and maintain interpersonal relationships in their daily environments. These strategies can help autistic people with social interactions (leading to self-perceived efficacy of using social strategies), but can also lead to cognitive fatigue (self-perceived effort of using social strategies). However, previous studies have focused primarily on self-perceived effort, overlooking the self-perceived efficacy of using social strategies, and the balance between self-perceived effort and efficacy. To address this gap, this study examined the impact of autistic people&amp;amp;rsquo;s use of social strategies on their well-being, focusing on self-perceived effort, self-perceived efficacy, and their interaction effect. Methods: An online survey was conducted among self-reported autistic people in Japan aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;65 years, using a modified Compensation Checklist. Data from 104 self-reported autistic participants were analyzed using linear regression. Results: High self-perceived effort in using social strategies was negatively associated with well-being, whereas high self-perceived efficacy was positively associated with well-being. The interaction effect between effort and efficacy was not significant. These results were supported even when loneliness was used as an index of social well-being. Additionally, the number of strategies used by an autistic person was positively associated with well-being. Conclusions: This study highlights the double-edged effect of autistic people using social strategies, and that using a broader repertoire of social strategies may improve the well-being of autistic people. These findings call for a nuanced approach by researchers and clinicians considering both the positive and negative aspects of using social strategies.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and a leading cause of dementia. One major challenge for clinicians is accurately assessing the rate of disease progression (RoP) early in the diagnostic process, which is crucial for patient management and clinical trial stratification. This study evaluated the role of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers&amp;amp;mdash;A&amp;amp;beta;42, t-Tau, pTau, Neurogranin (Ng), and Neurofilament light-chain (NF-L)&amp;amp;mdash;in predicting RoP at the time of AD diagnosis. We included 56 AD patients and monitored cognitive impairment using MMSE scores at diagnosis and during six-month follow-up visits. RoP scores were calculated based on these assessments. Our correlation analyses revealed significant associations between RoP and pTau, A&amp;amp;beta;42/Ng ratio, and NF-L levels. When patients were stratified by median RoP values into low-to-moderate (L-M: &amp;amp;lt;2) and upper-moderate (U-M: &amp;amp;gt;2) groups, those in the U-M group had notably higher CSF NF-L levels compared to the L-M group. Logistic regression analysis further demonstrated that elevated CSF NF-L levels were predictive of a faster RoP. These findings highlight the potential of CSF NF-L as a prognostic biomarker for rapid disease progression in AD. By identifying patients at risk for accelerated cognitive decline, CSF NF-L could significantly enhance early intervention strategies and improve patient management in clinical settings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In Belgium, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization is authorized in the presence of certain criteria governed by the law relating to the protection of the mentally ill. The number of involuntary hospitalizations has been increasing continuously in recent years. Since personality disorders are frequent comorbidities in involuntarily hospitalized patients, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential role played by comorbid personality disorders in the decisions about involuntary hospitalization made during urgent forensic assessment. Methods: A total of 565 individuals were retrospectively recruited from the database of urgent forensic assessment carried out in the Psychiatric Emergency Department. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the risk of involuntary hospitalization associated with comorbid personality disorders in patients referred for urgent forensic assessment. Results: 66.7% of urgent forensic assessments resulted in involuntary hospitalization. In addition, comorbid personality disorders (especially borderline personality disorder) were associated with a lower risk of involuntary hospitalization in patients referred for urgent forensic assessment. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated that urgent forensic assessments frequently result in involuntary hospitalizations. Furthermore, this study highlighted that comorbid personality disorders (especially borderline personality disorder) appeared to have a major impact on the decision not to involuntarily hospitalize patients referred for urgent forensic assessment. These elements therefore justify the establishment of adequate clinical reflection to avoid the stigmatization related to these frequent comorbidities in patients at risk of involuntary hospitalization.</p>

	<p>Objective: Awake craniotomy (AWC) allows intraoperative evaluation of functions involving the cortical surface and subcortical fibers. In epilepsy surgery, indications for and the role of AWC have not been established because evaluation with intracranial electrodes is considered the gold standard. We report herein our case series of patients who underwent AWC in epilepsy surgery and propose the scenarios for and roles of AWC. Methods: Patients who underwent AWC in epilepsy surgery at our institutions between 2014 and 2023 were included. Information about age, sex, etiology, location of epileptogenicity, seizure type, use of intracranial electrode placement, surgical complications, neurological deficits, additional surgery, and seizure outcomes was reviewed. Following a diagnostic and treatment flow for epilepsy surgery, we clarified three different scenarios and roles for AWC. Results: Ten patients underwent AWC. Three patients underwent AWC after non-invasive evaluations. Two patients underwent AWC after intracranial evaluation with stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG). Five patients underwent AWC after intracranial evaluation with subdural grid electrodes (SDG). Among these, two patients were initially evaluated with SEEG and with SDG thereafter. One patient reported slight numbness in the hand, and one patient showed slight cognitive decline. Seizure outcomes according to the Engel outcome scale were class 1A in three patients, IIA in two patients, IIIA in four patients, and IVA in one patient. Conclusions: AWC can be used for purposes of epilepsy surgery in different situations, either immediately after non-invasive studies or as an additional invasive step after invasive monitoring with either SEEG or SDG. The application of AWC should be individualized according to each patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s specific characteristics.</p>

	<p>Extremely preterm birth entails an increased risk for multimorbidity and the prevalence of developmental deficits because this risk is negatively correlated to the number of gestation weeks. This work evaluated subcortical volume changes in children born extremely preterm who received Katona neurohabilitation, as well as the effects of subcortical volume and treatment adherence on their three-year-old neurodevelopment outcomes. Fifteen extremely preterm-born participants were treated from two months to two years old and followed up until past three years of age. The participants received Katona neurohabilitation, which provides vestibular and proprioceptive stimulation and promotes movement integration through the early, intensive practice of human-specific elementary movements. Subcortical brain volumes from magnetic resonance images were obtained at the beginning and after treatment. Also, treatment adherence to Katona neurohabilitation and neurodevelopment outcomes were measured. The results showed that absolute subcortical volumes increased after treatment; however, when adjusted by intracranial volume, these volumes decreased. Subcortical function inhibition allows cortical control and increased connectivity, which may explain decreased adjusted volume. Regression analyses showed that after-treatment hippocampal volumes had a discrete predictive value. However, treatment adherence showed a clear effect on mental and psychomotor neurodevelopment. Thus, the effectiveness of Katona neurohabilitation is constrained by treatment adherence.</p>

                <p>Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MeCP2 gene, is characterized by cognitive and social deficits. Previous studies have noted hypoactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pyramidal neurons of MeCP2-deficient mice (RTT mice) in response to both social and nonsocial stimuli. To further understand the neural mechanisms behind the social deficits of RTT mice, we monitored excitatory pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the mPFC during social interactions in mice. These neurons&rsquo; activity was closely linked to social preference, especially in wild-type mice. However, RTT mice showed reduced social interest and corresponding hypoactivity in these neurons, indicating that impaired mPFC activity contributes to their social deficits. We identified six mPFC neural ensembles selectively tuned to various stimuli, with RTT mice recruiting fewer neurons to ensembles responsive to social interactions and consistently showing lower stimulus-ON ensemble transient rates. Despite these lower rates, RTT mice exhibited an increase in the percentage of social-ON neurons in later sessions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for the decreased firing rate. This highlights the limited plasticity in the mPFC caused by MeCP2 deficiency and offers insights into the neural dynamics of social encoding. The presence of multifunctional neurons and those specifically responsive to social or object stimuli in the mPFC emphasizes its crucial role in complex behaviors and cognitive functions, with selective neuron engagement suggesting efficiency in neural activation that optimizes responses to environmental stimuli.</p>

                <p>Studies employing EEG to measure somatosensory responses have been typically optimized to compute event-related potentials in response to discrete events. However, tactile interactions involve continuous processing of nonstationary inputs that change in location, duration, and intensity. To fill this gap, this study aims to demonstrate the possibility of measuring the neural tracking of continuous and unpredictable tactile information. Twenty-seven young adults (females, 15) were continuously and passively stimulated with a random series of gentle brushes on single fingers of each hand, which were covered from view. Thus, tactile stimulations were unique for each participant and stimulated fingers. An encoding model measured the degree of synchronization between brain activity and continuous tactile input, generating a temporal response function (TRF). Brain topographies associated with the encoding of each finger stimulation showed a contralateral response at central sensors starting at 50&nbsp;ms and peaking at ~140&nbsp;ms of lag, followed by a bilateral response at ~240&nbsp;ms. A series of analyses highlighted that reliable tactile TRF emerged after just 3&nbsp;min of stimulation. Strikingly, topographical patterns of the TRF allowed discriminating digit lateralization across hands and digit representation within each hand. Our results demonstrated for the first time the possibility of using EEG to measure the neural tracking of a naturalistic, continuous, and unpredictable stimulation in the somatosensory domain. Crucially, this approach allows the study of brain activity following individualized, idiosyncratic tactile events to the fingers.</p>

                Abstract* Background Goal-directed perfusion (GDP) aims to balance oxygen delivery (DO2) and consumption (VO2) in cardiac surgery. Elevated lactate during CPB is common and linked to higher morbidity and mortality. Evaluating lactate with base excess (BE) is vital due to their relationship. Reducing severe BE and lactate predicts cardiac surgery outcomes better. Methods Fifty adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were randomly assigned to either the GDP group or the conventional group. In the GDP group, the priming solution was adjusted to target a hematocrit (HCT) level of 24 to 27% with a pump flow of 1.8 to 2.2 L/min/m2 to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 60 and 65 mmHg. The primary outcomes was oxygen delivery index (DO2i). Results There were increasing trends in lactate levels and decreasing trends in BE levels at all timeframes. The GDP mean difference of lactate [1.504 (1.52); p < 0.001] and BE [-0.87 (2.93); p = 0.22] levels showed better value in the GDP group, with statistically significant increased values in the control group for BE [-1.667 (2.93); p = 0.017] and lactate levels [2.215 (2.919); p < 0.001]. The postoperative outcome showed a significant difference in AKI and ventilator time. Conclusions The GDP low flow CPB compared with conventional flow CPB maintained DO2 matched with VO2 with a better clinical values in the lactate and BE levels and significantly lowered AKI and ventilator duration in cardiac surgery.

                Introduction Climacteric period signifies a transitional phase characterized by ovarian failure and a decline in estrogen levels, leading to various urogynecological alterations, including potential sexual dysfunctions. Among these, pelvic floor muscle (PFM) function plays a pivotal role in female sexual function. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on the sexual function of climacteric women. Methods Experimental or quasi-experimental studies published in peer-reviewed journals, assessing the sexual function of perimenopausal women with PFMT as an intervention, will be included. Studies conducted in institutionalized populations or with neurological and cognitive diseases will be excluded. This systematic review protocol follows the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The searches will be carried out in the Pubmed, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences), Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro, using the Search equation: climacteric women/menopause and PFMT and (sexual function or sexual dysfunction). The assessment of methodological quality will be carried out using the Pedro and GRADE scale, which will involve two independent researchers to evaluate the criteria. A third researcher will resolve discrepancies. Ethics and disclosure Ethical approval is not required as this is a secondary data study. This systematic review began in April 2024 and all steps are expected to be completed by November 2024. PROSPERO registration number CRD42024534297

                Background This socio-economic analysis studies the influence of jasmine production on the economic well-being of farmers in Huvina Hadagali, a region known for its high-quality jasmine flowers. The Vijaya Nagara district’s Havina Hadagali area is well known throughout the country for its jasmine flower farming. In addition to being referred to as Mallige Nadu, this location is also known as Malligeya Tavaru. The cultivation of the jasmine flower is protected by the Geographical Indication (GI) Tag, and this flower has been popular in this region for a substantial amount of time. Methods Data was collected from a sample of 364 jasmine growers using a structured questionnaire in Huvina Hadagali, Vijayanagar district. The data focused on different socio-economic factors such as income levels, employment, market access, and agricultural techniques. The study is analysed using IBM SPSS through frequency analysis and 2-step clustering. Result The results demonstrate that the cultivation of jasmine makes a substantial contribution to the local economy, serving as a main or additional source of income for numerous households. Jasmine farming often contributes 40% of the whole household income, and during peak seasons, it provides significant economic advantages. Nevertheless, the highlighted obstacles were volatile market pricing, pest infestations, and limited access to contemporary farming practices. The study emphasises the crucial significance of cooperative societies and local marketplaces in stabilising income and offering essential resources and training to farmers. Conclusion The research highlights the necessity of governmental interventions focused on developing market infrastructure, offering financial assistance, and improving access to agricultural innovations to maintain and augment the economic advantages of jasmine cultivation in Huvina Hadagali.

                Abstract* Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods This scoping review aims to assess the current evidence on the effects and safety of PCL in pediatric surgery. A multi-database search strategy would be used, with eligibility criteria including recent original English articles on pediatric PCL. Data extraction would focus on PCL type, sample sizes, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 10 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies showed that PCL improved metabolic outcome and reduced postoperative recovery time. However, outcomes like hospital stay length and postoperative complications, such as nausea and vomiting, varied. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery may stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and enhance recovery, including anxiety reduction.

                Background Trichoderma spp. hold significant potential as biocontrol agents in agriculture due to their antagonistic properties against plant pathogens. The study aimed to characterize and identify Trichoderma isolates from rhizospheric regions of vegetable crops. Methods In this study, Trichoderma isolates were collected from rhizospheric soil samples of vegetable crops from different ecological zones and were selected for comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization. The isolates were visually assessed for colony color, growth pattern, aerial mycelium presence, phialide and conidial morphology, and chlamydospore presence. Molecular analysis was employed based on ITS and tef-1α sequences. Diversity indices were also computed for different ecological zones. Results The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic trees for both regions provided a clear species resolution, with four main clades: Harzianum, Viride, Brevicompactum and Longibrachiatum with 12 species T. harzinaum, T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. inhamatum, T. camerunense, T. azevedoi, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. asperelloides, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. brevicompactum and nine species as a new country record. Diversity indices indicated that high mountain regions displayed the highest species diversity and evenness (H = 1.724 [0.28], J = 0.84, D = 0.28), followed by hilly regions (H = 1.563 [0.28], J = 0.72, D = 0.28). Plains, on the other hand, exhibited lower species diversity (H = 1.515, J = 0.66, D = 0.33). The calculated species abundance values showed that plains (E = 2.11), mid-hills (E = 1.95), and high mountains (E = 1.99) each had their unique diversity profiles. Notably, T. afroharzianum and T. asperellum were predominant. Conclusions Overall, the study unveiled a rich diversity of Trichoderma species in different agricultural zones of Nepal. These findings shed light on the ecological distribution and diversity of Trichoderma spp., which could have significant implications for sustainable agriculture and biological control strategies.

                RNA-binding protein Fused-in Sarcoma (FUS) plays an essential role in various cellular processes. Mutations in the C-terminal domain region, where the nuclear localization signal (NLS) is located, causes the redistribution of FUS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In neurons, neurotoxic aggregates are formed as a result, contributing to neurogenerative diseases. Well-characterized anti-FUS antibodies would enable the reproducibility of FUS research, thereby benefiting the scientific community. In this study, we characterized ten FUS commercial antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

                Background Cancer and its management can incur high costs, high risks and high demand. In Indonesia, there remains gap in the availability of national cancer data despite the establishment of a National Committee for Cancer Control. Multiple pilot projects have been developed by the Ministry of Health to improve the delivery of care, including interventions utilising digital health approaches and integrated referral information systems. However, it is not yet clear to what extent these approaches influence patient management or the experience of cancer patients themselves. This research aims to explore the current role of health information technology (HIT) in the provision of services and treatments for patients with cancer from primary to tertiary healthcare centres in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Methods The study will adopt an observational mixed-methods single case study design of health facilities involved in the delivery of cancer services in a sub-national health system. We will collect data through face-to-face interviews with a range of health professionals involved in the delivery of cancer care. Patients will be interviewed to share their views and experiences of the existing cancer referral system and communication with health facilities. Alongside interviews, we will undertake an analysis of routine data from participating health facilities to assess gaps in existing information systems. Data analysis will include framework analysis for qualitative data alongside descriptive analyses of quantitative data. Findings will be used to inform conceptual maps to be presented as part of Theory of Change workshops focused on understanding how the existing cancer referral system works, why and for whom, with a focus on future refinement and intervention development. Conclusion Our findings will inform critical thinking around the design, implementation, adaptation, and evaluation of existing systems. Through early engagement and participation of key stakeholders and project partners, we intend that findings will have immediate utility.

Triploidy is very useful in both aquaculture and some cultivated plants as the induced sterility helps to enhance growth and product quality, as well as acting as a barrier against the contamination of wild populations by escapees. To use genetic information from triploids for academic or breeding purposes, an efficient and robust method to genotype triploids is needed. We developed such a method for genotype calling from SNP arrays, and we implemented it in the R package named GenoTriplo. Our method requires no prior information on cluster positions and remains unaffected by shifted luminescence signals. The method relies on starting the clustering algorithm with an initial higher number of groups than expected from the ploidy level of the samples, followed by merging groups that are too close to each other to be considered as distinct genotypes. Accurate classification of SNPs is achieved through multiple thresholds of quality controls. We compared the performance of GenoTriplo with that of fitPoly, the only published method for triploid SNP genotyping with a free software access. This was assessed by comparing the genotypes generated by both methods for a dataset of 1232 triploid rainbow trout genotyped for 38,033 SNPs. The two methods were consistent for 89% of the genotypes, but for 26% of the SNPs, they exhibited a discrepancy in the number of different genotypes identified. For these SNPs, GenoTriplo had >95% concordance with fitPoly when fitPoly genotyped better. On the contrary, when GenoTriplo genotyped better, fitPoly had less than 50% concordance with GenoTriplo. GenoTriplo was more robust with less genotyping errors. It is also efficient at identifying low-frequency genotypes in the sample set. Finally, we assessed parentage assignment based on GenoTriplo genotyping and observed significant differences in mismatch rates between the best and second-best couples, indicating high confidence in the results. GenoTriplo could also be used to genotype diploids as well as individuals with higher ploidy level by adjusting a few input parameters.

Advances in bioinformatics are primarily due to new algorithms for processing diverse biological data sources. While sophisticated alignment algorithms have been pivotal in analyzing biological sequences, deep learning has substantially transformed bioinformatics, addressing sequence, structure, and functional analyses. However, these methods are incredibly data-hungry, compute-intensive, and hard to interpret. Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has recently emerged as an exciting alternative. The key idea is that random vectors of high dimensionality can represent concepts such as sequence identity or phylogeny. These vectors can then be combined using simple operators for learning, reasoning, or querying by exploiting the peculiar properties of high-dimensional spaces. Our work reviews and explores HDC’s potential for bioinformatics, emphasizing its efficiency, interpretability, and adeptness in handling multimodal and structured data. HDC holds great potential for various omics data searching, biosignal analysis, and health applications.

                <p>by Yidi Sun, Albert Yeam, Jonathan Kuo, Yuichiro Iwamoto, Gean Hu, David G. Drubin</p>

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a critical trafficking process that begins when an elaborate endocytic protein network is established at the plasma membrane. Interaction of early endocytic proteins with anionic phospholipids and/or cargo has been suggested to trigger CME initiation. However, the exact mechanism by which CME sites are initiated has not been fully elucidated. In the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, higher levels of anionic phospholipids and cargo molecules exist in the newly formed daughter cell compared to the levels in the mother cell during polarized growth. Taking advantage of this asymmetry, we quantitatively compared CME proteins in <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> mother versus daughter cells, observing differences in the dynamics and composition of key endocytic proteins. Our results show that CME site initiation occurs preferentially on regions of the plasma membrane with a relatively higher density of endocytic cargo and/or acidic phospholipids. Furthermore, our combined live cell-imaging and yeast genetics analysis provided evidence for a molecular mechanism in which CME sites are initiated when Yap1801 and Yap1802 (yeast CALM/AP180) and Syp1 (yeast FCHo1/2) coordinate with anionic phospholipids and cargo molecules to trigger Ede1 (yeast Eps15)-centric CME initiation complex assembly at the plasma membrane.

Neural activity and behavior vary within an individual (states) and between individuals (traits). However, the mapping of state-trait neural variation to behavior is not well understood. To address this gap, we quantify moment-to-moment changes in brain-wide co-activation patterns derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. In healthy young adults, we identify reproducible spatiotemporal features of co-activation patterns at the single-subject level. We demonstrate that a joint analysis of state-trait neural variations and feature reduction reveal general motifs of individual differences, encompassing state-specific and general neural features that exhibit day-to-day variability. The principal neural variations co-vary with the principal variations of behavioral phenotypes, highlighting cognitive function, emotion regulation, alcohol and substance use. Person-specific probability of occupying a particular co-activation pattern is reproducible and associated with neural and behavioral features. This combined analysis of state-trait variations holds promise for developing reproducible neuroimaging markers of individual life functional outcome.

Bats are reservoirs of many zoonotic viruses that are fatal in humans but do not cause disease in bats. Moreover, bats generate low neutralizing antibody titers in response to experimental viral infection, although more robust antibody responses have been observed in wild-caught bats during times of food stress. Here, we compared the antibody titers and B cell receptor (BCR) diversity of Jamaican fruit bats (<i>Artibeus jamaicensis</i>; JFBs) and BALB/c mice generated in response to T-dependent and T-independent antigens. We then manipulated the diet of JFBs and challenged them with H18N11 influenza A-like virus or a replication incompetent Nipah virus VSV (Nipah-riVSV). Under standard housing conditions, JFBs generated a lower avidity antibody response and possessed more BCR mRNA diversity compared to BALB/c mice. However, withholding protein from JFBs improved serum neutralization in response to Nipah-riVSV and improved serum antibody titers specific to H18 but reduced BCR mRNA diversity.

Dopamine-based reward and learning mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to placebo effects. However, the exact role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in their generation and maintenance is still unclear. This study aimed to shed light on the causal role of dopamine in establishing positive treatment expectations, as well as on the magnitude and duration of their effect on pain. To this end, we used an established placebo analgesia paradigm in combination with 2 opposing pharmacological modulations of dopaminergic tone, i.e., the dopamine antagonist sulpiride and the dopamine precursor L-dopa which were both applied in an experimental, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a between-subject design in <i>N</i> = 168 healthy volunteers. The study medication successfully altered dopaminergic tone during the conditioning procedure. Contrary to our hypotheses, the medication did not modulate the formation of positive treatment expectation and placebo analgesia tested 1 day later. Placebo analgesia was no longer detectable on day 8 after conditioning. Using a combined frequentist and Bayesian approach, our data provide strong evidence against a direct dopaminergic influence on the generation and maintenance of placebo effects. Further exploration of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia remains paramount in the quest to exploit these effects for optimal treatment outcomes.

Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in the regulation and evolution of host–virus interactions. Here, we conducted a genome-wide arrayed CRISPR knockout screen in the presence and absence of IFN to identify human genes that influence Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We then performed an integrated analysis of genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2, drawing from a selection of 67 large-scale studies, including our own. We identified 28 genes of high relevance in both human genetic studies of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and functional genetic screens in cell culture, with many related to the IFN pathway. Among these was the IFN-stimulated gene <i>PLSCR1</i>. PLSCR1 did not require IFN induction to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and did not contribute to IFN signaling. Instead, PLSCR1 specifically restricted spike-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry. The PLSCR1-mediated restriction was alleviated by TMPRSS2 overexpression, suggesting that PLSCR1 primarily restricts the endocytic entry route. In addition, recent SARS-CoV-2 variants have adapted to circumvent the PLSCR1 barrier via currently undetermined mechanisms. Finally, we investigate the functional effects of PLSCR1 variants present in humans and discuss an association between PLSCR1 and severe COVID-19 reported recently.

                <p>by Richard A. Stewart, Zhihao Ding, Ung Seop Jeon, Lauren B. Goodman, Jeannine J. Tran, John P. Zientko, Malavika Sabu, Ken M. Cadigan</p>

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays numerous essential roles in animal development and tissue/stem cell maintenance. The activation of genes regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling requires the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, a transcriptional co-activator. β-catenin is recruited to many Wnt-regulated enhancers through direct binding to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family transcription factors. β-catenin has previously been reported to form phase-separated biomolecular condensates (BMCs), which was implicated as a component of β-catenin’s mechanism of action. This function required aromatic amino acid residues in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N- and C-termini of the protein. In this report, we further explore a role for β-catenin BMCs in Wnt target gene regulation. We find that β-catenin BMCs are miscible with LEF1 BMCs in vitro and in cultured cells. We characterized a panel of β-catenin mutants with different combinations of aromatic residue mutations in human cell culture and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Our data support a model in which aromatic residues across both IDRs contribute to BMC formation and signaling activity. Although different Wnt targets have different sensitivities to loss of β-catenin’s aromatic residues, the activation of every target examined was compromised by aromatic substitution. These mutants are not defective in nuclear import or co-immunoprecipitation with several β-catenin binding partners. In addition, residues in the N-terminal IDR with no previously known role in signaling are clearly required for the activation of various Wnt readouts. Consistent with this, deletion of the N-terminal IDR results in a loss of signaling activity, which can be rescued by the addition of heterologous IDRs enriched in aromatic residues. Overall, our work supports a model in which the ability of β-catenin to form biomolecular condensates in the nucleus is tightly linked to its function as a transcriptional co-regulator.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The brain changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include Abeta (Aβ) amyloid plaques (“A”), abnormally phosphorylated tau tangles (“T”), and neurodegeneration (“N”). These have been used to construct in vivo and postmortem diagnostic and staging classifications for evaluating the spectrum of AD in the “ATN” and “ABC” (“B” for Braak tau stage, “C” for Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease [CERAD] neuritic plaque density) systems. Another common AD feature involves cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We report the first experiment to examine relationships among cognition, brain distribution of amyloid plaques, CAA, tau/tangles, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-determined volume changes (as a measure of “N”) in the same group of behaviorally characterized nonhuman primates. Both ATN and ABC systems were applied to a group of 32 rhesus macaques aged between 7 and 33 years. When an immunohistochemical method for “T” and “B” was used, some monkeys were “triple positive” on ATN, with a maximum ABC status of A1B2C3. With silver or thioflavin S methods, however, all monkeys were classified as T-negative and B0, indicating the absence of mature neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and hence neuropathologically defined AD. Although monkeys at extremes of the ATN and ABC classifications, or with frequent CAA, had significantly lower scores on some cognitive tests, the lack of fully mature NFTs or dementia-consistent cognitive impairment indicates that fully developed AD may not occur in rhesus macaques. There were sex differences noted in the types of histopathology present, and only CAA was significantly related to gray matter volume.</p>

<p>High motor impulsivity is associated with low cortico-striatal function. Chemogenetic restoration of cortico-striatal activity in high-impulsive rats reduces their exacerbated motor impulsivity, without affecting risky decision-making.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders (SUD) are characterized by exacerbated motor and risk-related impulsivities, which are associated with decreased cortical activity. In rodents, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been separately implicated in impulsive behaviors, but studies on the specific role of the mPFC-NAc pathway in these behaviors are limited. Here, we investigated whether heightened impulsive behaviors are associated with reduced mPFC activity in rodents and determined the involvement of the mPFC-NAc pathway in motor and risk-related impulsivities. We used the Roman High- (RHA) and Low-Avoidance (RLA) rat lines, which display divergent phenotypes in impulsivity. To investigate alterations in cortical activity in relation to impulsivity, regional brain glucose metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography and [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG). Using chemogenetics, the activity of the mPFC-NAc pathway was either selectively activated in high-impulsive RHA rats or inhibited in low-impulsive RLA rats, and the effects of these manipulations on motor and risk-related impulsivity were concurrently assessed using the rat gambling task. We showed that basal [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake was lower in the mPFC and NAc of RHA compared to RLA rats. Activation of the mPFC-NAc pathway in RHA rats reduced motor impulsivity, without affecting risk-related decision-making. Conversely, inhibition of the mPFC-NAc pathway had no effect in RLA rats. Our results suggest that the mPFC-NAc pathway controls motor impulsivity, but has limited involvement in risk-related decision-making in our current model. Our findings suggest that reducing fronto-striatal activity may help attenuate motor impulsivity in patients with impulse control dysregulation.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Fatally injured neurons may necrose and rupture immediately, or they may initiate a programmed cell death pathway and then wait for microglial phagocytosis. Biochemical and histopathologic assays of neuronal death assess the numbers of neurons awaiting phagocytosis at a particular time point after injury. This number varies with the fraction of neurons that have necrosed vs initiated programmed cell death, the time elapsed since injury, the rate of phagocytosis, and the assay’s ability to detect neurons at different stages of programmed cell death. Many of these variables can be altered by putatively neurotoxic and neuroprotective interventions independent of the effects on neuronal death. This complicates analyses of neurotoxicity and neuroprotection and has likely contributed to difficulties with clinical translation of neuroprotective strategies after brain injury. Time-resolved assays of neuronal health, such as ongoing expression of transgenic fluorescent proteins, are a useful means of avoiding these problems.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Deficits in learning and memory are some of the most commonly reported symptoms following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). We will examine whether the neural basis of these deficits stems from alterations to bidirectional synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. Although the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus has been a focus of TBI research, the dentate gyrus should also be given attention as it exhibits a unique ability for adult neurogenesis, a process highly susceptible to TBI-induced damage. This review examines our current understanding of how TBI results in deficits in synaptic plasticity, as well as how TBI-induced changes in endocannabinoid (eCB) systems may drive these changes. Through the synthesis and amalgamation of existing data, we propose a possible mechanism for eCB-mediated recovery in synaptic plasticity deficits. This hypothesis is based on the plausible roles of CB1 receptors in regulating inhibitory tone, influencing astrocytes and microglia, and modulating glutamate release. Dysregulation of the eCBs may be responsible for deficits in synaptic plasticity and learning following TBI. Taken together, the existing evidence indicates eCBs may contribute to TBI manifestation, pathogenesis, and recovery, but it also suggests there may be a therapeutic role for the eCB system in TBI.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Down syndrome (DS), a prevalent cognitive disorder resulting from trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), poses a significant global health concern. Affecting approximately 1 in 800 live births worldwide, DS is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and a major predisposing factor for early-onset Alzheimer’s dementia. The estimated global population of individuals with DS is 6 million, with increasing prevalence due to advances in DS health care. Global efforts are dedicated to unraveling the mechanisms behind the varied clinical outcomes in DS. Recent studies on DS mouse models reveal disrupted neuronal circuits, providing insights into DS pathologies. Yet, translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limited systematic electrophysiological analyses directly comparing human and mouse. Additionally, disparities in experimental procedures between the two species pose hurdles to successful translation. This review provides a concise overview of neuronal oscillations in human and rodent cognition. Focusing on recent DS mouse model studies, we highlight disruptions in associated brain function. We discuss various electrophysiological paradigms and suggest avenues for exploring molecular dysfunctions contributing to DS-related cognitive impairments. Deciphering neuronal oscillation intricacies holds promise for targeted therapies to alleviate cognitive disabilities in DS individuals.

                Chirality is a fundamental trait of living organisms, encompassing the homochirality of biological molecules and the left–right (LR) asymmetry of visceral organs and the brain. The nervous system in bilaterian organisms displays a lateralized organization characterized by the presence of asymmetrical neuronal circuits and brain functions that are predominantly localized within one hemisphere. Although body asymmetry is relatively well understood, and exhibits robust phenotypic expression and regulation via conserved molecular mechanisms across phyla, current findings indicate that the asymmetry of the nervous system displays greater phenotypic, genetic, and evolutionary variability. In this review we explore the use of nematode, zebrafish, and Drosophila genetic models to investigate neuronal circuit asymmetry. We discuss recent discoveries in the context of body–brain concordance and highlight the distinct characteristics of nervous system asymmetry and its cognitive correlates.

                The offline reactivation of hippocampal neuronal activity during sleep is thought to be crucial for memory. We investigated the contribution of dentate spikes to offline reactivation of hippocampal activity patterns and flexible recognition memory by combining triple-ensemble (DG-CA3-CA1) recordings and closed-loop optogenetic feedback in mice undergoing sleep/rest following active exploratory behavior. This work establishes dentate spikes as a second network event that, together with sharp-wave ripples, supports offline hippocampal dynamics for memory-guided behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93796">Identification of pharmacological inducers of a reversible hypometabolic state for whole organ preservation</a></h4>

              
                Drugs that induce reversible slowing of metabolic and physiological processes would have great value for organ preservation, especially for organs with high susceptibility to hypoxia-reperfusion injury, such as the heart. Using whole-organism screening of metabolism, mobility, and development in <i>Xenopus</i>, we identified an existing drug, SNC80, that rapidly and reversibly slows biochemical and metabolic activities while preserving cell and tissue viability. Although SNC80 was developed as a delta opioid receptor activator, we discovered that its ability to slow metabolism is independent of its opioid modulating activity as a novel SNC80 analog (WB3) with almost 1000 times less delta opioid receptor binding activity is equally active. Metabolic suppression was also achieved using SNC80 in microfluidic human organs-on-chips, as well as in explanted whole porcine hearts and limbs, demonstrating the cross-species relevance of this approach and potential clinical relevance for surgical transplantation. Pharmacological induction of physiological slowing in combination with organ perfusion transport systems may offer a new therapeutic approach for tissue and organ preservation for transplantation, trauma management, and enhancing patient survival in remote and low-resource locations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91102">Distractor effects in decision making are related to the individual’s style of integrating choice attributes</a></h4>

              
                Humans make irrational decisions in the presence of irrelevant distractor options. There is little consensus on whether decision making is facilitated or impaired by the presence of a highly rewarding distractor, or whether the distractor effect operates at the level of options’ component attributes rather than at the level of their overall value. To reconcile different claims, we argue that it is important to consider the diversity of people’s styles of decision making and whether choice attributes are combined in an additive or multiplicative way. Employing a multi-laboratory dataset investigating the same experimental paradigm, we demonstrated that people used a mix of both approaches and the extent to which approach was used varied across individuals. Critically, we identified that this variability was correlated with the distractor effect during decision making. Individuals who tended to use a multiplicative approach to compute value, showed a positive distractor effect. In contrast, a negative distractor effect (divisive normalisation) was prominent in individuals tending towards an additive approach. Findings suggest that the distractor effect is related to how value is constructed, which in turn may be influenced by task and subject specificities. This concurs with recent behavioural and neuroscience findings that multiple distractor effects co-exist.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89131">When and why does motor preparation arise in recurrent neural network models of motor control?</a></h4>

              
                During delayed ballistic reaches, motor areas consistently display movement-specific activity patterns prior to movement onset. It is unclear why these patterns arise: while they have been proposed to seed an initial neural state from which the movement unfolds, recent experiments have uncovered the presence and necessity of ongoing inputs during movement, which may lessen the need for careful initialization. Here, we modeled the motor cortex as an input-driven dynamical system, and we asked what the optimal way to control this system to perform fast delayed reaches is. We find that delay-period inputs consistently arise in an optimally controlled model of M1. By studying a variety of network architectures, we could dissect and predict the situations in which it is beneficial for a network to prepare. Finally, we show that optimal input-driven control of neural dynamics gives rise to multiple phases of preparation during reach sequences, providing a novel explanation for experimentally observed features of monkey M1 activity in double reaching.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85601">Time-resolved proximity proteomics uncovers a membrane tension-sensitive caveolin-1 interactome at the rear of migrating cells</a></h4>

              
                Caveolae are small membrane pits with fundamental roles in mechanotransduction. Several studies have shown that caveolae flatten out in response to an increase in membrane tension, thereby acting as a mechanosensitive membrane reservoir that buffers acute mechanical stress. The dynamic assembly and disassembly of caveolae has also been implicated in the control of RhoA/ROCK-mediated actomyosin contractility at the rear of migrating cells. However, how membrane tension controls the organisation of caveolae and caveolae-mediated mechanotransduction is poorly understood. To address this, we systematically quantified protein-protein interactions of caveolin-1 in migrating RPE1 cells at steady state and in response to an acute increase in membrane tension using biotin-based proximity labelling and quantitative mass spectrometry. Our data show that caveolae are highly enriched at the rear of migrating RPE1 cells and that membrane tension rapidly and reversibly disassembles the caveolar protein coat. Membrane tension also dislodges caveolin-1 from focal adhesion proteins and several mechanosensitive cortical actin regulators including filamins and cortactin. In addition, we present evidence that ROCK and the RhoGAP ARHGAP29 are associated with caveolin-1 in a membrane tension-dependent manner, and that ARHGAP29 regulates caveolin-1 Y14 phosphorylation, caveolae rear localisation, and RPE1 cell migration. Taken together, our work uncovers a membrane tension-sensitive coupling between caveolae and the rear-localised F-actin cytoskeleton. This provides a framework for dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying caveolae-regulated mechanotransduction pathways.

">BrainScale: Enabling Scalable Online Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain simulation stands as one of the most ambitious endeavors of our time, yet it remains constrained by significant technical challenges. A critical obstacle in this pursuit is the absence of a scalable online learning framework capable of supporting the efficient training of complex, diverse, and large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs). To address this limitation, we introduce BrainScale, a framework specifically designed to enable scalable online learning in SNNs. BrainScale achieves three key advancements for scalability. (1) Model diversity: BrainScale accommodates the complex dynamics of brain function by supporting a wide spectrum of SNNs through a streamlined abstraction of synaptic interactions. (2) Efficient scaling: Leveraging SNN intrinsic characteristics, BrainScale achieves an online learning algorithm with linear memory complexity. (3) User-friendly programming: BrainScale provides a programming environment that automates the derivation and execution of online learning computations for any user-defined models. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate BrainScale's efficiency and robustness, showing a hundred-fold improvement in memory utilization and several-fold acceleration in training speed while maintaining performance on long-term dependency tasks and neuromorphic datasets. These results suggest that BrainScale represents a crucial step towards brain-scale SNN training and whole-brain simulation.

">Hyperexcitability precedes CA3 hippocampal neurodegeneration in a dox-regulatable TDP-43 mouse model of ALS-FTD.</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal hyperexcitability is a hallmark of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but its relationship with the TDP-43 aggregates that comprise the predominant pathology in over 90% of ALS cases remains unclear. Emerging evidence in tissue and slice culture models indicate that TDP-43 pathology induces neuronal hyperexcitability suggesting it may be responsible for the excitotoxicity long believed to be a major driver of ALS neuron death. Here, we characterized hyperexcitability and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of doxycycline-regulatable rNLS8 mice (NEFH-tTA x tetO-hTDP-43deltaNLS), followed by treatment with AAV encoded DREADDs and anti-seizure medications to measure the effect on behavioral function and neurodegeneration. We found that approximately half of the CA3 neurons in the dorsal hippocampus are lost between 4 and 6 weeks after TDP-43deltaNLS induction. Neurodegeneration was preceded by selective hyperexcitability in the mossy fiber-CA3 circuit, leading us to hypothesize that glutamate excitotoxicity may be a significant contributor to neurodegeneration in this model. Interestingly, hippocampal injection of AAV encoded inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) and daily activation with CNO ligand rescued anxiety deficits on elevated zero maze (EZM) but did not reduce neurodegeneration. Therapeutic doses of the anti-seizure medications, valproic acid and levetiracetam, did not improve behavior or prevent neurodegeneration. These results highlight the complexity of TDP-43 -induced alterations to neuronal excitability and suggest that whereas targeting hyperexcitability can meliorate some behavioral deficits, it may not be sufficient to halt or slow neurodegeneration in TDP-43-related proteinopathies.

">Adipocyte metabolic state regulates glial phagocytic function</a></h4>

              
                Obesity and type 2 diabetes are well-established risk factors for neurodegenerative disorders, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The adipocyte-brain axis is crucial for brain function, as adipocytes secrete signaling molecules, including lipids and adipokines, that impinge on neural circuits to regulate feeding and energy expenditure. Disruptions in the adipocyte-brain axis are associated with neurodegenerative conditions, but the causal links are not fully understood. Neural debris accumulates with age and injury, and glial phagocytic function is crucial for clearing this debris and maintaining a healthy brain microenvironment. Using adult Drosophila, we investigate how adipocyte metabolism influences glial phagocytic activity in the brain. We demonstrate that a prolonged obesogenic diet increases adipocyte fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Genetic manipulations that mimic obesogenic diet-induced changes in adipocyte lipid and mitochondrial metabolism unexpectedly reduce the expression of the phagocytic receptor Draper in Drosophila microglia-like cells in the brain. We identify Apolpp, the Drosophila equivalent of human apolipoprotein B (ApoB), as a critical adipocyte-derived signal that regulates glial phagocytosis. Additionally, we show that Lipoprotein Receptor 1 (LpR1), the LDL receptor on phagocytic glia, is required for glial capacity to clear injury-induced neuronal debris. Our findings establish that adipocyte-brain lipoprotein signaling regulates glial phagocytic function, revealing a novel pathway that links adipocyte metabolic disorders with neurodegeneration.

">Phonological decoding ability is associated with fiber density of the left arcuate fasciculus longitudinally across reading development</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have linked reading ability to white matter microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging, but recent large studies have failed to show consistency. Fiber-specific diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) models offer enhanced precision to measure specific features of white matter structure and may be more sensitive to individual differences in reading skills. However, fiber-specific models have not yet been applied to examine associations between reading ability and white matter microstructure over the course of reading acquisition. In this accelerated longitudinal study, we applied constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and fiber-specific modelling to characterize developmental changes in fiber density of key white matter tracts of the reading network bilaterally, and investigated associations between tract-wise fiber density and children's phonological decoding abilities. Fiber density was measured from ages 2-13 years, and decoding ability (pseudoword reading) was assessed at ages 6 years and older. Higher decoding ability was associated with greater fiber density in the left arcuate fasciculus, and effects remained consistent over time. Follow-up analysis revealed that asymmetry changes in the arcuate fasciculus were moderated by decoding ability: good decoders showed leftward asymmetry from early childhood onward, while poorer decoders shifted toward leftward asymmetry over time. These results suggest that densely organized fibers in the left arcuate fasciculus serve as a foundation for the development of reading skills from the pre-reading stage through fluent reading. Ongoing developmental changes in fiber density and microstructural asymmetry throughout childhood may reflect a reciprocal relationship in which reading experience continues to refine and strengthen these pathways.

">An integrative analysis of cell-specific transcriptomics and nuclear proteomics of sleep-deprived mouse cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sleep regulation follows a homeostatic pattern. The mammalian cerebral cortex is the repository of homeostatic sleep drive and neurons and astrocytes of the cortex are principal responders of sleep need. The molecular mechanisms by which these two cell types respond to sleep loss are not yet clearly understood. By combining cell-type specific transcriptomics and nuclear proteomics we investigated how sleep loss affects the cellular composition and molecular profiles of these two cell types in a focused approach. The results indicate that sleep deprivation regulates gene expression and nuclear protein abundance in a cell-type-specific manner. Our integrated multi-omics analysis suggests that this distinction arises because neurons and astrocytes employ different gene regulatory strategies under accumulated sleep pressure. These findings provide a comprehensive view of the effects of sleep deprivation on gene regulation in neurons and astrocytes.

">Transcriptomic and histological characterization of telocytes in the human dorsal root ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Telocytes are interstitial cells with long processes that cover distances in tissues and likely coordinate interacts with other cell types. Though present in central and peripheral neuronal tissues, their role remains unclear. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) house pseudounipolar afferent neurons responsible for signals such as temperature, proprioception and nociception. This study aimed to investigate the presence and function of telocytes in human DRG by investigating their transcriptional profile, location and ultrastructure. Sequencing data revealed CD34 and PDGFRA expressing cells comprise roughly 1.5-3% of DRG cells. Combined expression of CD34 and PDGFRA is a putative marker gene set for telocytes. Further analysis identified nine subclusters with enriched cluster-specific genes. KEGG and GO pathway analysis suggested vascular, immune and connective tissue associated putative telocyte subtypes. Over 3000 potential receptor-ligand interactions between sensory neurons and these CD34 and PDGFRA expressing putative telocytes were identified using a ligand-receptors interactome platform. Immunohisto-chemistry showed CD34+ telocytes in the endoneural space of DRGs, next to neuron-satellite complexes, in perivascular spaces and in the endoneural space between nerve fibre bundles, consistent with pathway analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed their location identifying characteristic elongated nucleus, long and thin telopods containing vesicles, surrounded by a basal lamina. This is the first study that provides gene expression analysis of telocytes in complex human tissue such as the DRG, highlighting functional differences based on tissue location with no significant ultrastructural variation.

">Elevated synaptic PKA activity and abnormal striatal dopamine signaling in Akap11 mutant mice, a genetic model of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in AKAP11 (a protein kinase A (PKA)-binding protein) greatly increase the risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. We conducted multi-omic analyses of Akap11 mutant mouse brains and report the neurobiological functions of AKAP11 and the consequences of its absence. AKAP11 interacts with multiple proteins involved in signaling and proteostasis. In Akap11+/- and Akap11-/- synapses, PKA protein levels were markedly elevated, and many synaptic proteins were hyperphosphorylated at PKA substrate sites. Akap11 mutant brains showed extensive transcriptomic changes, prominently in synapse-related gene-sets and most profoundly in neurons of the striatum, a brain region implicated in motivation, cognition and psychiatric disorders. In vivo, real-time measurements of PKA activity in Akap11-/- revealed constitutively elevated kinase activity, which distorts the dynamic range of dopamine to PKA signaling in the striatum. Our work reveals the molecular basis of circuit dysfunction in a genetically valid model of psychotic disorder.

                Calcium fluorescence imaging enables us to investigate how individual neurons of live animals encode sensory input or drive specific behaviors. Extracting and interpreting large-scale neuronal activity from imaging data are crucial steps in harnessing this information. A significant challenge arises from uncorrectable tissue deformation, which disrupts the effectiveness of existing neuron segmentation methods. Here, we propose an open-source software, DynamicNeuronTracker (DyNT), which generates dynamic neuron masks for deforming and/or incompletely registered 3D calcium imaging data using patch-matching iterations. We demonstrate that DyNT accurately tracks densely populated neurons, whereas a widely used static segmentation method often produces erroneous masks. DyNT also includes automated statistical analyses for interpreting neuronal responses to multiple sequential stimuli. We applied DyNT to analyze the responses of pheromone-sensing neurons in mice to controlled stimulation. We found that four bile acids and four sulfated steroids activated 15 subpopulations of sensory neurons with distinct combinatorial response profiles, revealing a strong bias toward detecting sulfated estrogen and pregnanolone.

">Which perceptual categories do observers experience during multistable perception?</a></h4>

              
                Multistable perceptual phenomena provide insights into the mind's dynamic states within a stable external environment and the neural underpinnings of these consciousness changes are often studied with binocular rivalry. Conventional methods to study binocular rivalry suffer from biases and assumptions that limit their ability to describe the continuous nature of this perceptual transitions and to discover what kind of percept was perceived across time. In this study, we propose a novel way to avoid those shortcomings by combining a continuous psychophysical method that estimates introspection during binocular rivalry with machine learning clustering and transition probability analysis. This combination of techniques reveals individual variability and complexity of perceptual experience in 28 normally sighted participants. Also, the analysis of transition probabilities between perceptual categories, i.e., exclusive and different kinds of mixed percepts, suggest that interocular perceptual competition, triggered by low-level stimuli, involves conflict between monocular and binocular neural processing sites rather than mutual inhibition of monocular sites.

">Transcriptome profiling of dopaminergic neurons derived from an ADHD induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model</a></h4>

              
                The most recent ADHD GWAS meta analysis highlighted the potential role of 76 genes enriched among genes expressed in early brain development and associated with midbrain dopaminergic neurons. However, the precise functional importance of the GWAS-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remain unknown. In contrast to GWAS, transcriptome analysis directly investigates gene products by assessing the transcribed RNA. This allows one to gain functional insights into gene expression paving the way for a better understanding of the molecular risk mechanisms of conditions, such as ADHD. In this study, we performed transcriptome profiling of highly homogeneous dopamine neurons developed from induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) that were derived from an individual with ADHD and a neurotypical comparison individual. Comparative gene expression analysis between the examined lines revealed that the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly associated with nervous system functions related to neuronal development and dopaminergic regulation. Notably, 29 of the DEGs overlapped with those identified by ADHD GWAS meta analysis. These genes are overrepresented in biological processes including developmental growth regulation, axonogenesis, and nervous system development. In addition, gene set analysis revealed significant enrichment for meta categories such as ion channel activity, synaptic function and assembly, neuronal development and cell differentiation. Further, we observed significantly reduced projections in the ADHD dopamine neurons at the mid differentiation stage (day 14 in vitro), providing preliminary support for the delayed neuronal maturation hypotheses of ADHD. This study underscores the potential of using iPSC derived cell type specific models that integrate genome and transcriptome analyses for biological discovery in ADHD.

">Navigating Memorability Landscapes: Hyperbolic Geometry Reveals Hierarchical Structures in Object Concept Memory</a></h4>

              
                Why are some object concepts (e.g., birds, cars, vegetables, etc.) more memorable than others? Prior studies have suggested that features (e.g., color, animacy, etc.) and typicality (e.g., robin vs. penguin) of object images influences the likelihood of being remembered. However, a complete understanding of object memorability remains elusive. In this study, we examine whether the geometric relationship between object concepts explains differences in their memorability. Specifically, we hypothesize that image concepts will be geometrically arranged in hierarchical structures and that memorability will be explained by a concept's depth in these hierarchical trees. To test this hypothesis, we construct a Hyperbolic representation space of object concepts (N=1,854) from the THINGS database (Hebart et al., 2019), which consists of naturalistic images of concrete objects, and a space of 49 feature dimensions derived from data-driven models. Using ALBATROSS (Stier et al., In prep), a stochastic topological data analysis technique that detects underlying structures of data, we demonstrate that Hyperbolic geometry efficiently captures the hierarchical organization of object concepts above and beyond a traditional Euclidean geometry and that hierarchical organization is related to memorability. We find that concepts closer to the center of the representational space are more prototypical and also more memorable. Importantly, Hyperbolic distances are more predictive of memorability and prototypicality than Euclidean distances, suggesting that concept memorability and typicality are organized hierarchically. Taken together, our work presents a novel hierarchical representational structure of object concepts that explains memorability and typicality.

                MicroRNAs are small, highly conserved non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate mRNA translation and stability. In the brain, microRNAs contribute to neuronal development, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. The microRNA 138-5p (miR-138-5p) controls inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and is highly expressed in cerebellar excitatory neurons. However, its role in cerebellar synaptic transmission remains unkwown. Here, we investigated excitatory transmission within the cerebellum in mice expressing a sponge construct that sequesters endogenous miR-138-5p. Mossy fiber stimulation-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in granule cells were significantly larger compared with controls. Furthermore, we observed larger miniature EPSC amplitudes, suggesting increased postsynaptic AMPA receptor numbers. High-frequency train stimulations revealed enhanced short-term depression following miR-138-5p downregulation. Together with computational modelling, this suggests a negative regulation of presynaptic release probability. Overall, our results demonstrate that miR-138-5p suppresses synaptic strength through pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, providing a powerful mechanism for tuning excitatory synaptic input into the cerebellum.

">Cardiac responses to auditory irregularities reveal hierarchical information processing during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to process environmental stimuli varies during sleep. Although much research focused on neural processing, emerging evidence shows that bodily signals may play a key role in understanding high-level sensory processing during sleep. Here, we tested how cardiac responses to the local-global paradigm, a typical oddball task probing the processing of simple (local) and complex (global) sensory irregularities. To do so, we analyzed electrocardiography (ECG) signals in a total of 56 participants from two existing datasets which contained cerebral responses to local auditory irregularities, but which did not analyze the ECG data before. We found that cardiac activity slowed down after global, but not local, auditory irregularities, revealing the presence of global deviance effect in Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, cardiac activity was faster after local, but not global, deviants in Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. Overall, our results demonstrate that cardiac responses to auditory irregularities inform about hierarchical information processing and its variations during sleep beyond cerebral activity. They highlight the embodiment of cognitive function and the value of cardiac signals to understand the variations of sensory processing during sleep.

">The electrogenicity of the Na+/K+-ATPase poses challenges for computation in highly active spiking cells</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of the Na+/K+-ATPase laid the foundation for ion homeostasis and electrical signalling. While not required for restoration of ionic gradients, the electrogenicity of the pump (resulting from its 3:2 stoichiometry) is useful to prevent runaway activity. As we show here, electrogenicity also comes with disadvantageous side effects: (1) an activity-dependent shift in a cell's baseline firing and (2) interference with computation, disturbing network entrainment when inputs change strongly. We exemplify these generic effects in a mathematical model of the weakly electric fish electrocyte, which spikes at hundreds of Hz and is exposed to abrupt rate changes when producing behaviourally relevant communication signals. We discuss biophysical strategies allowing cells to mitigate the consequences of electrogenicity at additional metabolic cost and postulate an interesting role for a voltage dependence of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Our work shows that the pump's electrogenicity opens an additional axis of vulnerability that is likely to play a role in brain disease.

">Temporal integration in human auditory cortex is predominantly yoked to absolute time, not structure duration</a></h4>

              
                Sound structures such as phonemes and words have highly variable durations. Thus, there is a fundamental difference between integrating across absolute time (e.g., 100 ms) vs. sound structure (e.g., phonemes). Auditory and cognitive models have traditionally cast neural integration in terms of time and structure, respectively, but the extent to which cortical computations reflect time or structure remains unknown. To answer this question, we rescaled the duration of all speech structures using time stretching/compression and measured integration windows in the human auditory cortex using a new experimental/computational method applied to spatiotemporally precise intracranial recordings. We observed significantly longer integration windows for stretched speech, but this lengthening was very small (~5%) relative to the change in structure durations, even in non-primary regions strongly implicated in speech-specific processing. These findings demonstrate that time-yoked computations dominate throughout the human auditory cortex, placing important constraints on neurocomputational models of structure processing.

">Leg compliance is required to explain the ground reaction force patterns and speed ranges in different gaits</a></h4>

              
                Two simple models, vaulting over stiff legs and rebounding over compliant legs, are employed to describe the mechanics of legged locomotion. It is agreed that compliant legs are necessary for describing running and that legs are compliant while walking. Despite this agreement, stiff legs continue to be employed to model walking. Here, we show that leg compliance is necessary to model walking and, in the process, identify the principles that underpin two important features of legged locomotion: First, at the same speed, step length, and stance duration, multiple gaits that differ in the number of leg contraction cycles are possible. Among them, humans and other animals choose a gait with M-shaped vertical ground reaction forces because it is energetically favored. Second, the transition from walking to running occurs because of the inability to redirect the vertical component of the velocity during the double stance phase. Additionally, we also examine the limits of double spring-loaded pendulum (DSLIP) as a quantitative model for locomotion, and conclude that DSLIP is limited as a model for walking. However, insights gleaned from the analytical treatment of DSLIP are general and will inform the construction of more accurate models of walking.

">Whisker deprivation triggers a distinct form of cortical homeostatic plasticity that is impaired in the Fmr1 KO</a></h4>

              
                Mouse models of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) have demonstrated impairments in excitatory and inhibitory sensory-evoked neuronal firing. Homeostatic plasticity, which encompasses a set of mechanisms to stabilize baseline activity levels, does not compensate for these changes in activity. Previous work has shown that impairments in homeostatic plasticity are observed in FXS, including deficits in synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability. Here, we aimed to examine how homeostatic plasticity is altered in vivo in an Fmr1 KO mouse model following unilateral whisker deprivation (WD). We show that WD in the wild type leads to an increase in the proportion of L5/6 somatosensory neurons that are recruited, but this does not occur in the KO. In addition, we observed a change in the threshold of excitatory neurons at a later developmental stage in the KO. Compromised homeostatic plasticity in development could influence sensory processing and long-term cortical organization.

">Embodied processing in whisker somatosensory cortex during exploratory behaviour in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems have evolved to solve computational challenges that animals face during behaviour in their natural environments. To illuminate how sensory cortex operates under such conditions, we investigated the function of neurons in whisker-related Somatosensory Cortex (wS1) of freely moving mice, engaged in tactile exploratory behaviour. By recording neural activity from wS1 whilst tracking the mouse body in 3D, we found that wS1 neurons are substantially modulated by body state (configuration of individual body-parts and their derivatives), even in the absence of whisker afferent input. Most neurons were modulated by multiple dimensions of body state, with the most prominently encoded being the angle of the head to the body and locomotion speed. Overall, our data suggest that sensory cortex functions as an embodied representation, which integrates signals from its associated sense organ within a body schema.

">Distinct Disruptions in CA1 and CA3 Place Cell Function in Alzheimer's Disease Mice</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus, a critical brain structure for spatial learning and memory, is susceptible to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model is widely used to study the pathology of AD. Although previous research has established AD-associated impairments in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these cognitive dysfunctions remain less understood. To address this gap, we investigated the activities of place cells in both CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subregions, which have distinct yet complementary computational roles. Behaviorally, APP/PS1 mice demonstrated impaired spatial recognition memory compared to wild-type (WT) mice in the object location test. Physiologically, place cells in APP/PS1 mice showed deterioration in spatial representation compared to WT. Specifically, CA1 place cells exhibited significant reductions in coherence and spatial information, while CA3 place cells displayed a significant reduction in place field size. Both CA1 and CA3 place cells in APP/PS1 mice also showed significant disruptions in their ability to stably encode the same environment. Furthermore, the burst firing properties of these cells were altered to forms correlated with reduced cognition. Additionally, the theta rhythm was significantly attenuated in CA1 place cells of APP/PS1 mice compared to WT. Our results suggest that distinct alteration in the physiological properties of CA1 and CA3 place cells, coupled with disrupted hippocampal theta rhythm in CA1, may collectively contribute to impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in AD.

">The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol is released and transported on demand via extracellular microvesicles</a></h4>

              
                While it is known that endocannabinoids (eCB) modulate multiple neuronal functions, the molecular mechanism governing their release and transport remains elusive. Here, we propose an 'on-demand release' model, wherein the formation of microvesicles, a specific group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is the rate-limiting step. A co-culture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, GRABeCB2.0, and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by PKC, DAGL, Arf6, and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors. This 'on demand release' model, supported by mathematical analysis, offers a cohesive framework for understanding eCB signaling at the molecular level and suggests that microvesicles carrying signaling lipids regulate neuronal functions in parallel to canonical synaptic vesicles.

">CX3CR1 modulates migration of resident microglia towards brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). They extend their processes towards and migrate towards injuries in vivo. However, whether the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) influences microglial migration remains unknown. Label-free proteomic profiling predicted changes in RHO-signaling activity that hint at dysregulated cytoskeleton signaling in Cx3cr1-deficient murine cortex tissue. To further investigate microglial migration, we carried out 4-hour interval two-photon in vivo imaging for 72 hours after a laser lesion in the cortex. Cx3cr1-deficient microglia showed enhanced migration towards the lesion. Additionally, length and velocity of microglial fine processes extending towards the lesion were increased in Cx3cr1-deficient microglia. Migration remained unchanged in Ccr2-deficient mice, indicating that monocyte-derived macrophages/microglia did not contribute to microglia accumulation around the lesion. These results demonstrate microglia migration towards CNS injury and suggest CX3CR1 as a modulator of this. Manipulating microglia migration via CX3CR1 therefore is a potential target for treatment of CNS-injury.

">Why do we have so many excitatory neurons?</a></h4>

              
                Approximately four in five neurons are excitatory. This is true across functional regions and species. Why do we have so many excitatory neurons? Little is known. Here we provide a normative answer to this question. We designed a task-agnostic, learning-independent and experiment-testable measurement of functional complexity, which quantifies the network's ability to solve complex problems. Using the first neuron level full connectome of a species - the larva Drosophila - we discovered the optimal Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) ratio that maximizes the functional complexity: 75-81% percentage of neurons are excitatory. This number is consistent with the true distribution observed via scRNA-seq. We found that the abundance of excitatory neurons confers an advantage in functional complexity, but only when inhibitory neurons are highly connected. In contrast, when the E-I identities are sampled uniformly (not dependent on connectivity), the optimal E-I ratio falls around equal population size, and its overall achieved functional complexity is sub-optimal. Our functional complexity measurement offers a normative explanation for the over-abundance of excitatory neurons in the brain. We anticipate that this approach will further uncover the functional significance of various neural network structures.

">Amyloid-β-induced Alteration of Fast and Localized Calcium Elevations in Cultured Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes cognitive decline. Uncovering the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in the early stages is essential to establish a treatment for AD. Recent research has proposed the hypothesis that amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) oligomers elicit an excessive glutamate release from astrocytes toward synapses through intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) elevations in astrocytes, finally resulting in neuronal dendritic spine loss. Under physiological conditions, astrocytic [Ca2+]i elevations range spatially from microdomains to network-wide propagation and temporally from milliseconds to tens of seconds. Astrocytic localized and fast [Ca2+]i elevations might correlate with glutamate release; however, the A{beta}-induced alteration of localized, fast astrocytic [Ca2+]i elevations remains unexplored. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the A{beta} dimers-induced changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of [Ca2+]i in a primary culture of astrocytes by two-photon excitation spinning-disk confocal microscopy. The frequency of fast [Ca2+]i elevations occurring locally in astrocytes ([&le;]0.5 s, [&le;]35 m2) and [Ca2+]i event occupancy relative to cell area significantly increased after exposure to A{beta} dimers. The effect of A{beta} dimers appeared dose-dependently above 500 nM, and these A{beta} dimers-induced [Ca2+]i elevations were primarily mediated by a metabotropic purinergic receptor (P2Y1 receptor) and Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Our findings suggest that the A{beta} dimers-induced alterations and hyperactivation of astrocytic [Ca2+]i is a candidate cellular mechanism in the early stages of AD.

">Motor preparation tracks decision boundary crossing in temporal decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Interval timing, the ability of animals to estimate the passage of time, is thought to involve diverse neural processes rather than a single central "clock" (Paton & Buonomano, 2018). Each of the different processes engaged in interval timing follows a different dynamic path, according to its specific function. For example, attention tracks anticipated events, such as offsets of intervals (Rohenkohl & Nobre, 2011), while motor processes control the timing of the behavioral output (De Lafuente et al., 2024). Hence, different processes provide complimentary perspectives on mechanisms of time perception. The temporal bisection task, where participants categorize intervals as "long" or "short", is thought to rely on the same mechanisms as other perceptual decisions (Balci & Simen, 2014). In line with this hypothesis, we previously described an EEG potential that tracks the formation of decision following the end of the timed interval (Ofir & Landau, 2022). Here, we track the dynamics of motor preparation to investigate the formation of decision within the timed interval. In contrast to typical perceptual decisions, where motor plans for all response alternatives are prepared simultaneously (Shadlen & Kiani, 2013), we find that different temporal decisions develop sequentially. While preparation for "long" responses was already underway before interval offset, no preparation was found for "short" responses. Furthermore, within intervals categorized as "long", motor preparation was stronger at interval offset for faster responses. Our findings shed light on the unique dynamics of temporal decisions and demonstrate the importance of considering neural activity in timing tasks from multiple perspectives.

">Effects of age on resting-state cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography recordings of functional brain activity reveal large-scale cortical networks that are associated with cognition. The correlation of individualised networks with age and cognitive performance (age effects and cognitive performance effects respectively) was studied using a large cross-sectional healthy cohort (N=612, 18-88 years old) and accounting for a comprehensive set of confounds. Age effects were found in time-averaged functional networks in five canonical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) that are consistent with the posterior-anterior shift with age observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. Evidence from cognitive performance effects in time-averaged networks suggested the importance of maintaining alpha-band activity for cognitive health. A more detailed description of the functional activity was obtained by adopting an established machine learning approach (the Hidden Markov Model). Ten transient large-scale cortical networks with fast dynamics (~100 ms) were identified, which provided insight into age and cognitive performance effects that were not observed in the time-averaged analyses. The time spent in most networks increased with age, whereas the time spent in frontal networks decreased. The cognitive performance effects for the transient networks suggested that age effects in the frontal networks are compensatory. Thus, our study suggests both the maintenance of functional activity (lesser age effects) and the recruitment of compensatory functional activity can co-occur to produce good cognitive performance in older individuals. The time-averaged and transient functional networks have been made publicly available as a resource.

We demonstrate live imaging of 25 plane 3D volumes of up to 180x180x50um at >100 volumes per second. 3D data is recorded simultaneously by an array of 25 small, sensitive, synchronized machine vision cameras. M25 employs aberration corrected Multifocus microscopy, an optical method where diffractive Fourier optics are used for multiplexing and refocusing light, with a simplified design for chromatic dispersion correction where a corrective diffractive grating is placed on each camera in the array. This elegant architecture for chromatic correction will be applicable in a broad range of diffractive imaging applications. M25 is a powerful optical tool for high speed 3D microscopy in that it allows both non invasive, label free bright field and highly sensitive fluorescence microscopy. We showcase M25 capabilities in 3D particle tracking, bright field and fluorescence imaging in D. melanogaster, and locomotion and neural activity studies in C. elegans.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Crowding is a common visual phenomenon that can significantly impair the recognition of objects in peripheral vision. Two recent behavioral studies have revealed that both exogenous and endogenous attention can alleviate crowding, but exogenous attention seems to be more effective. Methods: The present study employed the event-related potential (ERP) technique to explore the electrophysiological characteristics of the influence of these two types of attention on crowding. In the experiment, participants were required to judge whether the letter &amp;amp;ldquo;T&amp;amp;rdquo; was upright or inverted, which may be preceded by an exogenous cue or an endogenous cue indicating the location of the target letter. Results: The behavioral results showed that while exogenous cues reduced crowding in all stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), endogenous attention took effects only in long SOA. The ERP results indicated that both endogenous and exogenous cues significantly alleviated the inhibition of visual crowding on the N1 component. However, the endogenous cue was effective only under long SOA, while the exogenous cue was effective only under short SOA conditions. In addition, invalid exogenous cues induced a larger P3 wave amplitude than valid ones in the short SOA condition, but endogenous attention did not show such a difference. Conclusions: These results indicate that both endogenous and exogenous attention can alleviate the effects of visual crowding, but they differ in effect size and temporal dynamics.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive impairment is an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia, and its detection in the early stages is essential to prevent dementia, an incurable pathology. The aim of this study is to screen and estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment, including dementia, and its correlated factors in a community-based sample of the Albanian population over 50 years old. Methods: We carried out a door-to-door neuropsychological screening of Albanian residents older than 50 years from November 2023 to June 2024 in 12 Albanian districts. Participants completed the Early Dementia Questionnaire (EDQ) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: The overall estimating prevalence of cognitive impairment and early dementia among the Albanian population over 50 years old was 14.04% using the MMSE, with 2.31% for MMSE &amp;amp;le;18 (serious cognitive impairment), 5.51% for MMSE 19&amp;amp;ndash;22 (mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), and 6.22 for MMSE 23&amp;amp;ndash;24 (suspected cognitive impairment or dementia),respectively. The prevalence of early dementia using the EDQ was significantly higher (53.99%).The number of male participants with MMSE scores of 23&amp;amp;ndash;24 (suspected cognitive impairment or early dementia) was 2.5 times higher with respect to female participants. Smoking and alcohol consumption decreased the MMSE scores. The number of participants with normal cognitive function (MMSE scores 25&amp;amp;ndash;30) was lower among participants with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cerebral ischemia. Conclusions: A diagnostic evaluation, including a clinical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory studies, is further required for a diagnosis. Despite limitations, the data provided in this study are the only ones reported for a large community-based sample of the older adult Albanian population, which can help health care providers to diagnose cognitive impairment.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used to assess language lateralization, but its application in patients with brain tumors can be hindered by cognitive impairments, compensatory neuroplasticity, and artifacts due to patient movement or severe aphasia. Gray matter volume (GMV) analysis via voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in language-related brain regions may offer a stable complementary approach. This study investigates the relationship between GMV and fMRI-derived language lateralization in healthy individuals and patients with left-hemisphere brain tumors, aiming to enhance accuracy in complex cases. Methods: The MRI data from 22 healthy participants and 28 individuals with left-hemisphere brain tumors were analyzed. Structural T1-weighted and functional images were obtained during three language tasks. Language lateralization was assessed based on activation in predefined regions of interest (ROIs), categorized as typical (left) or atypical (right or bilateral). The GMV in these ROIs was measured using VBM. Linear regressions explored GMV-lateralization associations, and logistic regressions predicted the lateralization based on the GMV. Results: In the healthy participants, typical left-hemispheric language dominance correlated with higher GMV in the left pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus. The brain tumor participants with atypical lateralization showed increased GMV in six right-hemisphere ROIs. The GMV in the language ROIs predicted the fMRI language lateralization, with AUCs from 80.1% to 94.2% in the healthy participants and 78.3% to 92.6% in the tumor patients. Conclusions: GMV analysis in language-related ROIs effectively complements fMRI for assessing language dominance, particularly when fMRI is challenging. It correlates with language lateralization in both healthy individuals and brain tumor patients, highlighting its potential in preoperative language mapping. Further research with larger samples is needed to refine its clinical utility.</p>

	<p>Violence against women impacts a minimum of 35% of the global female population, encompassing sexual, physical, and psychological forms. Perpetrators of this violence include partners, family members, or strangers. Its ramifications are substantial, evident in the prevalence of chronic pain reported by between 48% and 84% of women who have experienced abuse, with an odds ratio of 2.08. Notably associated diagnoses include pelvic/vaginal pain, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome/bowel symptoms, abdominal pain, migraine/headache, and back and neck pain. These diagnoses significantly limit a woman&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to participate in daily activities, such as exercising or working, leading to genuine disability. Despite substantial evidence, the precise cause and etiology of these conditions remain unclear. Adhering to the bio-psycho-social model, it is conceivable that chronic pain in victims of violence cannot be attributed to a single factor alone, but rather to a combination of all three: biological, psychological, and social factors. Uncovering these factors could have significant clinical and legal implications. On one hand, it would be possible to conduct screenings to avoid developing chronic pain. and guide individuals toward the correct treatment. On the other hand, victims could seek compensation for chronic pain resulting from violence. Considering the limited knowledge about the causes of chronic pain and the absence of tools to identify risk factors or a set of tests for evaluating victims of violence, the goal of the research described in this project protocol is to pinpoint the specific contributing factors for chronic pain due to violence victimization. Additionally, it aims to devise a comprehensive protocol for assessing these factors in forensic science.</p>

	<p>In this review, we aim to draw a connection between drug addiction and overconsumption of highly palatable food (OHPF) by discussing common behaviors and neurochemical pathways shared by these two states. OHPF can stimulate reward pathways in the brain that parallel those triggered by drug use, increasing the risk of dependency. Behavioral similarities between food and drug addiction can be addressed by tracking their stages: loss of control when eating (bingeing), withdrawal, craving, sensitization, and cross-sensitization. The brain adapts to addiction by way of the mesolimbic dopamine system, endogenous opioids and receptors, acetylcholine and dopamine balance, and adaptations of serotonin in neuroanatomy. Studies from the current literature are reviewed to determine how various neurological chemicals contribute to the reinforcement of drug addiction and OHPF. Finally, protocols for treating food addiction are discussed, including both clinical and pharmacological modalities. There is consistent evidence that OHPF changes brain chemistry and leads to addiction in similar ways to drugs. However, more long-term research is needed on food addiction, binge eating, and their neurobiological effects.</p>

	<p>Background: Headache is a common complaint during childhood and adolescence. It is important to be aware of the characteristics of pediatric headaches in order to make a precise and timely diagnosis. This study investigated the clinical characteristics of pediatric headaches according to the underlying etiology and age group. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 3374 pediatric patients (2667 with primary headache [PH] and 707 with secondary headache [SH]) who presented with headaches at two centers between January 2012 and November 2023. Results: The incidence of PH was significantly higher in adolescents (40.1% vs. 22.9%), whereas that of SH was considerably higher in preschoolers (37.5% vs. 16.3%) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The prevalence of headaches attributed to infection was significantly higher in preschool and school-aged children (90.8% vs. 80.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); adolescents exhibited significantly higher frequencies of cranial and cervical vascular disorders (3.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.044) and psychiatric disorders (5.6% vs. 0.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Statistically significant differences were observed between preschool/school-aged children and adolescents in terms of headache characteristics and the prevalence of headache-associated symptoms (60.4% vs. 74.1%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in PH), neurologic abnormalities (10.2% vs. 23.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in PH; 2.4% vs. 11.7%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in SH), and headache triggers (19.9% vs. 24.2%, p = 0.008 in PH; 2.0% vs. 8.0%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in SH). Conclusions: Recognizing the etiology and age-specific differences in the clinical characteristics of headaches is crucial for an accurate and timely diagnosis. Tailoring the diagnostic approach accordingly helps to achieve optimal outcomes in pediatric patients with headaches.</p>

                <p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (CaBPs; CaBP1&ndash;5) are a subfamily of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors with high homology to calmodulin. Notably, CaBP4, which is exclusively expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors, is crucial for maintaining normal retinal functions. However, the functional roles of CaBP1, CaBP2, and CaBP5 in the retina remain elusive, primarily due to limited understanding of their expression patterns within inner retinal neurons. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive transcript analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to investigate the gene expression profiles of CaBPs in mouse and human retinal neurons. Our findings revealed notable similarities in the overall expression patterns of CaBPs across both species. Specifically, nearly all amacrine cell, ganglion cell, and horizontal cell types exclusively expressed CaBP1. In contrast, the majority of bipolar cell types, including rod bipolar (RB) cells, expressed distinct combinations of CaBP1, CaBP2, and CaBP5, rather than a single CaBP as previously hypothesized. Remarkably, mouse rods and human cones exclusively expressed CaBP4, whereas mouse cones and human rods coexpressed both CaBP4 and CaBP5. Our single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the coexpression CaBP1 and CaBP5 in individual RBs from mice of either sex. Additionally, all three splice variants of CaBP1, primarily L-CaBP1, were detected in mouse RBs. Taken together, our study offers a comprehensive overview of the distribution of CaBPs in mouse and human retinal neurons, providing valuable insights into their roles in visual functions.</p>

                <p>Social recognition is an essential part of social function and often promotes specific social behaviors based on prior experience. Social and defensive behaviors in particular often emerge with prior experiences of familiarity or novelty/stress, respectively. This is also commonly seen in rodents toward same-strain and interstrain conspecifics. Medial amygdala (MeA) activity guides social choice based on age and sex recognition and is sensitive to social experiences. However, little is known about whether the MeA exhibits differential responses based on strain or how this is impacted by experience. Social stress impacts posterior MeA (MeAp) function and can shift measures of social engagement. However, it is unclear how stress impacts MeAp activity and contributes to altered social behavior. The primary goal of this study in adult male Sprague Dawley rats was to determine whether prior stress experience with a different-strain (Long&ndash;Evans) rat impacts MeAp responses to same-strain and different-strain conspecifics in parallel with a change in behavior using in vivo fiber photometry. We found that MeAp activity was uniformly activated during social contact with a novel same-strain rat during a three-chamber social preference test following control handling but became biased toward a novel different-strain rat following social stress. Socially stressed rats also showed initially heightened social interaction with novel same-strain rats but showed social avoidance and fragmented social behavior with novel different-strain rats relative to controls. These results indicate that heightened MeAp activity may guide social responses to novel, threatening, rather than non-threatening, social stimuli after stress.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0306-24.2024?rss=1">Whole Nervous System Expression of Glutamate Receptors Reveals Distinct Receptor Roles in Sensorimotor Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>The goal of connectomics is to reveal the links between neural circuits and behavior. Larvae of the primitive chordate <I>Ciona</I> are well-suited to make contributions in this area. In addition to having a described connectome, <I>Ciona</I> larvae have a range of readily quantified behaviors. Moreover, the small number of neurons in the larval CNS (~180) holds the promise of a comprehensive characterization of individual neurons. We present single-neuron predictions for glutamate receptor (GlutR) expression based on in situ hybridization. Included are both ionotropic receptors (AMPA, NMDA, and kainate) and metabotropic receptors. The predicted glutamate receptor expression dataset is discussed in the context of known circuits driving behaviors such as phototaxis, mechanosensation, and looming shadow response. The predicted expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors may help resolve issues regarding the co-production of GABA and glutamate by a subset of photoreceptors. The targets of these photoreceptors in the midbrain appear to express NMDA receptors, but not AMPA receptors. This is in agreement with previous results indicating that GABA is the primary neurotransmitter from the photoreceptors evoking a swimming response through a disinhibition mechanism and that glutamate may, therefore, have only a modulatory action in this circuit. Other findings reported here are more unexpected. For example, many of the targets of glutamatergic epidermal sensory neurons (ESNs) do not express any of the ionotropic receptors, yet the ESNs themselves express metabotropic receptors. Thus, we speculate that their production of glutamate may be for communication with neighboring ESNs, rather than to their interneuron targets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-791/v2?src=rss">Real Customization or Just Marketing: Are Customized Versions of Generative AI Useful? [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of fine-tuning their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

                Background Building Metagenome–Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from highly complex metagenomics datasets encompasses a series of steps covering from cleaning the sequences, assembling them to finally group them into bins. Along the process, multiple tools aimed to assess the quality and integrity of each MAG are implemented. Nonetheless, even when incorporated within end–to–end pipelines, the outputs of these pieces of software must be visualized and analyzed manually lacking integration in a complete framework. Methods We developed a Nextflow pipeline (MAGFlow) for estimating the quality of MAGs through a wide variety of approaches (BUSCO, CheckM2, GUNC and QUAST), as well as for annotating taxonomically the metagenomes using GTDB-Tk2. MAGFlow is coupled to a Python–Dash application (BIgMAG) that displays the concatenated outcomes from the tools included by MAGFlow, highlighting the most important metrics in a single interactive environment along with a comparison/clustering of the input data. Results By using MAGFlow/BIgMAG, the user will be able to benchmark the MAGs obtained through different workflows or establish the quality of the MAGs belonging to different samples following the divide and rule methodology. Conclusions MAGFlow/BIgMAG represents a unique tool that integrates state-of-the-art tools to study different quality metrics and extract visually as much information as possible from a wide range of genome features.

                Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a change in brain function or evidence of brain pathology caused by external mechanical forces. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a neurotropin that functions as a neuron protective. Nigella sativa L is reported to have an antioxidant effect, administration of Nigella Sativa L to rats treated with ischemia-reperfusion brain injury. Propofol is an anesthetic agent frequently used intravenously in the management of TBI. The effect of propofol on brain tissue after TBI may be neuroprotective. We aimed to compare the potential of Nigella sativa L and propofol as neuroplasticity and neuroprotection in rats with TBI. Methods This was a laboratory experimental animal model with the post-test only control group design, namely measuring the effect of treatment by comparing the five groups of rats consisting of 30 rats. BDNF levels in rat brain tissue were collected at day 7 of treatment and measured by ELISA. Results The average BDNF protein levels per group, namely G1 (221,243 pg/mL), G2 (172,139 pg/mL), G3 (255,483 pg/mL), G4 (227,089 pg/mL), and G5 (272,603 pg/mL) respectively. Based on the ANOVA statistic, p-value = 0.032 (there was a significant difference between groups), with the Levene Test (0.077) or having variance between the same groups, sequentially the difference in average BDNF protein levels of the five groups is G5>G3>G4>G1>G2, meaning that the combination of Nigella sativa and propofol has more potential to increase BDNF protein levels than Nigella sativa, and Nigella sativa has more potential than propofol. Conclusion We concluded that both nigella sativa and propofol have the potential to increase BDNF protein levels. Nigella Sativa L had a better effect than propofol in repairing damaged neuron cells (neuroplasticity) and increasing BDNF protein levels (neuroprotection) for 7 days of administration in rat traumatic brain injury.

                Background Gambling disorder (GD) has become a wide concern in Indonesia, as many negative consequences arise from this psychiatric condition. Prompt treatment with an appropriate method of delivery is required to achieve optimal outcomes in GD patients. This protocol paper outlines a study to determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) in treating GD in Indonesia. Methods This non-randomized pilot and feasibility study will recruit 20 people with GD. All participants will receive the iCBT intervention through self-learning videos and guided weekly group sessions. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed at baseline (week 0), post- treatment completion (week 10), and 6 weeks post-treatment (week 16). The outcomes measured will be the change in gambling symptoms, gambling urges, cognitive distortions, readiness to change, emotional problems, and quality of life of the participants. Discussion The feasibility of iCBT for GD patients in Indonesia will be assessed by this study. The study’s results will give an indication of the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of a subsequent conclusive trial. The delivery of iCBT may help to address the issue of treatment access in an extensive geographical region and provide immediate implications as a treatment resource for GD in practice.

                Wireless capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive medical imaging modality used for diagnosing and monitoring digestive tract diseases. However, the analysis of images obtained from wireless capsule endoscopy is a challenging task, as the images are of low resolution and often contain a large number of artifacts. In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the analysis of medical images, including wireless capsule endoscopy images. This paper provides a review of the current trends and future directions in deep learning for wireless capsule endoscopy. We focus on the recent advances in transfer learning, attention mechanisms, multi-modal learning, automated lesion detection, interpretability and explainability, data augmentation, and edge computing. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of current deep learning methods and discuss the potential future directions for the field. Our review provides insights into the ongoing research and development efforts in the field of deep learning for wireless capsule endoscopy, and can serve as a reference for researchers, clinicians, and engineers working in this area inspection process.

                <p>by Jolanda Malamud, Sinan Guloksuz, Ruud van Winkel, Philippe Delespaul, Marc A. F. De Hert, Catherine Derom, Evert Thiery, Nele Jacobs, Bart P. F. Rutten, Quentin J. M. Huys</p>
Background <p>Mood disorders involve a complex interplay between multifaceted internal emotional states, and complex external inputs. Dynamical systems theory suggests that this interplay between aspects of moods and environmental stimuli may hence determine key psychopathological features of mood disorders, including the stability of mood states, the response to external inputs, how controllable mood states are, and what interventions are most likely to be effective. However, a comprehensive computational approach to all these aspects has not yet been undertaken.</p> Methods <p>Here, we argue that the combination of ecological momentary assessments (EMA) with a well-established dynamical systems framework—the humble Kalman filter—enables a comprehensive account of all these aspects. We first introduce the key features of the Kalman filter and optimal control theory and their relationship to aspects of psychopathology. We then examine the psychometric and inferential properties of combining EMA data with Kalman filtering across realistic scenarios. Finally, we apply the Kalman filter to a series of EMA datasets comprising over 700 participants with and without symptoms of depression.</p> Results <p>The results show a naive Kalman filter approach performs favourably compared to the standard vector autoregressive approach frequently employed, capturing key aspects of the data better. Furthermore, it suggests that the depressed state involves alterations to interactions between moods; alterations to how moods responds to external inputs; and as a result an alteration in how controllable mood states are. We replicate these findings qualitatively across datasets and explore an extension to optimal control theory to guide therapeutic interventions.</p> Conclusions <p>Mood dynamics are richly and profoundly altered in depressed states. The humble Kalman filter is a well-established, rich framework to characterise mood dynamics. Its application to EMA data is valid; straightforward; and likely to result in substantial novel insights both into mechanisms and treatments.</p>

                <p>by Matt J. Keeling, Louise Dyson</p>

We discuss the invasion of the Omicron BA.1 variant into England as a paradigm for real-time model fitting and projection. Here we use a mixture of simple SIR-type models, analysis of the early data and a more complex age-structure model fit to the outbreak to understand the dynamics. In particular, we highlight that early data shows that the invading Omicron variant had a substantial growth advantage over the resident Delta variant. However, early data does not allow us to reliably infer other key epidemiological parameters—such as generation time and severity—which influence the expected peak hospital numbers. With more complete epidemic data from January 2022 are we able to capture the true scale of the epidemic in terms of both infections and hospital admissions, driven by different infection characteristics of Omicron compared to Delta and a substantial shift in estimated precautionary behaviour during December. This work highlights the challenges of real time forecasting, in a rapidly changing environment with limited information on the variant’s epidemiological characteristics.

                <p>by Juan Pablo Franco, Peter Bossaerts, Carsten Murawski</p>

Many everyday tasks require people to solve computationally complex problems. However, little is known about the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving such problems. Here, we draw on computational complexity theory to address this issue. We performed an experiment in which participants solved several instances of the 0-1 knapsack problem, a combinatorial optimization problem, while undergoing ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Instances varied in computational hardness. We characterize a network of brain regions whose activation was correlated with computational complexity, including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the intra-parietal sulcus/angular gyrus. Activation and connectivity changed dynamically as a function of complexity, in line with theoretical computational requirements. Overall, our results suggest that computational complexity theory provides a suitable framework to study the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving complex cognitive tasks.

                <p>by Nafiseh Atapour, Marcello G. P. Rosa, Shi Bai, Sylwia Bednarek, Agata Kulesza, Gabriela Saworska, Sadaf Teymornejad, Katrina H. Worthy, Piotr Majka</p>

The diversity of the mammalian cerebral cortex demands technical approaches to map the spatial distribution of neurons with different biochemical identities. This issue is magnified in the case of the primate cortex, characterized by a large number of areas with distinctive cytoarchitectures. To date, no full map of the distribution of cells expressing a specific protein has been reported for the cortex of any primate. Here we have charted the 3-dimensional distribution of neurons expressing the calcium-binding protein calbindin (CB<sup>+</sup> neurons) across the entire marmoset cortex, using a combination of immunohistochemistry, automated cell identification, computerized reconstruction, and cytoarchitecture-aware registration. CB<sup>+</sup> neurons formed a heterogeneous population, which together corresponded to 10–20% of the cortical neurons. They occurred in higher proportions in areas corresponding to low hierarchical levels of processing, such as sensory cortices. Although CB<sup>+</sup> neurons were concentrated in the supragranular and granular layers, there were clear global trends in their laminar distribution. For example, their relative density in infragranular layers increased with hierarchical level along sensorimotor processing streams, and their density in layer 4 was lower in areas involved in sensorimotor integration, action planning and motor control. These results reveal new quantitative aspects of the cytoarchitectural organization of the primate cortex, and demonstrate an approach to mapping the full distribution of neurochemically distinct cells throughout the brain which is readily applicable to most other mammalian species.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012091">Impact of phylogeny on the inference of functional sectors from protein sequence data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicola Dietler, Alia Abbara, Subham Choudhury, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that nonlinear selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002832">Diverse signatures of convergent evolution in cactus-associated yeasts</a></h4>

Many distantly related organisms have convergently evolved traits and lifestyles that enable them to live in similar ecological environments. However, the extent of phenotypic convergence evolving through the same or distinct genetic trajectories remains an open question. Here, we leverage a comprehensive dataset of genomic and phenotypic data from 1,049 yeast species in the subphylum Saccharomycotina (Kingdom Fungi, Phylum Ascomycota) to explore signatures of convergent evolution in cactophilic yeasts, ecological specialists associated with cacti. We inferred that the ecological association of yeasts with cacti arose independently approximately 17 times. Using a machine learning–based approach, we further found that cactophily can be predicted with 76% accuracy from both functional genomic and phenotypic data. The most informative feature for predicting cactophily was thermotolerance, which we found to be likely associated with altered evolutionary rates of genes impacting the cell envelope in several cactophilic lineages. We also identified horizontal gene transfer and duplication events of plant cell wall–degrading enzymes in distantly related cactophilic clades, suggesting that putatively adaptive traits evolved independently through disparate molecular mechanisms. Notably, we found that multiple cactophilic species and their close relatives have been reported as emerging human opportunistic pathogens, suggesting that the cactophilic lifestyle—and perhaps more generally lifestyles favoring thermotolerance—might preadapt yeasts to cause human disease. This work underscores the potential of a multifaceted approach involving high-throughput genomic and phenotypic data to shed light onto ecological adaptation and highlights how convergent evolution to wild environments could facilitate the transition to human pathogenicity.
