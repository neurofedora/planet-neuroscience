<p>We provide anatomical and physiological evidence of a retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway in salamanders. This pathway provides a substrate for the transformation of visual information into a motor command and is well positioned to control orienting behaviors when approaching a prey for instance.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transformation of visual input into motor output is essential to approach a target or avoid a predator. In salamanders, visually guided orientation behaviors have been extensively studied during prey capture. However, the neural circuitry involved is not resolved. Using salamander brain preparations, calcium imaging and tracing experiments, we describe a neural substrate through which retinal input is transformed into spinal motor output. We found that retina stimulation evoked responses in reticulospinal neurons of the middle reticular nucleus, known to control steering movements in salamanders. Microinjection of glutamatergic antagonists in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) decreased the reticulospinal responses. Using tracing, we found that retina projected to the dorsal layers of the contralateral tectum, where the dendrites of neurons projecting to the middle reticular nucleus were located. In slices, stimulation of the tectal dorsal layers evoked glutamatergic responses in deep tectal neurons retrogradely labeled from the middle reticular nucleus. We then examined how tectum activation translated into spinal motor output. Tectum stimulation evoked motoneuronal responses, which were decreased by microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists in the contralateral middle reticular nucleus. Reticulospinal fibers anterogradely labeled from tracer injection in the middle reticular nucleus were preferentially distributed in proximity with the dendrites of ipsilateral motoneurons. Our work establishes a neural substrate linking visual and motor centers in salamanders. This retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal circuitry is well positioned to control orienting behaviors. Our study bridges the gap between the behavioral studies and the neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of visual input into motor output in salamanders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Strain design optimization using reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maryam Sabzevari, Sandor Szedmak, Merja Penttilä, Paula Jouhten, Juho Rousu</p>

Engineered microbial cells present a sustainable alternative to fossil-based synthesis of chemicals and fuels. Cellular synthesis routes are readily assembled and introduced into microbial strains using state-of-the-art synthetic biology tools. However, the optimization of the strains required to reach industrially feasible production levels is far less efficient. It typically relies on trial-and-error leading into high uncertainty in total duration and cost. New techniques that can cope with the complexity and limited mechanistic knowledge of the cellular regulation are called for guiding the strain optimization.
In this paper, we put forward a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that learns from experiments to tune the metabolic enzyme levels so that the production is improved. Our method is model-free and does not assume prior knowledge of the microbe’s metabolic network or its regulation. The multi-agent approach is well-suited to make use of parallel experiments such as multi-well plates commonly used for screening microbial strains.
We demonstrate the method’s capabilities using the genome-scale kinetic model of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, k-ecoli457, as a surrogate for an <i>in vivo</i> cell behaviour in cultivation experiments. We investigate the method’s performance relevant for practical applicability in strain engineering i.e. the speed of convergence towards the optimum response, noise tolerance, and the statistical stability of the solutions found. We further evaluate the proposed MARL approach in improving L-tryptophan production by yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, using publicly available experimental data on the performance of a combinatorial strain library.
Overall, our results show that multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising approach for guiding the strain optimization beyond mechanistic knowledge, with the goal of faster and more reliably obtaining industrially attractive production levels.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From affinity selection to kinetic selection in Germinal Centre modelling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Danial Lashgari, Elena Merino Tejero, Michael Meyer-Hermann, Mathieu A. F. Claireaux, Marit J. van Gils, Huub C. J. Hoefsloot, Antoine H. C. van Kampen</p>

Affinity maturation is an evolutionary process by which the affinity of antibodies (Abs) against specific antigens (Ags) increases through rounds of B-cell proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and positive selection in germinal centres (GC). The positive selection of B cells depends on affinity, but the underlying mechanisms of affinity discrimination and affinity-based selection are not well understood. It has been suggested that selection in GC depends on both rapid binding of B-cell receptors (BcRs) to Ags which is kinetically favourable and tight binding of BcRs to Ags, which is thermodynamically favourable; however, it has not been shown whether a selection bias for kinetic properties is present in the GC. To investigate the GC selection bias towards rapid and tight binding, we developed an agent-based model of GC and compared the evolution of founder B cells with initially identical low affinities but with different association/dissociation rates for Ag presented by follicular dendritic cells in three Ag collection mechanisms. We compared an Ag collection mechanism based on association/dissociation rates of B-cell interaction with presented Ag, which includes a probabilistic rupture of bonds between the B-cell and Ag (Scenario-1) with a reference scenario based on an affinity-based Ag collection mechanism (Scenario-0). Simulations showed that the mechanism of Ag collection affects the GC dynamics and the GC outputs concerning fast/slow (un)binding of B cells to FDC-presented Ags. In particular, clones with lower dissociation rates outcompete clones with higher association rates in Scenario-1, while remaining B cells from clones with higher association rates reach higher affinities. Accordingly, plasma cell and memory B cell populations were biased towards B-cell clones with lower dissociation rates. Without such probabilistic ruptures during the Ag extraction process (Scenario-2), the selective advantage for clones with very low dissociation rates diminished, and the affinity maturation level of all clones decreased to the reference level.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CellDynaMo–stochastic reaction-diffusion-dynamics model: Application to search-and-capture process of mitotic spindle assembly</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Evgenii Kliuchnikov, Artem Zhmurov, Kenneth A. Marx, Alex Mogilner, Valeri Barsegov</p>

We introduce a Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion-Dynamics Model (SRDDM) for simulations of cellular mechanochemical processes with high spatial and temporal resolution. The SRDDM model is mapped into the CellDynaMo package, which couples the spatially inhomogeneous reaction-diffusion master equation to account for biochemical reactions and molecular transport within the Langevin Dynamics (LD) framework to describe dynamic mechanical processes. This computational infrastructure allows the simulation of hours of molecular machine dynamics in reasonable wall-clock time. We apply the model to test performance of the Search-and-Capture model of mitotic spindle assembly by simulating, in three spatial dimensions, dynamic instability of elastic microtubules anchored in two centrosomes, movement and deformations of geometrically realistic centromeres with flexible kinetochores and chromosome arms. Furthermore, the SRDDM model describes the mechanics and kinetics of Ndc80 linkers mediating transient attachments of microtubules to the chromosomal kinetochores. The rates of these attachments and detachments depend upon phosphorylation states of the Ndc80 linkers, which are regulated in the model by explicitly accounting for the reactions of Aurora A and B kinase enzymes, which undergo restricted diffusion. We find that there is an optimal rate of microtubule-kinetochore detachments which maximizes the accuracy of the chromosome connections, that adding chromosome arms to kinetochores improve the accuracy by slowing down chromosome movements, that Aurora A and kinetochore deformations have a small positive effect on the attachment accuracy, and that thermal fluctuations of the microtubules increase the rates of kinetochore capture and also improve the accuracy of spindle assembly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Induced fit with replica exchange improves protein complex structure prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ameya Harmalkar, Sai Pooja Mahajan, Jeffrey J. Gray</p>

Despite the progress in prediction of protein complexes over the last decade, recent blind protein complex structure prediction challenges revealed limited success rates (less than 20% models with DockQ score > 0.4) on targets that exhibit significant conformational change upon binding. To overcome limitations in capturing backbone motions, we developed a new, aggressive sampling method that incorporates temperature replica exchange Monte Carlo (T-REMC) and conformational sampling techniques within docking protocols in Rosetta. Our method, ReplicaDock 2.0, mimics induced-fit mechanism of protein binding to sample backbone motions across putative interface residues on-the-fly, thereby recapitulating binding-partner induced conformational changes. Furthermore, ReplicaDock 2.0 clocks in at 150-500 CPU hours per target (protein-size dependent); a runtime that is significantly faster than Molecular Dynamics based approaches. For a benchmark set of 88 proteins with moderate to high flexibility (unbound-to-bound iRMSD over 1.2 Å), ReplicaDock 2.0 successfully docks 61% of moderately flexible complexes and 35% of highly flexible complexes. Additionally, we demonstrate that by biasing backbone sampling particularly towards residues comprising flexible loops or hinge domains, highly flexible targets can be predicted to under 2 Å accuracy. This indicates that additional gains are possible when mobile protein segments are known.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Addressing delayed case reporting in infectious disease forecast modeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lauren J. Beesley, Dave Osthus, Sara Y. Del Valle</p>

Infectious disease forecasting is of great interest to the public health community and policymakers, since forecasts can provide insight into disease dynamics in the near future and inform interventions. Due to delays in case reporting, however, forecasting models may often <i>underestimate</i> the current and future disease burden.
In this paper, we propose a general framework for addressing reporting delay in disease forecasting efforts with the goal of improving forecasts. We propose strategies for leveraging either historical data on case reporting or external internet-based data to estimate the amount of reporting error. We then describe several approaches for adapting general forecasting pipelines to account for under- or over-reporting of cases. We apply these methods to address reporting delay in data on dengue fever cases in Puerto Rico from 1990 to 2009 and to reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States between 2010 and 2019. Through a simulation study, we compare method performance and evaluate robustness to assumption violations. Our results show that forecasting accuracy and prediction coverage almost always increase when correction methods are implemented to address reporting delay. Some of these methods required knowledge about the reporting error or high quality external data, which may not always be available. Provided alternatives include excluding recently-reported data and performing sensitivity analysis. This work provides intuition and guidance for handling delay in disease case reporting and may serve as a useful resource to inform practical infectious disease forecasting efforts.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique to decipher tissue composition at the single-cell level and to inform on disease mechanisms, tumor heterogeneity, and the state of the immune microenvironment. Although multiple methods for the computational analysis of scRNA-seq data exist, their application in a clinical setting demands standardized and reproducible workflows, targeted to extract, condense, and display the clinically relevant information. To this end, we designed scAmpi (Single Cell Analysis mRNA pipeline), a workflow that facilitates scRNA-seq analysis from raw read processing to informing on sample composition, clinically relevant gene and pathway alterations, and <i>in silico</i> identification of personalized candidate drug treatments. We demonstrate the value of this workflow for clinical decision making in a molecular tumor board as part of a clinical study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A musculoskeletal finite element model of rat knee joint for evaluating cartilage biomechanics during gait</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gustavo A. Orozco, Kalle Karjalainen, Eng Kuan Moo, Lauri Stenroth, Petri Tanska, Jaqueline Lourdes Rios, Teemu V. Tuomainen, Mikko J. Nissi, Hanna Isaksson, Walter Herzog, Rami K. Korhonen</p>

Abnormal loading of the knee due to injuries or obesity is thought to contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Small animal models have been used for studying OA progression mechanisms. However, numerical models to study cartilage responses under dynamic loading in preclinical animal models have not been developed. Here we present a musculoskeletal finite element model of a rat knee joint to evaluate cartilage biomechanical responses during a gait cycle. The rat knee joint geometries were obtained from a 3-D MRI dataset and the boundary conditions regarding loading in the joint were extracted from a musculoskeletal model of the rat hindlimb. The fibril-reinforced poroelastic (FRPE) properties of the rat cartilage were derived from data of mechanical indentation tests. Our numerical results showed the relevance of simulating anatomical and locomotion characteristics in the rat knee joint for estimating tissue responses such as contact pressures, stresses, strains, and fluid pressures. We found that the contact pressure and maximum principal strain were virtually constant in the medial compartment whereas they showed the highest values at the beginning of the gait cycle in the lateral compartment. Furthermore, we found that the maximum principal stress increased during the stance phase of gait, with the greatest values at midstance. We anticipate that our approach serves as a first step towards investigating the effects of gait abnormalities on the adaptation and degeneration of rat knee joint tissues and could be used to evaluate biomechanically-driven mechanisms of the progression of OA as a consequence of joint injury or obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantifying the impact of ecological memory on the dynamics of interacting communities</a></h4>

Ecological memory refers to the influence of past events on the response of an ecosystem to exogenous or endogenous changes. Memory has been widely recognized as a key contributor to the dynamics of ecosystems and other complex systems, yet quantitative community models often ignore memory and its implications.
Recent modeling studies have shown how interactions between community members can lead to the emergence of resilience and multistability under environmental perturbations. We demonstrate how memory can be introduced in such models using the framework of fractional calculus. We study how the outcomes of a well-characterized interaction model are affected by gradual increases in ecological memory under varying initial conditions, perturbations, and stochasticity.
Our results highlight the implications of memory on several key aspects of community dynamics. In general, memory introduces inertia into the dynamics. This favors species coexistence under perturbation, enhances system resistance to state shifts, mitigates hysteresis, and can affect system resilience both ways depending on the time scale considered. Memory also promotes long transient dynamics, such as long-standing oscillations and delayed regime shifts, and contributes to the emergence and persistence of alternative stable states. Our study highlights the fundamental role of memory on ecological communities, and provides quantitative tools to introduce it in ecological models and analyse its impact under varying conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Alix is required for activity-dependent bulk endocytosis at brain synapses</a></h4>

Caudal, Na Zhao, Yvonne Schwarz, Marta Rolland, José Martinez-Hernandez, Magalie Martineau, Christine Chatellard, Eric Denarier, Vincent Mercier, Florent Lemaître, Béatrice Blot, Eve Moutaux, Maxime Cazorla, David Perrais, Fabien Lanté, Dieter Bruns, Sandrine Fraboulet, Fiona J. Hemming, Frank Kirchhoff, Rémy Sadoul</p>

In chemical synapses undergoing high frequency stimulation, vesicle components can be retrieved from the plasma membrane via a clathrin-independent process called activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). Alix (ALG-2-interacting protein X/PDCD6IP) is an adaptor protein binding to ESCRT and endophilin-A proteins which is required for clathrin-independent endocytosis in fibroblasts. Alix is expressed in neurons and concentrates at synapses during epileptic seizures. Here, we used cultured neurons to show that Alix is recruited to presynapses where it interacts with and concentrates endophilin-A during conditions triggering ADBE. Using Alix knockout (ko) neurons, we showed that this recruitment, which requires interaction with the calcium-binding protein ALG-2, is necessary for ADBE. We also found that presynaptic compartments of Alix ko hippocampi display subtle morphological defects compatible with flawed synaptic activity and plasticity detected electrophysiologically. Furthermore, mice lacking Alix in the forebrain undergo less seizures during kainate-induced status epilepticus and reduced propagation of the epileptiform activity. These results thus show that impairment of ADBE due to the lack of neuronal Alix leads to abnormal synaptic recovery during physiological or pathological repeated stimulations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pleiotropic constraints promote the evolution of cooperation in cellular groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael A. Bentley, Christian A. Yates, Jotun Hein, Gail M. Preston, Kevin R. Foster</p>

The evolution of cooperation in cellular groups is threatened by lineages of cheaters that proliferate at the expense of the group. These cell lineages occur within microbial communities, and multicellular organisms in the form of tumours and cancer. In contrast to an earlier study, here we show how the evolution of pleiotropic genetic architectures—which link the expression of cooperative and private traits—can protect against cheater lineages and allow cooperation to evolve. We develop an age-structured model of cellular groups and show that cooperation breaks down more slowly within groups that tie expression to a private trait than in groups that do not. We then show that this results in group selection for pleiotropy, which strongly promotes cooperation by limiting the emergence of cheater lineages. These results predict that pleiotropy will rapidly evolve, so long as groups persist long enough for cheater lineages to threaten cooperation. Our results hold when pleiotropic links can be undermined by mutations, when pleiotropy is itself costly, and in mixed-genotype groups such as those that occur in microbes. Finally, we consider features of multicellular organisms—a germ line and delayed reproductive maturity—and show that pleiotropy is again predicted to be important for maintaining cooperation. The study of cancer in multicellular organisms provides the best evidence for pleiotropic constraints, where abberant cell proliferation is linked to apoptosis, senescence, and terminal differentiation. Alongside development from a single cell, we propose that the evolution of pleiotropic constraints has been critical for cooperation in many cellular groups.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Lipids, Apolipoproteins, Statins and ICH: A Mendelian Randomization Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the causal role of lipid or apolipoprotein traits in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and determine the effect of lipid-lowering interventions on the disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations of HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, ApoB and ApoA1 levels with risks for ICH and those of LDL-C- (<i>HMGCR, PCSK9 and NPC1L1</i>) and TG-lowering targets (<i>LPL and APOC3</i>) with ICH.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Increased levels of ApoB was associated with a decreased risk of overall ICH (OR, 0.623; 95% CI, 0.413-0.940; P =0.024) and lobar ICH (OR, 0.579; 95% CI, 0.342-0.979; P =0.042). The inverse relationship remained stable in multivariable MR. In addition, elevated TGs showed a causal effect on lobar ICH in multivariable MR (OR, 1.600; 95% CI, 1.009-2.537; P= 0.046). The LDL-C-reducing genetic variation alleles at or near the <i>HMGCR</i> gene (mimicking the effect of statins) were predicted to increase the overall and deep ICH risk. Additionally, genetic variation at or near the <i>APOC3</i> gene suggested that genetically reducing the activity of <i>APOC3</i> (mimicking antisense anti-apoC3 agents) was predicted to decrease lobar ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted elevated ApoB may have a protective effect on overall ICH and lobar ICH, while elevated TG was associated with higher risk of lobar ICH conditional on LDL-C and ApoB. MR analysis supports the conclusion that statins may increase the risk of overall and deep ICH independent of their lipid-lowering effect. More specific lipid lowering targets may end up being the future.</p>

                Selective loss of inhibitory interneurons (INs) that promotes a shift toward an excitatory predominance may have a critical impact on the generation of epileptic activity. While research on mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has mostly focused on hippocampal changes, including IN loss, the subiculum as the major output region of the hippocampal formation has received comparatively little attention. Although it has been shown to occupy a key position in the epileptic network, data on cellular changes in the subiculum are controversial. Using the intrahippocampal kainate (KA) mouse model for MTLE, which recapitulates main features of human MTLE such as hippocampal sclerosis and granule cell dispersion following status epilepticus (SE), we identified cell loss in the subiculum and quantified changes in specific IN subpopulations along its dorsoventral axis. We performed intrahippocampal recordings, FluoroJade C-staining for degenerating neurons shortly after SE and immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclei (NeuN), parvalbumin (PV), neuropeptide Y (NPY), calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB), and in situ hybridization for glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad) 67 mRNA at 21 days after KA. We observed remarkable cell loss in the ipsilateral subiculum shortly after SE which was reflected in lowered density of NeuN+ cells in the chronic stage when epileptic activity could be measured in the subiculum concomitant with the hippocampus. We show a position-dependent reduction of Gad67-expressing INs by ~50% which particularly affected the PV- and to a lesser extent CR-expressing INs, whereas CB-expressing cells were unchanged. Interestingly, the density of NPY-positive neurons was increased, but double-labeling for Gad67 mRNA expression revealed that rather a de novo expression of NPY in non-GABAergic cells instead of IN changes underlay this increase. Our data reveal a position- and cell type-specific vulnerability of subicular INs in MTLE which might contribute to hyperexcitability of the subiculum, as reflected in the occurrence of epileptic activity.

                Persistent cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders are prevalent sequelae of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 in middle-aged adults. To model age-related neurological vulnerability to COVID-19, we induced respiratory SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infections by nasal inoculation in young (2 months) and middle-aged (12 months) mice. We hypothesized that aging and SARS-CoV-2 synergistically damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to worsen disease. Indeed, the combined action of aging and SARS-CoV-2 infection caused more fibrinogen leakage, T cell infiltration, and neuroinflammation in middle-aged SARS-CoV-2-infected mice than in similarly inoculated young adults. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 exacerbated age-related increases in Caveolin-1 BBB transcellular permeability and loss of Wnt/{beta}-catenin ligands, with no apparent changes in tight junction proteins. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced age-dependent neuropsychiatric abnormalities including bradykinesia and repetitive behavior. These observations indicate that cerebrovascular aging, including loss of Wnt suppression of Caveolin-1, heightens vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation and neuropsychiatric sequalae. Our work suggests that modulation of Wnt signaling or its downstream effectors at the BBB could be potential interventional strategies for Long COVID.

                Synaptic Zn2+ has emerged as a key neuromodulator in the brain. However, the lack of research tools for directly tracking synaptic Zn2+ in the brain in live animals hinders our rigorous understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of synaptic Zn2+. In this study, we developed a genetically encoded far-red fluorescent indicator for monitoring synaptic Zn2+ dynamics in the nervous system. Our engineered far-red fluorescent indicator for synaptic Zn2+ (FRISZ) displayed a substantial Zn2+-specific turn-on response and low micromolar affinity. We genetically anchored FRISZ to the mammalian extracellular membrane via a transmembrane -helix. We further successfully used membrane-tethered FRISZ (FRISZ-TM) to image synaptic Zn2+ dynamics in response to sound in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in awake mice. This study thus establishes a new technology for studying the roles of synaptic Zn2+ in the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ensemble-specific deficit in neuronal intrinsic excitability in aged mice</a></h4>

              
                With the prevalence of age-related cognitive deficits on the rise, it is essential to identify cellular and circuit alterations that contribute to age-related memory impairment. Increased intrinsic neuronal excitability after learning is important for memory consolidation, and changes to this process could underlie memory impairment in old age. Some studies find age-related deficits in hippocampal neuronal excitability that correlate with memory impairment but others do not, possibly due to selective changes only in activated neural ensembles. Thus, we tagged CA1 neurons activated during learning and recorded their intrinsic excitability 5 hours or 7 days post-training. Adult mice exhibited increased neuronal excitability 5 hours after learning, specifically in ensemble (learning-activated) CA1 neurons. As expected, ensemble excitability returned to baseline 7 days post-training. In aged mice, there was no ensemble-specific excitability increase after learning, which was associated with impaired hippocampal memory performance. These results suggest that CA1 may be susceptible to age-related impairments in post-learning ensemble excitability and underscore the need to selectively measure ensemble-specific changes in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Creatine transporter (Slc6a8) knockout mice show an inattentive-like phenotype in the 5-choice serial reaction time test</a></h4>

              
                Disorders of creatine (Cr) synthesis and transport cause moderate to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and a lack of speech development. Mutations of the X-linked Cr transporter (CrT; SLC6A8) gene are the most frequent cause of Cr deficiency and one of the leading causes of X-linked intellectual disability. There are no treatments for CrT deficiency (CTD) and there are many unanswered questions related to this disorder. Rodent models of CTD have deficits in spatial learning and memory, object recognition memory, fear conditioning, and working memory, making them high-fidelity models of CTD. While these cognitive deficits provide important information related to CTD, they lack some translational relevance and do not address important aspects of executive function like attention and impulsivity. To address this gap in knowledge, we tested brain specific Slc6a8 knockout (bKO) mice in the 5-choice serial reaction time test (5CSRTT), a correlate of the continuous performance task in humans. Following 5CSRTT training, mice were then tested for 3 sessions using trials with a variable stimulus duration followed by 3 sessions using a fixed stimulus duration and variable intertrial interval. During both the testing phases the bKO mice had reduced accuracy along with increased omissions and correct latencies compared with controls. There were no increases in premature responses during the vITI, suggesting that these mice do not have an impulsive phenotype. The results of this study expand the known phenotype of Slc6a8 deficient mice and add a translationally relevant behavioral output to test potential therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peripheral Auditory Nerve Impairment in a Mouse Model of Syndromic Autism</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of the peripheral auditory nerve (AN) contributes to dynamic changes throughout the central auditory system, resulting in abnormal auditory processing, including hypersensitivity. Altered sound sensitivity is frequently observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting that AN deficits and changes in auditory information processing may contribute to ASD-associated symptoms, including social communication deficits and hyperacusis. The MEF2C transcription factor is associated with risk for several neurodevelopmental disorders, and mutations or deletions of MEF2C produce a haploinsufficiency syndrome characterized by ASD, and language and cognitive deficits. A mouse model of this syndromic ASD (i.e., Mef2c+/- or Mef2c-Het) recapitulates many of the MEF2C Haploinsufficiency syndrome-linked behaviors including communication deficits. We show here that Mef2c-Het mice exhibit functional impairment of the peripheral AN and a modest reduction in hearing sensitivity. We find that MEF2C is expressed during development in multiple AN and cochlear cell types, and in Mef2c-Het mice, we observe multiple cellular and molecular alterations associated with the AN, including abnormal myelination, neuronal degeneration, neuronal mitochondria dysfunction, and increased macrophage activation and cochlear inflammation. These results reveal the importance of MEF2C function in inner ear development and function and the engagement of immune cells and other non-neuronal cells, which suggests that microglia/macrophages and other non-neuronal cells might contribute, directly or indirectly, to AN dysfunction and ASD-related phenotypes. Finally, our study establishes a comprehensive approach for characterizing AN function at the physiological, cellular, and molecular levels in mice, which can be applied to animal models with a wide range of human auditory processing impairments.

                Memory-updating is critical in dynamic environments because updating memories with new information promotes versatility. However, little is known about how memories are updated with new information. To study how neuronal ensembles might support memory-updating, we used a hippocampus-dependent spatial reversal task to measure hippocampal ensemble dynamics when mice switched navigational goals. Using Miniscope calcium imaging, we identified neuronal ensembles (co-active neurons) in dorsal CA1 that were spatially tuned and stable across training sessions. When reward locations were moved during a reversal session, a subset of these ensembles decreased their activation strength, correlating with memory-updating. These 'remodeling' ensembles were a result of weakly-connected neurons becoming less co-active with their peers. Middle-aged mice were impaired in reversal learning, and the prevalence of their remodeling ensembles correlated with their memory-updating performance. Therefore, we have identified a mechanism where the hippocampus breaks down ensembles to support memory-updating.

                Accurate anatomical characterizations are necessary to investigate neural circuitry on a fine scale, but for the rodent claustrum complex (CC) this has yet to be fully accomplished. The CC is generally considered to comprise two major subdivisions, the claustrum (CL) and the dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEn), but regional boundaries to these areas are highly debated. To address this, we conducted a multifaceted analysis of fiber- and cyto-architecture, genetic marker expression, and connectivity using mice of both sexes, to create a comprehensive guide for identifying and delineating borders to the CC. We identified four distinct subregions within the CC, subdividing both the CL and the DEn into two. Additionally, we conducted brain-wide tracing of inputs to the entire CC using a transgenic mouse line. Immunohistochemical staining against myelin basic protein (MBP), parvalbumin (PV), and calbindin (CB) revealed intricate fiber-architectural patterns enabling precise delineations of the CC and its subregions. Myelinated fibers were abundant in dorsal parts of the CL but absent in ventral parts, while parvalbumin labelled fibers occupied the entire CL. Calbindin staining revealed a central gap within the CL, which was also visible at levels anterior to the striatum. Furthermore, cells in the CL projecting to the retrosplenial-cortex were located within the myelin sparse area. By combining our own experimental data with digitally available datasets of gene expression and input connectivity, we could demonstrate that the proposed delineation scheme allows anchoring of datasets from different origins to a common reference framework.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precise and stable edge orientation signaling by human first-order tactile neurons</a></h4>

              
                Fast-adapting type 1 (FA-1) and slow-adapting type 1 (SA-1) first-order neurons in the human tactile system have distal axons that branch in the skin and form many transduction sites, yielding receptive fields with many highly sensitive zones or 'subfields'. We previously demonstrated that this arrangement allows FA-1 and SA-1 neurons to signal the geometric features of touched objects, specifically the orientation of raised edges scanned with the fingertips. Here we show that such signaling operates for fine edge orientation differences (5-20{degrees}) and is stable across a broad range of scanning speeds (15-180 mm/s); that is, under conditions relevant for real-world hand use. We found that both FA-1 and SA-1 neurons weakly signal fine edge orientation differences via the intensity of their spiking responses and only when considering a single scanning speed. Both neuron types showed much stronger edge orientation signaling in the sequential structure of the evoked spike trains and FA-1 neurons performed better than SA-1 neurons. Represented in the spatial domain, the sequential structure was strikingly invariant across scanning speeds, especially those naturally used in tactile spatial discrimination tasks. This speed invariance suggests that neurons' responses are structured via sequential stimulation of their subfields. Indeed, the spatial precision of elicited action potentials rationally matched spatial acuity of subfield arrangements, which typically corresponds to the dimension of individual fingertip ridges. The present results further the idea that the terminal branching of first-order tactile neurons constitutes a peripheral neural mechanism supporting the identification of tactile geometric features.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateral Axonal Modulation is Required for Stimulus-Specific Olfactory Conditioning in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Effective and stimulus-specific learning is essential for animals survival. Two major mechanisms are known to aid stimulus-specificity of associative learning. One is accurate stimulus-specific representations in neurons. The second is limited effective temporal window for the reinforcing signals to induce neuromodulation only after sensory stimuli. However, these mechanisms are often imperfect in preventing unspecific associations; different sensory stimuli can be represented by overlapping populations of neurons, and more importantly the reinforcing signals alone can induce neuromodulation even without coincident sensory-evoked neuronal activity. Here, we report a crucial neuromodulatory mechanism that counteracts both limitations and is thereby essential for stimulus specificity of learning. In Drosophila, olfactory signals are sparsely represented by cholinergic Kenyon cells (KCs), which receive dopaminergic reinforcing input. We find that KCs have numerous axo-axonic connections mediated by the muscarinic type-B receptor (mAChR-B). By using functional imaging and optogenetic approaches, we show that these axo-axonic connections suppress both odor-evoked calcium responses and dopamine-evoked cAMP signals in neighboring KCs. Strikingly, behavior experiments demonstrate that mAChR-B knockdown in KCs impairs olfactory learning by inducing undesired changes to the valence of an odor that was not associated with the reinforcer. Thus, this local neuromodulation acts in concert with sparse sensory representations and global dopaminergic modulation to achieve effective and accurate memory formation.

                The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Valine 66 to Methionine human polymorphism results in impaired activity-dependent BDNF release and has been linked to psychiatric disorders including anxiety and alcohol dependence. We previously showed that knock-in mice carrying the mouse Methionine homolog (Met68BDNF) exhibit excessive and compulsive alcohol drinking behaviors as compared to the wild-type Val68BDNF mice. Here, we set out to determine the potential mechanism for the heightened and compulsive alcohol drinking phenotype exhibited by the Met68BDNFmice. We found that male, but not female Met68BDNF mice show social anxiety-like behaviors. We further report that male, but not female, Met68BDNF mice are resistant to the anxiolytic effects and sedative actions of alcohol as compared to Val68BDNF mice. Alcohol-dependent hypolocomotion is also reduced in Met68BDNF. In contrast, alcohol place preference is similar in Met68BDNF compared with Val68BDNF mice. Finally, we show that the anxiolytic action of alcohol is restored in Met68BDNF mice by overexpressing the wild-type Val68BDNF in the ventral hippocampus (vHC). Together, our results suggest that heighted social anxiety and a lack of alcohol-dependent anxiolysis may contribute to excessive alcohol intake by constraining normal BDNF signaling in the vHC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Unified Dynamic and Computational Mechanism for Persistent and Transient Neural Activity Patterns During Delayed-Response Tasks</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity during short-term memory can be either persistent or transient. However, there is an ongoing debate about which activity pattern presents a more accurate neural basis underlying short-term memory. Here, we addressed this problem by training artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with delayed-response tasks. We found biological features emerged from the trained RNNs. Reverse-engineering showed that persistent and transient neural activity patterns can be unified by a neural state moving on a low-dimensional heteroclinic manifold, driven by a velocity field which is computationally Bayes-optimal to minimize the memory error. Our results shed new light on the neural mechanism and computational principles of short-term memory by unifying two seemly contradictory experimental phenomena into a single framework and suggest a new way to interpret the experimental data using computationally important transient speed as a continuous measure to characterize the neural activities during the delay.

                Endocytosis at synapses is accelerated by the pre-accumulation of Dynamin 1xA at the endocytic zone by Syndapin 1. However, it is unclear how these proteins support the ultrafast kinetics of endocytosis. Here we report that these proteins phase separate at the presynaptic endocytic zone where ultrafast endocytosis takes place. Specifically, the proline-rich motif of Dynamin 1xA interacts with the Src-Homology 3 domain of Syndapin 1 and forms liquid-like condensates. Single-particle tracking of Dynamin 1xA molecules at synapses shows that their diffusion slows down substantially when they are in the condensates, indicating the presence of molecular crowding and intermolecular interaction. When Dynamin 1xA is mutated to disrupt its interaction with Syndapin 1 the condensates do not form. Thus, the liquid-like assembly of these endocytic proteins provides a catalytic platform for ultrafast endocytosis.

                Recent studies have established that cardiac and respiratory phases can modulate perception and related neural dynamics. While heart rate and respiratory sinus arrhythmia are possibly affecting interoception biomarkers, such as heartbeat-evoked potentials, the relative changes in heart rate and cardiorespiratory dynamics in interoceptive processes have not yet been investigated. In this study, we investigated the variation in heart and respiration rates, as well as higher functional dynamics including cardiorespiratory correlation and frontal hemodynamics, during cardiac awareness tasks. To further investigate the functional physiology linked to changes in vagal activity caused by specific respiratory rates, we studied cardiac awareness and controlled respiration rate. The results demonstrate that focusing on heartbeats decreases respiration and heart rates in comparison, which may be part of the physiological mechanisms related to 'listening' to the heart, the focus of attention, and self-awareness. Focusing on heartbeats was also observed to increase frontal connectivity, supporting the role of frontal structures in the neural monitoring of visceral inputs. However, cardiorespiratory correlation is affected by both interoceptive and controlled respiration. Based on these results, we concluded that variations in heart and respiratory rates are confounding factors in the assessment of interoceptive abilities and relative fluctuations in respiration and heart rates should be considered to be a mode of covariate measurement of interoceptive processes.

                Ena/VASP proteins are processive actin polymerases that are required throughout animal phylogeny for many morphogenetic processes, including axon growth and guidance. Here we use live imaging of morphology and actin organization in the TSM1 axon of the Drosophila wing to dissect the mechanism of Ena action. We find that altering Ena activity has a substantial impact on filopodial morphology in this growth cone, but exerts only modest effects on actin organization. This is in contrast to the main regulator of Ena, Abl tyrosine kinase, which has profound effects on actin and only mild effects on TSM1 growth cone morphology. These data suggest that the primary role of Ena in this axon may be to link actin to morphogenetic processes of the plasma membrane, rather than regulating actin organization itself. These data also suggest that a key role of Ena, acting downstream of Abl, may be to maintain a constant filopodial organization of the growth cone, even as Abl activity varies in response to guidance cues in the environment.

                It has been shown that different inhibitory cell types underlie brain rhythmic and cross-frequency coupling output, but exactly how inhibitory cell types manifest their contributions to these outputs is far from clear. Brain rhythms and their couplings are functionally important in cognition and behaviour, and thus it is essential that we determine and understand these contributions. To do this, one needs simultaneous access to multiple cell types and population brain output in functionally relevant states. This is extremely challenging to do with experiments alone, and here we use mathematical models of different types to gain insight into the contributions of the different inhibitory cell types. We focus on theta and gamma rhythms in the hippocampus and use a previously developed detailed model to develop precise hypotheses of how these rhythms are generated and coupled. We find critical contributions by four different cell types - pyramidal cells, parvalbumin expressing (PV+) basket cells (BCs), cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) BCs and bistratified cells. We develop a reduced population rate model (PRM) based on these hypotheses and do extensive explorations and visualizations of the PRM to obtain testable predictions. We find that CCK+BCs exhibit a much higher degree of control relative to PV+BCs for theta or gamma rhythm dominance and thus their coupling, and that coupling from PV+BCs to CCK+BCs more strongly affects theta frequencies relative to coupling from CCK+BCs to PV+BCs. As it is now possible to target these specific inhibitory cell types in the behaving animal, experimentally testing these hypotheses and predictions would be possible. Moreover, our work shows that a variety of mathematical model types creates new insights that would not be revealed with a single model type.

                Epitranscriptome modifications are crucial in translation regulation and essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. N6 methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant and well-conserved epitranscriptome modifications, which is known to play a pivotal role in diverse aspects of neuronal functions. However, the role of m6A modifications with respect to activity-mediated translation regulation and synaptic plasticity has not been studied. Here, we investigated the role of m6A modification in response to NMDAR stimulation. We have consistently observed that upon 5-minute NMDAR stimulation causes an increase in eEF2 phosphorylation. Correspondingly, NMDAR stimulation caused a significant increase in the m6A signal at 5 minutes time point, correlating with the global translation inhibition. The NMDAR induced increase in the m6A signal is accompanied by the redistribution of the m6A marked RNAs from translating to the non-translating pool of ribosomes. The increased m6A levels are well correlated with the reduced FTO levels observed on NMDAR stimulation. Additionally, we show that inhibition of FTO prevents NMDAR mediated changes in m6A levels. Overall, our results establish RNA-based molecular readout which corelates with the NMDAR-dependent translation regulation which helps in understanding changes in protein synthesis.

                Facilitating axon regeneration in the injured central nervous system remains a challenging task. RAF - MEK signaling plays an important role in axon elongation during nervous system development. Here we show that activation of B-RAF in mature corticospinal neurons elicited the expression of a discrete set of transcription factors previously implicated in the regeneration of zebrafish optic nerve axons. Genetic activation of B-RAF - MEK signaling promoted robust regeneration and sprouting of corticospinal tract axons after injury. Newly sprouting axon collaterals formed synaptic connections with spinal interneurons, correlating with the recovery of skilled motor function. Seeking a non-invasive way to stimulate axon regeneration, we found that suprathreshold high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation activates the B-RAF canonical effectors MEK1/2 and requires MEK1/2 activity to promote corticospinal axon regeneration and sprouting after injury. These data demonstrate a central role of neuron-intrinsic RAF - MEK signaling in enhancing the growth capacity of mature corticospinal neurons and propose HF-rTMS as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-regional delays fluctuate in the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological studies suggest that the excitability fluctuations that underlie oscillatory field potentials can regulate the flow of information between regions. However, most studies of these oscillatory processes have focused on local (circuit-level) changes; less is known about how millisecond-scale inter-regional couplings change with global (cortex-wide) oscillatory states. Therefore, we measured ongoing changes in global oscillations and inter-regional coupling by recording intracranially from the human cerebral cortex. In the presence of an ongoing auditory narrative stimulus, we observed that global increases in low-frequency power (4-14Hz) were associated with stronger and more delayed couplings between regions. Conversely, increases in broadband high-frequency (BHA) power (65+ Hz) were associated with weaker inter-regional couplings and more frequent zero-lag coupling between regions. Latency changes were predicted both by local oscillatory power (at each site) and by global oscillatory power (averaged across the lateral cerebral cortex). Fluctuations in coupling latency were weakly locked to the auditory stimulus: when we repeated the same narrative, a small number of temporal lobe sites exhibited reliable latency patterns across repetitions. The empirical findings were recapitulated in an amplitude-and-phase coupled oscillator model, in which the increases in latency arose from increases in the effective influence of nodes upon one another. Altogether, gradual and widespread increases in low-frequency oscillations were associated with delayed cortico-cortical couplings in the human brain. These changes in inter-regional latency indicate a shift in the timing of peak excitability between regions; we interpret them in relation to bottom-up and top-down information flow, regulated by nonspecific ascending projections to the cortex.

                Precisely controlled development of the somatosensory system is essential for detecting pain, itch, temperature, mechanical touch, and body position. To investigate the protein-level changes that occur during somatosensory development, we performed single-cell mass cytometry on dorsal root ganglia from C57/BL6 mice, with litter replicates collected daily from E11.5 to P4. Measuring nearly 3 million cells, we quantified 30 molecularly distinct somatosensory glial and 41 distinct neuronal states across all time points. Analysis of differentiation trajectories revealed rare cells that coexpress two or more Trk receptors and overexpress stem cell markers, suggesting that these neurotrophic factor receptors play a role in cell fate specification. Comparison to previous RNA-based studies identified substantial differences between many protein/mRNA pairs, demonstrating the importance of protein-level measurements to identify functional cell states. Overall, this study demonstrates that mass cytometry is a high-throughput, scalable platform to rapidly phenotype somatosensory tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combined small molecule treatment accelerates timing of maturation in human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                The maturation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons mimics the protracted timing of human brain development, extending over months and years to reach adult-like function. Prolonged in vitro maturation presents a major challenge to stem cell-based applications in modeling and treating neurological disease. We designed a high-content imaging assay based on morphological and functional readouts in hPSC-derived cortical neurons to reveal underlying pathways and to identify chemicals capable of accelerating neuronal maturation. Probing a library of 2688 bioactive drugs, we identified multiple compounds that drive neuronal maturation including inhibitors of LSD1 and DOT1L and activators of calcium-dependent transcription. A cocktail of 4 factors GSK-2879552, EPZ-5676, NMDA and Bay K 8644, which we collectively termed GENtoniK, triggered maturation across all assays tested including measures of synaptic density, electrophysiology and transcriptomics. Remarkably, GENtoniK was similarly effective in enhancing neuronal maturation in 3D cortical organoids and in spinal motoneurons, and improved aspects of cell maturation in non-neural lineages such as melanocytes and pancreatic beta cells. These results demonstrate that the maturation of multiple hPSC-derived cell types can be enhanced by simple pharmacological intervention and suggests that some of the mechanisms controlling the timing of human maturation are shared across lineages.

	<p>Cognitive skills predict academic performance, so schools that try to improve academic performance might also improve cognitive skills. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of achievements in mathematics on cognitive ability in primary school. Methods: Participants: 100 girls and 102 boys aged 9&amp;amp;ndash;10 years (the fourth grade) were selected from three schools. A diagnostic test of cognitive abilities (DTCA) was created by the authors of the article for the assessment of primary school students&amp;amp;rsquo; cognitive abilities. The diagnostic cognitive ability test was based on Reuven Feuerstein&amp;amp;rsquo;s theory of dynamic cognitive modality assessment, the problem-solving model, and followed the mathematics curriculum for grade 4. The tasks of the test were distributed according to the cognitive function: systematic exploration, spatial orientation, sequencing, image recognition, recognizing and understanding relationships, collecting and processing information, algorithm development, data management (classification), and construction of combinations. Achievements in mathematics: they were collected systematically using short- and medium-term mathematics tests, and the levels of achaievement were defined of grade 4 primary school students to assess individual learner performance, anticipate their learning strengths and weaknesses, and shape their subsequent learning process. Results: With regard to the relationships between cognitive functions and achievement level, Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis revealed the relationships between the following cognitive functions: systematic exploration and spatial orientation (Spearman q = 0.276, p = 0.022), systematic exploration and designing an algorithm development (Spearman q = 0.351, p = 0.003), spatial orientation and data management (Spearman q = 0.274, p = 0.023), sequencing and combination construction (Spearman q = 0.275, p = 0.022), and sequencing and recognizing and understanding relationships (Spearman q = 0.243, p = 0.044). Conclusions: (1) The internal validity of the diagnostic test of cognitive abilities was supported by significant correlations between cognitive functions and mathematics achievement. This suggests that this methodology of the diagnostic cognitive ability test can be used to assess the cognitive abilities of primary school students. (2) The diagnostic test of cognitive abilities showed that the majority of primary school students reached higher levels of achievement in a systematic inquiry (systematic, non-impulsive, planned behavior when collecting data or checking information). A difference was observed in the ability of students to navigate in space and follow directions for primary school students at a satisfactory or higher level. Primary school students&amp;amp;rsquo; performance in identifying the rule for the sequencing of elements, finding missing elements, and extending the sequences was at the basic and advanced levels. (3) The results of the study showed the reciprocal correlation between achievements in mathematics and cognitive function of primary school students. The two phases that caused difficulties for students were revealed: understanding the problem and carrying out the plan phase.</p>

	<p>Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a developmental disorder characterized by arithmetic difficulties. Recently, it has been suggested that the neural networks supporting procedure-based calculation (e.g., in subtraction) and left-hemispheric verbal arithmetic fact retrieval (e.g., in multiplication) are partially distinct. Here we compared the neurofunctional correlates of subtraction and multiplication in a 19-year-old student (RM) with DD to 18 age-matched controls. Behaviorally, RM performed significantly worse than controls in multiplication, while subtraction was unaffected. Neurofunctional differences were most pronounced regarding multiplication: RM showed significantly stronger activation than controls not only in left angular gyrus but also in a fronto-parietal network (including left intraparietal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus) typically activated during procedure-based calculation. Region-of-interest analyses indicated group differences in multiplication only, which, however, did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Our results are consistent with dissociable and processing-specific, but not operation-specific neurofunctional networks. Procedure-based calculation is not only associated with subtraction but also with (untrained) multiplication facts. Only after rote learning, facts can be retrieved quasi automatically from memory. We suggest that this learning process and the associated shift in activation patterns has not fully occurred in RM, as reflected in her need to resort to procedure-based strategies to solve multiplication facts.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Radical pairs may explain reactive oxygen species-mediated effects of hypomagnetic field on neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rishabh Rishabh, Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, Dennis Salahub, Christoph Simon</p>

Exposures to a hypomagnetic field can affect biological processes. Recently, it has been observed that hypomagnetic field exposure can adversely affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition in mice. In the same study, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hypomagnetic field effects has been demonstrated. However, the mechanistic reasons behind this effect are not clear. This study proposes a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of ROS production and the attenuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a hypomagnetic field. The results of our calculations favor a singlet-born radical pair over a triplet-born radical pair. Our model predicts hypomagnetic field effects on the triplet/singlet yield of comparable strength as the effects observed in experimental studies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental results on superoxide concentration and other observed ROS effects. We also predict the effects of applied magnetic fields and oxygen isotopic substitution on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of water-bridged interactions in metal ion coupled protein allostery</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xingyue Guan, Cheng Tan, Wenfei Li, Wei Wang, D. Thirumalai</p>

Allosteric communication between distant parts of proteins controls many cellular functions, in which metal ions are widely utilized as effectors to trigger the allosteric cascade. Due to the involvement of strong coordination interactions, the energy landscape dictating the metal ion binding is intrinsically rugged. How metal ions achieve fast binding by overcoming the landscape ruggedness and thereby efficiently mediate protein allostery is elusive. By performing molecular dynamics simulations for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding mediated allostery of the calmodulin (CaM) domains, each containing two Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding helix-loop-helix motifs (EF-hands), we revealed the key role of water-bridged interactions in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and protein allostery. The bridging water molecules between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and binding residue reduces the ruggedness of ligand exchange landscape by acting as a lubricant, facilitating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupled protein allostery. Calcium-induced rotation of the helices in the EF-hands, with the hydrophobic core serving as the pivot, leads to exposure of hydrophobic sites for target binding. Intriguingly, despite being structurally similar, the response of the two symmetrically arranged EF-hands upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is asymmetric. Breakage of symmetry is needed for efficient allosteric communication between the EF-hands. The key roles that water molecules play in driving allosteric transitions are likely to be general in other metal ion mediated protein allostery.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">sumSTAAR: A flexible framework for gene-based association studies using GWAS summary statistics</a></h4>

Gene-based association analysis is an effective gene-mapping tool. Many gene-based methods have been proposed recently. However, their power depends on the underlying genetic architecture, which is rarely known in complex traits, and so it is likely that a combination of such methods could serve as a universal approach. Several frameworks combining different gene-based methods have been developed. However, they all imply a fixed set of methods, weights and functional annotations. Moreover, most of them use individual phenotypes and genotypes as input data. Here, we introduce sumSTAAR, a framework for gene-based association analysis using summary statistics obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It is an extended and modified version of STAAR framework proposed by Li and colleagues in 2020. The sumSTAAR framework offers a wider range of gene-based methods to combine. It allows the user to arbitrarily define a set of these methods, weighting functions and probabilities of genetic variants being causal. The methods used in the framework were adapted to analyse genes with large number of SNPs to decrease the running time. The framework includes the polygene pruning procedure to guard against the influence of the strong GWAS signals outside the gene. We also present new improved matrices of correlations between the genotypes of variants within genes. These matrices estimated on a sample of 265,000 individuals are a state-of-the-art replacement of widely used matrices based on the 1000 Genomes Project data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Learning the statistics and landscape of somatic mutation-induced insertions and deletions in antibodies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cosimo Lupo, Natanael Spisak, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Thierry Mora</p>

Affinity maturation is crucial for improving the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens. This process is mainly driven by point substitutions caused by somatic hypermutations of the immunoglobulin gene. It also includes deletions and insertions of genomic material known as indels. While the landscape of point substitutions has been extensively studied, a detailed statistical description of indels is still lacking. Here we present a probabilistic inference tool to learn the statistics of indels from repertoire sequencing data, which overcomes the pitfalls and biases of standard annotation methods. The model includes antibody-specific maturation ages to account for variable mutational loads in the repertoire. After validation on synthetic data, we applied our tool to a large dataset of human immunoglobulin heavy chains. The inferred model allows us to identify universal statistical features of indels in heavy chains. We report distinct insertion and deletion hotspots, and show that the distribution of lengths of indels follows a geometric distribution, which puts constraints on future mechanistic models of the hypermutation process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pulmonary drug delivery and retention: A computational study to identify plausible parameters based on a coupled airway-mucus flow model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aranyak Chakravarty, Mahesh V. Panchagnula, Alladi Mohan, Neelesh A. Patankar</p>

Pulmonary drug delivery systems rely on inhalation of drug-laden aerosols produced from aerosol generators such as inhalers, nebulizers etc. On deposition, the drug molecules diffuse in the mucus layer and are also subjected to mucociliary advection which transports the drugs away from the initial deposition site. The availability of the drug at a particular region of the lung is, thus, determined by a balance between these two phenomena. A mathematical analysis of drug deposition and retention in the lungs is developed through a coupled mathematical model of aerosol transport in air as well as drug molecule transport in the mucus layer. The mathematical model is solved computationally to identify suitable conditions for the transport of drug-laden aerosols to the deep lungs. This study identifies the conditions conducive for delivering drugs to the deep lungs which is crucial for achieving systemic drug delivery. The effect of different parameters on drug retention is also characterized for various regions of the lungs, which is important in determining the availability of the inhaled drugs at a target location. Our analysis confirms that drug delivery efficacy remains highest for aerosols in the size range of 1-5 <i>μ</i>m. Moreover, it is observed that amount of drugs deposited in the deep lung increases by a factor of 2 when the breathing time period is doubled, with respect to normal breathing, suggesting breath control as a means to increase the efficacy of drug delivery to the deep lung. A higher efficacy also reduces the drug load required to be inhaled to produce the same health effects and hence, can help in minimizing the side effects of a drug.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">fingeRNAt—A novel tool for high-throughput analysis of nucleic acid-ligand interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natalia A. Szulc, Zuzanna Mackiewicz, Janusz M. Bujnicki, Filip Stefaniak</p>

Computational methods play a pivotal role in drug discovery and are widely applied in virtual screening, structure optimization, and compound activity profiling. Over the last decades, almost all the attention in medicinal chemistry has been directed to protein-ligand binding, and computational tools have been created with this target in mind. With novel discoveries of functional RNAs and their possible applications, RNAs have gained considerable attention as potential drug targets. However, the availability of bioinformatics tools for nucleic acids is limited. Here, we introduce fingeRNAt—a software tool for detecting non-covalent interactions formed in complexes of nucleic acids with ligands. The program detects nine types of interactions: (i) hydrogen and (ii) halogen bonds, (iii) cation-anion, (iv) pi-cation, (v) pi-anion, (vi) pi-stacking, (vii) inorganic ion-mediated, (viii) water-mediated, and (ix) lipophilic interactions. However, the scope of detected interactions can be easily expanded using a simple plugin system. In addition, detected interactions can be visualized using the associated PyMOL plugin, which facilitates the analysis of medium-throughput molecular complexes. Interactions are also encoded and stored as a bioinformatics-friendly Structural Interaction Fingerprint (SIFt)—a binary string where the respective bit in the fingerprint is set to 1 if a particular interaction is present and to 0 otherwise. This output format, in turn, enables high-throughput analysis of interaction data using data analysis techniques. We present applications of fingeRNAt-generated interaction fingerprints for visual and computational analysis of RNA-ligand complexes, including analysis of interactions formed in experimentally determined RNA-small molecule ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank. We propose interaction fingerprint-based similarity as an alternative measure to RMSD to recapitulate complexes with similar interactions but different folding. We present an application of interaction fingerprints for the clustering of molecular complexes. This approach can be used to group ligands that form similar binding networks and thus have similar biological properties. The fingeRNAt software is freely available at https://github.com/n-szulc/fingeRNAt.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Priority-based transformations of stimulus representation in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quan Wan, Jorge A. Menendez, Bradley R. Postle</p>

How does the brain prioritize among the contents of working memory (WM) to appropriately guide behavior? Previous work, employing inverted encoding modeling (IEM) of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, has shown that unprioritized memory items (UMI) are actively represented in the brain, but in a “flipped”, or opposite, format compared to prioritized memory items (PMI). To acquire independent evidence for such a priority-based representational transformation, and to explore underlying mechanisms, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to perform a 2-back WM task. Visualization of LSTM hidden layer activity using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) confirmed that stimulus representations undergo a representational transformation–consistent with a flip—while transitioning from the functional status of UMI to PMI. Demixed (d)PCA of the same data identified two representational trajectories, one each within a UMI subspace and a PMI subspace, both undergoing a reversal of stimulus coding axes. dPCA of data from an EEG dataset also provided evidence for priority-based transformations of the representational code, albeit with some differences. This type of transformation could allow for retention of unprioritized information in WM while preventing it from interfering with concurrent behavior. The results from this initial exploration suggest that the algorithmic details of how this transformation is carried out by RNNs, versus by the human brain, may differ.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A new test suggests hundreds of amino acid polymorphisms in humans are subject to balancing selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vivak Soni, Michiel Vos, Adam Eyre-Walker</p>

The role that balancing selection plays in the maintenance of genetic diversity remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a new test, based on the McDonald–Kreitman test, in which the number of polymorphisms that are shared between populations is contrasted to those that are private at selected and neutral sites. We show that this simple test is robust to a variety of demographic changes, and that it can also give a direct estimate of the number of shared polymorphisms that are directly maintained by balancing selection. We apply our method to population genomic data from humans and provide some evidence that hundreds of nonsynonymous polymorphisms are subject to balancing selection.

<p>We investigated fiber distribution patterns of corticospinal neurons within the cortical area projecting to the lumbar cord gray matter of mice. The lumbar-cord-projecting area fundamentally innervates the gray matter in the same way as the cervical-cord-projecting area does.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although corticospinal neurons are known to be distributed in both the primary motor and somatosensory cortices (S1), details of the projection pattern of their fibers to the lumbar cord gray matter remain largely uncharacterized, especially in rodents. We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB. These findings suggest that the L4 Cx is parceled into subregions defined by the cytoarchitecture and subcortical projection.</p>

<p>By using a genetically modified mouse model and viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of a subpopulation of neurons in the anterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus, molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup>). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons form connections with several nuclei throughout the brain axis, with the strongest concerning hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation and forebrain areas associated with reward and stress processing. Furthermore, guided by the transcriptional signatures of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons, we combined retrograde labeling with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization and we identified that they receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) is a structure highly interconnected with several nuclei ranging from forebrain to hypothalamus and brainstem. Numerous rodent studies have examined afferent and efferent connections of the PVT and their contribution to behavior, revealing its important role in the integration of arousal cues. However, the majority of these studies used a region-oriented approach, without considering the neuronal subtype diversity of the nucleus. In the present study, we provide the anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of a subpopulation of PVT neurons molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck). Combining a genetically modified mouse model with viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of Gck-positive neurons of the anterior PVT (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup>). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons innervate several nuclei throughout the brain axis. The strongest connections are with forebrain areas associated with reward and stress and with hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the Gck-expressing neurons revealed that they are enriched in receptors for hypothalamic-derived neuropeptides, adhesion molecules, and obesity and diabetes susceptibility transcription factors. Using retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we identify that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations, including arginine-vasopressin-, melanin-concentrating hormone-, orexin-, and proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons. This detailed anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons provides a basis for functional studies of the integration of homeostatic and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, and for deciphering the potential role of these neurons in obesity and diabetes development.</p>

<p>Gaze stabilization reflexes such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the optokinetic reflex (OKR) share some neuronal circuitry and interact in oculomotor adaptation phenomena. The presence of androgen receptors (Ars) in the cerebellar–vestibular network that mediates the adaptive modification of the VOR makes the VOR an excellent model to study the impact of androgens on cerebellar-dependent learning. In young male rats, the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (FLUT) acutely impairs the capability of VOR to encode gain-increase and gain-decrease adaptation without influencing basal VOR and OKR. Such findings imply that the androgenic neuronal pathway activation participates in the VOR adaptation phenomenon probably via nonclassical mechanisms of regulation. We suggested that androgens, possibly testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by binding Ars may rapidly regulate cerebellar and extracerebellar plastic sites responsible for VOR adaptation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebellar-dependent learning is essential for the adaptation of motor and no motor behaviors to changing contexts, and neuroactive steroids—mainly referred to as estrogens—may regulate this process. However, the role of androgens in this process has not been established, although they may affect cerebellar physiology. Thus, this study aims to determine whether the activation of androgenic neural pathways may take part in controlling the vestibuloocular (VOR) and optokinetic reflexes (OKR), which depend on a defined cerebellar circuitry. To answer this question, we acutely blocked the activation of androgen receptors (Ars) using systemic administration of the Ars antagonist flutamide (FLUT; 20 mg/Kg) in peripubertal male rats. Then, we evaluated the FLUT effect on general oculomotor performance in the VOR and OKR as well as VOR adaptive gain increases and decreases. We used a paradigm causing fast VOR adaptation that combined in phase/out phase visuo-vestibular stimulations. We found that FLUT impaired the gain increase and decrease in VOR adaptation. However, FLUT altered neither acute nor overtime basal ocular-motor performance in the VOR or OKR. These findings indicate that the activation of androgenic neural pathways participates in phenomena leading to fast VOR adaptation, probably through the modulation of plasticity mechanisms that underlie adaptation of this reflex. Conversely, androgens may not be essential for neural information processing demands in basal ocular-motor reflexes. Moreover, our results suggest that androgens, possibly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, could rapidly regulate motor memory encoding in the VOR adaptation, acting at both cerebellar and extracerebellar plasticity sites.</p>

<p>Expression and significance of secretagogin (scgn) in the brain of catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Three scgn transcript variants were found in the brain of <i>C. batrachus</i>. Two of these transcript variants predicted to encode a putative 272 aa protein, comparable to that found in teleosts and fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Cells expressing scgn showed wide distribution in the brain and pituitary. None of the hypophysiotropic dopamine neurons but a great majority of the isotocin and vasotocin neurons coexpressed scgn. Distinct scgn neurons/fibers were observed in the entopeduncular nucleus (EN, arrow) in the ventral telencephalon. Intracranial insulin enhanced scgn expression in EN neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), is a novel hexa EF-hand, phylogenetically conserved calcium-binding protein. It serves as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and neuroendocrine regulation in mammals. However, its relevance in the brain of non-mammalian vertebrates has largely remained unexplored. To address this issue, we studied the cDNA encoding scgn, <i>scgn</i> mRNA expression, and distribution of scgn-equipped elements in the brain and pituitary of a teleost, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (<i>cb</i>). The <i>cbscgn</i> cDNA consists of three transcripts (T) variants: T1 (2185 bp), T2 (2151 bp) and T3 (2060 bp). While 816 bp ORF in T1 and T2 encodes highly conserved six EF-hand 272 aa protein fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, 726-bp ORF in T3 encodes 242 aa protein. The T1 showed &gt;90% and &gt;70% identity with scgn of catfishes, and other teleosts and mammals, respectively. The T1-mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and pituitary, while the expression of T3 was restricted to the telencephalon. Application of the anti-scgn antiserum revealed a ∼32 kDa scgn-immunoreactive (scgn-i) band (known molecular weight of scgn) in the forebrain tissue, and immunohistochemically labeled neurons in the olfactory epithelium and bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hindbrain. In the pituitary, scgn-i cells were seen in the pars distalis and intermedia. Insulin is reported to regulate <i>scgn</i> mRNA in the mammalian hippocampus, and feeding-related neuropeptides in the telencephalon of teleost. Intracranial injection of insulin significantly increased T1-mRNA expression and scgn-immunoreactivity in the telencephalon. We suggest that scgn may be an important player in the regulation of olfactory, neuroendocrine system, and energy balance functions in <i>C. batrachus</i>.</p>

<p>The expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) in the zebra finch brain showing unique differential expressions in subdivisions of the forebrain and the song nuclei. The white color represents mRNA signal.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission and cell signaling, which contribute to learning, memory, and the execution of motor skills. Birdsong is a complex learned motor skill in songbirds. Although the existence of 15 nAChR subunits has been predicted in the avian genome, their expression patterns and potential contributions to song learning and production have not been comprehensively investigated. Here, we cloned all the 15 nAChR subunits (ChrnA1–10, B2–4, D, and G) from the zebra finch brain and investigated the mRNA expression patterns in the neural pathways responsible for the learning and production of birdsong during a critical period of song learning. Although there were no detectable hybridization signals for ChrnA1, A6, A9, and A10, the other 11 nAChR subunits were uniquely expressed in one or more major subdivisions in the song nuclei of the songbird brain. Of these 11 subunits, ChrnA3–5, A7, and B2 were differentially regulated in the song nuclei compared with the surrounding anatomically related regions. ChrnA5 was upregulated during the critical period of song learning in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed ChrnA7 and B2 to be the major subunits expressed in neurons of the vocal motor nuclei HVC and robust nucleus of the arcopallium, indicating the potential existence of ChrnA7-homomeric and ChrnB2-heteromeric nAChRs in limited cell populations. These results suggest that relatively limited types of nAChR subunits provide functional contributions to song learning and production in songbirds.</p>

<p>Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad) is a regulator of dendritic spine density. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. <i>Acad</i> was substantially expressed in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus of intact brains. Cerebral ischemia dramatically upregulated <i>Acad</i> expression, mainly in the limbic and paralimbic regions. The upregulation of <i>Acad</i> depended on neuronal activation following cerebral ischemia. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms underlying neuronal plasticity after brain ischemia.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structural plasticity of dendritic spines serves as the adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system to various stimuli. Among these stimuli, cerebral ischemia induces dynamic alterations in neuronal network activity. Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad), a regulator of dendritic spine density, is strongly induced by activating stimuli to the neurons. However, the detailed distribution of Acad in normal and ischemic adult brains remains unclear. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We found that intact adult brains expressed <i>Acad</i> in the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, hippocampal CA3, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. <i>Acad</i> expression was dramatically upregulated in the piriform cortex, olfactory area, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, amygdala, and septohippocampal nucleus 4 h after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induced widespread neuronal activation, which was required for <i>Acad</i> upregulation. Our data suggested the involvement of Acad in the adaptive plasticity and remodeling of the neuronal network in the limbic and paralimbic systems.</p>

     alt="Brain-wide mapping of inputs to the mouse lateral posterior (LP/Pulvinar) thalamus–anterior cingulate cortex network"/>
<p>We perform projection-specific monosynaptic mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP and ACC network in mice and show that the LP-ACC network integrates information from regions which parallel that of the primate pulvinar-prefrontal network. LP→ACC and ACC→LP neurons share common sources of inputs from regions involved in orienting and sensorimotor control. Inputs to the ACC→LP projection may serve to provide spatial context or visuomotor instructions, while the bottom-up LP→ACC circuit integrates multisensory information and could serve as a route for SC feedback to frontal cortex. Our study serves as a primer for future circuit-level examination of LP-ACC interactions and inputs integrated by this circuit.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent homolog of the primate pulvinar, the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus, is extensively interconnected with multiple cortical areas. While these cortical interactions can span the entire LP, subdivisions of the LP are characterized by differential connections with specific cortical regions. In particular, the medial LP has reciprocal connections with frontoparietal cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC plays an integral role in top-down sensory processing and attentional regulation, likely exerting some of these functions via the LP. However, little is known about how ACC and LP interact, and about the information potentially integrated in this reciprocal network. Here, we address this gap by employing a projection-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to delineate brain-wide inputs to bottom-up LP→ACC and top-down ACC→LP neurons. We find that LP→ACC neurons receive inputs from widespread cortical regions, including primary and higher order sensory and motor cortical areas. LP→ACC neurons also receive extensive subcortical inputs, particularly from the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Sensory inputs to ACC→LP neurons largely arise from visual cortical areas. In addition, ACC→LP neurons integrate cross-hemispheric prefrontal cortex inputs as well as inputs from higher order medial cortex. Our brain-wide anatomical mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP-ACC pathways provides a roadmap for understanding how LP and ACC communicate different sources of information to mediate attentional control and visuomotor functions.</p>

     alt="Estrogen receptors observed at extranuclear neuronal sites and in glia in the nucleus accumbens core and shell of the female rat: Evidence for localization to catecholaminergic and GABAergic neurons"/>
<p>This study used electron microscopy to examine the distribution ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core and shell. These receptors are localized, almost exclusively, to extranuclear sites in the NAc. They are observed in all neuronal profiles and in glia, but are most prevalent in presynaptic profiles. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic neurons, and a larger proportion are localized to GABAergic neurons. These results provide a mechanism for the rapid effects of estrogens on dopaminergic transmission in the NAc.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens affect dopamine-dependent diseases/behavior and have rapid effects on dopamine release and receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Low levels of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ are seen in the NAc, which cannot account for the rapid effects of estrogens in this region. G-protein coupled ER 1 (GPER1) is observed at low levels in the NAc shell, which also likely does not account for the array of estrogens’ effects in this region. Prior studies demonstrated membrane-associated ERs in the dorsal striatum; these experiments extend those findings to the NAc core and shell. Single- and dual-immunolabeling electron microscopy determined whether ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are at extranuclear sites in the NAc core and shell and whether ERα and GPER1 were localized to catecholaminergic or γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons. All three ERs are observed, almost exclusively, at extranuclear sites in the NAc, and similarly distributed in the core and shell. ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are primarily in axons and axon terminals suggesting that estrogens affect transmission in the NAc via presynaptic mechanisms. About 10% of these receptors are found on glia. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic terminals, suggesting that binding at these ERs alters release of catecholamines, including dopamine. A larger proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to GABAergic dendrites and terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter GABAergic transmission to indirectly affect dopamine transmission in the NAc. Thus, the localization of ERs could account for the rapid effects of estrogen in the NAc.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied changes in the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [Cb] and parvalbumin [Pv]) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of four capuchin monkeys with laser-induced retinal lesions. The lesions were generated with the aid of a neodymium-YAG dual-frequency laser with shots of different intensity and at different survival time in each animal. The expression of these proteins in the layers of the dLGN was evaluated by performing histodensitometry of coronal sections throughout the nucleus. High-power laser shots administered at the border of the optic disc (OD)-injured fibers resulted in large scotomas. These lesions produced a devastating effect on fibers in this passage, resulting in large deafferentation of the dLGN. The time course of plasticity expressed in this nucleus varied with the degree of the retinal lesion. Topographically, corresponding portions of the dLGN were inferred by the extent of the ocular dominance column revealed by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry in flattened preparations of V1. In the region representing the retinal lesion, the expression of GFAP, GAP43, Pv, and Cb increased and decreased in the corresponding dLGN layers shortly after lesion induction and returned to their original values with different time courses. Synaptogenesis (indicated by GAP43 expression) appeared to be increased in all layers, while “cleansing” of the glial-damaged region (indicated by GFAP expression) was markedly greater in the parvocellular layers, followed by the magnocellular layers.</p>

                Endophenotypes are heritable and quantifiable traits indexing genetic liability for a disorder. Here, we examined three potential endophenotypes, working memory function, response inhibition and reaction time variability, for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) measured as a dimensional latent trait in a large general population sample derived from the Adolescent Brain and Cognition Developmental study. The genetic risk for ADHD was estimated using polygenic risk scores (PRS) whereas ADHD traits were quantified as a dimensional continuum using Bartlett factor score estimates, derived from Attention Problems items from the Child Behaviour Checklist and Effortful Control items from the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised. The three candidate cognitive endophenotypes were quantified using task-based performance measures. Higher ADHD PRSs were associated with higher ADHD traits, as well as poorer working memory performance and increased reaction time variability. Lower working memory performance, poorer response inhibition, and increased reaction time variability were associated with more pronounced ADHD traits. Working memory and reaction time variability partially statistically mediated the relationship between ADHD PRS and ADHD traits, explaining 14% and 16% of the association, respectively. The mediation effect was specific to the genetic risk for ADHD and did not generalise to genetic risk for four other major psychiatric disorders. Together, these findings provide robust evidence from a large general population sample that working memory and reaction time variability can be considered endophenotypes for ADHD that mediate the relationship between ADHD PRS and ADHD traits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of neonatal brain functional centrality and alterations associated with preterm birth</a></h4>

              
                Formation of the functional connectome in early life underpins future learning and behaviour. However, our understanding of how the functional organisation of brain regions into interconnected hubs (centrality) matures in the early postnatal period is limited, especially in response to factors associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as preterm birth. We characterised voxel-wise functional centrality (weighted degree) in 366 neonates from the Developing Human Connectome Project. We tested the hypothesis that functional centrality matures with age at scan in term-born babies and is disrupted by preterm birth. Finally, we asked whether neonatal functional centrality predicts general neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. We report an age-related increase in functional centrality predominantly within visual regions and decrease within motor and auditory regions in term-born infants. Preterm-born infants scanned at term equivalent age had higher functional centrality predominantly within visual regions and lower measures in motor regions. Functional centrality was not related to outcome at 18 months old. Thus, preterm birth appears to affect functional centrality in regions undergoing substantial development during the perinatal period. Our work raises the question of whether these alterations are adaptive or disruptive, and whether they predict neurodevelopmental characteristics that are more subtle or emerge later in life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ankyrin-B is lipid-modified by S-palmitoylation to promote dendritic membrane scaffolding of voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2 in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal ankyrin-B is an intracellular scaffolding protein that plays multiple roles in the axon. By contrast, relatively little is known about the function of ankyrin-B in dendrites, where ankyrin-B is also localized in mature neurons. Recently, we showed that ankyrin-B acts as a scaffold for the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.2, in dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons. How ankyrin-B is itself targeted to the dendritic membrane is not well understood. Here, we report that ankyrin-B is lipid-modified by S-palmitoylation to promote dendritic localization of Nav1.2. We identify the palmitoyl acyl transferase zDHHC17 as a key mediator of ankyrin-B palmitoylation in heterologous cells and in neurons. Additionally, we find that zDHHC17 regulates ankyrin-B protein levels independently of its S-acylation function through a conserved binding mechanism between the ANK repeat domain of zDHHC17 and the zDHHC ankyrin-repeat binding motif of ankyrin-B. We subsequently identify five cysteines in the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain of ankyrin-B that are necessary for ankyrin-B palmitoylation. Mutation of these five cysteines to alanines not only abolishes ankyrin-B palmitoylation, but also prevents ankyrin-B from scaffolding Nav1.2 at dendritic membranes of neurons due to ankyrin-B's inability to localize properly at dendrites. Thus, we show palmitoylation is critical for localization and function of ankyrin-B at dendrites. Strikingly, loss of ankyrin-B palmitoylation does not affect ankyrin-B-mediated axonal cargo transport of synaptic vesicle synaptotagmin-1 in neurons. This is the first demonstration of S-palmitoylation of ankyrin-B as an underlying mechanism required for ankyrin-B localization and function in scaffolding Nav1.2 at dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Association of Striatal Connectivity Gradients to Functional Domains Across Psychiatric Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To uncover transdiagnostic domains of functioning across stress- and neurodevelopmental disorders, and to map these on to the topographic functional organization of cortico-striatal circuitry. Methods: In a clinical sample (n=186) of subjects with high rates of comorbidity of major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and/or autism spectrum disorder, we use exploratory factor analysis on a wide range of clinical questionnaires to identify consistent functional domains of symptomatology across disorders, then replicate these functional domains in an independent dataset (n=188). Then, we use canonical correlation analysis link these functional domains to the topographic organization of the striatum as represented by connectopic maps. Results: We reveal four functional domains that transcend current diagnostic categories relating to negative valence, cognition, social functioning and inhibition/arousal. These functional domains are replicated in an independent sample and are associated with the fine-grained topographical organization of functional connectivity in the striatum (out of sample r=0.20, p=0.026), a central hub in motor, cognitive, affective and reward-related brain circuits. Conclusions and relevance: Functional domains across stress- and neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with the functional organization of the striatum. We propose that investigating psychiatric symptoms across disorders is a promising path to linking them to underlying biology, and can help bridge the gap between neuroscience and clinical psychiatry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scalable graph analysis tools for the connectomics community</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscientists now have the opportunity to analyze synaptic resolution connectomes that are larger than the memory on single consumer workstations. As dataset size and tissue diversity have grown, there is increasing interest in conducting comparative connectomics research, including rapidly querying and searching for recurring patterns of connectivity across brain regions and species. There is also a demand for algorithm reuse -- applying methods developed for one dataset to another volume. A key technological hurdle is enabling researchers to efficiently and effectively query these diverse datasets, especially as the raw image volumes grow beyond terabyte sizes. Existing community tools can perform such queries and analysis on smaller scale datasets, which can fit locally in memory, but the path to scaling remains unclear. Existing solutions such as neuPrint or FlyBrainLab enable these queries for specific datasets, but there remains a need to generalize algorithms and standards across datasets. To overcome this challenge, we present a software framework for comparative connectomics and graph discovery to make connectomes easy to analyze, even when larger-than-RAM, and even when stored in disparate datastores. This software suite includes visualization tools, a web portal, a connectivity and annotation query engine, and the ability to interface with a variety of data sources and community tools from the neuroscience community. These tools include MossDB (an immutable datastore for metadata and rich annotations); Grand (for prototyping larger-than-RAM graphs); GrandIso-Cloud (for querying existing graphs that exceed the capabilities of a single work-station); and Motif Studio (for enabling the public to query across connectomes). These tools interface with existing frameworks such as neuPrint, graph databases such as Neo4j, and standard data analysis tools such as Pandas or NetworkX. Together, these tools enable tool and algorithm reuse, standardization, and neuroscience discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectome-based predictive modeling of cognitive reserve using task-based functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive reserve supports cognitive function in the presence of pathology or atrophy. Functional neuroimaging may enable direct and accurate measurement of cognitive reserve which could have considerable clinical potential. The present study aimed to develop and validate a measure of cognitive reserve using task-based fMRI data that could then be applied to independent resting-state data. Connectome-based predictive modeling with leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to predict a residual measure of cognitive reserve using task-based functional connectivity from the Cognitive Reserve/Reference Ability Neural Network studies (n = 220, mean age = 51.91 years, SD = 17.04 years). Three network-strength predicted cognitive reserve measures were generated that accurately predicted the residual measures of unseen participants. The theoretical validity of these measures was established via a positive correlation with a socio-behavioural proxy of cognitive reserve (verbal intelligence) and a positive correlation with global cognition, independent of brain structure. This fitted model was then applied to external test data: resting-state functional connectivity data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA, n = 294, mean age = 68.3 years, SD = 7.18 years). The network-strength predicted measures were not positively associated with a residual measure of cognitive reserve nor with measures of verbal intelligence and global cognition. The present study demonstrated that task-based functional connectivity data can be used to generate theoretically valid measures of cognitive reserve. Further work is needed to establish if, and how, measures of cognitive reserve derived from task-based functional connectivity can be applied to independent resting-state data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontal cortex melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4R) mediate food intake behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) activity in the hypothalamus is crucial for regulation of metabolism and food intake. The peptide ligands for the MC4R are associated with feeding, energy expenditure, and also with complex behaviors that orchestrate energy intake and expenditure, but the downstream neuroanatomical and neurochemical targets associated with these behaviors are elusive. In addition to strong expression in the hypothalamus, the MC4R is highly expressed in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in executive function and decision-making. Methods: Using viral techniques in genetically modified mice combined with molecular techniques, we identify and describe the neuronal dynamics, and define the effects on feeding behavior of a novel population of MC4R expressing neurons in the infralimbic region of the cortex. Results: Here, we describe a novel population of MC4R-expressing neurons in the infralimbic (IL) region of the mouse prefrontal cortex that are glutamatergic, receive input from melanocortinergic neurons of the arcuate hypothalamus, and project to multiple regions that coordinate appetitive responses to food-related stimuli. The neurons are depolarized by application of MC4R-specific peptidergic agonist, THIQ. Deletion of MC4R from the IL neurons causes increased food intake and body weight gain and impaired executive function in simple food-related behavior tasks. Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that MC4R neurons of the IL play a critical role in the regulation of food intake.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High emotional reactivity is associated with activation of a molecularly distinct hippocampal-amygdala circuit modulated by the glucocorticoid receptor</a></h4>

              
                Emotions are characterized not only by their valence but also by whether they are stable or labile. Yet, we do not understand the molecular or circuit mechanisms that control the dynamic nature of emotionality. We have shown that glucocorticoid receptor overexpression in the forebrain (GRov) leads to a highly reactive mouse with increased anxiety behavior coupled with greater swings in emotional responses. This phenotype is established early in development and persists into adulthood. However, the neural circuitry mediating this lifelong emotional lability remains unknown. In the present study, optogenetic stimulation in ventral dentate gyrus (vDG) of GRov mice led to a greater range and a prolonged duration of anxiety behavior. cFos expression showed that the amplified behavioral response to vDG activation in GRov mice is coupled to increased neuronal activity in specific brain regions. Relative to wild type mice, GRov mice displayed glutamatergic/GABAergic activation imbalance in ventral CA1 (vCA1) and selectively increased glutamatergic activation in the basal posterior amygdaloid complex. Fluorescence in situ hybridization chain reaction studies showed that forebrain GR overexpression led to increased activation of molecularly distinct subpopulations of neurons within the hippocampus and the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA). Increased cFos labeling was observed in the Calbindin 1 (Calbn1+) glutamatergic neurons in vCA1 and in the DARPP-32/Ppp1r1b+ glutamatergic neurons in pBLA. We propose that a molecularly distinct hippocampal-amygdala circuit is shaped by stress early in life and tunes the dynamics of emotional responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Olfactory decoding is positively associated with ad libitum food intake in sated humans</a></h4>

              
                The role of olfaction in eating behavior and body weight regulation is controversial. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test whether central olfactory coding is associated with internal state, food intake, and change in body weight over one year in healthy human adults. Since odor quality and category are coded across distributed neural patterns that are not discernible with traditional univariate analyses, we used multi-voxel pattern analyses to decode patterns of brain activation to food versus nonfood odors. We found that decoding accuracies in the piriform cortex and amygdala were greater in the sated compared to hungry state. Sated decoding accuracies in these and other regions were also associated with post-scan ad libitum food intake, but not with weight change. These findings demonstrate that the fidelity of olfactory decoding is influenced by internal state and is associated with immediate food intake, but not longer-term body weight regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improving classification and reconstruction of imagined images from EEG signals</a></h4>

              
                Decoding brain activity related to specific tasks, such as imagining something, is important for brain computer interface (BCI) control. While decoding of brain signals, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, during observing visual images and while imagining images has been previously reported, further development of methods for improving training, performance, and interpretation of brain data was the goal of this study. We applied a Sinc-EEGNet to decode brain activity during perception and imagination of EEG stimuli, and added an attention module to extract the importance of each electrode or frequency band. We also reconstructed images from brain activity by using a generative adversarial network (GAN). By combining the EEG recorded during a visual task (perception) and imagination task, we have successfully boosted the accuracy of classifying EEG data in the imagination task and improved the quality of reconstruction by GAN. Our result indicates that the brain activity evoked during the visual task is present in the imagination task and can be used for better classification of the imagined image. By using the attention module, we can derive the spatial weights in each frequency band and contrast spatial or frequency importance between tasks from our model. Imagination tasks are classified by low frequency EEG signals over temporal cortex, while perception tasks are classified by high frequency EEG signals over occipital and frontal cortex. Combining data sets in training results in a balanced model improving classification of the imagination task without significantly changing performance in the visual task. Our approach not only improves performance and interpretability but also potentially reduces the burden on training since we can improve the accuracy of classifying a relatively hard task with high variability (imagination) by combining with the data of the relatively easy task, observing visual images.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Color Constant Representations in Early Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The light entering our eyes is the product of the illumination and the surface reflectance of an object. Although this light changes considerably when the illumination changes, we are usually able to perceive objects as stable in color. To investigate how the brain achieves color constancy, we measured BOLD fMRI while 19 participants either observed patches of light that appear colored (yellow, blue) under a spectrally neutral illuminant, or spectrally neutral gray patches that appear colored under simulated blue and yellow illumination conditions. Under bluish illumination, the neutral gray patches appeared yellow; under yellowish illumination, the same gray patches appeared blue. We successfully trained a classifier to discriminate between the blue- and yellow-colored patches in V1-V4. Crucially, we then tested whether this same classifier could also distinguish between the apparent blue and yellow induced by the illuminants. The neural representations for apparent blue and yellow resembled colorimetric blue and yellow in V1, V3 and V4. A control experiment showed that apparent lightness cannot explain these effects. These findings suggest that not only colorimetric, but also apparent color is represented to some degree in retinotopic visual cortex, as early as in V1. Furthermore, a small frontal region, the Rolandic operculum, showed activation for apparent color, possibly playing a role in color constancy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proactive inhibition of goal-directed movements involves explicit changes to movement planning</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition can be implemented reactively, withholding movement in response to a stop-signal, or by proactive changes to movement planning when a stop-signal is expected. Previous studies have typically employed simple button presses, finding proactive delays to movement onset when a stop-signal might appear. Here, we consider inhibition in the context of more complex, goal-directed movements, such as the swing of a bat. Thus, we observe two additional dimensions of movement planning under proactive control, movement duration and end-point error. We found, in addition to onset delay, movements were briefer and arrived later when a stop-signal might appear. This challenges a classical theoretical dichotomy, suggesting proactive inhibition is underlay by both response suppression and delayed facilitation. Moreover, participants were aware of delays to onset and arrival, but reported magnitudes were smaller than observed. This suggests proactive inhibition operates as an explicitly retrievable compensatory strategy whose finer details are implicitly tuned.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large errors increase the generalization of locomotor adaptation depending on the error direction.</a></h4>

              
                Generalization in motor adaptation involves the transfer of movements beyond the adaptation context. We investigated the effect of size (large vs. small) and direction (unidirectional vs. bidirectional) of performance errors during adaptation on the generalization of walking patterns from a split-belt treadmill (training context) to overground (testing context). We hypothesized that unusual errors (i.e., large unidirectional or bidirectional errors) would serve as contextual cues limiting generalization. The size of unidirectional errors was modulated either implicitly (i.e., gradual vs. semi-abrupt split-belt perturbations) or explicitly (i.e., through instructed visual feedback). Bidirectional errors were induced by a sudden removal of the split-perturbation after a long adaptation period, resulting in errors in the opposite direction to those at the start of the adaptation period. Our findings did not support our hypothesis. We found that bidirectional, but not large, performance errors limited generalization across contexts, which could be mediated by two distinct mechanisms. On the one hand, bidirectional errors upon removal of the split-perturbation are also experienced when transitioning to overground walking. Thus, bidirectional errors may facilitate switching between distinct walking patterns, thereby limiting generalization. On the other hand, large unidirectional errors induce more motor adaptation, which might lead to more generalization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Language exposure and brain myelination in early development</a></h4>

              
                The language environment to which children are exposed has an impact on later language and cognitive abilities as well as on brain development; however, it is unclear how early such impacts emerge. This study investigates the effects of children's early language environment and socioeconomic status (SES) on brain structure in infancy at both 6 and 30 months of age. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify concentrations of myelin in specific fiber tracts in the brain. Our central question was whether Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) measures from in-home recording devices and SES measures of maternal education and family income predicted myelin concentrations over development. Results show relationships between amount of in-home adult input and myelination in the white matter tracts most associated with language. Right hemisphere regions also show an association with SES, with older children from a higher SES background who were exposed to more adult input showing greater concentrations of myelin in language-related areas. We discuss these results in relation with the current literature and implications for future language research and intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effect of channel density, inverse solutions and connectivity measures on EEG resting-state networks: a simulation study</a></h4>

              
                Along with the study of brain activity evoked by external stimuli, the past two decades witnessed an increased interest in characterizing the spontaneous brain activity occurring during resting conditions. The identification of the connectivity patterns in this so-called "resting-state" has been the subject of a great number of electrophysiology-based studies, using the Electro/Magneto-Encephalography (EEG/MEG) source connectivity method. However, no consensus has been reached yet regarding a unified (if possible) analysis pipeline, and several involved parameters and methods require cautious tuning. This is particularly challenging when different choices induce significant discrepancy in results and drawn conclusions, thereby hindering reproducibility of neuroimaging research. Hence, our objective in this study was to evaluate some of the parameters related to the EEG source connectivity analysis and shed light on their implications on the accuracy of the resulting networks. We simulated, using neural mass models, EEG data corresponding to two of the resting-state networks (RSNs), namely the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attentional network (DAN). We investigated the impact of five channel densities (19, 32, 64, 128, 256), three inverse solutions (weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE), exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), and linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming) and four functional connectivity measures (phase-locking value (PLV), phase-lag index (PLI), and amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) with and without source leakage correction), on the correspondence between reconstructed and reference networks. We showed that, with different analytical choices, a high variability is present in the results. More specifically, our results show that a higher number of EEG channels significantly increased the accuracy of the reconstructed networks. Additionally, our results showed a significant variability in the performance of the tested inverse solutions and connectivity measures. In our specific simulation context, eLORETA and wMNE combined with AEC computed between orthogonalized time series exhibited the highest performance in terms of similarity between reconstructed and reference connectivity matrices. Results were similar for both DMN and DAN. We believe that this work could be useful for the field of electrophysiology connectomics, by shedding light on the challenge of analytical variability and its consequences on the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Leveraging place field repetition to understand positional versus nonpositional inputs to hippocampal field CA1</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is believed to encode episodic memory by binding information about the content of experience within a spatial framework encoding the location of that experience. Previous work implies a distinction between positional inputs to the hippocampus that provide information about an animal's location and nonpositional inputs which provide information about the content of experience, both sensory and navigational. Here we leverage the phenomenon of "place field repetition" to better understand the functional dissociation between positional and nonpositional inputs to CA1 as rats navigated freely on a novel city-block maze, which combined elements of open-field foraging and linear-track tasks. Unlike typical results in open-field foraging, place fields were directionally tuned on the maze, even though the animal's behavior was not constrained to 1-D trajectories. Repeating fields from the same cell tended to have the same directional preference when the fields were aligned along a linear corridor of the maze, but they showed uncorrelated directional preferences when they were unaligned across different corridors. Lastly, individual fields displayed complex time dynamics which resulted in the population activity changing gradually over the course of minutes. These temporal dynamics were evident across repeating fields of the same cell. These results demonstrate that the positional inputs that drive a cell to fire in similar locations across the maze can be behaviorally and temporally dissociated from the nonpositional inputs that alter the firing rates of the cell within its place fields, thereby increasing the flexibility of the system to encode episodic variables within a stable, spatial framework provided by place cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maternal obesity programs hypothalamic miR-505-5p expression in mouse offspring and impacts hypothalamic fatty acid sensing</a></h4>

              
                In utero exposure to maternal obesity programs a susceptibility to develop obesity. Animal models have shown that offspring obesity is often preceded by increased food intake, however, the mechanisms that mediate these changes are not understood. Using a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity we observed increased intake specifically of a high-fat pellet in adult offspring of obese mothers. Through small RNA sequencing, we identified programmed overexpression of miR-505-5p in the hypothalamus of offspring of obese mothers that is established in the fetus, and confirmed in vitro that fatty acid exposure increases expression of miR-505-5p. Pulsed SILAC analysis demonstrated protein targets of miR-505-5p are enriched in pathways involved in fatty acid metabolism. These include key components of neuronal fatty acid sensing, such as Cpt1a, that are implicated in BMI regulation in human genetic studies. Over-expression of miR-505-5p decreased neuronal fatty acid uptake and metabolism in vitro. Importantly, intra-cerebroventricular injection of a miR-505-5p mimic in mice resulted in increased high-fat pellet intake. Collectively these data suggest that maternal obesity induces over-expression of miR-505-5p in offspring hypothalamus, resulting in altered fatty acid sensing and increased intake of high-fat diet. This represents a novel mechanism by which maternal obesity programs obesity in offspring.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale brain correlates of sweet versus cocaine reward in rats</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine induces many supranormal changes in neuronal activity in the brain, notably in learning- and reward-related regions, in comparison to nondrug rewards - a difference that is thought to contribute to its relatively high addictive potential. However, when facing a choice between cocaine and a nondrug reward (e.g., water sweetened with saccharin), most rats do not choose cocaine, as one would expect from the extent and magnitude of its global activation of the brain, but instead choose the nondrug option. We recently showed that cocaine, though larger in magnitude, is also an inherently more delayed reward than sweet water, thereby explaining why it has less value during choice and why rats opt for the more immediate nondrug option. Here we used a large-scale fos brain mapping approach to measure brain responses to each option in saccharin-preferring rats, with the hope to identify brain regions whose activity may explain the preference for the nondrug option. In total, fos expression was measured in 142 brain levels corresponding to 52 brain subregions and composing 5 brain macrosystems. Overall, our findings confirm in rats with a preference for saccharin that cocaine induces more global brain activation than the preferred nondrug option does. Only very few brain regions were uniquely activated by saccharin. They included regions involved in taste processing (i.e., anterior gustatory cortex) and also regions involved in processing reward delay and intertemporal choice (i.e., some components of the septohippocampal system and its connections with the lateral habenula).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical areas involved in grasping and reaching actions with and without visual information: an ALE meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies</a></h4>

              
                The functional specialization of the ventral stream in Perception and the dorsal stream in Action is the cornerstone of the leading model proposed by Goodale and Milner in 1982. This model is based on neuropsychological evidence and has been a matter of debate for almost three decades, during which the dual-visual stream hypothesis has received much attention, including support and criticisms. The advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed investigating the brain areas involved in Perception and Action and provided useful data on the functional specialization of the two streams. Research on this topic has been quite prolific, yet very little attempt has been made so far to identify consistent neuroimaging results across the available literature. In particular, no meta-analysis has explored the spatial convergence in the involvement of the two streams in Action. The present meta-analysis (N=53) was designed to reveal the specific neural activations associated with Action (i.e., grasping and reaching movements), and the extent to which visual information affects the involvement of the two streams during motor control. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the consistent and spatially convergent neural correlates of Action based on neuroimaging studies conducted over the past two decades. We discuss our results in light of the well-established dual-visual stream model and frame these findings in the context of recent discoveries obtained with advanced fMRI methods, such as multivoxel pattern analysis.

	<p>The field of neuroscience has seen significant growth and interest in recent decades. While neuroscience knowledge can benefit laypeople as well as professionals in many different areas, it may be particularly relevant for educators. With the right information, educators can apply neuroscience-based teaching strategies as well as protect themselves and their students against pseudoscientific ideas and products based on them. Despite rapidly growing sources of available information and courses, studies show that educators in many countries have poor knowledge of brain science and tend to endorse education-related neuromyths. Poor English skills and fewer resources (personal, institutional and governmental) may be additional limitations in Latin America. In order to better understand the scenario in Latin America&amp;amp;rsquo;s largest country, we created an anonymous online survey which was answered by 1634 individuals working in education from all five regions of Brazil. Respondents stated whether they agreed with each statement and reported their level of confidence for each answer. Significant differences in performance were observed across regions, between educators living in capital cities versus the outskirts, between those teaching in private versus public schools, and among educators teaching different levels (pre-school up to college/university). We also observed high endorsement of some key neuromyths, even among groups who performed better overall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a detailed analysis of the profile of a large group of educators in Brazil. We discuss our findings in terms of efforts to better understand regional and global limitations and develop methods of addressing these most efficiently.</p>

	<p>The relative benefit of ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for tinnitus treatment remains unclear, especially for patients with lateralized tinnitus. In this study, we compared outcomes after 10 sessions of 1-Hz rTMS at 110% of resting motor threshold over a two-week period. In total, 104 right-handed patients with lateralized subjective tinnitus were randomly divided into four groups according to rTMS treatment: Left (n = 29), Right (n = 23), Bilateral (n = 30), and Sham stimulation (n = 22). Outcomes included estimates of tinnitus severity, psychological state, and psychoacoustic measures. Patients with left- or right-sided tinnitus were similarly distributed across treatment groups. There were no significant changes in outcome measures for the Right or Sham treatment groups. For the Left and Bilateral groups, tinnitus severity was significantly lower after treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The reduction in tinnitus severity was largest for ipsilateral treatment in the Left group. The overall response rate was 56.1% for the Left group, 46.7% for the Bilateral group, 8.3% for the Right group, and 8.3% for the Sham group. For the Left and Bilateral groups, the response rate was larger for patients with left- than right-sided tinnitus. Changes in tinnitus severity were best predicted by changes in anxiety, depression, and the loudness of the tinnitus. The results suggests that rTMS on the left temporoparietal cortex is more effective for patients with left-sided than with right-sided tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Flavonoids are one of the most exciting types of phenolic compounds with a wide range of bioactive benefits. A series of flavone derivatives (F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5) were previously synthesized from substituted O-hydroxy acetophenone and substituted chloro-benzaldehydes. The titled compounds F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5 in the present study were evaluated for their anticholinesterase potential (against AChE and BuChE). The obtained results were then validated through a molecular docking approach. Compound F5 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of AChE (IC50 = 98.42 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.97 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL) followed by compound F4, whereas compound F2 was found to be the most promising inhibitor of BuChE (IC50 = 105.20 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.43 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL) among the tested compounds. The molecular docking analysis revealed a similar trend in the binding affinity of compounds with the targeted enzymes and found them to be capable of forming highly stable complexes with both receptors. The selected compounds were further subjected to in vivo assessment of cognitive function in a scopolamine-induced amnesic animal model, in which almost all compounds F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5 significantly attenuated the amnesic effects as evaluated through Y-Maze Paradigm and novel object discrimination (NOD) tasks, findings that were further supported by ex vivo experimental results. Among (F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5), F5 showed significant anti-amnesic effects in scopolamine-induced amnesic models and ameliorated the memory loss in behavioral model studies as compared to counterparts. In ex vivo study, noteworthy protection from oxidative stress in the brains of scopolamine-induced amnesic mice was also recorded for F5. These findings also confirmed that there were no significant differences among the in vivo and ex vivo results after administration of F1&amp;amp;ndash;F5 (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) or donepezil (2 mg/kg). These synthesized flavonoids could serve as potential candidates for new neuroprotective and nootropic drugs. However, further studies are needed to validate their observed potential in other animal models as well.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to systematically review to find if aerobic exercise compared to no exercise or any other intervention affects brain plasticity among people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Searches were conducted in the Scopus, SciELO, PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. The included studies were randomized control trials (RCTs) written in English comprising individuals with MCI that evaluated the effects of aerobic training on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), brain structures, or brain activity. The quality of trials was evaluated using the PEDro scale for RCTs. Twelve studies with medium to high quality were included, of which five studies focused on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (four articles reported elevation and one article reported no changes in BDNF levels following the aerobic exercise), two studies focused on brain structures (both reported increases in hippocampus volume following the aerobic exercise), and five studies focused on brain activity (four articles reported positive changes, and one article reported no changes in brain activity following the aerobic exercise). Research regarding the effects of aerobic training on brain plasticity in people with MCI is in its infancy. Still, aerobic exercise seems to be a promising therapy in people with MCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Granule Cells Constitute One of the Major Neuronal Subtypes in the Molecular Layer of the Posterior Cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The migration of neurons from their birthplace to their correct destination is one of the most crucial steps in brain development. Incomplete or incorrect migration yields ectopic neurons, which cause neurologic deficits or are negligible at best. However, the granule cells (GCs) in the cerebellar cortex may challenge this traditional view of ectopic neurons. When animals are born, GCs proliferate near the pia mater and then migrate down to the GC layer located deep in the cerebellar cortex. However, some GC-like cells stay in the molecular layer, a layer between the pia mater and GC layer, even in normal adult animals. These cells were named ectopic GCs nearly 50 years ago, but their abundance and functional properties remain unclear. Here, we have examined GCs in the molecular layer (mGCs) with a specific marker for mature GCs and transgenic mice in which GCs are sparsely labeled with a fluorescent protein. Contrary to the previous assumption that mGCs are a minor neuronal population, we have found that mGCs are as prevalent as stellate or basket cells in the posterior cerebellum. They are produced during a similar period as regular GCs (rGCs), and <I>in vivo</I> time-lapse imaging has revealed that mGCs are stably present in the molecular layer. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings have shown that mGCs discharge action potentials similarly to rGCs. Since axonal inputs differ between the molecular layer and GC layer, mGCs might be incorporated in different micro-circuits from rGCs and have a unique functional role in the cerebellum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Learning from the Physical Consequences of Our Actions Improves Motor Memory</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Actions have consequences. Motor learning involves correcting actions that lead to movement errors and remembering these actions for future behavior. In most laboratory situations, movement errors have no physical consequences and simply indicate the progress of learning. Here, we asked how experiencing a physical consequence when making a movement error affects motor learning. Two groups of participants adapted to a new, prism-induced mapping between visual input and motor output while performing a precision walking task. Importantly, one group experienced an unexpected slip perturbation when making foot-placement errors during adaptation. Because of our innate drive for safety, and the fact that balance is fundamental to movement, we hypothesized that this experience would enhance motor memory. Learning generalized to different walking tasks to a greater extent in the group who experienced the adverse physical consequence. This group also showed faster relearning one week later despite exposure to a competing mapping during initial learning, evidence of greater memory consolidation. The group differences in generalization and consolidation occurred although they both experienced similar magnitude foot-placement errors and adapted at similar rates. Our results suggest the brain considers the potential physical consequences of movement error when learning and that balance-threatening consequences serve to enhance this process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Contributions of Mu-Opioid Receptors on Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons to Analgesia Induced by Various Stress Intensities</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The endogenous opioid system plays a crucial role in stress-induced analgesia. Mu-opioid receptors (MORs), one of the major opioid receptors, are expressed widely in subpopulations of cells throughout the CNS. However, the potential roles of MORs expressed in glutamatergic (MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB>) and -aminobutyric acidergic (MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB>) neurons in stress-induced analgesia remain unclear. By examining tail-flick latencies to noxious radiant heat of male mice, here we investigated the contributions of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> and MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> to behavioral analgesia and activities of neurons projecting from periaqueductal gray (PAG) to rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) induced by a range of time courses of forced swim exposure. The moderate but not transitory or prolonged swim exposure induced a MOR-dependent analgesia, although all of these three stresses enhanced &beta;-endorphin release. Selective deletion of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> but not MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> clearly attenuated analgesia and blocked the enhancement of activities of PAG-RVM neurons induced by moderate swim exposure. Under transitory swim exposure, in contrast, selective deletion of MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> elicited an analgesia behavior via strengthening the activities of PAG-RVM neurons. These results indicate that MOR-dependent endogenous opioid signaling participates in nociceptive modulation in a wide range, not limited to moderate, of stress intensities. Endogenous activation of MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> exerts analgesia, whereas MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> produces antianalgesia. More importantly, with an increase of stress intensities, the efficiencies of MORs on nociception shifts from balance between MOR<SUB>Glut</SUB> and MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB> to biasing toward MOR<SUB>GABA</SUB>-mediated processes. Our results point to the cellular dynamic characteristics of MORs expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in pain modulation under various stress intensities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Functional Gradient of the Fusiform Cortex for Chinese Character Recognition</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visual word recognition has been proposed to have a  functional and spatial organization corresponding to hierarchical language-like word forms in the left fusiform gyrus (FG) during visual word recognition in alphabetic languages. However, it is still unclear whether the similar functional gradients of word-like representation exist during Chinese character recognition. In this study, we adopted univariate activation analysis and representational similarity analysis (RSA) methods to investigate the functional organization in the FG for Chinese character recognition using task fMRI data. Native Chinese readers were visually presented with four types of character-like stimuli (i.e., real characters, pseudo-characters, false characters, and stroke combinations). After analysis, we observed a posterior-to-anterior functional gradient in the left FG corresponding to the degree of likeness of stimuli to character. Additionally, distinct subregions of the left FG harbor different orthographic codes. The middle part of the left FG was involved in abstract orthographic processing, while the anterior part of the left FG was involved in lexical orthographic processing (i.e., mapping orthography onto phonology or semantics). Notably, for the right FG, we did not find similar coding pattern for selectivity to character likeness, indicating the asymmetry of the functional hierarchical organization in favor of the left hemisphere. In conclusion, our findings revealed that the left FG presents a posterior-to-anterior gradient functional processing for Chinese character recognition, which expands our understanding of the psychological, neural, and computational theories of word reading.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynein Is Required for Rab7-Dependent Endosome Maturation, Retrograde Dendritic Transport, and Degradation</a></h4>

              
                <p>In all cell types, endocytosed cargo is transported along a set of endosomal compartments, which are linked maturationally from early endosomes (EEs) via late endosomes (LEs) to lysosomes. Lysosomes are critical for degradation of proteins that enter through endocytic as well as autophagic pathways. Rab7 is the master regulator of early-to-late endosome maturation, motility, and fusion with lysosomes. We previously showed that most degradative lysosomes are localized in the soma and in the first 25 &micro;m of the dendrite and that bulk degradation of dendritic membrane proteins occurs in/near the soma. Dendritic late endosomes therefore move retrogradely in a Rab7-dependent manner for fusion with somatic lysosomes. We now used cultured E18 rat hippocampal neurons of both sexes to determine which microtubule motor is responsible for degradative flux of late endosomes. Based on multiple approaches (inhibiting dynein/dynactin itself or inhibiting dynein recruitment to endosomes by expressing the C-terminus of the Rab7 effector, RILP), we now demonstrate that net retrograde flux of late endosomes in dendrites is supported by dynein. Inhibition of dynein also delays maturation of somatic endosomes, as evidenced by excessive accumulation of Rab7. In addition, degradation of dendritic cargos is inhibited. Our results also suggest that GDP-GTP cycling of Rab7 appears necessary not only for endosomal maturation but also for fusion with lysosomes subsequent to arrival in the soma. In conclusion, Rab7-dependent dynein/dynactin recruitment to dendritic endosomes plays multifaceted roles in dendritic endosome maturation as well as retrograde transport of late endosomes to sustain normal degradative flux.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lysosomes are critical for degradation of membrane and extracellular proteins that enter through endocytosis. Lysosomes are also the endpoint of autophagy and thus responsible for protein and organelle homeostasis. Endosomal-lysosomal dysfunction is linked to neurodegeneration and aging. We identify roles in dendrites for two proteins with links to human diseases, Rab7 and dynein. Our previous work identified a process that requires directional retrograde transport in dendrites, namely, efficient degradation of short-lived membrane proteins. Based on multiple approaches, we demonstrate that Rab7-dependent recruitment of dynein motors supports net retrograde transport to lysosomes and is needed for endosome maturation. Our data also suggest that GDP-GTP cycling of Rab7 is required for fusion with lysosomes and degradation, subsequent to arrival in the soma.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a Developmental Switch in Information Transfer between Whisker S1 and S2 Cortex in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The whiskers of rodents are a key sensory organ that provides critical tactile information for animal navigation and object exploration throughout life. Previous work has explored the developmental sensory-driven activation of the primary sensory cortex processing whisker information (wS1), also called barrel cortex. This body of work has shown that the barrel cortex is already activated by sensory stimuli during the first postnatal week. However, it is currently unknown when over the course of development these stimuli begin being processed by higher-order cortical areas, such as secondary whisker somatosensory area (wS2). Here we investigate the developmental engagement of wS2 by whisker stimuli and the emergence of corticocortical communication from wS1 to wS2. Using <I>in vivo</I> wide-field imaging and multielectrode recordings in control and conditional KO mice of either sex with thalamocortical innervation defects, we find that wS1 and wS2 are able to process bottom-up information coming from the thalamus from birth. We also identify that it is only at the end of the first postnatal week that wS1 begins to provide functional excitation into wS2, switching to more inhibitory actions after the second postnatal week. Therefore, we have uncovered a developmental window when information transfer between wS1 and wS2 reaches mature function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At the end of the first postnatal week, the primary whisker somatosensory area starts providing excitatory input to the secondary whisker somatosensory area 2. This excitatory drive weakens during the second postnatal week and switches to inhibition in the adult.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Stimulation Induces Distinct Forms of Sensitization of On-Off Direction-Selective Ganglion Cell Responses in the Dorsal and Ventral Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experience-dependent modulation of neuronal responses is a key attribute in sensory processing. In the mammalian retina, the On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) is well known for its robust direction selectivity. However, how the On-Off DSGC light responsiveness dynamically adjusts to the changing visual environment is underexplored. Here, we report that On-Off DSGCs tuned to posterior motion direction [i.e. posterior DSGCs (pDSGCs)] in mice of both sexes can be transiently sensitized by prior stimuli. Notably, distinct sensitization patterns are found in dorsal and ventral pDSGCs. Although responses of both dorsal and ventral pDSGCs to dark stimuli (Off responses) are sensitized, only dorsal cells show the sensitization of responses to bright stimuli (On responses). Visual stimulation to the dorsal retina potentiates a sustained excitatory input from Off bipolar cells, leading to tonic depolarization of pDSGCs. Such tonic depolarization propagates from the Off to the On dendritic arbor of the pDSGC to sensitize its On response. We also identified a previously overlooked feature of DSGC dendritic architecture that can support dendritic integration between On and Off dendritic layers bypassing the soma. By contrast, ventral pDSGCs lack a sensitized tonic depolarization and thus do not exhibit sensitization of their On responses. Our results highlight a topographic difference in Off bipolar cell inputs underlying divergent sensitization patterns of dorsal and ventral pDSGCs. Moreover, substantial crossovers between dendritic layers of On-Off DSGCs suggest an interactive dendritic algorithm for processing On and Off signals before they reach the soma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual neuronal responses are dynamically influenced by the prior visual experience. This form of plasticity reflects the efficient coding of the naturalistic environment by the visual system. We found that a class of retinal output neurons, On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells, transiently increase their responsiveness after visual stimulation. Cells located in dorsal and ventral retinas exhibit distinct sensitization patterns because of different adaptive properties of Off bipolar cell signaling. A previously overlooked dendritic morphologic feature of the On-Off direction-selective ganglion cell is implicated in the cross talk between On and Off pathways during sensitization. Together, these findings uncover a topographic difference in the adaptive encoding of upper and lower visual fields and the underlying neural mechanism in the dorsal and ventral retinas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Biophysical and Architectural Mechanisms of Subthalamic Theta under Response Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cortico-basal ganglia circuit is needed to suppress prepotent actions and to facilitate controlled behavior. Under conditions of response conflict, the frontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN) exhibit increased spiking and theta band power, which are linked to adaptive regulation of behavioral output. The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these neural signatures of impulse control remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal (STN-globus pallidus externus) network and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence, and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN "conflict detector" units because of an NMDA-dependent supralinear response. Our results provide insights into the biophysical principles and architectural constraints that give rise to STN dynamics during response conflict, and how their disruption can lead to impulsivity and compulsivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subthalamic nucleus exhibits theta band power modulation related to cognitive control over motor actions during conditions of response conflict. However, the mechanisms of such dynamics are not understood. Here we developed a novel biophysically detailed and data-constrained large-scale model of the subthalamopallidal network, and examined the impacts of cellular and network architectural properties that give rise to theta dynamics. Our investigations implicate an important role for NMDA receptors and cortico-subthalamic nucleus topographical connectivities in theta power modulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in the Activity of Basolateral Amygdalar Neurons That Project to the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis and Their Role in Anticipatory Anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal fear and anxiety can manifest as psychiatric disorders. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in sustained responding to, or anticipation of, an aversive event which can be expressed as anticipatory anxiety. The BLA is also active during anticipatory anxiety and sends projections to the BNST. However, little is known about the role for BLA neurons that project to BNST (BLA-BNST) in anticipatory anxiety in rodents. To address this, we tested whether chemogenetic inactivation of the BLA-BNST pathway attenuates sustained conditioned responses produced by anticipation of an aversive stimulus. For comparison, we also assessed BLA-BNST inactivation during social interaction, which is sensitive to unlearned anxiety. We found that BLA-BNST inactivation reduced conditioned sustained freezing and increased social behaviors, but surprisingly, only in males. To determine whether sex differences in BLA-BNST neuronal activity contribute to the differences in behavior, we used <I>in vivo</I> and <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiological approaches. In males, BLA-BNST projection neurons were more active and excitable, which coincided with a smaller after-hyperpolarization current (<I>I</I><SUB>AHP</SUB>) compared with other BLA neurons; whereas in females, BLA-BNST neurons were less excitable and had larger <I>I</I><SUB>AHP</SUB> compared with other BLA neurons. These findings demonstrate that activity of BLA-BNST neurons mediates conditioned anticipatory anxiety-like behavior in males. The lack of a role of BLA-BNST in females in this behavior, possibly because of low excitability of these neurons, also highlights the need for caution when generalizing the role of specific neurocircuits in fear and anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anxiety disorders disproportionately affect women. This hints toward sex differences within anxiety neurocircuitry, yet most of our understanding is derived from male rodents. Furthermore, debilitating anticipation of adverse events is among the most severe anxiety symptoms, but little is known about anticipatory anxiety neurocircuitry. Here we demonstrated that BLA-BNST activity is required for anticipatory anxiety to a prolonged aversive cue, but only in males. Moreover, BLA-BNST neurons are hypoactive and less excitable in females. These results uncover BLA-BNST as a key component of anticipatory anxiety circuitry, and cellular differences may explain the sex-dependent role of this circuit. Uncovering this disparity provides evidence that the assumed basic circuitry of an anxiety behavior might not readily transpose from males to females.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Aged Rats Exhibit Altered Behavior-Induced Oscillatory Activity, Place Cell Firing Rates, and Spatial Information Content in the CA1 Region of the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal gamma and theta oscillations are associated with mnemonic and navigational processes and adapt to changes in the behavioral state of an animal to optimize spatial information processing. It has been shown that locomotor activity modulates gamma and theta frequencies in rats, although how age alters this modulation has not been well studied. Here, we examine gamma and theta local-field potential and place cell activity in the hippocampus CA1 region of young and old male rats as they performed a spatial eye-blink conditioning task across 31 d. Although mean gamma frequency was similar in both groups, gamma frequency increased with running speed at a slower rate in old animals. By contrast, theta frequencies scaled with speed similarly in both groups but were lower across speeds in old animals. Although these frequencies scaled equally well with deceleration and speed, acceleration was less correlated with gamma frequency in both age groups. Additionally, spike phase-locking to gamma, but not theta, was greater in older animals. Finally, aged rats had reduced within-field firing rates but greater spatial information per spike within the field. These data support a strong relationship between locomotor behavior and local-field potential activity and suggest that age significantly affects this relationship. Furthermore, observed changes in CA1 place cell firing rates and information content lend support to the hypothesis that age may result in more general and context-invariant hippocampal representations over more detailed information. These results may explain the observation that older adults tend to recall the gist of an experience rather than the details.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal oscillations and place cell activity are sensitive to sensorimotor input generated from active locomotion, yet studies of aged hippocampal function often do not account for this. By considering locomotion and spatial location, we identify novel age-associated differences in the scaling of oscillatory activity with speed, spike-field coherence, spatial information content, and within-field firing rates of CA1 place cells. These results indicate that age has an impact on the relationship between locomotion and hippocampal oscillatory activity, perhaps indicative of alterations to afferent input. These data also support the hypothesis that aged hippocampal place cells, compared with young, may more often represent more general spatial information. If true, these results may help explain why older humans tend to recall less specific and more gist-like information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human Spindle Variability</a></h4>

              
                <p>In humans, sleep spindles are 10- to 16-Hz oscillations lasting approximately 0.5&ndash;2 s. Spindles, along with cortical slow oscillations, may facilitate memory consolidation by enabling synaptic plasticity. Early recordings of spindles at the scalp found anterior channels had overall slower frequency than central-posterior channels. This robust, topographical finding led to dichotomizing spindles as "slow" versus "fast," modeled as two distinct spindle generators in frontal versus posterior cortex. Using a large dataset of intracranial stereoelectroencephalographic (sEEG) recordings from 20 patients (13 female, 7 male) and 365 bipolar recordings, we show that the difference in spindle frequency between frontal and parietal channels is comparable to the variability in spindle frequency within the course of individual spindles, across different spindles recorded by a given site, and across sites within a given region. Thus, fast and slow spindles only capture average differences that obscure a much larger underlying overlap in frequency. Furthermore, differences in mean frequency are only one of several ways that spindles differ. For example, compared with parietal, frontal spindles are smaller, tend to occur after parietal when both are engaged, and show a larger decrease in frequency within-spindles. However, frontal and parietal spindles are similar in being longer, less variable, and more widespread than occipital, temporal, and Rolandic spindles. These characteristics are accentuated in spindles which are highly phase-locked to posterior hippocampal spindles. We propose that rather than a strict parietal-fast/frontal-slow dichotomy, spindles differ continuously and quasi-independently in multiple dimensions, with variability due about equally to within-spindle, within-region, and between-region factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep spindles are 10- to 16-Hz neural oscillations generated by cortico-thalamic circuits that promote memory consolidation. Spindles are often dichotomized into slow-anterior and fast-posterior categories for cognitive and clinical studies. Here, we show that the anterior-posterior difference in spindle frequency is comparable to that observed between different cycles of individual spindles, between spindles from a given site, or from different sites within a region. Further, we show that spindles vary on other dimensions such as duration, amplitude, spread, primacy and consistency, and that these multiple dimensions vary continuously and largely independently across cortical regions. These findings suggest that multiple continuous variables rather than a strict frequency dichotomy may be more useful biomarkers for memory consolidation or psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>Calcium imaging using GCaMP indicators and miniature microscopes has been used to image cellular populations during long timescales and in different task phases, as well as to determine neuronal circuit topology and organization. Because the hippocampus (HPC) is essential for tasks of memory, spatial navigation, and learning, calcium imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can provide new insight on cell changes over time during these tasks. All reported HPC <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging experiments have been done in mouse. However, rats have many behavioral and physiological experimental advantages over mice. In this paper, we present the first (to our knowledge) <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging from CA1 HPC in freely moving male rats. Using the UCLA Miniscope, we demonstrate that, in rat, hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks. We show that calcium events in these cells are highly correlated with periods of movement, with few calcium events occurring during periods without movement. We additionally show that an extremely large percent of cells recorded during a navigational task are place cells (77.3 &plusmn; 5.0%, surpassing the percent seen during mouse calcium imaging), and that these cells enable accurate decoding of animal position and can be held over days with consistent place fields in a consistent spatial map. A detailed protocol is included, and implications of these advancements on <I>in vivo</I> imaging and place field literature are discussed.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>In vivo</I> calcium imaging in freely moving animals allows the visualization of cellular activity across days. In this paper, we present the first <I>in vivo</I> Ca2+ recording from CA1 hippocampus (HPC) in freely moving rats. We demonstrate that hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks, and that calcium activity corresponds to periods of movement. We show that a high percentage (77.3 &plusmn; 5.0%) of imaged cells are place cells, and that these place cells enable accurate decoding and can be held stably over days with little change in field location. Because the HPC is essential for many tasks involving memory, navigation, and learning, imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can shed new insight on cellular activity changes and organization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence for the Normalization Effects of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder on Functional Connectivity in Neonates with Prenatal Opioid Exposure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altered functional connectivity has been reported in infants with prenatal exposure to opioids, which significantly interrupts and influences endogenous neurotransmitter/receptor signaling during fetal programming. Better birth outcomes and long-term developmental outcomes are associated with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during pregnancy, but the neural mechanisms underlying these benefits are largely unknown. We aimed to characterize effects of prenatal opioid/other drug exposure (PODE) and the neural basis for the reported beneficial effects of MOUD by examining neonatal brain functional organization. A cohort of 109 human newborns, 42 PODE, 39 with prenatal exposure to drugs excluding opioids (PDE), 28 drug-free controls (males and females) underwent resting-state fMRI at 2 weeks of age. To examine neural effects of MOUD, PODE infants were separated into subgroups based on whether mothers received MOUD (<I>n</I> = 31) or no treatment (<I>n</I> = 11). A novel heatmap analysis was designed to characterize PODE-associated functional connectivity alterations and MOUD-related effects, and permutation testing identified regions of interest with significant effects. PODE neonates showed alterations beyond those associated with PDE, particularly in reward-related frontal-sensory connectivity. MOUD was associated with a significant reduction of PODE-related alterations in key regions of endogenous opioid pathways including limbic and frontal connections. However, significant residual effects in limbic and subcortical circuitry were observed. These findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with PODE. Importantly, widespread normalization effects associated with MOUD reveal, for the first time, the potential brain basis of the beneficial effects of MOUD on the developing brain and underscore the importance of this treatment intervention for better developmental outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first study to reveal the potential neural mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects on the neonate brain associated with MOUD during pregnancy. We identified both normalization and residual effects of MOUD on brain functional architecture by directly comparing neonates prenatally exposed to opioids with MOUD and those exposed to opioids but without MOUD. Our findings confirm altered brain functional organization associated with prenatal opioid exposure and demonstrate that although significant residual effects remain in reward circuitry, MOUD confers significant normalization effects on functional connectivity of regions associated with socioemotional development and reward processing. Together, our results highlight the importance of MOUD intervention for better neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Uncertainty Alternates Top-down and Bottom-up Fronto-Temporal Network Signaling during Response Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response inhibition is a primary executive control function that allows the withholding of inappropriate responses, and requires appropriate perception of the external environment to achieve a behavioral goal. It remains unclear, however, how response inhibition is achieved when goal-relevant information involves perceptual uncertainty. Twenty-six human participants of both sexes performed a go/no-go task where visually presented random-dot motion stimuli involved perceptual uncertainties. The right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) was involved in response inhibition, and the middle temporal (MT) region showed greater activity when dot motions involved less uncertainty. A neocortical temporal region in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) specifically showed greater activity during response inhibition in more perceptually certain trials. In this STS region, activity was greater when response inhibition was successful than when it failed. Directional effective connectivity analysis revealed that, in more coherent trials, the MT and STS regions showed enhanced connectivity to the rIFC, whereas in less coherent trials, the signal direction was reversed. These results suggest that a reversible fronto-temporal functional network guides response inhibition and perceptual decision-making under perceptual uncertainty, and in this network, perceptual information in the MT is converted to control information in the rIFC via STS, enabling achievement of response inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Response inhibition refers to withholding inappropriate behavior and is important for achieving goals. Often, however, decision must be made based on limited environmental evidence. We showed that successful response inhibition is guided by a neocortical temporal region that plays a hub role in converting perceived information coded in a posterior temporal region to control information coded in the PFC. Interestingly, when a perceived stimulus becomes more uncertain, the PFC supplements stimulus encoding in the temporal regions. Our results highlight fronto-temporal mechanisms of response inhibition in which conversion of stimulus-control information is regulated based on the uncertainty of environmental evidence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sound Localization of World and Head-Centered Space in Ferrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>The location of sounds can be described in multiple coordinate systems that are defined relative to ourselves, or the world around us. Evidence from neural recordings in animals point toward the existence of both head-centered and world-centered representations of sound location in the brain; however, it is unclear whether such neural representations have perceptual correlates in the sound localization abilities of nonhuman listeners. Here, we establish novel behavioral tests to determine the coordinate systems in which ferrets can localize sounds. We found that ferrets could learn to discriminate between sound locations that were fixed in either world-centered or head-centered space, across wide variations in sound location in the alternative coordinate system. Using probe sounds to assess broader generalization of spatial hearing, we demonstrated that in both head and world-centered tasks, animals used continuous maps of auditory space to guide behavior. Single trial responses of individual animals were sufficiently informative that we could then model sound localization using speaker position in specific coordinate systems and accurately predict ferrets' actions in held-out data. Our results demonstrate that ferrets, an animal model in which neurons are known to be tuned to sound location in egocentric and allocentric reference frames, can also localize sounds in multiple head and world-centered spaces.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans can describe the location of sounds either relative to themselves, or in the world, independent of their momentary position. These different spaces are also represented in the activity of neurons in animals, but it is not clear whether nonhuman listeners also perceive both head and world-centered sound location. Here, we designed behavioral tasks in which ferrets discriminated between sounds using their position in the world, or relative to the head. Subjects learnt to solve both problems and generalized sound location in each space when presented with infrequent probe sounds. These findings reveal a perceptual correlate of neural sensitivity previously observed in the ferret brain and establish that, like humans, ferrets can access an auditory map of their local environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CREB Inactivation by HDAC1/PP1{gamma} Contributes to Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding the pathogenesis of nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration is critical for developing mechanism-based treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). In the nigral dopaminergic neurons of postmortem human PD brains, we found that CREB, a well-recognized pro-survival transcription factor in neurons, was inactivated by dephosphorylation at Ser133. CREB dephosphorylation correlated with decreased expression of NURR1, one of its target genes crucial for dopaminergic neuron survival, confirming that CREB function was impaired in nigral dopaminergic neurons in PD. An MPTP mouse model was used to further elucidate the mechanism underlying CREB dephosphorylation. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates CREB, was constitutively associated with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC1 promotes CREB Ser133 dephosphorylation via a stable interaction with PP1. We found that CREB interacted with the HDAC1/PP1 complex during dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Importantly, increased CREB/HDAC1 interaction occurred in the nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patients as demonstrated using a proximity ligation assay. Disrupting CREB/HDAC1 interaction via either overexpression of GAL4 M1, a CREB mutant, or administration of trichostatin A, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, restored the expression levels of phospho-CREB (Ser133) and NURR1, and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP-treated mouse brain. Collectively, our results demonstrated that HDAC1/PP1-mediated CREB inactivation contributed to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Disruption of CREB/HDAC1 interaction has the potential to be a new approach for PD therapy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder attributed to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Understanding the pathogenesis of nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration is critical for developing mechanism-based treatments for PD. We found in nigral dopaminergic neurons of postmortem human PD brains that CREB, a well-recognized pro-survival transcription factor in neurons, was inactivated by dephosphorylation at Ser133. HDAC1, constitutively associated with PP1, interacted with CREB to mediate its dephosphorylation during dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Disrupting CREB/HDAC1 interaction restored CREB activity and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP mouse brains. This work suggests that disruption of the CREB/HDAC1 interaction to restore CREB activity may be a potential therapeutic approach in PD.</p>
