              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Insular cortex to ventral striatum synapses encode valence of social interaction</a></h4>

              
                The decision to approach or avoid a conspecific is fundamental for survival. Affiliative (prosocial) interactions favor approach behaviors, while antagonistic (aggressive) contacts trigger avoidance. Here we ask how the brain encodes the valence of social interaction. We focused on the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in social reward processing. We observed that social interactions activate D1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) regardless of their valence. However, afferent D1- expressing neurons of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) exhibited distinct activity patterns coding for prosocial and aggressive social interaction, respectively. As a result, distinct forms of synaptic plasticity were elicited at the AIC to NAc synapses. Thus, the valence of social interaction induces distinct neural activity in the AIC, which teaches the animal to approach and avoid conspecifics in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The locus coeruleus broadcasts prediction errors across the cortex to promote sensorimotor plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Prediction errors are differences between expected and actual sensory input and are thought to be key computational signals that drive learning related plasticity. One way that prediction errors could drive learning is by activating neuromodulatory systems to gate plasticity. The catecholaminergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a major neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice exploring a virtual environment, we found that the activity of LC axons in the cortex correlated with the magnitude of unsigned visuomotor prediction errors. LC response profiles were similar in both motor and visual cortical areas, indicating that LC axons broadcast prediction errors throughout the dorsal cortex. While imaging calcium activity in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex, we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC axons facilitated learning of a stimulus-specific suppression of visual responses during locomotion. This plasticity, induced by minutes of LC axon stimulation, recapitulated the effect of visuomotor learning on a scale that is normally observed during visuomotor development across days. We conclude that prediction errors drive LC activity, and that LC activity facilitates sensorimotor plasticity in the cortex, consistent with a role in modulating learning rates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic Connectivity of Afferent Inputs onto Projection Neurons in the Songbird HVC</a></h4>

              
                Birdsong is a complex and volitionally produced skilled behavior that, like speech and language, is dependent on forebrain circuits for its fluent production. The well delineated neural circuits associated with song provide a powerful system in which to study how synaptically linked networks of neurons control a natural and complex behavior. The premotor cortical analog HVC is necessary for song production and for song learning. Although the main input and output pathways of HVC have in most cases been known for decades, we still lack a detailed synaptic wiring diagram of this core circuit. Here we report our progress in building this wiring diagram. HVC has at least three non-overlapping classes of projection neurons and receives input from at least five song associated regions, totaling 15 potential synaptic pathways. Combining optogenetic stimulation of axon terminals from HVCs different afferent pathways with targeted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of HVC projection neurons, we now provide an initial synaptic connectivity map of 12 of these potential pathways. We report on 435 whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the 3 classes of HVC projection neurons, examining 4 different input pathways, from NIf, Uva, mMAN, Av, and mapping the polysynaptic and monosynaptic connections in each pathway. We find that the synaptic connectivity of HVCs input-output pathways is complex. Each class of projection neuron receives monosynaptic input from three of the four afferents and all in different combinations. At this stage, only one input pathway, NIf, appears to monosynaptically project onto all three classes of HVC projection neurons. We provide this initial synaptic mapping as an update for the field and will build on this wiring diagram, by updating this bioRxiv manuscript, as more data is collected, and additional pathways are characterized.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Granite classification using machine learning and edge computing [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The outlook and the aura of any place are highly dependent on how a place is decorated and what materials are used in designing it. Granite is such a kind of rock which is vastly used for this purpose. Granite flooring and counters have a major influence on the interior d ́ecor which is essential to set the mood and ambience of a house. A system is needed to help the end users differentiate between granites, which enhance the grandeur of their house and also check the frauds of different color granite being sent by the merchant as compared to what was selected by the end user. Several models have been developed for this cause using CNN and other image processing techniques. However, a solution for this purpose must be precise and computationally efficient. Methods: For this purpose,researchers in this work developed a machine learning based granite classifier using Edge Computing and a website to help users in choosing which granite would go well with their d ́ecor is also built. The developed system consists of a color sensor [TCS3200] integrated with an ESP8266 board. The data pertaining to RGB contrasts of different rocks is acquired by using the color sensor from a dealership.This data is used to train a Machine Learning algorithm to classify the rock into different granite types from a granite dealer and yield the category prediction. Results: The proposed system yields a result of 94% accuracy when classified using Random Forest Algorithm. Conclusion: Thus, this system provides an upper hand for the end users in differentiating between different types of granites.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Intraoral repair of fractured ceramics: a literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Fracture or chipping of veneering ceramic resulting in aesthetic and functional issues is a frequent technical complication encountered with fixed dental prostheses. Treatment options include extraoral or intraoral repair of the ceramic restoration; the latter being minimally invasive and cost-effective. We reviewed the various intraoral repair techniques for ceramic fractures and their efficiency in the last decade. Methods: A literature search was carried out between 2017 and 2022 using the PubMed database with keywords: intraoral, repair, ceramics, porcelain, and ‘porcelain fused to metal’. Screening of abstracts and full texts was carried out to determine the final list of eligible studies. Results:  Twenty-one eligible studies were included in the review which consisted of 17 in vitro studies, three case reports, and one prospective clinical study. Researchers and dentists preferred repairing cracked veneered zirconia-based restorations intraorally if the restoration is in acceptable condition. However, successful intraoral repair of veneering fractures relies on the bond between the previous restoration and the new repair material, the right adhesive resin, and adequate surface conditioning. The review indicated that the best technique to fix chipping in a complex made of zirconia core and veneering ceramic is to treat the veneering ceramic with hydrofluoric acid before covering the core ceramic with silica. Conclusion: Intraoral repair is an efficient and economic procedure without the need for repeated sessions. However, the success and longevity of the restoration rely on the technical skills of the clinicians and adherence to prescribed protocols.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Peruvian children toothbrushing during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Toothbrushing is a convenient, inexpensive, widespread and culturally accepted method, resulting in an ideal public health outcome. This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on toothbrushing in Peruvian children. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted using a database of children aged 0 to 11 years, with a final sample of 39,124 participants, 15,974 in 2019 (62.03%) and 7088 in 2020 (55.54%). General toothbrushing, daily toothbrushing and minimum frequency of two times a day were dependent variables; the year was considered as the independent variable. In addition, other covariates such as geographical landscape, area of residence, place of residence, altitude, wealth index, health insurance cover, sex and age. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Results: General toothbrushing was 96.19% (n=51 013), daily toothbrushing was 87.47% (n=42 246) and minimum toothbrushing two times a day was 84.53% (n=33 957). In multivariate form, the year presented a negative association with daily toothbrushing (RPa: 0.97; CI95%: 0.96-0.98; p<0.001) and minimum toothbrushing two times a day (RPa: 0.97; CI95%: 0.95-0.98; p<0.001), adjusted for the previously associated co-variables. Conclusions: The year 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted daily toothbrushing and minimum twice-daily toothbrushing of Peruvian children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Targeting Acanthamoeba proteins interaction with flavonoids of Propolis extract by in vitro and in silico studies for promising therapeutic effects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Propolis is a natural resinous mixture produced by bees. It provides beneficial effects on human health in the treatment/management of many diseases. The present study was performed to demonstrate the anti-Acanthamoeba activity of ethanolic extracts of Propolis samples from Iran. The interactions of the compounds and essential proteins of Acanthamoeba were also visualized through docking simulation. Methods: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Propolis extract against Acanthamoeba trophozoites and cysts was determined in vitro. In addition, two-fold dilutions of each of the agents were tested for encystment, excystment and adhesion inhibitions. Three major compounds of Propolis extract such as chrysin, tectochrysin and pinocembrin have been selected in molecular docking approach to predict the compounds that might be responsible for encystment, excystment and adhesion inhibitions of A. castellanii. Furthermore, to confirm the docking results, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also carried out for the most promising two ligand-pocket complexes from docking studies. Results: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 62.5 and 125 µg/mL of the most active Propolis extract were assessed in trophozoites stage of Acanthamoeba castellanii ATCC30010 and ATCC50739, respectively. At concentrations lower than their MICs values (1/16 MIC), Propolis extract revealed inhibition of encystation. However, at 1/2 MIC, it showed a potential inhibition of excystation and anti-adhesion. The molecular docking and dynamic simulation revealed the potential capability of Pinocembrin to form hydrogen bonds with A. castellanii Sir2 family protein (AcSir2), an encystation protein of high relevance for this process in Acanthamoeba. Conclusions: The results obtained provided a candidate for the development of therapeutic drugs against Acanthamoeba infection. In vivo experiments and clinical trials are necessary to support this claim.

                Background: The aim of this paper is to find evidence of a changing pattern in cover songs by 21st-century artists. To this end, over 76,000 covers performed by artists who grew up in the 2000s were quantitatively analyzed. Methods: SecondHandSongs.com was crawled to extract the cover relationships, and Allmusic.com to obtain the genre and starting decade of each performer. Results: The results show that the current music panorama is dominated by Pop/Rock music and, for the first time since the 1960s, artists from the 2010s generation prefer to cover more songs by contemporary artists than by classic figures from the 1960s. Pop and Dance are the emerging sub-genres with the largest proportion of covered musicians, while Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran are responsible for this changing trend. Conclusions: These results provide an interesting opportunity to introduce quantitative studies in cultural studies about music, cinema and arts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Network topology metrics explaining enrichment of hybrid epithelial mesenchymal phenotypes in metastasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mubasher Rashid, Kishore Hari, John Thampi, Nived Krishnan Santhosh, Mohit Kumar Jolly</p>

Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its reverse—Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition (MET) are hallmarks of metastasis. Cancer cells use this reversible cellular programming to switch among Epithelial (E), Mesenchymal (M), and hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal (hybrid E/M) state(s) and seed tumors at distant sites. Hybrid E/M cells are often more aggressive and metastatic than the “pure” E and M cells. Thus, identifying mechanisms to inhibit hybrid E/M cells can be promising in curtailing metastasis. While multiple gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based mathematical models for EMT/MET have been developed recently, identifying topological signatures enriching hybrid E/M phenotypes remains to be done. Here, we investigate the dynamics of 13 different GRNs and report an interesting association between “hybridness” and the number of negative/positive feedback loops across the networks. While networks having more negative feedback loops favor hybrid phenotype(s), networks having more positive feedback loops (PFLs) or many <i>HiLoops–</i>specific combinations of PFLs, support terminal (E and M) phenotypes. We also establish a connection between “hybridness” and network-frustration by showing that hybrid phenotypes likely result from non-reinforcing interactions among network nodes (genes) and therefore tend to be more frustrated (less stable). Our analysis, thus, identifies network topology-based signatures that can give rise to, as well as prevent, the emergence of hybrid E/M phenotype in GRNs underlying EMP. Our results can have implications in terms of targeting specific interactions in GRNs as a potent way to restrict switching to the hybrid E/M phenotype(s) to curtail metastasis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A structural dynamics model for how CPEB3 binding to SUMO2 can regulate translational control in dendritic spines</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xinyu Gu, Nicholas P. Schafer, Carlos Bueno, Wei Lu, Peter G. Wolynes</p>

A prion-like RNA-binding protein, CPEB3, can regulate local translation in dendritic spines. CPEB3 monomers repress translation, whereas CPEB3 aggregates activate translation of its target mRNAs. However, the CPEB3 aggregates, as long-lasting prions, may raise the problem of unregulated translational activation. Here, we propose a computational model of the complex structure between CPEB3 RNA-binding domain (CPEB3-RBD) and small ubiquitin-like modifier protein 2 (SUMO2). Free energy calculations suggest that the allosteric effect of CPEB3-RBD/SUMO2 interaction can amplify the RNA-binding affinity of CPEB3. Combining with previous experimental observations on the SUMOylation mode of CPEB3, this model suggests an equilibrium shift of mRNA from binding to deSUMOylated CPEB3 aggregates to binding to SUMOylated CPEB3 monomers in basal synapses. This work shows how a burst of local translation in synapses can be silenced following a stimulation pulse, and explores the CPEB3/SUMO2 interplay underlying the structural change of synapses and the formation of long-term memories.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Kleptoplasty: Getting away with stolen chloroplasts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sónia Cruz, Paulo Cartaxana</p>

Kleptoplasty, the process by which a host organism sequesters and retains algal chloroplasts, is relatively common in protists. The origin of the plastid varies, as do the length of time it is retained in the host and the functionality of the association. In metazoa, the capacity for long-term (several weeks to months) maintenance of photosynthetically active chloroplasts is a unique characteristic of a handful of sacoglossan sea slugs. This capability has earned these slugs the epithets “crawling leaves” and “solar-powered sea slugs.” This Unsolved Mystery explores the basis of chloroplast maintenance and function and attempts to clarify contradictory results in the published literature. We address some of the mysteries of this remarkable association. Why are functional chloroplasts retained? And how is the function of stolen chloroplasts maintained without the support of the algal nucleus?

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, causes respiratory failure and damage to multiple organ systems. The emergence of viral variants poses a risk of vaccine failures and prolongation of the pandemic. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent COVID-19 pathophysiology is limited. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for the evolutionarily conserved Hippo signaling pathway in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Given the complexity of COVID-19-associated cell injury and immunopathogenesis processes, we investigated Hippo pathway dynamics in SARS-CoV-2 infection by utilizing COVID-19 lung samples and human cell models based on pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) and human primary lung air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused activation of the Hippo signaling pathway in COVID-19 lung and in vitro cultures. Both parental and Delta variant of concern (VOC) strains induced Hippo pathway. The chemical inhibition and gene knockdown of upstream kinases MST1/2 and LATS1 resulted in significantly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication, indicating antiviral roles. Verteporfin, a pharmacological inhibitor of the Hippo pathway downstream transactivator, YAP, significantly reduced virus replication. These results delineate a direct antiviral role for Hippo signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential for this pathway to be pharmacologically targeted to treat COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparative analysis of computed tomography severity indices in predicting the severity and clinical outcome in patients with acute pancreatitis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has unpredictable severity. Its management is based on initial assessment of disease severity. It ranges from mild interstitial to severe necrotic form; the latter is associated with poor prognosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the gold standard in early detection of pancreatic necrosis and in assessing the severity of AP. Two CT grading systems exist to assess severity of AP: CT severity Index (CSI) and modified CSI (MCSI). This study compares the usefulness of these two systems in predicting severity and clinical outcome in AP in comparison with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters. Methods: This is a prospective hospital-based screening study of 80 patients aged >12 years with clinical diagnosis of AP who underwent contrast-enhanced CT study of the abdomen. Comparative analysis between MCSI and CSI with Ranson’s criteria and clinical outcome parameters was assessed by Chi-Squared test. Results: The accuracy of CSI and MSCI in predicting the requirement of critical care, superadded infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and requirement of intervention were 73.0%, 64.5%, 69.8% 60.9% and 77.2%, 76.0%, 74.4% & 56.6%, respectively. Area under the curve for MCSI score was significantly higher (AUC : 0.861; 95% CI: 0.736-0.986) than CSI score (AUC:0.815;95% CI:0.749-0.941). MCSI and CSI showed significant correlation with Ranson’s criteria; however, MCSI correlation was better (r:0.53; p<0.01) than CSI (r:0.35;p:0.04). Conclusion: CSI and MCSI are better predictors of severity, clinical outcome and mortality compared with Ranson’s criteria, with MCSI being more accurate and better predictor than CSI.  The accuracy of MCSI is better than CSI for prediction of requirement of critical care, development of superadded infection and development of MODS in AP. However, CSI and MCSI have low accuracy in predicting intervention in AP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inference of a genome-wide protein-coding gene set of the inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The hagfishes (Myxiniformes) arose from agnathan (jawless vertebrate) lineages and they are one of only two extant cyclostome taxa, together with lampreys (Petromyzontiformes). Even though whole genome sequencing has been achieved for diverse vertebrate taxa, genome-wide sequence information has been highly limited for cyclostomes. Here we sequenced the genome of the inshore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri using DNA extracted from the testis, with a short-read sequencing platform, aiming to reconstruct a high-coverage protein-coding gene catalogue. The obtained genome assembly, scaffolded with mate-pair reads and paired RNA-seq reads, exhibited an N50 scaffold length of 293 Kbp, which allowed the genome-wide prediction of coding genes. This computation resulted in the gene models whose completeness was estimated at the complete coverage of more than 83 % and the partial coverage of more than 93 % by referring to evolutionarily conserved single-copy orthologs. The high contiguity of the assembly and completeness of the gene models promise a high utility in various comparative analyses including phylogenomics and phylome exploration.

                Background: In language learning, reading is a skill that enables interaction with a text in whatever field of knowledge the learner is pursuing. Readers tend to use strategies such as comprehension, interpretation and conception of decoding written language and texts to enhance their reading capacity. This research explores the reading strategies applied by Saudi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners and compares the reading abilities of male and female EFL students. Methods: The study interviewed three EFL students about the reading strategies they applied while reading passages and texts. Then an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) reading test was handed over to 26 randomly selected students. Results: The study found that the reading strategies used by the students interviewed involved skimming, scanning, guessing the meaning from context, identifying the mean idea, and summarizing the body of the text in question. Moreover, the study revealed that both male and female students scored low in the IELTS tests that the researchers conducted. The average mean score they reached was 7.15 out of 20. However, even in the low scoring ratio, female students (M=7.69) outperformed male students (M= 6.62) and the difference between them remained significant, P=.000. Conclusions: The study recommends that the language instructors help EFL learners in developing their reading strategies and applying them every time they read any text.

                Background: The world economy was broken by the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected the coffee industry. The COVID-19 pandemic's financial effects might influence equity markets and personal lives. This includes financial commodities like coffee, which the pandemic is predicted to damage. Coffee tourism is an emerging new kind of tourism in Thailand, formed in response to growing demand from visitors with a particular affinity for the beverage. Coffee tourism may contribute considerably to the expansion of Thai tourism if given the proper guidance and assistance. Methods: As part of a coffee tourism experience focusing on first-hand activities and information, tourists can visit neighbouring sites while on a coffee plantation. This research uses a stochastic neuro-fuzzy decision tree (SNF-DT) to analyse coffee tourism in Thailand. The research surveys 400 international and Thai coffee tourists. According to studies, Thai visitors mostly visit coffee tourism locations in Thailand for enjoyment. They also wanted to visit coffee fields in order to get personal knowledge of coffee production and marketing. Based on the comments of Thai visitors, coffee tourism in northern Thailand looks to be highly and effectively handled. Due to the same factor, responses from foreign coffee tourists indicated that many of their journeys to coffee tourism destinations were made entirely for enjoyment rather than the business. They also wanted to meet local tour guides and acquire handmade and locally produced things to understand more about coffee tourism.  Result: According to study results, coffee tourism management in northern Thailand looks well-received by international tourists. We also compare the suggested model to the traditional one to demonstrate its efficacy. The performance metrics are prediction rate, prediction error, and accuracy. The estimated results for our proposed technique are prediction rate (95%), prediction error (97%), and accuracy (94%).

                Vaccine rollouts have been underway to combat the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Based on ongoing interviews with ten primary care physicians ‘in the field’, this paper elucidates how in practice the vaccinations were carried out in Japan in 2021. We examine what the primary care physicians did to prepare for the rollouts, what problems they faced, and how they responded to these problems. Large-scale vaccination projects are supposed to proceed smoothly and quickly, or to have what Anna Tsing calls ‘scalability’. In practice, however, they required a variety of tasks for coordination, information sharing, and promotion. Despite feeling stressed by the lack of information and exhausted by the work overload, the primary care physicians carried out the vaccinations as an important service to their patients and communities. The findings of this paper will provide valuable materials for improving future vaccine rollouts.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Seizures are a frequent symptom of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). However, the brain regions responsible for these seizures remain unclear. To identify the brain regions causally involved in bAVM-related seizures, we retrospectively reviewed 220 patients with unruptured bAVMs. Using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) analyses, we tested whether individual brain regions were associated with unruptured bAVM-related seizures. The result revealed that unruptured bAVMs causing seizures are anatomically heterogeneous at the voxel level. Subsequently, lesion network mapping (LNM) analyses was performed to determine whether bAVMs causing seizures belonged to a distributed brain network. LNM analyses indicated that these lesions were located in a functional network characterized by connectivity to the left caudate and precuneus. Moreover, the discrimination performance of the identified seizure network was evaluated in discovery set by calculating the individualized network damage score and was tested in validation set. Based on the calculated network damage scores, patients were divided into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. The prevalence of seizures significantly differed among the three risk categories in both discovery (<i>p</i> = .003) and validation set (<i>p</i> = .004). Finally, we calculated the percentage of voxels in the canonical resting-state networks that overlapped with the seizure-susceptible brain regions to investigate the involvement of resting-state networks. With an involvement percentage over 50%, the frontoparietal control (82.9%), limbic function (76.7%), and default mode network (69.3%) were considered to be impacted in bAVM-related seizures. Our study identified the seizure-susceptible brain regions for unruptured bAVMs, which could be a plausible neuroimaging biomarker in predicting possible seizures.</p>

                Schizophrenia remains a major health burden, highlighting the need for new treatment approaches. We consider the potential for targeting the trace amine (TA) system. We first review genetic, preclinical, and clinical evidence for the role of TAs in the aetiopathology of schizophrenia. We then consider how the localisation and function of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) position it to modulate key brain circuits for the disorder. Studies in rodents using Taar1 knockout (TAAR1-KO) and overexpression models show that TAAR1 agonism inhibits midbrain dopaminergic and serotonergic activity, and enhances prefrontal glutamatergic function.

                This article is an in-depth investigation of molecular alterations underlying chiasmatic misrouting in the albino binocular circuit. During development, in a specialized retinal niche—the ciliary margin—fewer cells express the cell-cycle regulator CyclinD2. Consequently, the cell cycle is elongated, resulting in fewer ipsilaterally projecting RGCs and perturbed binocular vision.

                Pratt et al. identify neuronal Tet2 as a molecular target to boost cognitive function. Tet2-mediated neuronal hydroxymethylation and transcriptional changes negatively regulate adult hippocampal synaptic processes. Increasing neuronal Tet2 impairs hippocampal-dependent memory, while loss of neuronal Tet2 enhances memory.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Platelet p110β mediates platelet-leukocyte interaction and curtails bacterial dissemination in pneumococcal pneumonia</a></h4>

              
                Platelets are increasingly recognized as essential mediators of host defense in infectious diseases. Schrottmaier et al. identify platelet PI3K catalytic isoform p110β to foster platelet interaction with neutrophils and monocytes in streptococcal infection, promoting their recruitment and effector functions to prevent bacterial dissemination and prolong survival.

Obesity-associated vaginal microbiota, but not gut microbiota, protects host from HSV-2 infection via γδ T cells. Obesity-associated microbiota produces L-Arg. L-Arg maintains NKG2D expression of γδ T cells by “pseudonormoxia.” NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity of γδ T cells is critical for early viral clearance of obese mice.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Identification of hematopoietic stem cells residing in the meninges of adult mice at steady state</a></h4>

              
                Niu et al. characterize meningeal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with a mechanical isolation method for dura leukocytes. They disclose that meningeal HSCs possess multi-lineage reconstitution and self-renewal capability. With a tissue-specific expression profile, meningeal HSCs can provide the CNS with a constant supply of leukocytes more adapted to local microenvironment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">New insights into anatomical connectivity along the anterior–posterior axis of the human hippocampus using in vivo quantitative fibre tracking</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus supports multiple cognitive functions including episodic memory. Recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior–posterior axis of the human hippocampus, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. We leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior–posterior axis of the <i>in vivo</i> human hippocampus. We first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, we characterised where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Our results provide new and detailed insights into how specific regions along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasise the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, our results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus <i>in vivo</i> and inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutathione in the nucleus accumbens regulates motivation to exert reward-incentivized effort</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence is implicating mitochondrial function and metabolism in the nucleus accumbens in motivated performance. However, the brain is vulnerable to excessive oxidative insults resulting from neurometabolic processes, and whether antioxidant levels in the nucleus accumbens contribute to motivated performance is not known. Here, we identify a critical role for glutathione (GSH), the most important endogenous antioxidant in the brain, in motivation. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at ultra-high field in both male humans and rodent populations, we establish that higher accumbal GSH levels are highly predictive of better, and particularly, steady performance over time in effort-related tasks. Causality was established in <i>in vivo</i> experiments in rats that, first, showed that downregulating GSH levels through micro-injections of the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine in the nucleus accumbens impaired effort-based reward-incentivized performance. In addition, systemic treatment with the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine increased accumbal GSH levels in rats and led to improved performance, potentially mediated by a cell-type-specific shift in glutamatergic inputs to accumbal medium spiny neurons. Our data indicate a close association between accumbal GSH levels and an individual’s capacity to exert reward-incentivized effort over time. They also suggest that improvement of accumbal antioxidant function may be a feasible approach to boost motivation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gene interaction perturbation network deciphers a high-resolution taxonomy in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                Molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer (CRC) are currently identified via the snapshot transcriptional profiles, largely ignoring the dynamic changes of gene expressions. Conversely, biological networks remain relatively stable irrespective of time and condition. Here, we introduce an individual-specific gene interaction perturbation network-based (GIN) approach and identify six GIN subtypes (GINS1-6) with distinguishing features: (i) GINS1 (proliferative, 24%~34%), elevated proliferative activity, high tumor purity, immune-desert, <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations, and immunotherapeutic resistance; (ii) GINS2 (stromal-rich, 14%~22%), abundant fibroblasts, immune-suppressed, stem-cell-like, <i>SMAD4</i> mutations, unfavorable prognosis, high potential of recurrence and metastasis, immunotherapeutic resistance, and sensitive to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy; (iii) GINS3 (<i>KRAS</i>-inactivated, 13%~20%), high tumor purity, immune-desert, activation of <i>EGFR</i> and ephrin receptors, chromosomal instability (CIN), fewer <i>KRAS</i> mutations, <i>SMOC1</i> methylation, immunotherapeutic resistance, and sensitive to cetuximab and bevacizumab; (iv) GINS4 (mixed, 10%~19%), moderate level of stromal and immune activities, transit-amplifying-like, and <i>TMEM106A</i> methylation; (v) GINS5 (immune-activated, 12%~24%), stronger immune activation, plentiful tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, microsatellite instability and high CpG island methylator phenotype, <i>BRAF</i> mutations, favorable prognosis, and sensitive to immunotherapy and <i>PARP</i> inhibitors; (vi) GINS6, (metabolic, 5%~8%), accumulated fatty acids, enterocyte-like, and <i>BMP</i> activity. Overall, the novel high-resolution taxonomy derived from an interactome perspective could facilitate more effective management of CRC patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternative splicing downstream of EMT enhances phenotypic plasticity and malignant behaviour in colon cancer</a></h4>

              
                Phenotypic plasticity allows carcinoma cells to transiently acquire the quasi-mesenchymal features necessary to detach from the primary mass and proceed along the invasion-metastasis cascade. A broad spectrum of epigenetic mechanisms is likely to cause the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET) transitions necessary to allow local dissemination and distant metastasis. Here, we report on the role played by alternative splicing (AS) in eliciting phenotypic plasticity in epithelial malignancies with focus on colon cancer. By taking advantage of the coexistence of subpopulations of fully epithelial (EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>) and quasi-mesenchymal and highly metastatic (EpCAM<sup>lo</sup>) cells in conventional human cancer cell lines, we here show that the differential expression of <i>ESRP1</i> and other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) downstream of the EMT master regulator <i>ZEB1</i>, alters the AS pattern of a broad spectrum of targets including <i>CD44</i> and <i>NUMB</i>, thus resulting in the generation of specific isoforms functionally associated with increased invasion and metastasis. Additional functional and clinical validation studies indicate that both the newly identified RBPs and the CD44s and NUMB2/4 splicing isoforms promote local invasion and distant metastasis and are associated with poor survival in colon cancer. The systematic elucidation of the spectrum of EMT-related RBPs and AS targets in epithelial cancers, apart from the insights in the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity, will lead to the identification of novel and tumor-specific therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A prebiotic diet modulates microglial states and motor deficits in α-synuclein overexpressing mice</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, α-synuclein pathology, and neurodegeneration. Most cases of PD are non-hereditary, suggesting a strong role for environmental factors, and it has been speculated that disease may originate in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract before affecting the brain. The gut microbiome is altered in PD and may impact motor and GI symptoms as indicated by animal studies, though mechanisms of gut-brain interactions remain incompletely defined. Intestinal bacteria ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, with fecal levels of these molecules differing between PD and healthy controls and in mouse models. Among other effects, dietary microbial metabolites can modulate activation of microglia, brain-resident immune cells implicated in PD. We therefore investigated whether a fiber-rich diet influences microglial function in α-synuclein overexpressing (ASO) mice, a preclinical model with PD-like symptoms and pathology. Feeding a prebiotic high-fiber diet attenuates motor deficits and reduces α-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra of mice. Concomitantly, the gut microbiome of ASO mice adopts a profile correlated with health upon prebiotic treatment, which also reduces microglial activation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of microglia from the substantia nigra and striatum uncovers increased pro-inflammatory signaling and reduced homeostatic responses in ASO mice compared to wild-type counterparts on standard diets. However, prebiotic feeding reverses pathogenic microglial states in ASO mice and promotes expansion of protective disease-associated macrophage (DAM) subsets of microglia. Notably, depletion of microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor eliminates the beneficial effects of prebiotics by restoring motor deficits to ASO mice despite feeding a prebiotic diet. These studies uncover a novel microglia-dependent interaction between diet and motor symptoms in mice, findings that may have implications for neuroinflammation and PD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gastrointestinal helminths increase Bordetella bronchiseptica shedding and host variation in supershedding</a></h4>

              
                Co-infected hosts, individuals that carry more than one infectious agent at any one time, have been suggested to facilitate pathogen transmission, including the emergence of supershedding events. However, how the host immune response mediates the interactions between co-infecting pathogens and how these affect the dynamics of shedding remains largely unclear. We used laboratory experiments and a modeling approach to examine temporal changes in the shedding of the respiratory bacterium <i>Bordetella bronchiseptica</i> in rabbits with one or two gastrointestinal helminth species. Experimental data showed that rabbits co-infected with one or both helminths shed significantly more <i>B. bronchiseptica</i>, by direct contact with an agar petri dish, than rabbits with bacteria alone. Co-infected hosts generated supershedding events of higher intensity and more frequently than hosts with no helminths. To explain this variation in shedding an infection-immune model was developed and fitted to rabbits of each group. Simulations suggested that differences in the magnitude and duration of shedding could be explained by the effect of the two helminths on the relative contribution of neutrophils and specific IgA and IgG to <i>B. bronchiseptica</i> neutralization in the respiratory tract. However, the interactions between infection and immune response at the scale of analysis that we used could not capture the rapid variation in the intensity of shedding of every rabbit. We suggest that fast and local changes at the level of respiratory tissue probably played a more important role. This study indicates that co-infected hosts are important source of variation in shedding, and provides a quantitative explanation into the role of helminths to the dynamics of respiratory bacterial infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The molecular basis of socially induced egg size plasticity in honey bees</a></h4>

              
                Reproduction involves the investment of resources into offspring. Although variation in reproductive effort often affects the number of offspring, adjustments of propagule size are also found in numerous species, including the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>. However, the proximate causes of these adjustments are insufficiently understood, especially in oviparous species with complex social organization in which adaptive evolution is shaped by kin selection. Here, we show in a series of experiments that queens predictably and reversibly increase egg size in small colonies and decrease egg size in large colonies, while their ovary size changes in the opposite direction. Additional results suggest that these effects cannot solely explained by egg laying rate and are due to the queens' perception of colony size. Egg size plasticity is associated with quantitative changes of 290 ovarian proteins, most of which relate to energy metabolism, protein transport, and cytoskeleton. Based on functional and network analyses, we further study the small GTPase Rho1 as a candidate regulator of egg size. Spatio-temporal expression analysis via RNAscope® and qPCR supports an important role of <i>Rho1</i> in egg size determination, and subsequent RNAi-mediated gene knock-down confirmed that <i>Rho1</i> has a major effect on egg size in honey bees. These results elucidate how the social environment of the honey bee colony may be translated into a specific cellular process to adjust maternal investment into eggs. It remains to be studied how widespread this mechanism is and whether it has consequences for population dynamics and epigenetic influences on offspring phenotype in honey bees and other species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatiotemporal properties of glutamate input support direction selectivity in the dendrites of retinal starburst amacrine cells</a></h4>

              
                The asymmetric summation of kinetically distinct glutamate inputs across the dendrites of retinal 'starburst' amacrine cells is one of the several mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie their direction-selective properties, but experimentally verifying input kinetics has been a challenge. Here, we used two-photon glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging to directly measure the input kinetics across individual starburst dendrites. We found that signals measured from proximal dendrites were relatively sustained compared to those measured from distal dendrites. These differences were observed across a range of stimulus sizes and appeared to be shaped mainly by excitatory rather than inhibitory network interactions. Temporal deconvolution analysis suggests that the steady-state vesicle release rate was ~ 3 times larger at proximal sites compared to distal sites. Using a connectomics-inspired computational model, we demonstrate that input kinetics play an important role in shaping direction selectivity at low stimulus velocities. Together, these results provide direct support for the 'space-time wiring' model for direction selectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling and mechanical perturbations reveal how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics across the mammalian spindle</a></h4>

              
                During cell division, the spindle generates force to move chromosomes. In mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et al., 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber’s response to force remain unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes, but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 μm length scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles. Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at poles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise to spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose are key for function.

                Efficient planning in complex environments requires that uncertainty associated with current inferences and possible consequences of forthcoming actions is represented. Representation of uncertainty has been established in sensory systems during simple perceptual decision making tasks but it remains unclear if complex cognitive computations such as planning and navigation are also supported by probabilistic neural representations. Here, we capitalized on gradually changing uncertainty along planned motion trajectories during hippocampal theta sequences to capture signatures of uncertainty representation in population responses. In contrast with prominent theories, we found no evidence of encoding parameters of probability distributions in the momentary population activity recorded in an open-field navigation task in rats. Instead, uncertainty was encoded sequentially by sampling motion trajectories randomly and efficiently in subsequent theta cycles from the distribution of potential trajectories. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that the hippocampus is well equipped to contribute to optimal planning by representing uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Targeted genomic sequencing with probe capture for discovery and surveillance of coronaviruses in bats</a></h4>

              
                Public health emergencies like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have prioritized surveillance of zoonotic coronaviruses, resulting in extensive genomic characterization of coronavirus diversity in bats. Sequencing viral genomes directly from animal specimens remains a laboratory challenge, however, and most bat coronaviruses have been characterized solely by PCR amplification of small regions from the best-conserved gene. This has resulted in limited phylogenetic resolution and left viral genetic factors relevant to threat assessment undescribed. In this study, we evaluated whether a technique called hybridization probe capture can achieve more extensive genome recovery from surveillance specimens. Using a custom panel of 20,000 probes, we captured and sequenced coronavirus genomic material in 21 swab specimens collected from bats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For 15 of these specimens, probe capture recovered more genome sequence than had been previously generated with standard amplicon sequencing protocols, providing a median 6.1-fold improvement (ranging up to 69.1-fold). Probe capture data also identified five novel <i>alpha-</i> and <i>betacoronaviruses</i> in these specimens, and their full genomes were recovered with additional deep sequencing. Based on these experiences, we discuss how probe capture could be effectively operationalized alongside other sequencing technologies for high-throughput, genomics-based discovery and surveillance of bat coronaviruses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Two neuronal peptides encoded from a single transcript regulate mitochondrial complex III in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Naturally produced peptides (&lt;100 amino acids) are important regulators of physiology, development, and metabolism. Recent studies have predicted that thousands of peptides may be translated from transcripts containing small open reading frames (smORFs). Here, we describe two peptides in <i>Drosophila</i> encoded by conserved smORFs, Sloth1 and Sloth2. These peptides are translated from the same bicistronic transcript and share sequence similarities, suggesting that they encode paralogs. Yet, Sloth1 and Sloth2 are not functionally redundant, and loss of either peptide causes animal lethality, reduced neuronal function, impaired mitochondrial function, and neurodegeneration. We provide evidence that Sloth1/2 are highly expressed in neurons, imported to mitochondria, and regulate mitochondrial complex III assembly. These results suggest that phenotypic analysis of smORF genes in <i>Drosophila</i> can provide a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly characterized class of genes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Connexin 43 hemichannels regulate mitochondrial ATP generation, mobilization, and mitochondrial homeostasis against oxidative stress</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress is a major risk factor that causes osteocyte cell death and bone loss. Prior studies primarily focus on the function of cell surface expressed Cx43 channels. Here, we reported a new role of mitochondrial Cx43 (mtCx43) and hemichannels (HCs) in modulating mitochondria homeostasis and function in bone osteocytes under oxidative stress. In murine long bone osteocyte-Y4 cells, the translocation of Cx43 to mitochondria was increased under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased the mtCx43 level accompanied by elevated mtCx43 HC activity, determined by dye uptake assay. Cx43 knockdown (KD) by the CRISPR-Cas9 lentivirus system resulted in impairment of mitochondrial function, primarily manifested as decreased ATP production. Cx43 KD had reduced intracellular reactive oxidative species levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, live-cell imaging results demonstrated that the proton flux was dependent on mtCx43 HCs because its activity was specifically inhibited by an antibody targeting Cx43 C-terminus. The co-localization and interaction of mtCx43 and ATP synthase subunit F (ATP5J2) were confirmed by Förster resonance energy transfer and a protein pull-down assay. Together, our study suggests that mtCx43 HCs regulate mitochondrial ATP generation by mediating K<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, and ATP transfer across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the interaction with mitochondrial ATP synthase, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial redox levels in response to oxidative stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LRG1 is an adipokine that promotes insulin sensitivity and suppresses inflammation</a></h4>

              
                While dysregulation of adipocyte endocrine function plays a central role in obesity and its complications, the vast majority of adipokines remain uncharacterized. We employed bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) and mass spectrometry to comprehensively characterize the secretome of murine visceral and subcutaneous white and interscapular brown adipocytes. Over 600 proteins were identified, the majority of which showed cell type-specific enrichment. We here describe a metabolic role for leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) as an obesity-regulated adipokine secreted by mature adipocytes. LRG1 overexpression significantly improved glucose homeostasis in diet-induced and genetically obese mice. This was associated with markedly reduced white adipose tissue macrophage accumulation and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, we found LRG1 binds cytochrome <i>c</i> in circulation to dampen its pro-inflammatory effect. These data support a new role for LRG1 as an insulin sensitizer with therapeutic potential given its immunomodulatory function at the nexus of obesity, inflammation, and associated pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrative modeling reveals the molecular architecture of the intraflagellar transport A (IFT-A) complex</a></h4>

              
                Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a conserved process of cargo transport in cilia that is essential for development and homeostasis in organisms ranging from algae to vertebrates. In humans, variants in genes encoding subunits of the cargo-adapting IFT-A and IFT-B protein complexes are a common cause of genetic diseases known as ciliopathies. While recent progress has been made in determining the atomic structure of IFT-B, little is known of the structural biology of IFT-A. Here, we combined chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryo-electron tomography with AlphaFold2-based prediction of both protein structures and interaction interfaces to model the overall architecture of the monomeric six-subunit IFT-A complex, as well as its polymeric assembly within cilia. We define monomer-monomer contacts and membrane-associated regions available for association with transported cargo, and we also use this model to provide insights into the pleiotropic nature of human ciliopathy-associated genetic variants in genes encoding IFT-A subunits. Our work demonstrates the power of integration of experimental and computational strategies both for multi-protein structure determination and for understanding the etiology of human genetic disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An essential periplasmic protein coordinates lipid trafficking and is required for asymmetric polar growth in mycobacteria</a></h4>

              
                Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - <i>lamA</i> - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing <i>lamA</i>. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key determinant of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective oxytocin receptor activation prevents prefrontal circuit dysfunction and social behavioral alterations in response to chronic prefrontal cortex activation in rats</a></h4>

              
                Social behavioral changes are a hallmark of several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, nevertheless the underlying neural substrates of such dysfunction remain poorly understood. Building evidence points to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as one of the key brain regions that orchestrates social behavior. We used this concept with the aim to develop a translational rat model of social-circuit dysfunction, the chronic PFC activation model (CPA). Chemogenetic designer receptor hM3Dq was used to induce chronic activation of the PFC over 10 days, and the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of prolonged PFC hyperactivity were evaluated. To test the sensitivity of this model to pharmacological interventions on longer timescales, and validate its translational potential, the rats were treated with our novel highly selective oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonist RO6958375, which has a significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile over oxytocin. CPA rats showed reduced sociability in the three-chamber sociability test, and a concomitant decrease in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission within the PFC as measured by electrophysiological recordings in acute slice preparation. Sub-chronic treatment with a low dose of the novel OXTR agonist following CPA interferes with the emergence of PFC circuit dysfunction, abnormal social behavior and specific transcriptomic changes. These results demonstrate that sustained PFC hyperactivity modifies circuit characteristics and social behaviors in ways that can be modulated by selective oxytocin receptor activation and that this model may be used to understand the circuit recruitment of prosocial therapies in drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On why we lack confidence in signal-detection-based analyses of confidence</a></h4>

              
                Signal detection theory (SDT) is one of the most popular frameworks for analysing data from studies of human behaviour, including investigations of confidence. SDT based analyses of confidence deliver both standard estimates of sensitivity (d prime), and a second estimate based only on high confidence decisions, meta d prime. The extent to which meta d prime estimates fall short of d prime estimates is regarded as a measure of metacognitive inefficiency, quantifying the contamination of confidence by additional noise. These analyses rely on a key but questionable assumption, that repeated exposures to an input will evoke a normally shaped distribution of perceptual experiences (the normality assumption). Here we show, via analyses inspired by an experiment and modelling, that when distributions of experiences do not conform with the normality assumption, meta d prime can be systematically underestimated relative to d prime. Our data highlight that SDT based analyses of confidence do not provide a ground truth measure of human metacognitive inefficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional control of motor pool formation and motor circuit connectivity by the LIM-HD protein Isl2</a></h4>

              
                The fidelity of motor control requires the precise positional arrangement of motor pools and the establishment of synaptic connections between these pools. In the developing spinal cord, motor nerves project to specific target muscles and receive proprioceptive input from the muscles via the sensorimotor circuit. LIM-homeodomain transcription factors are known to successively restrict specific motor neuronal fates during neural development; however, it remains unclear to what extent they contribute to limb-based motor pools and locomotor circuits. Here, we showed in mice that deletion of Isl2 resulted in scattered motor pools, primarily in the median motor column and lateral LMC (LMCl) populations, and lacked Pea3 expression in the hindlimb motor pools, accompanied by reduced terminal axon branching and disorganized neuromuscular junctions. Transcriptomic analysis of Isl2-deficient spinal cords revealed that a variety of genes involved in motor neuron differentiation, axon development, and synapse organization were downregulated in hindlimb motor pools. Moreover, the loss of Isl2 impaired sensorimotor connectivity and hindlimb locomotion. Together, our studies indicate that Isl2 plays a critical role in organizing motor pool position and sensorimotor circuits in hindlimb motor pools.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative analysis of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in a rabbit model of retinal detachment-related proliferative vitreoretinopathy.</a></h4>

              
                Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is the most common cause of failure of retinal reattachment surgery and the molecular changes leading to this aberrant wound healing process is currently unknown. We aimed to study PVR pathogenesis using single-cell transcriptomics to dissect cellular heterogeneity in a rabbit PVR model. PVR was induced unilaterally in Dutch Belted rabbits. At different timepoints following PVR induction, retinas were dissociated into either cells or nuclei suspension and processed for single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq or snRNA-seq). ScRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq were conducted on retinas at 4 hours and 14 days after disease induction. While the capture rate of unique molecular identifiers (UMI) and genes were greater in scRNA-seq samples, overall gene expression profiles of individual cell types were highly correlated between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq. A major disparity between the two sequencing modalities is the cell type capture rate, however, with glial cell types over-represented in scRNA-seq, and inner retinal neurons were enriched by snRNA-seq. Furthermore, fibrotic Muller glia were over-represented in snRNA-seq samples, while reactive Muller glia were in scRNA-seq samples. Trajectory analyses were similar between the two methods, allowing for the combined analysis of the scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets. These findings highlight limitations of both scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq analysis and imply that use of both techniques can more accurately identify transcriptional networks critical for aberrant fibrogenesis in PVR.

	<p>Previous research has shown that changes in the scenarios in which something is learned and recalled, respectively, may result in a subpar performance in memory recollection. The current study aimed to evaluate how changes in the visuo-perceptual environmental learning context impact incidental vocabulary learning. To this end, a highly immersive virtual reality setting was created, and participants were required to read eight distinct stories visually presented to them. A novel word was delivered twice in every paragraph and embedded in each story. Stories could be displayed either in a high variability condition, where each paragraph was shown in a new environment context (four different classrooms) or in a low variability condition, where each paragraph was shown in the same context. The findings obtained across four assessment tasks (free recall, recognition, picture matching, and sentence completion) demonstrated that significant visuo-perceptual variability did not bring about any disadvantages in word learning. Thus, perceptual information from a physically diverse environment could provide a variety of instructional and educational beneficial possibilities in the absence of a learning disadvantage.</p>

	<p>Apelin is a 77-amino-acid peptide that is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor APJ (Apelin receptor, APJ). Apelin-13, as the most bioactive affinity fragment of apelin, plays a role in energy metabolism, myocardial ischemia&amp;amp;#8210;reperfusion injury, and the regulation of the inflammatory response during oxidative stress, but its role in spinal cord injury is still unclear. This research identified and verified the differential expression of apelin in rat spinal cord injured tissues and normal spinal cord tissues by transcriptome sequencing in vivo and proved that apelin-13 protects neurons by strengthening autophagy and attenuating early-stage postspinal cord injury apoptosis in vitro. After constructing the model concerning a rat spinal cord hemisection damage, transcriptome sequencing was performed on the injured and normal spinal cord tissues of rats, which identified the differentially expressed gene apelin, with qRT-PCR detecting the representative level of apelin. The oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model of PC12 cells was constructed in vitro to simulate spinal cord injury. The OGD injury times were 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 12 h, and the non-OGD injury group was used as the control. The expression of apelin at each time point was observed by Western blotting. The expression of apelin was the lowest in the 6 h OGD injury group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Therefore, the OGD injury time of 6 h was used in subsequent experiments. The noncytotoxic drug concentration of apelin-13 was determined with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. An appropriate dose of apelin-13 (1 &amp;amp;mu;M) significantly improved cell survival (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Thus, subsequent experiments selected a concentration of 1 &amp;amp;mu;M apelin-13 as it significantly increased cell viability. Finally, we divided the experimental groups into four groups according to whether they received drugs (1 &amp;amp;mu;M apelin-13, 24 h) or OGD (6 h): (1) control group: without apelin-13 or OGD injury; (2) apelin-13 group: with apelin-13 but no OGD injury; (3) OGD group: with OGD injury but without apelin-13; and (4) OGD + apelin-13 group: with apelin-13 and OGD injury. The TUNEL assay and flow cytometry results showed that compared with the OGD group, apoptosis in the OGD+Apelin-13 group was significantly reduced (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Determination of cell viability under different conditions by CCK-8 assay results displays that Apelin-13 can significantly improve the cell viability percentage under OGD conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Western blotting results showed that apelin-13 decreased the expression ratios of apoptosis-related proteins Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase3/caspase3 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), increasing the key to Beclin1-dependent autophagy pathway expression of the protein Beclin1. This finding indicates that apelin-13 protects neurons by strengthening autophagy and attenuating early-stage postspinal cord injury apoptosis in vitro.</p>

	<p>This study explored the effect of electroencephalographic infraslow neurofeedback (EEG ISF-NF) training on effective connectivity and tested whether such effective connectivity changes are correlated with changes in pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. This involved secondary analysis of a pilot double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled study. Participants (n = 60) were randomised to receive ISF-NF targeting either the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), dorsal anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortex (dACC + S1), ratio of pgACC*2/dACC + S1, or Sham-NF. Resting-state EEG and clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately after intervention, and at one-week and one-month follow-up. Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis tests demonstrated significant between-group differences in effective connectivity from pgACC to S1L at one-month follow up and marginal significant changes from S1L to pgACC at one-week and one-month follow up. Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests demonstrated significant increases in effective connectivity in the ISF-NF up-training pgACC group when compared to the Sham-NF group (pgACC to S1L at one-month (p = 0.013), and S1L to pgACC at one-week (p = 0.008) and one-month follow up (p = 0.016)). Correlational analyses demonstrated a significant negative correlation (&amp;amp;rho; = &amp;amp;minus;0.630, p = 0.038) between effective connectivity changes from pgACC to S1L and changes in pain severity at one-month follow-up. The ISF-NF training pgACC can reduce pain via influencing effective connectivity between pgACC and S1L.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Approximately one-third of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) do not experience sustained remission with current treatments. Presently, astrocytes, i.e., glial cells that act as key regulators of neuroinflammation, have been a target for therapeutic development. Research regarding their role in the neuropathology of BD is limited. We conducted a scoping review on evidence linking astrocytes to the pathology of BD. (2) Methods: The search was conducted in MEDLINE for studies published from inception to August 2022. Studies of interest were data-extracted and reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols. (3) Results: Overall, 650 publications were identified, of which 122 full texts were evaluated and 12 included. Four were in vitro, seven were ex vivo, and one study was both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro investigations focused on plasma levels of neuroinflammatory biomarkers S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Ex vivo investigations were post-mortem brain studies assessing astrocytes in regions of interest (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) using phosphorylated GFAP and ASCT-1. The in vivo and in vitro study evaluated morphological and chemical variations of YKL-40 between cohorts. (4) Conclusions: Reports indicate an association between astrocyte dysfunction and BD although larger studies are required to validate this association.</p>

	<p>Background: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by impulsivity, affect instability, dysregulation, low self-image, and interpersonal difficulties. There are many instruments to measure traits of BPD, however, few can be administered quickly. The Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (SI-Bord) is an instrument offering a brief administration time with comparable psychometric properties to more comprehensive measures. The present study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the SI-Bord in a healthy community-based sample and its relatedness to measures of social cognition. Methods: A community-based sample of participants completed an online survey consisting of measures of BPD traits and social cognition including: the Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (SI-Bord), the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), the Florida Affect Battery (FAB), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha and inter-item correlations. Validity was assessed using factor analysis, examining associations with other measures of BPD traits, and examining associations with measures not measuring BPD traits. Results: 151 participants were included in the study. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; age ranged from 20&amp;amp;ndash;76 (mean age of 38.79 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.37) and comprised 76 females (50.33%) and 75 males (49.67%). Good internal consistency was found with a Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha of 0.71. Good inter-item reliability was found with a mean inter-item cross correlation of 0.25, with each item of the SI-Bord showing an inter-item correlation coefficient of &amp;amp;gt;.5. Factor analysis identified good construct validity with a strong singular dimension explaining a large proportion of variance (Question 1). The SI-Bord showed good concurrent validity with significantly strong positive correlations with the subscales of the PAI borderline scale measuring affect instability (r = 0.60; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), identity problems (r = 0.67; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), negative relationships (r = 0.61; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), total score (r = 0.76; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and to a moderately strong positive correlation with self-harm (r = 0.39; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The SI-Bord was not correlated with the NPI-16 (r = 0.131; p = 0.11), showing good divergent validity. Conclusions: These findings support the SI-Bord as a quick and useful screening tool for traits associated with BPD. Further clinical validation is warranted.</p>

                Background: The identification of differentially expressed genes and their associated biological processes, molecular function, and cellular components are important for genetic diseases studies because they present potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: In this study, we developed an o²S²PARC template representing an interactive pipeline for the gene expression data visualization and ontologies data analysis and visualization.  To demonstrate the usefulness of the tool, we performed a case study on a publicly available dataset. Results: The tool enables users to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and visualize them in a volcano plot format. The ontologies associated with the DEGs are determined and visualized in barplots. Conclusions: The “Expression data visualization” template is publicly available on the o²S²PARC platform.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Professional qualifications of medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians and other internal stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians (MAPPs) have unique value to pharmaceutical companies due to their accountability for activities that benefit regulators, payors, prescribers and patients. This study assessed whether MAPPs’ specialist training and education in pharmaceutical medicine could account for this level of value by determining whether there was significant variation in education and training between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders of pharmaceutical companies. Methods: A systematic search of LinkedIn profiles from the 10 pharmaceutical companies by revenue was conducted between June and October 2021. Job title and type and year of undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications were extracted. A one-sided Mann-Whitney test assessed for differences in the total number of qualifications between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders involved in medical affairs using MAPPs as the reference group. Other internal stakeholders included medical affairs pharmacists (MAPharm), other medical affairs professionals (MAOth), and market access (MAcc), commercial (COmm) and sales professionals. Sub-group analysis determined differences in undergraduate and postgraduate education. Results: In total, 524 profiles were included. Compared to all other internal stakeholders, MAPPs had a significantly higher number of undergraduate (p < 0.001) and postgraduate (MAPharm, p = 0.003; MAOth, p = 0.004; MAcc, COmm and Sales, p < 0.001) qualifications. Additionally, MAPPs had a significantly longer time to industry than other internal stakeholders apart from MAPharm. Of those with clinical qualifications, MAPPs were almost twice as likely to have business qualifications. Conclusions: Of all internal stakeholders, MAPPs had the highest number of qualifications and the best match between expertise and the contextual demands of decision-makers in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies in the UK can use these findings to clarify role boundaries and decision-making power based on the nature and level of expertise of each internal stakeholder.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use on perspective-taking [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are known to alter responses to empathic pain when used alone, however the effects of their combined use on the perspective-taking facet of empathy are unknown. In order to examine the effects of concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use on perspective-taking, we analyzed behavioral and neural changes on perspective-taking ability using event-related potentials. Methods: To this purpose, 13 long-term concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants users and 13 healthy controls performed a task designed to assess affective perspective-taking with simultaneous EEG recording. Results: The behavioral results revealed similar performance between groups. The neural results showed no significant differences between groups for the N170 and late positive potential (LPP) components. These results seem to suggest that long-term use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants together does not affect perspective-taking abilities nor the processing of related information. Conclusions: The concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use seem to preserve the perspective-taking ability of social cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness, survival and safety of guselkumab attending to basal characteristics in moderate-to-severe psoriatic patients: a cohort study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease which can impact quality of life. In the past decade multiple biologic treatments have been released with encouraging results. Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-23p19. Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in psoriasis, but response differences among patient subpopulations have not been extensively reported. Furthermore, patients in real life are often non-eligible for clinical trials and their responses may differ from pivotal studies. Methods: This is a retrospective, observational study of real clinical practice of patients receiving guselkumab treatment in Spain. Patients treated with guselkumab were included between February 2019 to December 2021. This study evaluates the potential differential effect of baseline demographic and disease characteristics on therapeutic responses to guselkumab. We measured effectiveness and survival by the psoriasis area and severity index, the dermatology life quality index as well as Kaplan meier curves, respectively. Categorical and quantitative variables are reported with frequencies, and with mean and standard deviation, respectively. Differences between groups in psoriasis area and severity index and dermatology life quality index, were calculated using a mixed-effects analysis. Survival was calculated using Kaplan meier curves and log-rank tests. Results: A total of 87 patients were included. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and survival of guselkumab attending to demographic characteristics. No differences in psoriasis area and severity index or dermatology life quality index baseline values or therapeutic responses were noted at 52 weeks of follow-up among all the subgroups analysed (age, sex, psoriasis duration, body mass index, and comorbidities). A difference in drug survival was only seen between gender groups. Conclusions: Our research has demonstrated the consistency of guselkumab effectiveness across patient subgroups. No baseline features affected the effectiveness or drug survival of guselkumab, except for lower drug survival in female patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Changes in mammography screening in Ontario and Alberta following national guideline dissemination: an interrupted time series analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In November 2011, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care released guidelines for screening women at average breast cancer risk. Weak recommendations (framed using GRADE methodology) were made for screening women aged 50 to 74 years every two to three years, and for not screening women aged 40 to 49 years. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis using administrative data to examine bilateral mammography use before and after a release of a national breast screening guideline. Women aged 40 to 74 years living in Ontario or Alberta from 30th November 2008 to 30th November 2014 were included. Strata included age, region of residence, neighbourhood income quintile, immigration status, and education level. Results: In both provinces, mammography use rates were lower in the post-intervention period (527 vs. 556 and 428 vs. 465/1000 women in Ontario and Alberta, respectively). In Ontario, mammography trends decreased following guideline release to align with recommendations for women aged 40 to 74 (decrease of 2.21/1000 women, SE 0.26/1000, p<0.0001). In Alberta, mammography trends decreased for women aged 40 to 49 years (3/1000 women, SE 0.32, p<0.001) and 50 to 69 (2.9/1000 women, SE 0.79, p<0.001), but did not change for women aged 70 to 74 (0.7/1000 women, SE 1.23, p=0.553). In both provinces, trends in mammography use rates were sustained for up to three years after guideline release. Conclusions: We observed a decrease in screening for women aged 40-49. Additional research to explore whether shared decision making was used to optimize guideline-concordant screening for women aged 50-74 is needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Indonesia mixed contraception method skewness background 1997-2012: A mixed method study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Indonesia's decentralization policy adopted in 1999 had implications for the programs of national ministries and agencies, including the family planning program. Since 1999, there has been a "relaxation in family planning program effort" since many districts have a low commitment to family planning. The trend of contraceptive mix in Indonesia leading to hormonal methods, especially injections, has occurred since 2007. This study aimed to describe the mixed conditions of contraception in Indonesia from 1997 to 2012 and explore the link between the availability of facilities and infrastructure with this plan. Methods: The quantitative research used was a cross-sectional design using secondary data from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS), and In-depth interviews were employed as the qualitative approach in this study. It was found based on the results of the quantitative analysis that the trend of contraceptive mix tilted to the injection method. Results: The qualitative study results indicate that the contraceptive mix is affected by infrastructure as the main factor. Conclusion: In conclusion, there is a close relationship between the decentralization policy and the condition of the contraceptive mix. Thus, it is recommended that the central and local governments re-prioritize family planning programs and assure the availability of supporting facilities and infrastructure.

                Background: This article examines how current jurists can deal with a juristic division of the world into abode of "Islam” and “infidelity". The success with which jurists re-evaluate this dichotomy will have major impacts on how an Islamic state interacts with non-Muslim governments on the one hand, and Muslims residing temporarily or permanently in a non-Muslim territory on the other. Methods: Here, an attempt made to review the concepts of Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb from two perspectives: that of the dialectical limits and liberalization, as discussed in secondary material such as books, research articles, and reports. Results: this paper has explored and discussed the criteria for identifying Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb in Islamic jurisprudence. Conclusions: This article analyzes the various arguments put forward to establish new ways of peaceful coexisting and maintaining healthy international connections.

                In this white paper, we describe the founding of a new ELIXIR Community - the Systems Biology Community - and its proposed future contributions to both ELIXIR and the broader community of systems biologists in Europe and worldwide. The Community believes that the infrastructure aspects of systems biology - databases, (modelling) tools and standards development, as well as training and access to cloud infrastructure - are not only appropriate components of the ELIXIR infrastructure, but will prove key components of ELIXIR’s future support of advanced biological applications and personalised medicine. By way of a series of meetings, the Community identified seven key areas for its future activities, reflecting both future needs and previous and current activities within ELIXIR Platforms and Communities. These are: overcoming barriers to the wider uptake of systems biology; linking new and existing data to systems biology models; interoperability of systems biology resources; further development and embedding of systems medicine; provisioning of modelling as a service; building and coordinating capacity building and training resources; and supporting industrial embedding of systems biology. A set of objectives for the Community has been identified under four main headline areas: Standardisation and Interoperability, Technology, Capacity Building and Training, and Industrial Embedding. These are grouped into short-term (3-year), mid-term (6-year) and long-term (10-year) objectives.

                In constant degradation of conventional sources and shifting fuel costs, has prompted research into alternate power generating options in recent years. A substantial study has been conducted in the literature to properly harvest power from green energy resources. This publication aims to provide a quick assessment of various PV Performance Characteristics on different factors (such as varying irradiation, temperature, parallel & series connection, tilt angle, shading, environment impact, and different type of PV modules), to bring all of the research activities in this field under one tent. This work resulted that the efficiency and performance of the PV system are greatly affected by module temperature, irradiation, shadow, and tilt angle. Hence, each of the characteristics of the solar PV module has been examined critically with reasons, remedies, and techniques applied. Finally, a concise review with enumerated data has been presented which lightened the pathway for new researchers working in Solar Photovoltaics.

                Background Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and inflammation of the exocrine glands, especially the lacrimal and salivary glands. Moringa oleifera (MO) leaves are rich in polyphenols and flavonoids which have antioxidant activity which is also shown when extracted with ethanol. This study aimed to probe the effect of Moringa oleifera leaf extract on malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-17 (IL-17), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and caspase-3 levels and salivary gland damage in Sjögren's syndrome mice model. Methods Thirty-two samples were divided into four treatment groups: 200 mg/kg BW MO-ethanol leaf extracts with 1.23 mg/kg BW dexamethasone group (T2), 1.23 mg/kg BW dexamethasone alone group (T1), normal control group/C- (without induction of Ro antigen (SSA) and extract of MO-ethanol), and negative group/C+ (with induction of Ro antigen (SSA) on day 42). MDA, IL-17, MMP-9, and caspase-3 levels and salivary gland epithelium damage (histopathological changes) were measured 14 days post-Ro antigen (SSA) induction. The method used to measure MDA level was Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substance (TBARS) while IL-7 and MMP-9 were ELISA. Some of the salivary gland was used for histological preparations using the paraffin method withoud Harris Hematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining. Then for the examination of caspase-3, we used the standard procedure of immunohistochemically staining. The salivary gland epithelium damage examination used the HE staining of histological preparation. Results There were significant differences in MDA, IL-17, MMP-9, and caspase-3 levels in the group given a 200 mg/kg BW dose of MO-ethanol leaf extract compared to the control group. The administration of the extract also significantly reduced the degree of necrosis of the salivary gland epithelium. Conclusions Moringa oleifera leaf extract reduced MDA, IL-17, MMP9, and caspase-3 levels and salivary epithelial damage.

                Background: Angiosarcoma is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma that can arise in any soft-tissue structure or viscera. Only individual case reports and small series of gastrointestinal angiosarcoma have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we report the first African case of small intestine epithelioid angiosarcoma. Case report: Here, we present the case of a 66-year-old man who presented with melena and anemia. Physical examination showed the presence of two subcutaneous masses on the right and left flanks. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, duodenoscopy and jejunoscopy revealed multiple purpuric and hemorrhagic nodules and masses, some of which were bleeding. Pathological study of the ampullary formation and of a subcutaneous nodule concluded to the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma. Blood transfusions and interventional endoscopy by argan plasma coagulation were required due to a continued drop in hemoglobin. A drop in hemoglobin persisted and the patient died within 10 days. Conclusions: Angiosarcoma has a very poor prognosis due to delayed prognosis and insufficient therapeutic management. Interventional endoscopy to control bleeding can be considered in localized forms. Chemotherapy may help to prolong survival in metastatic and disseminated angiosarcoma. Further studies should be conducted to improve the prognosis.

Accurate epidemiological models require parameter estimates that account for mobility patterns and social network structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of probabilistic programming for parameter inference in these models. We consider an agent-based simulation that represents mobility networks as degree-corrected stochastic block models, whose parameters we estimate from cell phone co-location data. We then use probabilistic program inference methods to approximate the distribution over disease transmission parameters conditioned on reported cases and deaths. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models improve the quality of fit in multiple geographies relative to baselines that do not model network topology.

Cellular adaptation to stressful environments such as starvation is essential to the survival of microbial communities, but the uniform response of the cell community may lead to entire cell death or severe damage to their fitness. Here, we demonstrate an elaborate response of the yeast community against glucose depletion, in which the first adapted cells kill the latecomer cells. During glucose depletion, yeast cells release autotoxins, such as leucic acid and L-2keto-3methylvalerate, which can even kill the clonal cells of the ones producing them. Although these autotoxins were likely to induce mass suicide, some cells differentiated to adapt to the autotoxins without genetic changes. If nondifferentiated latecomers tried to invade the habitat, autotoxins damaged or killed the latecomers, but the differentiated cells could selectively survive. Phylogenetically distant fission and budding yeast shared this behavior using the same autotoxins, suggesting that latecomer killing may be the universal system of intercellular communication, which may be relevant to the evolutional transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms.

                <p>by Matthew S. J. Mangan, Friederike Gorki, Karoline Krause, Alexander Heinz, Anne Pankow, Thomas Ebert, Dieter Jahn, Karsten Hiller, Veit Hornung, Marcus Maurer, Florian I. Schmidt, Ralf Gerhard, Eicke Latz</p>

Pyrin is a cytosolic immune sensor that nucleates an inflammasome in response to inhibition of RhoA by bacterial virulence factors, triggering the release of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β. Gain-of-function mutations in the <i>MEFV</i> gene encoding Pyrin cause autoinflammatory disorders, such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and Pyrin-associated autoinflammation with neutrophilic dermatosis (PAAND). To precisely define the role of Pyrin in pathogen detection in human immune cells, we compared initiation and regulation of the Pyrin inflammasome response in monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM). Unlike human monocytes and murine macrophages, we determined that hMDM failed to activate Pyrin in response to known Pyrin activators <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> (<i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>) toxins A or B (TcdA or TcdB), as well as the bile acid analogue BAA-473. The Pyrin inflammasome response was enabled in hMDM by prolonged priming with either LPS or type I or II interferons and required an increase in Pyrin expression. Notably, FMF mutations lifted the requirement for prolonged priming for Pyrin activation in hMDM, enabling Pyrin activation in the absence of additional inflammatory signals. Unexpectedly, in the absence of a Pyrin response, we found that TcdB activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in hMDM These data demonstrate that regulation of Pyrin activation in hMDM diverges from monocytes and highlights its dysregulation in FMF.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Military health and performance optimization: a circadian strategy in response to governmental policies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In 2017, USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain, both guided-missile destroyers, experienced underway collisions that resulted in the deaths of 17 Sailors and degradation of national defense as two warships were removed from the frontline. This incident garnered Congress’ attention leading to numerous fatigue management policies and working groups instituted at various levels across the Department of Defense. One policy of the Department of the Navy (3120.2A; Dec 11, 2020) specifically addressed risk mitigation factors for maritime operations occurring in the overnight and early morning hours around the circadian nadir or trough in alertness and vigilance. Despite these circadian challenges that come with mission demands of military service, there are many opportunities as outlined in the Department of Navy policy to reduce and/or eliminate the performance-related risks associated with circadian misalignment. In regard to actionable systems and processes aligned with these policies, the first step is to perform a risk assessment to identify circadian-related problems that could arise in response to conducting the military training exercise or operation. The second step is to integrate a means to monitor 24-hour physiology, mitigate performance risk through fatigue countermeasures, and/or re-align the circadian timing system of military personnel to enhance sleep, manage fatigue, and optimize performance. Most importantly, the approach is not a one size fits all. Each military operation will require unique adaption (re-alignment) to the environment and each military operation may require a unique countermeasure(s).

                Background: In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the power is often ‘reverse engineered’ based on the number of participants that can realistically be achieved. An attractive alternative is planning a new trial conditional on the available evidence; a design of particular interest in RCTs that use a sham control arm (sham-RCTs). Methods: We explore the design of sham-RCTs, the role of sequential meta-analysis and  conditional planning in a systematic review of renal sympathetic denervation for patients with arterial hypertension. The main efficacy endpoint was mean change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure. We performed sequential meta-analysis to identify the time point where the null hypothesis would be rejected in a prospective scenario. Evidence-based conditional sample size calculations were performed based on fixed-effect meta-analysis. Results: In total, six sham-RCTs (981 participants) were identified. The first RCT was considerably larger (535 participants) than those subsequently published (median sample size of 80). All trial sample sizes were calculated assuming an unrealistically large intervention effect which resulted in low power when each study is considered as a stand-alone experiment. Sequential meta-analysis provided firm evidence against the null hypothesis with the synthesis of the first four trials (755 patients, cumulative mean difference -2.75 (95%CI -4.93 to -0.58) favoring the active intervention)). Conditional planning resulted in much larger sample sizes compared to those in the original trials, due to overoptimistic expected effects made by the investigators in individual trials, and potentially a time-effect association. Conclusions: Sequential meta-analysis of sham-RCTs can reach conclusive findings earlier and hence avoid exposing patients to sham-related risks. Conditional planning of new sham-RCTs poses important challenges as many surgical/minimally invasive procedures improve over time, the intervention effect is expected to increase in new studies and this violates the underlying assumptions. Unless this is accounted for, conditional planning will not improve the design of sham-RCTs.

The assessment of the included articles were conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Data were analyzed qualitatively. Result: A total of 10 articles were included in this study. Most (5) of the studies discovered a negative correlation between coffee intake and periodontal health, while 4 other studies found the protective effect of daily coffee consumption against alveolar bone loss. Last, only one study found that coffee intake did not relate with periodontitis. Conclusion: The effect of coffee consumption on periodontal health was fragmented since coffee has complex components that may give either beneficial effects or negative impact on periodontal health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors and housing effect on malaria infection: A case-control study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to demonstrate the different risk factors between low and high endemicity area and housing effect on malaria infection. Methods: This study is a case-control study with a ratio of 1:2 comparing low (Jambi) and high (Sumba) endemicity areas. Initial screening of malaria was done to assign cases and controls following inclusion criteria. The selected cases and controls were then assessed with a structured questionnaire in relation to risk factors of malaria infection. Additionally, to discover the impact of house type on malaria infection, a total of 72 houses was observed in a series of six weeks (between 28 June and 12 August 2018) human landing catch (HLC) observations that includes three types of houses; malaria, non-malaria, and permanent dwellings. The HLC was done indoors and outdoors for each house type each night. A weekly screening was taken to monitor the malaria infection rate of each house type. Results: Jambi and Sumba shared several similar individual and environmental risk factors. However, agricultural activity or visiting forestry areas is a protective factor for malaria infection in Jambi but is a risk factor in Sumba. The general linear mixed univariate model result indicates the difference in risk factor variables between Jambi and Sumba. The entomological survey found that only malaria houses significantly differed in the number of means collected mosquitoes compared with the other type of houses. Weekly screening found that the incidence rate of malaria houses is highest among others. Conclusion: The risk factors are inevitably crucial for malaria prevention strategy. Risk factor management needs to consider the location where the endemicity level may differ for each risk factor, and housing improvement is not a proper strategy before controlling other environmental factors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Gastroprotective effect of Zinnia elegans extracts against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage through downregulation of TLR4 and inflammatory cytokines [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the most common gastrointestinal diseases is gastric ulcer (GU). The ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Zinnia elegans was created to test its ability to protect the gastric mucosa from damage caused by ethanol in mice. Method: Zinnia elegans ethanolic extract was administrated intragastrically once daily for three days. After the final intragastric dose, gastric ulcer in mice was created on the third day using 70% ethanol. The stomach tissues were extracted to assess the severity of the gastric mucosal changes. Results: Orally administered Zinnia elegans ethanolic extract reduced the severity of stomach mucosal changes. In addition, the levels of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin-1B (IL‐1β), and tool-like receptor (TLR4) activity in stomach tissues were all dramatically reduced after oral administration of the extract. These findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory properties of Zinnia elegans ethanolic extract protect against ethanol-induced stomach mucosal damage in mice. Conclusions: The results of this investigation offer some support for the creation of new treatments for stomach ulcers as an alternative to treating gastric damage brought on by alcohol consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A connectomics-based taxonomy of mammals</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian taxonomies are conventionally defined by morphological traits and genetics. How species differ in terms of neural circuits and whether inter-species differences in neural circuit organization conform to these taxonomies is unknown. The main obstacle for the comparison of neural architectures have been differences in network reconstruction techniques, yielding species-specific connectomes that are not directly comparable to one another. Here we comprehensively chart connectome organization across the mammalian phylogenetic spectrum using a common reconstruction protocol. We analyze the mammalian MRI (MaMI) data set, a database that encompasses high-resolution ex vivo structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 124 species across 12 taxonomic orders and 5 superorders, collected using a unified MRI protocol. We assess similarity between species connectomes using two methods: similarity of Laplacian eigenspectra and similarity of multiscale topological features. We find greater inter-species similarities among species within the same taxonomic order, suggesting that connectome organization reflects established taxonomic relationships defined by morphology and genetics. While all connectomes retain hallmark global features and relative proportions of connection classes, inter-species variation is driven by local regional connectivity profiles. By encoding connectomes into a common frame of reference, these findings establish a foundation for investigating how neural circuits change over phylogeny, forging a link from genes to circuits to behaviour.

                Our current economic and political structures have an increasingly devastating impact on the Earth’s climate and ecosystems: we are facing a biospheric emergency, with catastrophic consequences for both humans and the natural world on which we depend. Life scientists – including biologists, medical scientists, psychologists and public health experts – have had a crucial role in documenting the impacts of this emergency, but they have failed to drive governments to take action in order to prevent the situation from getting worse. Here we, as members of the movement Scientist Rebellion, call on life scientists to re-embrace advocacy and activism – which were once hallmarks of academia – in order to highlight the urgency and necessity of systemic change across our societies. We particularly emphasise the need for scientists to engage in nonviolent civil resistance, a form of public engagement which has proven to be highly effective in social struggles throughout history.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrasting effects of Ksr2, an obesity gene, on trabecular bone volume and bone marrow adiposity</a></h4>

              
                Pathological obesity and its complications are associated with an increased propensity for bone fractures. Humans with certain genetic polymorphisms at the kinase suppressor of ras2 (KSR2) locus develop severe early-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes. Both conditions are phenocopied in mice with <i>Ksr2</i> deleted, but whether this affects bone health remains unknown. Here we studied the bones of global <i>Ksr2</i> null mice and found that <i>Ksr2</i> negatively regulates femoral, but not vertebral, bone mass in two genetic backgrounds, while the paralogous gene, <i>Ksr1</i>, was dispensable for bone homeostasis. Mechanistically, KSR2 regulates bone formation by influencing adipocyte differentiation at the expense of osteoblasts in the bone marrow. Compared with <i>Ksr2</i>’s known role as a regulator of feeding by its function in the hypothalamus, pair-feeding and osteoblast-specific conditional deletion of <i>Ksr2</i> reveals that <i>Ksr2</i> can regulate bone formation autonomously. Despite the gains in appendicular bone mass observed in the absence of <i>Ksr2</i>, bone strength, as well as fracture healing response, remains compromised in these mice. This study highlights the interrelationship between adiposity and bone health and provides mechanistic insights into how <i>Ksr2</i>, an adiposity and diabetic gene, regulates bone metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Super-resolution imaging uncovers the nanoscopic segregation of polarity proteins in epithelia</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial tissues acquire their integrity and function through the apico-basal polarization of their constituent cells. Proteins of the PAR and Crumbs complexes are pivotal to epithelial polarization, but the mechanistic understanding of polarization is challenging to reach, largely because numerous potential interactions between these proteins and others have been found, without a clear hierarchy in importance. We identify the regionalized and segregated organization of members of the PAR and Crumbs complexes at epithelial apical junctions by imaging endogenous proteins using STED microscopy on Caco-2 cells, and human and murine intestinal samples. Proteins organize in submicrometric clusters, with PAR3 overlapping with the tight junction (TJ) while PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6β form segregated clusters that are apical of the TJ and present in an alternated pattern related to actin organization. CRB3A is also apical of the TJ and partially overlaps with other polarity proteins. Of the numerous potential interactions identified between polarity proteins, only PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6β are spatially relevant in the junctional area of mature epithelial cells, simplifying our view of how polarity proteins could cooperate to drive and maintain cell polarity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">T cell deficiency precipitates antibody evasion and emergence of neurovirulent polyomavirus</a></h4>

              
                JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a life-threatening brain disease in immunocompromised patients. Inherited and acquired T cell deficiencies are associated with PML. The incidence of PML is increasing with the introduction of new immunomodulatory agents, several of which target T cells or B cells. PML patients often carry mutations in the JCPyV VP1 capsid protein, which confer resistance to neutralizing VP1 antibodies (Ab). Polyomaviruses (PyV) are tightly species-specific; the absence of tractable animal models has handicapped understanding PyV pathogenesis. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we found that T cell deficiency during persistent infection, in the setting of monospecific VP1 Ab, was required for outgrowth of VP1 Ab-escape viral variants. CD4 T cells were primarily responsible for limiting polyomavirus infection in the kidney, a major reservoir of persistent infection by both JCPyV and MuPyV, and checking emergence of these mutant viruses. T cells also provided a second line of defense by controlling the outgrowth of VP1 mutant viruses that evaded Ab neutralization. A virus with two capsid mutations, one conferring Ab-escape yet impaired infectivity and a second compensatory mutation, yielded a highly neurovirulent variant. These findings link T cell deficiency and evolution of Ab-escape polyomavirus VP1 variants with neuropathogenicity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Complementary evolution of coding and noncoding sequence underlies mammalian hairlessness</a></h4>

              
                Body hair is a defining mammalian characteristic, but several mammals, such as whales, naked mole-rats, and humans, have notably less hair than others. To find the genetic basis of reduced hair quantity, we used our evolutionary-rates-based method, RERconverge, to identify coding and noncoding sequences that evolve at significantly different rates in so-called hairless mammals compared to hairy mammals. Using RERconverge, we performed a genome-wide scan over 62 mammal species using 19,149 genes and 343,598 conserved noncoding regions to find genetic elements that evolve at significantly different rates in hairless mammals compared to hairy mammals. We show that these rate shifts resulted from relaxation of evolutionary constraint on hair-related sequences in hairless species. In addition to detecting known and potential novel hair-related genes, we also discovered hundreds of putative hair-related regulatory elements. Computational investigation revealed that genes and their associated noncoding regions show different evolutionary patterns and influence different aspects of hair growth and development. Many genes under accelerated evolution are associated with the structure of the hair shaft itself, while evolutionary rate shifts in noncoding regions also included the dermal papilla and matrix regions of the hair follicle that contribute to hair growth and cycling. Genes that were top-ranked for coding sequence acceleration included known hair and skin genes <i>KRT2</i>, <i>KRT35</i>, <i>PKP1</i>, and <i>PTPRM</i> that surprisingly showed no signals of evolutionary rate shifts in nearby noncoding regions. Conversely, accelerated noncoding regions are most strongly enriched near regulatory hair-related genes and microRNAs, such as <i>mir205</i>, <i>ELF3</i>, and <i>FOXC1</i>, that themselves do not show rate shifts in their protein-coding sequences. Such dichotomy highlights the interplay between the evolution of protein sequence and regulatory sequence to contribute to the emergence of a convergent phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sonic hedgehog-dependent recruitment of GABAergic interneurons into the developing visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) play critical roles in the development of inhibitory circuits in visual thalamus. We previously reported that RGC axons signal astrocytes to induce the expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), a motogen required for GABAergic interneuron migration into visual thalamus. However, how retinal axons induce thalamic astrocytes to generate <i>Fgf15</i> and influence interneuron migration remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that impairing RGC activity had little impact on interneuron recruitment into mouse visual thalamus. Instead, our data show that retinal-derived sonic hedgehog (SHH) is essential for interneuron recruitment. Specifically, we show that thalamus-projecting RGCs express SHH and thalamic astrocytes generate downstream components of SHH signaling. Deletion of RGC-derived SHH leads to a significant decrease in <i>Fgf15</i> expression, as well as in the percentage of interneurons recruited into visual thalamus. Overall, our findings identify a morphogen-dependent neuron–astrocyte signaling mechanism essential for the migration of thalamic interneurons.

                Understanding the activity of the mammalian brain requires an integrative knowledge of circuits at distinct scales, ranging from ion channel gating to circuit connectomics. Computational models are regularly employed to understand how multiple parameters contribute synergistically to circuit behavior. However, traditional models of anatomically and biophysically realistic neurons are computationally demanding, especially when scaled to model local circuits. To overcome this limitation, we trained several artificial neural network (ANN) architectures to model the activity of realistic multicompartmental cortical neurons. We identified an ANN architecture that accurately predicted subthreshold activity and action potential firing. The ANN could correctly generalize to previously unobserved synaptic input, including in models containing nonlinear dendritic properties. When scaled, processing times were orders of magnitude faster compared with traditional approaches, allowing for rapid parameter-space mapping in a circuit model of Rett syndrome. Thus, we present a novel ANN approach allowing for rapid, detailed network experiments using inexpensive and commonly available computational resources.

                The ever-increasing use of mouse models in preclinical neuroscience research calls for an improvement in the methods used to translate findings between mouse and human brains. Previously we showed that the brains of primates can be compared in a direct quantitative manner using a common reference space built from white matter tractography data (Rogier B. Mars et al., 2018b). Here we extend the common space approach to evaluate the similarity of mouse and human brain regions using openly accessible brain-wide transcriptomic data sets. We show that mouse-human homologous genes capture broad patterns of neuroanatomical organization, but that the resolution of cross-species correspondences can be improved using a novel supervised machine learning approach. Using this method, we demonstrate that sensorimotor subdivisions of the neocortex exhibit greater similarity between species, compared with supramodal subdivisions, and that mouse isocortical regions separate into sensorimotor and supramodal clusters based on their similarity to human cortical regions. We also find that mouse and human striatal regions are strongly conserved, with the mouse caudoputamen exhibiting an equal degree of similarity to both the human caudate and putamen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA-stimulated liquid-liquid phase separation by eukaryotic topoisomerase II modulates catalytic function</a></h4>

              
                Type II topoisomerases modulate chromosome supercoiling, condensation, and catenation by moving one double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in a second duplex. How DNA strands are chosen and selectively passed to yield appropriate topological outcomes - e.g., decatenation vs. catenation is poorly understood. Here we show that at physiological enzyme concentrations, eukaryotic type IIA topoisomerases (topo IIs) readily coalesce into condensed bodies. DNA stimulates condensation and fluidizes these assemblies to impart liquid-like behavior. Condensation induces both budding yeast and human topo IIs to switch from DNA unlinking to active DNA catenation, and depends on an unstructured C-terminal region, the loss of which leads to high levels of knotting and reduced catenation. Our findings establish that local protein concentration and phase separation can regulate how topo II creates or dissolves DNA links, behaviors that can account for the varied roles of the enzyme in supporting transcription, replication, and chromosome compaction.

                The power of electrophysiologically measured cortical activity decays 1/fX. The slope of this decay (i.e. the spectral exponent) is modulated by various factors such as age, cognitive states or psychiatric/neurological disorders. Interestingly, a mostly parallel line of research has shown similar effects for the spectral exponent in the electrocardiogram (ECG). This raises the question whether these bodywide changes in spectral exponents are independent or if the 'cortically' measured decay in power is explained by cardiac activity captured by cortical sensors (via volume conduction). Focusing on well-established age-related changes in spectral exponents, we analyzed a total of 1282 recordings of magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting state measurements with concurrent ECG in an age-diverse sample. We show that age-related changes of the spectral exponent of neural power spectra are largely explained by cardiac activity. Our results raise concerns when interpreting aperiodic activity as 'cortical' in absence of ECG recordings.

                Novel in vitro platforms based on human neurons are needed to improve early drug testing and address the stalling drug discovery in neurological disorders. Topologically controlled circuits of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons have the potential to become such a testing system. In this work, we build in vitro co-cultured circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons and rat primary glial cells using microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Such circuits are created by seeding either dissociated cells or pre-aggregated spheroids at different neuron-to-glia ratios. Furthermore, an antifouling coating is developed to prevent axonal overgrowth in undesired locations of the microstructure. We assess the electrophysiological properties of different types of circuits over more than 50 days, including their stimulation-induced neural activity. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of magnesium chloride on the electrical activity of our iPSC circuits as a proof-of-concept for screening of neuroactive compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Continuous automated MRS data analysis workflow for applied studies</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can non-invasively measure levels of endogenous metabolites in living tissue and is of great interest to neuroscience and clinical research. To this day, MRS data analysis workflows differ substantially between groups, frequently requiring many manual steps to be performed on individual datasets, e.g., data renaming/sorting, manual execution of analysis scripts, and manual assessment of success/failure. Manual analysis practices are a substantial barrier to wider uptake of MRS. They also increase the likelihood of human error and prevent deployment of MRS at large scale. Here, we demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for fully automated data uptake, processing, and quality review. Methods: The proposed continuous automated MRS analysis workflow integrates several recent innovations in MRS data and file storage conventions. They are efficiently deployed by a directory monitoring service that automatically triggers the following steps upon arrival of a new raw MRS dataset in a project folder: (1) conversion from proprietary manufacturer file formats into the universal format NIfTI-MRS; (2) consistent file system organization according to the data accumulation logic standard BIDS-MRS; (3) executing a command-line executable of our open-source end-to-end analysis software Osprey; (4) e-mail delivery of a quality control summary dashboard for all analysis steps. Results: The automated architecture successfully completed for a demonstration dataset. The only manual step required is to copy a raw data folder into a monitored directory. Conclusion: Continuous automated analysis of MRS data can reduce the burden of manual data analysis and quality control, particularly for non-expert users and large-scale studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Periodic neglect after frontoparietal lesions provides causal evidence for rhythmic attention sampling</a></h4>

              
                Contemporary models conceptualize spatial attention as a blinking spotlight that sequentially samples visual space. Hence, behavior fluctuates over time even in states of presumed "sustained" attention. Recent evidence suggested that rhythmic neural activity in the frontoparietal network constitutes the functional basis of rhythmic attentional sampling. However, causal evidence to support this notion remains absent. Using a lateralized spatial attention task, we addressed this issue in patients with focal lesions in the frontoparietal attention network. Our results uncovered that frontoparietal lesions introduce periodic neglect, i.e., temporally-specific behavioral deficits that were aligned with the underlying neural oscillations. Attention-guided perceptual sensitivity was on par with healthy controls during optimal phases but attenuated during the less excitable sub-cycles. Theta-dependent sampling (3 - 8 Hz) was causally dependent on prefrontal cortex, while alpha-band sampling (8 - 14 Hz) emerged from parietal areas. Collectively, our findings reveal that lesion-induced high amplitude, low frequency brain activity is not epiphenomenal, but has immediate behavioral consequences. More generally, these results provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that the functional architecture of attention is inherently rhythmic.

                Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent classic serotonergic psychedelic, which facilitates a variety of altered states of consciousness. Here we present the first meta-analysis establishing dose-response relationship estimates of the phenomenological states induced by LSD. Data extracted from articles identified by a systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines were obtained from the Altered States Database. The psychometric data comprised ratings of subjective effects from standardized and validated questionnaires: the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC, 11-ASC) and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30). We used a meta-regression approach to obtain estimates for linear dose-response relationships of questionnaire ratings after LSD administration to healthy, highly selected study participants in controlled settings for a dosage range between 25 g and 200 g. LSD doses positively correlated with ratings on most factors and scales of the questionnaires, with strongest responses for visionary phenomena such as audio-visual synesthesia and altered imagery, followed by positively perceived ego dissolution comprising depersonalization and derealization phenomena. Measures referring to mystical experiences exhibited weak modulations by dose. The established dose-response relationships in the given range may be used as general references for future experimental and clinical research on LSD with low to moderate dosages to relate observed with expected subjective effects and to elucidate phenomenological differences between psychedelics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early-life language deprivation affects specific neural mechanisms of semantic representations</a></h4>

              
                One signature of the human brain is its ability to derive knowledge from language inputs, in addition to nonlinguistic sensory channels such as vision and touch. How does human language experience specifically modulate the way in which semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain? We investigated this question using a unique early-life language-deprivation human model: early deaf adults who are born to hearing parents and thus had delayed acquisition of any natural human language (speech or sign), with early deaf adults who acquired sign language from birth as nonlinguistic sensory experience controls. Neural responses in a meaning judgment task with 90 written words that were familiar to both groups were measured using fMRI. The early language-deprived group, compared with the deaf control group, showed reduced semantic sensitivity, in both multivariate pattern (semantic structure encoding) and univariate (abstractness effect) analyses, in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL). These results provide positive, causal evidence that the neural semantic representation in dATL is specifically supported by language, as a unique mechanism of representing (abstract) semantic space, beyond the sensory-derived semantic representations distributed in the other cortical regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Steady state visual evoked potentials reveal a signature of the pitch-size crossmodal association in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Crossmodal correspondences describe our tendency to associate sensory features from different modalities with each other, such as the pitch of a sound with a specific size of a visual object. While such crossmodal correspondences (or associations) have been described in many behavioural studies their neurophysiological correlates remain debated. Under the current working model of multisensory perception both a low- and a high-level account seem plausible. That is, the neurophysiological processes shaping these associations could commence in early sensory regions, or may rather emerge only later and as a result from high-level multisensory integration processes or in semantic and object identification networks. We implemented a paradigm based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) to directly test the hypothesis that the associations between acoustic pitch and the visual features of size, hue or chromatic saturation are visible in brain activity from early visual cortices. Our results reveal a pitch-size congruency effect in the SSVEP over occipital electrodes and in the behavioural data, supporting a low-level account of this crossmodal association. For the associations between pitch and chromatic features we found no significant effects. We speculate that this signature of the pitch size association in early visual cortices reflects the successful pairing of congruent visual and acoustic object properties and may contribute to establishing causal relations between multisensory objects.

                Microstate analysis is a promising technique for analyzing high-density electroencephalographic data, but there are multiple questions about methodological best practices. Here we focus on a commonly used approach to the analysis of group differences in microstate maps and the derived metrics based on those maps. Using simulations seeded on real data from healthy control subjects, we compared error rates for analyses performed using microstates derived from the entire dataset to analyses performed using microstates derived separately within each subgroup. The latter approach resulted in substantially higher type I error rates. These results suggest that even subtle differences in microstate topography can have profound effects on derived microstate metrics and that future studies using microstate analysis should take steps to mitigate this large source of error.

                Reinforcement feedback can improve motor learning, but the underlying brain mechanisms remain unexplored. Especially, the causal contribution of specific patterns of oscillatory activity within the human striatum is unknown. To address this question, we exploited an innovative, non-invasive deep brain stimulation technique called transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) during reinforcement motor learning with concurrent neuroimaging, in a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind study. Striatal tTIS applied at 80Hz, but not at 20Hz, abolished the benefits of reinforcement on motor learning. This effect was related to a selective modulation of neural activity within the striatum. Moreover, 80Hz, but not 20Hz, tTIS increased the neuromodulatory influence of the striatum on frontal areas involved in reinforcement motor learning. These results show for the first time that tTIS can non-invasively and selectively modulate a striatal mechanism involved in reinforcement learning, opening new horizons for the study of causal relationships between deep brain structures and human behaviour.

                The Arctic mutation, encoding E693G in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene [E22G in amyloid-beta] (Abeta)], causes dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. Here we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structures of A beta filaments from the frontal cortex of a previously described case (A beta PParc1) with the Arctic mutation. Most filaments consist of two pairs of non-identical protofilaments that comprise residues V12-V40 (human Arctic fold A) and E11-G37 (human Arctic fold B). They have a substructure (residues F20-G37) in common with the folds of type I and type II Abeta42. When compared to the structures of wild-type Abeta42 filaments, there are subtle conformational changes in the human Arctic folds, because of the lack of a side chain at G22, which may strengthen hydrogen bonding between mutant Abeta molecules and promote filament formation. A minority of Abeta42 filaments of type II was also present, as were tau paired helical filaments. In addition, we report the cryo-EM structures of Abeta filaments with the Arctic mutation from mouse knock-in line App NL-G-F. Most filaments are made of two identical mutant protofilaments that extend from D1-G37 (murine Arctic fold). In a minority of filaments, two dimeric folds pack against each other in an anti-parallel fashion. The murine Arctic fold differs from the human Arctic folds, but shares some substructure.

                A central goal of cognitive neuroscience is to build computational models that predict and explain neural responses to sensory inputs in the cortex. Recent studies attempt to borrow the representation power of deep neural networks (DNN) to predict the brain response and suggest a correspondence between artificial and biological neural networks in their feature representations. However, each DNN instance is often specified for certain computer vision tasks which may not lead to optimal brain correspondence. On the other hand, these voxel-wise encoding models focus on predicting single voxels independently, while brain activity often demonstrates rich and dynamic structures at the population and network levels during cognitive tasks. These two important properties suggest that we can improve the prevalent voxel-wise encoding models by integrating features from DNN models and by integrating cortical network information into the models. In this work, we propose a new unified framework that addresses these two aspects through DNN feature-level ensemble learning and brain atlas-level model integration. Our proposed approach leads to superior performance over previous DNN-based encoding models in predicting whole-brain neural activity during naturalistic video perception. Furthermore, our unified framework also facilitates the investigation of the brain's neural representation mechanism by accurately predicting the neural response corresponding to complex visual concepts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biomechanics of Finger Pad Response under Torsion</a></h4>

              
                Surface skin deformation of the finger pad during partial slippage at finger-object interfaces elicits tactile feedback. During object manipulation, torque is often present, which can cause partial slippage. Until now, studies of surface skin deformation have used stimuli sliding on rectilinear tangential trajectories. Here we studied surface skin dynamics under torsion. A custom robotic platform stimulated the finger pad with a flat transparent surface, controlling the normal forces and rotation speeds applied while monitoring the contact interface using optical imaging. We observed the characteristic pattern by which partial slips develop, starting at the periphery of the contact and propagating towards its centre, and the resulting surface strains. The 20-fold range of normal forces and angular velocities used highlights the effect of those parameters on the resulting torque and skin strains. While normal force increases the contact area, generated torque, strains, and twist angle required to reach full slip, angular velocity increases loss of contact at the periphery and strain rates (although not total strains). We also discuss the surprisingly large inter-individual variability in skin biomechanics, notably observed in the twist angle the stimulus needed to rotate before reaching full slip.

                The microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) chromosome 17q21.31 locus lies within a region of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) conferring two extended haplotypes commonly referred to as H1 and H2. The major haplotype, H1 has been genetically associated with an increased risk for multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), APOE epsilon4-negative Alzheimer`s disease (AD) and Parkinson`s disease (PD). The mechanism causing this increased risk is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Mild Chronic Oxidative Stress (MCOS) in neurogenin 2 (NGN2) induced neurons (iNeurons) derived from iPS (induced pluripotent stem cells) from carriers of both haplotypes. We identified that iNeurons of the H1 homozygous haplotype showed an increased susceptibility to MCOS compared to homozygous H2 carriers, leading to cell death through ferroptosis. We performed a cellular screen in H1 iNeurons using a FDA-approved Drug Library and identified candidate molecules that rescued the increased susceptibility to MCOS and prevented ferroptosis in H1 iNeurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimization of modularity during development to simplify walking control across strides</a></h4>

              
                Walking in adults seems to rely on a small number of modules allowing to reduce the number of degrees of freedom effectively regulated by the central nervous system (CNS). However, the extent to which modularity evolves during development remains unknown, particularly regarding the ability to generate several strides in an optimized manner. Here we compared the modular organization of toddlers and adults during several strides of walking. We recorded the electromyographic activity of 10 bilateral (lower limbs) muscles in adults (n=12) and toddlers (n=12) during 8 gait cycles, and used non-negative matrix factorization to model the underlying modular command. While the muscular activity of all strides could be factorized into a consistent low-dimensional modular organization in adults, significantly more computational modules were needed in toddlers to account for their greater stride-by-stride variability. Activations of these modules varied more across strides and was less parsimonious in toddlers than in adults, even when balances constrained were diminished. These findings suggest that the modular control of locomotion of adults evolves as the organism develops and practices. They also suggest that new walker can flexibly activate a higher number of modules and benefit from a higher space of possible action, which could serve motor exploration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rac1, Rac3 GTPases and TPC2 are required for axonal outgrowth and migration of cortical interneurons.</a></h4>

              
                Rho GTPases, among them Rac1 and Rac3, are major transducers of extracellular signals and are involved in multiple cellular processes. In cortical interneurons, the neurons that control excitation/inhibition balance of cortical circuits, Rac1 and Rac3 are essential for their development. Ablation of both, leads to a severe reduction in the numbers of mature interneurons found in the murine cortex, which is partially due to abnormal cell cycle progression of interneuron precursors and defective formation of their growth cones. Here we present new evidence that upon Rac1 and Rac3 ablation, centrosome, Golgi complex and lysosome positioning are significantly perturbed, thus affecting both interneuron migration and axon growth. Moreover, for the first time we provide evidence of altered expression and localization of the two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) voltage-gated ion channel that mediates Ca2+ release. Pharmacological inhibition of TPC2 negatively affected axonal growth and migration of interneurons. Our data taken together suggest that TPC2 contributes to the severe phenotype in axon growth initiation, extension and interneuron migration in the absence of Rac1 and Rac3.

	<p>Robot-aided rehabilitation (RAR) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are the two main interventions for post-stroke rehabilitation. The efficacy of both approaches in combination has not been well established yet. The importance of coupling these interventions, which both enhance brain plasticity to promote recovery, lies in augmenting the rehabilitation potential to constrain the limitation in daily living activities and the quality of life following stroke. This review aimed to evaluate the evidence of NIBS coupled with RAR in improving rehabilitation outcomes of upper limb and gait motor impairment in adult individuals with stroke. We included 18 clinical trials in this review. All studies were highly heterogeneous concerning the technical characteristics of robotic devices and NIBS protocols. However, the studies reported a global improvement in body structure and function and activity limitation for the upper limb, which were non-significant between the active and control groups. Concerning gait training protocols, the active group outperformed the control group in improving walking capacity and recovery. According to this review, NIBS and RAR in combination are promising but not yet largely recommendable as a systematic approach for stroke rehabilitation as there is not enough data about this. Therefore, more homogenous clinical trials are required, pointing out the best characteristics of the combined therapeutic protocols.</p>

	<p>In this work, we aim to identify sensitive neurophysiological biomarkers of axonal degeneration in CIDP patients. A total of 16 CIDP patients, fulfilling the clinical and neurophysiological criteria for typical CIDP, treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (ScIg) (0.4 g/kg/week) were evaluated at baseline (before ScIg treatment) and after long-term treatment with ScIg (24 months) by clinical assessment scales, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG). Conventional and non-conventional neurophysiological parameters: motor unit potential (MUP) analysis, MUP thickness and size index (SI)] and interference pattern (IP) features were evaluated after long-term treatment (24 months) and compared with a population of 16 healthy controls (HC). An increase of distal motor latency (DML) and reduced compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude and area in CIDP patients suggest axonal damage of motor fibers, together with a significant increase of MUP amplitude, duration and area. Analysis of non-conventional MUP parameters shows no difference for MUP thickness; however, in CIDP patients, SI is increased and IP area and amplitude values are lower than HC. Despite clinical and neurophysiological improvement after ScIg treatment, neurophysiological analysis revealed axonal degeneration of motor fibers and motor unit remodeling. Correlation analysis shows that the axonal degeneration process is related to the diagnostic and therapeutic delay. MUP area and SI parameters can detect early signs of axonal degeneration, and their introduction in clinical practice may help to identify patients with the worst outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modular cell type organization of cortical areas revealed by in situ sequencing</a></h4>

              
                The cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture 1-3, connectivity4,5, and neuronal activity 6-10, are wired into modular networks4,5,11. However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 107 cell type marker genes in 1.2 million cells over a mouse forebrain hemisphere at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies12,13. Within medium-grained cell types that are shared across all cortical areas, gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas. The compositions of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. We grouped cortical areas into modules so that areas within a module, but not across modules, had similar compositions of transcriptomic types. Strikingly, these modules match cortical subnetworks that are highly interconnected 4,5,11, suggesting that cortical areas that are similar in cell types are also wired together. This "wire-by-similarity" rule reflects a novel organizing principle for the connectivity of cortical areas. Our BARseq-based strategy is high-throughput and low-cost, and scaling up this approach to many animals can potentially reveal the brain-wide molecular architecture across individuals, developmental times, and disease models.

                Variation in cortical cytoarchitecture is the basis for histology-based definition of cortical areas, such as Brodmann areas. Single cell transcriptomics enables higher-resolution characterization of cell types in human cortex, which we used to revisit the idea of the canonical cortical microcircuit and to understand functional areal specialization. Deeply sampled single nucleus RNA-sequencing of eight cortical areas spanning cortical structural variation showed highly consistent cellular makeup for 24 coarse cell subclasses. However, proportions of excitatory neuron subclasses varied strikingly, reflecting differences in intra- and extracortical connectivity across primary sensorimotor and association cortices. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also showed differences in laminar organization across areas. Primary visual cortex showed dramatically different organization, including major differences in the ratios of excitatory to inhibitory neurons, expansion of layer 4 excitatory neuron types and specialized inhibitory neurons. Finally, gene expression variation in conserved neuron subclasses predicts differences in synaptic function across areas. Together these results provide a refined cellular and molecular characterization of human cortical cytoarchitecture that reflects functional connectivity and predicts areal specialization.

                The discovery that DA transients can be mapped onto the reward prediction errors in temporal difference models is a pinnacle achievement of neuroscience. Yet, there is abundant evidence that DA activity reinforces actions, suggesting it serves as an intrinsically rewarding event. These two possibilities are so conceptually intertwined that it is not surprising that they have been so far experimentally conflated. Here, using computational modeling, behavioural blocking and optogenetics, we show that stimulating VTA DA neurons promotes learning even when a natural reward and DA stimulation are held constant across the learning phases of blocking. These findings provide strong evidence in favour of the prediction error hypothesis rather than encoding the rewarding value of appetitive events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrative single-cell characterization of hypothalamus sex-differential and obesity-associated genes and regulatory elements</a></h4>

              
                Over 500 noncoding genomic loci are associated with obesity. The majority of these loci reside near genes that are expressed in the hypothalamus in specific neuronal subpopulations that regulate food intake, hindering the ability to identify and functionally characterize them. Here, we carried out integrative single-cell analysis (RNA/ATAC-seq) on both mouse and human male and female hypothalamus to characterize genes and regulatory elements in specific cell subpopulations. Utilizing both transcriptome and regulome data, we identify over 30 different neuronal and non-neuronal cell subpopulations and a shared core of transcription factors that regulate cell cluster-specific genes between mice and humans. We characterize several sex-specific differentially expressed genes and the regulatory elements that control them in specific cell subpopulations. Overlapping cell-specific scATAC peaks with obesity-associated GWAS variants, identifies potential obesity-associated regulatory elements. Using reporter assays and CRISPR editing, we show that many of these sequences, including the top obesity-associated loci (FTO and MC4R), are functional enhancers whose activity is altered due to the obesity-associated variant and regulate known obesity genes. Combined, our work provides a catalog of genes and regulatory elements in hypothalamus cell subpopulations and uses obesity to showcase how integrative single-cell sequencing can identify functional variants associated with hypothalamus-related phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel antidepressant acting via allosteric inhibition of GluN2D-incorporated NMDA receptors at GABAergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated calcium-permeable excitatory channels. They have attracted great interest as potential targets for the treatment of depression in recent years. NMDARs typically assemble as heterotetramers composed of two GluN1 and two alternative GluN2 (2A-2D) subunits, the latter of which endow various subtypes with diverse gating and pharmacological properties. To date, limited molecules with GluN2 specificity have been identified to show antidepressant effects. Here, we identify a compound termed YY-23 extracted from Rhizoma Anemarrhenae allosterically inhibited the channel activities of GluN2C- or GluN2D-incorporated NMDARs, an effect that was presumably influenced by the S2 segment in the ligand-binding domain of the GluN2 subunit. We found that prefrontal GluN2D-containing NMDARs were predominantly expressed at GABAergic interneurons rather than pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we revealed that YY-23 suppressed the activity of GluN2D-containing NMDARs and GABAergic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). As a consequence, this GABAergic disinhibition facilitated the excitatory transmission. Behavioural experiments showed that YY-23 acted as a rapid antidepressant in both stress-naive and stressed animal models, which was abolished in Grin2d-knockout mice. Together, our findings suggest that GluN2D-incorporated NMDARs on GABAergic interneurons might be promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of depression.

                Neural entrainment to musical rhythm is thought to underlie the perception and production of music. In aging populations, the strength of neural entrainment to rhythm has been found to be attenuated, particularly during attentive listening to auditory streams. However, previous studies on neural entrainment to rhythm and aging have often employed artificial auditory rhythms or limited pieces of recorded, naturalistic music, failing to account for the diversity of rhythmic structures found in natural music. As part of larger project assessing a novel music-based intervention for healthy aging, we investigated neural entrainment to musical rhythms in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened to self-selected musical recordings across a sample of younger and older adults. We specifically measured neural entrainment to the level of musical pulse--quantified here as the phase-locking value (PLV)--after normalizing the PLVs to each musical recordings detected pulse frequency. As predicted, we observed strong neural phase-locking to musical pulse, and to the sub-harmonic and harmonic levels of musical meter. Overall, PLVs were not significantly different between older and younger adults. This preserved neural entrainment to musical pulse and rhythm could support the design of music-based interventions that aim to modulate endogenous brain activity via self-selected music for healthy cognitive aging.

                Two-photon microscopy can resolve fluorescence dynamics deep in scattering tissue, but applying this technique in vivo is limited by short working distance water-immersion objectives. Here we present an ultra long working distance (20 mm) air objective called the Cousa objective. It is optimized for performance across multiphoton imaging wavelengths, offers a >4 mm2 FOV with submicron lateral resolution, and is compatible with commonly used multiphoton imaging systems. We share the full optical prescription, along with data on real world performance including in vivo calcium imaging in a range of species and approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic Interneurons Drive Motivation by Promoting Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Motivation to work for potential rewards is critically dependent on dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). DA release from NAc axons can be controlled by at least two distinct mechanisms: 1) action potentials propagating from DA cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and 2) activation of {beta}2* nicotinic receptors by local cholinergic interneurons (CINs). How CIN activity contributes to NAc DA dynamics in behaving animals remains unclear. We monitored DA release in the NAc Core of awake, unrestrained rats while simultaneously monitoring or manipulating CIN activity at the same location. CIN stimulation rapidly evoked DA release, and in contrast to slice preparations, this DA release showed no indication of short-term depression or receptor desensitization. The sound of food delivery evoked a brief joint increase in CIN population activity and DA release, with a second joint increase as rats approached the food. In an operant task, we observed fast ramps in CIN activity during approach behaviors, either to start the trial or to collect rewards. These CIN ramps co-occurred with DA release ramps, without corresponding changes in the firing of VTA DA neurons. Finally, we examined the effects of blocking CIN influence over DA release through local NAc infusion of DH{beta}E, a selective antagonist of [Formula] nicotinic receptors. DH{beta}E dose-dependently interfered with motivated approach decisions, mimicking the effects of a DA antagonist. Our results support a key influence of CINs over motivated behavior via the local regulation of DA release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of the cerebellum in learning to predict reward: evidence from cerebellar ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings in animals have challenged the traditional view of the cerebellum solely as the site of motor control, suggesting that the cerebellum may also be important for learning to predict reward from trial-and-error feedback. Yet, evidence for the role of the cerebellum in reward learning in humans is lacking. Moreover, open questions remain about which specific aspects of reward learning the cerebellum may contribute to. Here we address this gap through an investigation of multiple forms of reward learning in individuals with cerebellum dysfunction, represented by cerebellar ataxia cases. Nineteen participants with cerebellar ataxia and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed two separate tasks that required learning about reward contingencies from trial-and-error. To probe the selectivity of reward learning processes, the tasks differed in their underlying structure: while one task measured incremental reward learning ability alone, the other allowed participants to use an alternative learning strategy based on episodic memory alongside incremental reward learning. We found that individuals with cerebellar ataxia were profoundly impaired at reward learning from trial-and-error feedback on both tasks, but retained the ability to learn to predict reward based on episodic memory. These findings provide evidence from humans for a specific and necessary role for the cerebellum in incremental learning of reward associations based on reinforcement. More broadly, the findings suggest that alongside its role in motor learning, the cerebellum likely operates in concert with the basal ganglia to support reinforcement learning from reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral detectability of optogenetic stimulation of inferior temporal cortex varies with the size of concurrently viewed objects.</a></h4>

              
                We have previously demonstrated that macaque monkeys can behaviorally detect a subtle optogenetic impulse delivered to their inferior temporal (IT) cortex. We have also shown that the ability to detect the cortical stimulation impulse varies depending on some characteristics of the visual images viewed at the time of brain stimulation, revealing the visual nature of the perceptual events induced by stimulation of the IT cortex. Here we systematically studied the effect of the size of viewed objects on behavioral detectability of optogenetic stimulation of the central IT cortex. Surprisingly, we found that behavioral detection of the same optogenetic impulse highly varies with the size of the viewed object images. Reduction of the object size in four steps from 8 to 1 degree of visual angle significantly decreased detection performance. These results show that identical stimulation impulses delivered to the same neural population induce variable perceptual events depending on the mere size of the objects viewed at the time of brain stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Express visuomotor responses reflect knowledge of both target location and conscious intent during reaches of different amplitudes</a></h4>

              
                When humans reach to visual targets, extremely rapid (~90 ms) bursts of activity can be observed on task-relevant proximal muscles. Such express visuomotor responses are inflexibly locked in time and space to the target and have been proposed to reflect rapid visuomotor transformations conveyed subcortically via the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway. Previously, we showed that express visuomotor responses are sensitive to explicit cue-driven information about the target, suggesting that the express pathway can be modulated by cortical signals affording contextual pre-stimulus expectations. Here, we show that the express visuomotor system incorporates information about the veridical target-directed reaching metrics and contextual instructions during visuospatial tasks requiring different movement amplitudes. In one experiment, we recorded the activity from two shoulder muscles as participants reached toward targets that appeared at different distances. Longer hand-to-target distances led to larger and more prevalent express visuomotor responses than short-reach targets. This suggests that both the direction and distance of veridical hand-to-target reaches are encoded along the putative subcortical express pathway. In a second experiment, we modulated the movement amplitude by asking the participants to deliberately undershoot, overshoot, or stop (control) at the target. The overshoot and undershoot tasks impaired the generation of large and frequent express visuomotor responses, consistent with the inability of the express pathway to generate responses directed toward non-veridical targets (e.g. anti-reach tasks). Our findings appear to reflect strategic, cortically-driven modulation of the express visuomotor circuit to facilitate rapid and effective response initiation during target-directed actions.

	<p>The application of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) analysis to study the central mechanism of migraine has been limited. Furthermore, little is known about inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) alterations during resting state in female patients with migraine. This study aimed to investigate potential interictal VMHC impairments in migraine without aura (MwoA) patients and the relationship between connectivity alterations and clinical parameters. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and clinical information were acquired from 43 female MwoA patients and 43 matched healthy controls. VMHC analysis was used to compare differences between these two groups, and brain regions showing significant differences were chosen as a mask to perform a seed-based FC group comparison. Subsequent correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between abnormal inter-hemispheric FC and clinical data. Compared with healthy controls, female MwoA patients revealed significantly decreased VMHC in the bilateral cerebellum; cuneus; and lingual, middle occipital, precentral and postcentral gyri. Seed-based FC analysis indicated disrupted intrinsic connectivity in the cerebellum, and default mode, visual and sensorimotor network. These VMHC and FC abnormalities were negatively correlated with clinical indexes including duration of disease, migraine days and visual analogue scale. These inter-hemispheric FC impairments and correlations between abnormal VMHC and FC and clinical scores may improve our understanding of the central mechanism of female-specific migraine.</p>

	<p>This research focused on the development of an astrocyte cell model system (C6 glioma) for the assessment of molecular changes in response to cathodic passively balanced pulsed electrical stimulation at a rate of 50 Hz (60 &amp;amp;micro;s duration, 0.15 mA intensity). Cells treated with selected neurotransmitters (glutamate, adenosine, D-serine, and &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid) were monitored (using specific fluorescent probes) for changes in levels of intracellular nitric oxide, calcium ions, and/or chloride. ES exerted an inhibitory effect on NO, increased calcium and had no effect on chloride. Using this model, cells can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively for changes and these changes can be correlated with the putative molecular effects that electrical stimulation has on astrocytes and their role in glia-mediated diseases. This model system allows for faster and cheaper experiments than those involving animal models due to the potential to easily vary the conditions, reduce the number of variables (especially problematic in animal models), and closely monitor the cellular effects.</p>

	<p>Acoustic stimulation during sleep is believed to enhance slow waves, which are critical to memory consolidation. However, clinical trials of acoustic stimulation have yielded mixed results concerning its effectiveness in improving human memory. A few studies have implied that acoustic stimulation ameliorates the pathology of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) in mice with normal sleep. Here, we explored the effect of acoustic stimulation on 3xTgAD mice suffering from chronic sleep deprivation, as these data may shed light on the potential use of acoustic stimulation in AD patients with insomnia. Methods: Twenty-four 8-month-old 3xTgAD mice were randomly and equally divided into three groups: the normal sleep group (S group), the sleep deprivation group (SD group), and the acoustic stimulation group (AS group). During a 14-day sleep intervention, the SD and AS groups received 6 h of sleep deprivation per day, and the AS group also received acoustic stimulation in the dark phase. Then, the mice underwent Morris water maze (MWM) tests and arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and were sacrificed for pathological evaluation. Results: The three groups showed similar stress levels. The S and AS groups exhibited better spatial memory, better brain perfusion, and milder amyloid &amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) and tau pathology than the SD group, although no significant discrepancies were found between the S and AS groups. Conclusion: Acoustic stimulation may exert a protective effect in 3xTgAD mice by improving spatial memory, enhancing the blood supply of the brain, and reversing the contribution of chronic sleep deprivation to A&amp;amp;beta; and tau pathology to mimic the effect of normal sleep patterns.</p>

	<p>In this study, we observed the sex differences in functional brain activity in patients with recurrent depressive disorder (RDE) and assessed the correlation between abnormal functional brain activity changes and clinical symptoms. A total of 40 patients with RDE (19 male and 21 female) and 42 healthy controls (HCs) (20 male and 22 female) met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of images using regional homogeneity (ReHo) and further analysis of the correlation between abnormal brain areas and clinical symptoms of the different sexes with RDE groups were carried out. For the main effects of sex (male vs. female), there were statistically significant differences in ReHo among the four groups in the right middle temporal gyrus, right thalamus, and left posterior cerebellar lobe. For the effects of the sex-by-group interaction, there were statistically significant differences in ReHo among the four groups in the left middle frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and right insula. Post hoc analyses showed that compared with the female RDE group, the male RDE group had decreased ReHo in the left middle frontal gyrus and right insula. In the female RDE group, the ReHo values of the left middle frontal gyrus were positively correlated with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) scores. This study provides new insights into the clinical targeting of different sexes for RDE.</p>

	<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a central nervous system disease with high mortality and morbidity. Some independent factors valuable for prognosis prediction in patients with SAH are still lacking. In our earlier study, we found that PDK4 exerts a protective effect after SAH, primarily by reducing oxidative stress and neuronal death via the ROS/ASK1/p38 signaling pathway. Therefore, we investigated the changes in the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and analyzed the value of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PDK4 level in predicting the prognoses of patients with SAH after interventional embolization surgery. Some knee arthritis subjects who needed surgery were recruited as a control group. The results showed that PDK4 expression was elevated in the CSF of SAH patients compared with that of controls. PDK4 levels in CSF (OR = 4.525; 95% CI: 1.135&amp;amp;ndash;18.038; p = 0.032), time to surgery (OR = 0.795; 95% CI: 0.646&amp;amp;ndash;0.977; p = 0.029), and initial GCS scores (OR = 2.758; 95% CI: 0.177&amp;amp;ndash;43.106; p = 0.469) were independent prognostic risk factors for SAH patients after surgery. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed PDK4 levels in CSF had a higher predictive value. Thus, PDK4 in CSF could be an independent prognostic risk factor for SAH patients after surgery. PDK4 has the potential to serve as a new therapeutic target and biomarker for use in the diagnosis of SAH severity and the prediction of recovery.</p>

	<p>The growing number of depressive people and the overload in primary care services make it necessary to identify depressive states with easily accessible biomarkers such as mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Some studies have addressed this issue by collecting and analyzing EEG resting state in a search of appropriate features and classification methods. Traditionally, EEG resting state classification methods for depression were mainly based on linear or a combination of linear and non-linear features. We hypothesize that participants with ongoing depressive states differ from controls in complex patterns of brain dynamics that can be captured in EEG resting state data, using only nonlinear measures on a few electrodes, making it possible to develop cheap and wearable devices that could be even monitored through smartphones. To validate such a perspective, a resting-state EEG study was conducted with 50 participants, half with depressive state (DEP) and half controls (CTL). A data-driven approach was applied to select the most appropriate time window and electrodes for the EEG analyses, as suggested by Giacometti&amp;amp;#8288;, as well as the most efficient nonlinear features and classifiers, to distinguish between CTL and DEP participants. Nonlinear features showing temporo-spatial and spectral complexity were selected. The results confirmed that computing nonlinear features from a few selected electrodes in a 15 s time window are sufficient to classify DEP and CTL participants accurately. Finally, after training and testing internally the classifier, the trained machine was applied to EEG resting state data (CTL and DEP) from a publicly available database, validating the capacity of generalization of the classifier with data from different equipment, population, and environment obtaining an accuracy near 100%.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tobacco smoking and overweight lead to adverse health effects, which remain an important public health problem worldwide. Researches indicate overlapping pathophysiology may contribute to tobacco use disorder (TUD) and overweight, but the neurobiological interaction mechanism between the two factors is still unclear. This study used a mixed sample design, including the following four groups: (i) overweight long-term smokers (<i>n</i> = 24, age = 31.80 ± 5.70, cigarettes/day = 20.50 ± 7.89); (ii) normal weight smokers (<i>n</i> = 28, age = 31.29 ± 5.56, cigarettes/day = 16.11 ± 8.35); (iii) overweight nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 19, age = 33.05 ± 5.60), and (iv) normal weight nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 28, age = 31.68 ± 6.57), a total of 99 male subjects. All subjects underwent T1-weighted high-resolution MRI. We used voxel-based morphometry to compare gray matter volume (GMV) among the four groups. Then, JuSpace toolbox was used for cross-modal correlations of MRI-based modalities with nuclear imaging derived estimates, to examine specific neurotransmitter system changes underlying the two factors. Our results illustrate a significant antagonistic interaction between TUD and weight status in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and a quadratic effect of BMI on DLPFC GMV. For main effect of TUD, long-term smokers were associated with greater GMV in bilateral OFC compared with nonsmokers irrespective of weight status, and such alteration is negatively associated with pack-year and FTND scores. Furthermore, we also found GMV changes related to TUD and overweight are associated with μ-opioid receptor system and TUD-related GMV alterations are associated with noradrenaline transporter maps. This study sheds light on novel multimodal neuromechanistic about the relationship between TUD and overweight, which possibly provides hints into future treatment for the special population of comorbid TUD and overweight.</p>

                <p>Infantile striatonigral degeneration is caused by a homozygous variant of the nuclear-pore complex (NPC) gene <i>NUP62</i>, involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. By querying sequencing-datasets of patients with dystonia and/or Leigh(-like) syndromes, we identified three unrelated individuals with biallelic variants in <i>NUP54</i>. All variants clustered in the C-terminal protein region that interacts with NUP62. Associated phenotypes were similar to those of <i>NUP62</i>-related disease, including early-onset dystonia with dysphagia, choreoathetosis, and T2-hyperintense lesions in striatum. <i>In-silico</i> and protein-biochemical studies gave further evidence for the argument that the variants were pathogenic. We expand the spectrum of NPC component-associated dystonic conditions with localized basal-ganglia abnormalities.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assessing pupil size as an index of activation of subcortical ascending arousal system nuclei during rest</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory nuclei that are part of the ascending arousal system (AAS) play a crucial role in regulating cortical state and optimizing task performance. Pupil diameter, under constant luminance conditions, is increasingly used as an index of activity of these AAS nuclei. Indeed, task-based functional imaging studies in humans have begun to provide evidence of stimulus-driven pupil-AAS coupling. However, whether there is such a tight pupil-AAS coupling during rest is not clear. To address this question, we examined simultaneously acquired resting-state fMRI and pupil-size data from 74 participants, focusing on six AAS nuclei: the locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and cholinergic basal forebrain. Activation in all six AAS nuclei was optimally correlated with pupil size at 0- to 2-second lags, suggesting that spontaneous pupil changes were almost immediately followed by corresponding BOLD-signal changes in the AAS. These results suggest that spontaneous changes in pupil size that occur during states of rest can be used as a noninvasive general index of activity in AAS nuclei. Importantly, the nature of pupil-AAS coupling during rest appears to be vastly different from the relatively slow canonical hemodynamic response function that has been used to characterize task-related pupil-AAS coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Methadone alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation in human cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women has become an epidemic in the United States. Pharmacological interventions for OUD involve methadone, a synthetic opioid analgesic that attenuates withdrawal symptoms and behaviors linked with maternal drug addiction. However, methadone's ability to readily accumulate in neural tissue, and cause long-term neurocognitive sequelae, has led to concerns regarding its effect on prenatal brain development. We took advantage of human cortical organoid (hCO) technology to probe how this drug impacts the earliest mechanisms giving rise to the cerebral cortex. To this end, we conducted bulk mRNA sequencing of 2-month-old hCOs derived from two cell lines that were chronically treated with a clinically relevant dose of 1M methadone for 50 days. Differential expression and gene ontology analyses revealed a robust transcriptional response to methadone associated with functional components of the synapse, the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and cilia. Further unsupervised co-expression network and predictive protein-protein interaction analyses demonstrated that these changes occurred in concert, centered around a regulatory axis consisting of growth factors, developmental signaling pathways, and matricellular proteins. Our results demonstrate that exposure to methadone during early cortico-genesis fundamentally alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation, and that these changes arise by modulating extra-synaptic molecular mechanisms in the ECM and cilia. These findings provide novel insight into methadone's putative effect on cognitive and behavioral development and a basis for improving interventions for maternal opioid addiction.

However, how lifelong musical expertise affects the functional reorganization of older brain in speech-in-noise perception has not yet been systematically investigated. Here, we address this issue by analyzing fMRI responses of older musicians, older non-musicians and, young non-musicians identifying noise-masked audiovisual syllables. First, we confirmed that older musicians outperformed older non-musicians and even equaled young non-musicians. Then, we showed that both older groups showed decreased auditory activation and increased visual activation compared to young non-musicians, while older musicians showed higher activation in speech motor regions and greater deactivation of default mode network (DMN) regions than older non-musicians. Next, we revealed that musical expertise counteracted the age-related neural dedifferentiation of speech representation, making older musicians exhibit higher neural alignment-to-young in bilateral sensorimotor areas. Finally, we disentangled that greater activation in speech motor areas and stronger deactivation in DMN regions were correlated with higher neural alignment in sensorimotor areas, which strongly predicted better performance in older adults. Together, long-term musical expertise mitigates age-related deficits in audiovisual speech-in-noise processing through enhanced compensatory scaffolding that reserves youth-like representation in sensorimotor areas. Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective on understanding age- and experience-related brain reorganization during speech perception.

                The inferior colliculus (IC) is an information processing hub that receives widespread 25 convergent projections. It contains two non-lemniscal divisions - the dorsal (DC) and lateral (LC) 26 cortices - that receive major cortical and multisensory projections. The LC in particular has 27 repeated molecular motifs that govern its input-output relationships. However, because the LC 28 is buried deep within a sulcus, it has been impossible to study by imaging, and thus difficult to 29 answer questions about its functional organization. Here, we couple two-photon microscopy with use of a microprism to reveal the first-ever sagittal views containing functional maps of the LC with cellular resolution. We used this novel approach to examine neuronal responses with respect to LC motifs, and demonstrate the LC is functionally distinct from DC. This method will not only provide new insights about the auditory system, but will also permit imaging of hidden brain regions previously un-imageable by conventional means.

                Cognition and attention arise from the adaptive coordination of neural systems in response to external and internal demands. The low-dimensional latent subspace that underlies large-scale neural dynamics and the relationships of these dynamics to cognitive and attentional states, however, are unknown. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging as human participants performed attention tasks, watched comedy sitcom episodes and an educational documentary, and rested. Whole-brain dynamics traversed a common set of latent states that spanned canonical gradients of functional brain organization, with global synchrony among functional networks modulating state transitions. Neural state dynamics were synchronized across people during engaging movie watching and aligned to narrative event structures. Neural state dynamics reflected attention fluctuations such that different states indicated engaged attention in task and naturalistic contexts whereas a common state indicated attention lapses in both contexts. Together, these results demonstrate that traversals along large-scale gradients of human brain organization reflect cognitive and attentional dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meta-analytic evidence for a novel hierarchical model of conceptual processing</a></h4>

              
                Conceptual knowledge plays a pivotal role in human cognition. Grounded cognition theories propose that concepts consist of perceptual-motor features represented in modality-specific perceptual-motor cortices. However, it is unclear whether conceptual processing consistently engages modality-specific areas. Here, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis across 212 neuroimaging experiments on conceptual processing related to 7 perceptual-motor modalities (action, sound, visual shape, motion, color, olfaction-gustation, and emotion). We found that conceptual processing consistently engages brain regions also activated during real perceptual-motor experience of the same modalities. In addition, we identified multimodal convergence zones that are recruited for multiple modalities. In particular, the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) are engaged for three modalities: action, motion, and sound. These "trimodal" regions are surrounded by "bimodal" regions engaged for two modalities. Our findings support a novel model of the conceptual system, according to which conceptual processing relies on a hierarchical neural architecture from modality-specific to multimodal areas up to an amodal hub.

                Objective: Based on network pharmacology, the response of Qing-tong-hua-yu Decoction (QTHY) to the regulation of EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was discussed and the possible mechanism of the protective effect of QTHY on the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was studied. Methods: A compound-target disease-function-pathway network was established and analyzed based on the network pharmacology approach used in Chinese medicine. The correlation, which is between effect of the components of QTHY Decoction against CI/RI with EGFR/MAPK signalling cascade response, was observed. And then the degree of neurological deficits in each group was assessed after cerebral ischemia for 2 hours and reperfusion for 3 hours, 24 hours, 3 days and 7 days. Expression levels of EGFR and p44/42MAPK in ischemic brain tissue at different time points in various groups of rats were tested by Western bolt (WB), real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Network pharmacology analysis revealed that QTHY-mediated treatment involved 439 key targets, in which the effect of QTHY groups against CI/RI was associated with EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade. QTHY treatment reduced neurological deficit scores and improved ischemic changes in rats. In addition, QTHY promoted EGFR and p44/42MAPK expression in the SVZ through the EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade, with varying degrees of improvement at different time points. Conclusion: QTHY can better improve cerebral ischemia injury in CI / RI rats and exert the neuroprotective effect of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. This may be related to the potential of QTHY to activate the EGFR / MAPK signaling cascade, which is consistent with the results of network pharmacology analysis.

                Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition leading to significant distress and poor quality of life. Successful treatment of OCD is restricted by the limited knowledge about its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of OCD using electroencephalographic (EEG) event related potentials (ERP), elicited from multiple tasks to characterise disorder-related differences in underlying brain activity across multiple neural processes. Methods: ERP data were obtained from 25 OCD patients and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) by recording EEG during Flanker and Go/Nogo tasks. Error-related negativity (ERN) was elicited by the Flanker task, while N200 and P300 were generated using the Go/Nogo task. Primary comparisons of the neural response amplitudes and the topographical distribution of neural activity were conducted using scalp field differences across all time points and electrodes. Results: Compared to HC, the OCD group showed altered ERP distributions. Contrasting with the previous literature on ERN and N200 topographies in OCD where fronto-central negative voltages were reported, we detected positive voltages. Additionally, the P300 was found to be less negative in the frontal regions. None of these ERP findings were associated with OCD symptom severity. Conclusions: These results indicate that individuals with OCD show altered frontal neural activity across multiple executive function related processes, supporting the frontal dysfunction theory of OCD. Furthermore, due to the lack of association between altered ERPs and OCD symptom severity, they may be considered potential candidate endophenotypes for OCD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peptidergic modulation of motor neuron output via CART signaling at C bouton synapses</a></h4>

              
                The intensity of muscle contraction, and therefore movement vigour, needs to be adaptable to enable complex motor behaviors. This can be achieved by adjusting the properties of motor neurons, which form the final common pathway for all motor output from the central nervous system. Here we identify novel roles for a neuropeptide, Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript (CART), in the control of movement vigour. We reveal distinct, but parallel mechanisms by which CART and acetylcholine, both released at C bouton synapses on motor neurons, selectively amplify the output of subtypes of motor neurons that are recruited during intense movement. We find that mice with broad genetic deletion of CART or selective elimination of acetylcholine from C boutons exhibit deficits in behavioral tasks that require higher levels of motor output. Overall, these data uncover novel spinal modulatory mechanisms that control movement vigour to support movements that require a high degree of muscle force.

                Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition with several major hallmarks, including loss of substantia nigra neurons, reduction in striatal dopaminergic function, and formation of alpha-synuclein-rich Lewy bodies. Mutations in SNCA, encoding for alpha-synuclein, are a known cause of familial PD, and the G51D mutation causes a particularly aggressive form of the condition. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to introduce the G51D mutation into the endogenous rat SNCA gene. SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats were born in Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit any severe behavourial defects. L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluorophenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was used to investigate this novel rat model. Wild-type (WT), SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats were characterised over the course of ageing (5, 11, and 16 months old) using 18F-DOPA PET imaging and kinetic modelling. We measured the influx rate constant (Ki) and effective distribution volume ratio (EDVR) of 18F-DOPA in the striatum relative to the cerebellum in WT, SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats. A significant reduction in EDVR was observed in SNCAG51D/G51D rats at 16 months of age indicative of increased dopamine turnover. Furthermore, we observed a significant asymmetry in EDVR between the left and right striatum in aged SNCAG51D/G51D rats. The increased and asymmetric dopamine turnover observed in the striatum of aged SNCAG51D/G51D rats is similar to prodromal PD, which suggests the presence of compensatory mechanisms. SNCAG51D rats represent a novel genetic model of PD, and kinetic modelling of 18F-DOPA PET data has identified a highly relevant early disease phenotype.

	<p>Dysregulation of high-frequency neuronal oscillations has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Chronic methamphetamine (METH) use can induce psychosis similar to paranoid schizophrenia. The current study in mice aimed to determine the effect of chronic METH treatment on ongoing and evoked neuronal oscillations. C57BL/6 mice were treated with METH or vehicle control for three weeks and implanted with extradural recording electrodes. Two weeks after the last METH injection, mice underwent three EEG recording sessions to measure ongoing and auditory-evoked gamma and beta oscillatory power in response to an acute challenge with METH (2 mg/kg), the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg), or saline control. A separate group of mice pretreated with METH showed significantly greater locomotor hyperactivity to an acute METH challenge, confirming long-term sensitisation. Chronic METH did not affect ongoing or evoked gamma or beta power. Acute MK-801 challenge reduced ongoing beta power whereas acute METH challenge significantly increased ongoing gamma power. Both MK-801 and METH challenge suppressed evoked gamma power. Chronic METH treatment did not modulate these acute drug effects. There were minor effects of chronic METH and acute METH and MK-801 on selected components of event-related potential (ERP) waves. In conclusion, chronic METH treatment did not exert neuroplastic effects on the regulation of cortical gamma oscillations in a manner consistent with schizophrenia, despite causing behavioural sensitisation.</p>

	<p>Globally, stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. The classification of motor intentions using brain activity is an important task in the rehabilitation of stroke patients using brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs). This paper presents a new method for model training in EEG-based BCI rehabilitation by using overlapping time windows. For this aim, three different models, a convolutional neural network (CNN), graph isomorphism network (GIN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are used for performing the classification task of motor attempt (MA). We conducted several experiments with different time window lengths, and the results showed that the deep learning approach based on overlapping time windows achieved improvements in classification accuracy, with the LSTM combined vote-counting strategy (VS) having achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 90.3% when the window size was 70. The results verified that the overlapping time window strategy is useful for increasing the efficiency of BCI rehabilitation.</p>

                Background: Anemia is a global public health problem, including Indonesia with 32% of adolescents are anemic. This study aims to process porang flour, moringa leaves, and tempe into cookies that are high in iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and antioxidants as potential functional food snacks for adolescents with anemia. Methods: This study is experimental with a completely randomized trial design (CRD) with three treatments and replications. There are three comparison formulations of a combination of porang, moringa leaves, and black soybean-based tempe; respectively F1 (91:3:3:3)%, F2 (85:3:6:6)%, and F3 (77:3:10:10)%. The cookie sample was then analyzed for water content, ash, iron, folic acid, cobalt, and antioxidant activity. The differences between the samples were analyzed based on the activity of antioxidants, iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in data obtained from triplicates using multivariate ANOVA analysis. Results: The results of the ash and water content tests of all three cookie formulations showed values in accordance with the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) for cookie products. F3 has significantly higher iron, folic acid, and cobalt levels than F1 and F2 (p<0.05). Antioxidant activity is highest in F3, but there is no statistical difference between F2 and F3 (p>0.05). Conclusions: The combination of porang's tubers, moringa leaves, and tempe made from black soybeans, especially F3, has the potential to be used as a functional cookie processed product source of iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin, and antioxidants for adolescent anemia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What is the association between common medications (indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen) and spontaneous intestinal perforations in premature infants? A systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) affects very low birth weight preterm neonates and accounts for 44% of gastrointestinal perforations. Commonly used medications such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen for PDA closure, increases the risk of intestinal perforation. Unfortunately, the majority of the data combine SIP with those affected by necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) despite them being separate entities. This systematic review aims to explore the association between the use of common medications and SIP in the premature infant cohort independently from NEC. Methods: Our study will focus on preterm infants with exposure to either indomethacin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen where SIP is a reported outcome. A health science librarian will search Medline and Medline in Process via OVID, Embase Classic + Embase via OVID, the LILACS database, the ScIELO database and the Cochrane Library including EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Search dates for each database will be from their respective dates of inception to March 2022. All articles will undergo screening by two independent reviewers, and if selected, data extraction with risk of bias assessment by two independent reviewers. A third reviewer will settle any disagreements that may occur. Incidence of SIP will be measured as a proportion. Individual proportions will be pooled using a random effects logistic regression model. The comparative incidence of SIP by treatment group will be measured using the odds ratio. Odds ratios will be pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model for meta-analysis. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42017058603

                Background: Population health diagnoses are a fundamental tool to guide health policies and programs, and consequently, public health requirements. In this perspective, the burden of disease in inhabitants of Colombian Orinoquia is quantified for the first time. Methods: A descriptive population-based study that was based on secondary sources was carried out, which aimed at measuring the burden of the disease in the Colombian region of Orinoquia, using the simplified synthetic indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the global health estimation methodology. We used mortality records from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and service provision records from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, both records from the year 2017, available on the Integrated Social Protection Information System. Results: 288,740.2 DALYs occurred (95% UI 210,714.6-382,948.8), with higher reports for men (59%); group of non-communicable diseases accounted for 62.3% of DALY (179,993.6, 95% UI, 115,030.2-268,405.0), followed by external cause injuries group which contributed 24.6% (71,000.0, 95% UI, 25,638.1-134,013.1), and group of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders which contributed 13.1% (37,746.0, 95% UI, 28,048.0-50,239.7). Interpersonal violence was the primary cause specific of DALYs with 9.8% of the burden, (28,290.0, 95% UI, 7,365.1-64,208.1). Conclusions: Most DALYs in Orinoquia are produced by non-communicable diseases (NCD), largely caused by neoplasms and cardiovascular disease, which increased with age. However, when considered by specific cause of illness or injury, interpersonal violence is indicated as the main cause of DALYs, affecting mainly young men, possibly as an expression of social inequality, substance use, criminality, and insecurity. It is important to highlight that this region has been recognized as an area of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and poverty.

                Agronomic traits of plants especially those of economic or aesthetic importance are threatened by climatic and environmental factors such as climate change, biotic, and abiotic stresses. These threats are now being mitigated through the analyses of omics data like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics. The emergence of high-throughput omics technology has led to an avalanche of plant omics data. Plant research demands novel analytical paradigms to extract and harness large plant omics data for plant improvement effectively and efficiently. Machine learning algorithms are well-suited analytical and computational approaches for the integrative analysis of large unstructured, heterogeneous datasets. This study presents an overview of omics approaches to improve plant agronomic traits and crucial curated plant genomic data sources. Furthermore, we summarize machine learning algorithms and software tools/programming packages used in plant omics research. Lastly, we discuss advancements in machine learning algorithms' applications in improving agronomic traits of economically important plants. Extensive application of machine learning would advance plant omics studies. These advancements would consequently help agricultural scientists improve economically important plants’ quality, yield, and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stresses and other plant health-threatening issues.

                Introduction Hand injuries are a recognized occupational hazard from the use of chaff cutters. With increasing mechanization of farming in our region, the burden of hand injuries is poised to increase. Methods We conducted a descriptive study of 47 patients presenting with chaff cutter hand injuries at our center in one year. Results They were predominantly male (98%) and the majority (70%) were aged between 21 and 40 years. The majority of patients who had not resumed work were those with severe injuries and those who had had an amputation. There was a positive correlation between age category and severity of injury. Discussion Chaff cutter injuries contribute considerably to hand amputations at our center. The majority of patients with severe injuries and those undergoing amputations do not return to gainful activities one year after sustaining the injury, suggesting increased dependency. Further research is paramount to identify safety features of chaff cutters in this region.

                Background: A growing population of cells accumulates mutations. A single mutation early in the growth process carries forward to all descendant cells, causing the final population to have a lot of mutant cells. When the first mutation happens later in growth, the final population typically has fewer mutants. The number of mutant cells in the final population follows the Luria-Delbrück distribution. The mathematical form of the distribution is known only from its probability generating function. For larger populations of cells, one typically uses computer simulations to estimate the distribution. Methods: This article searches for a simple approximation of the Luria-Delbrück distribution, with an explicit mathematical form that can be used easily in calculations. Results: The Fréchet distribution provides a good approximation for the Luria-Delbrück distribution for neutral mutations, which do not cause a growth rate change relative to the original cells. Conclusions: The Fréchet distribution apparently provides a good match through its description of extreme value problems for multiplicative processes such as exponential growth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Role of RAS signaling in ovarian cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The RAS family of proteins is among the most frequently mutated genes in human malignancies. In ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecological malignancy, RAS, especially KRAS mutational status at codons 12, 13, and 61, ranges from 6–65% spanning different histo-types. Normally RAS regulates several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular signaling cascades mediating numerous cellular processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion, and death. Aberrant activation of RAS leads to uncontrolled induction of several downstream signaling pathways such as RAF-1/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PI3K phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, RalGEFs, Rac/Rho, BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B), MEK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), PKB (protein kinase B) and PKC (protein kinase C) involved in cell proliferation as well as maintenance pathways thereby driving tumorigenesis and cancer cell propagation. KRAS mutation is also known to be a biomarker for poor outcome and chemoresistance in OC. As a malignancy with several histotypes showing varying histopathological characteristics, we focus on reviewing recent literature showcasing the involvement of oncogenic RAS in mediating carcinogenesis and chemoresistance in OC and its subtypes.

                Background: The simultaneous measurement of cellular proteins and transcriptomes of single cell data has become an exciting new possibility with the advent of highly multiplexed multi-omics methodologies. However, mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a well-established, affordable technique for the analysis of proteomic data, which is well suited for the discovery and characterisation of very rare subpopulations of cells with a wealth of publicly available datasets. Methods: We present and evaluate the multimodal integration of single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF datasets coming from both matched and unmatched samples, using two publicly available datasets. Results: We demonstrate that the integration of well annotated CyTOF data with single cell RNA sequencing can aid in the identification and annotation of cell populations with high accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the integration can provide imputed measurements of protein markers which are comparable to the current gold standard of antibody derived tags (ADT) from CITE-Seq for both matched and unmatched datasets. Using this methodology, we identify and transcriptionally characterise a rare subpopulation of CD11c positive B cells in high resolution using publicly available data and we unravel its heterogeneity in a single cell setting without the need to sort the cells in advance, in a manner which had not been previously possible. Conclusions: This approach provides the framework for using available proteomic and transcriptomic datasets in a unified and unbiased fashion to assist ongoing and future studies of cellular characterisation and biomarker identification.

                Background: Immediately after graduation from university, college students need to make significant decisions about starting their careers or pursuing higher studies. They are also pressured to meet the expectations and demands of self, others, and the environment. Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aforementioned challenging decisions may become hazardous stressors for college students. Hence, the researchers intended to assist and assess the college students involved in student placements. The research goal was to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on the stress and self-esteem of college students involved in student placements.  Methods: One hundred college students participating in the campus placements were selected using purposive sampling from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University in Coimbatore, India. For evaluation purposes, college students were administered the perceived stress, Rosenberg self-esteem, and Kuppuswamy socio-economic scales. Seventy-five college students were selected for the MBI process and were administered with a pre-intervention and post-intervention without a control group research design. Results: Statistical analysis including analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni post hoc test showed a significant increase in self-esteem and a decrease in the stress of the college students involved in placements. Conclusions: Thus, the researchers recommend that policymakers create awareness, include MBI in the curriculum, and allocate funds for training ventures in educational institutions to assist college students in their challenging life journeys

                <p>by Nathan D. Lee, Ivana Bozic</p>

As a cancer develops, its cells accrue new mutations, resulting in a heterogeneous, complex genomic profile. We make use of this heterogeneity to derive simple, analytic estimates of parameters driving carcinogenesis and reconstruct the timeline of selective events following initiation of an individual cancer, where two longitudinal samples are available for sequencing. Using stochastic computer simulations of cancer growth, we show that we can accurately estimate mutation rate, time before and after a driver event occurred, and growth rates of both initiated cancer cells and subsequently appearing subclones. We demonstrate that in order to obtain accurate estimates of mutation rate and timing of events, observed mutation counts should be corrected to account for clonal mutations that occurred after the founding of the tumor, as well as sequencing coverage. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which often does not require treatment for years after diagnosis, presents an optimal system to study the untreated, natural evolution of cancer cell populations. When we apply our methodology to reconstruct the individual evolutionary histories of CLL patients, we find that the parental leukemic clone typically appears within the first fifteen years of life.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neocortical Lewy body pathology parallels Parkinson's dementia, but not always</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia and cortical proteinopathies in a large population of pathologically confirmed PD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We reviewed clinical data from all patients with autopsy data seen in the Movement Disorders Center at Washington University, St. Louis between 1996 and 2019. All patients with a diagnosis of PD based on neuropathology were included. We used logistic regression and MANCOVA to investigate the relationship between neuropathology and dementia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 165 PD patients met inclusion criteria. Among these, 128 had clinical dementia. Those with dementia had greater mean ages of motor onset and death but equivalent mean disease duration. The delay between motor symptom onset and dementia was one year or less in 14 individuals, meeting research diagnostic criteria for possible or probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Braak Lewy body stage was associated with diagnosis of dementia, whereas severities of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and small vessel pathology did not. Pathology of individuals diagnosed with DLB did not differ significantly from that of other PD patients with dementia. 6% of individuals with PD and dementia did not have neocortical Lewy bodies; 68% with PD but without dementia did have neocortical Lewy bodies.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neocortical Lewy bodies almost always accompany dementia in PD; however, they also appear in most PD patients without dementia. In some cases, dementia may occur in PD patients without neocortical Lewy bodies, ADNC, or small vessel disease. Thus, other factors not directly related to these classic neuropathologic features may contribute to PD dementia.</p>
