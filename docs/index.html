	<p>The present study demonstrates that synaptamide (N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine), an endogenous metabolite of docosahexaenoic acid, when administered subcutaneously (4 mg/kg/day, 14 days), exhibits analgesic activity and promotes cognitive recovery in the rat sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) model. We analyzed the dynamics of GFAP-positive astroglia and S100&amp;amp;beta;-positive astroglia activity, the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), and two subunits of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR1 and NMDAR2A) in the hippocampi of the experimental animals. Hippocampal neurogenesis was evaluated by immunohistochemical detection of DCX. Analysis of N-acylethanolamines in plasma and in the brain was performed using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that synaptamide (1) reduces cold allodynia, (2) improves working memory and locomotor activity, (3) stabilizes neurogenesis and astroglial activity, (4) enhances the expression of NGF and NMDAR1, (5) increases the concentration of Ca2+ in astrocytes, and (6) increases the production of N-acylethanolamines. The results of the present study demonstrate that synaptamide affects the activity of hippocampal astroglia, resulting in faster recovery after CCI.</p>

                Clinical presentation of liver hydatidosis can vary from asymptomatic forms to lethal complications. We report herein a rare case of a 27-year-old male from a rural Tunisian region who presented with large-abundance haematemesis, haemodynamic instability, and marked biological data of hypersplenism. Endoscopy showed bleeding esophageal varicose veins that were ligated. Abdominal ultrasound concluded the presence of three type CE2 hydatic liver cysts causing portal cavernoma with signs of portal hypertension. Despite resuscitation, the patient died of massive rebleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock. Hepatic hydatid cyst should be considered as an indirect cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in endemic countries. Early abdominal ultrasound in varicose haemorrhage is essential in orienting the diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Refining the content and design of an alcohol reduction app, Drink Less, to improve its usability and effectiveness: a mixed methods approach [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Digital interventions have the potential to reduce alcohol consumption, although evidence on the effectiveness of apps is lacking. Drink Less is a popular, evidence-informed app with good usability, putting it in a strong position to be improved upon prior to conducting a confirmatory evaluation. This paper describes the process of refining Drink Less to improve its usability and likely effectiveness. Methods: The refinement consisted of three phases and involved qualitative and quantitative (mixed) methods: i) identifying changes to app content, based on findings from an initial evaluation of Drink Less, an updated review of digital alcohol interventions and a content analysis of user feedback; ii) designing new app modules with public input and a consultation with app developers and researchers; and iii) improving the app’s usability through user testing. Results: As a result of the updated review of digital alcohol interventions and user feedback analysis in Phase 1, three new modules: ‘Behaviour Substitution’, ‘Information about Antecedents’ and ‘Insights’, were added to the app. One existing module – ‘Identity Change’ – was removed based on the initial evaluation of Drink Less. Phases 2 and 3 resulted in changes to existing features, such as improving the navigational structure and onboarding process, and clarifying how to edit drinks and goals. Conclusions: A mixed methods approach was used to refine the content and design of Drink Less, providing insights into how to improve its usability and likely effectiveness. Drink Less is now ready for a confirmatory evaluation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A case series of ocular involvement in bullous pemphigoid: clinical features, management, and outcomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Ocular involvement in cases of bullous pemphigoid is rare and when present, the signs are usually subtle and in the form of fine tarsal scarring and dry eye disease. The current report aims to describe the clinical features and management protocols in a series of cases with aggressive ocular manifestations at presentation. All cases of bullous pemphigoid seen between 2017 and 2020 were included in this retrospective case series. Data regarding the clinical features, treatment administered, and outcomes was collected. Five cases (n=10 eyes) of bullous pemphigoid disease with ocular involvement were included. All eyes had significant cicatricial conjunctival changes in the form of symblephara, inferior forniceal shortening, and tarsal conjunctival scarring. Conjunctival granulomas were present in 3/10 eyes. Corneal involvement in the form of punctate keratitis was present in all eyes while 4/10 eyes had an epithelial defect as well. The management of these cases involved topical therapy with corticosteroids and lubricants (n=10 eyes) while pulse doses of intravenous methyl prednisolone were administered in 5/5 cases. Pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide was supplemented in 2/5 cases. Adequate control of the disease was noted in 3/5 cases while one case had a recalcitrant form of the disease and developed a dermalised ocular surface in both eyes. The last patient was lost to follow up during the course of therapy. Bullous pemphigoid can present with an aggressive form of cicatrizing conjunctivitis similar to other variants of autoimmune blistering disorders and must be considered as a differential in cases presenting with ocular cicatricial disease. Long-term intensive immunosuppression is required for the management of these cases to preserve the visual function and the integrity of the globe.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Design of a soft sensing technique for measuring pitch and yaw angular positions for a Twin Rotor MIMO System [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper presents a soft sensor design technique for the estimation of pitch and yaw angular positions of a Twin Rotor MIMO System (TRMS). The objective of the proposed work was to calculate the value of pitch and yaw angular positions using a stochastic estimation technique.  Methods: Measurements from optical sensors were used to measure fan blade rotations per minute (RPM).  The Kalman filter, which is a stochastic estimator, was used in the proposed system and its results were compared with those of the Luenberger observer and neural network. The Twin Rotor MIMO System is a nonlinear system with significant cross-coupling between its rotors.  Results: The estimators were designed for the decoupled system and were applied in real life to the coupled TRMS. The convergence of estimation to the actual values was checked on a practical setup. The Kalman filter estimators were evaluated for various inputs and disturbances, and the results were corroborated in real-time.  Conclusion:  From the proposed work it was seen that the Kalman filter had at least Integral Absolute Error (IAE), Integral Square Error (ISE), Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) as compared to the neural network and the Luenberger based observer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Nigella sativa on general health and immune system in young healthy volunteers; a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Nigella sativa (N. sativa) is traditionally used as an immune enhancer in different communities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of N. sativa on immunity related parameters in young healthy subjects. This study was a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial. Fifty-two healthy subjects (48 male and 4 female) 18-25 years old were enrolled in the study. They were randomly divided into four groups; the first received charcoal capsules and served as controls and the other three received 0.5, 1 g, and 2 g of powdered N. sativa capsules, respectively. Two blood samples were obtained from all participant, before initiation of the trial and at the end of the four weeks intervention. One sample was used for routine health screening by evaluating liver and renal functions as well as complete blood count and differential. The second sample was used to measure certain cytokines including; IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF. A third and fourth samples were obtained from the last cohort of subjects before and after treatment; the third was used for measuring immunoglobulins and CD profile and the fourth for evaluating certain gene expressions (INF-γ, NF-κ-B, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-13, IL-8, and IL-6). Only 1 g dose of N. sativa produced a significant elevation in total lymphocyte count, CD3+ and CD4+ counts. One gram N. sativa increased the absolute lymphocyte count from 1850±0.24 to 2170±0.26 (p=0.008), CD3+ from 1184.4±75.60 to 1424±114.51 (p=0.009), and CD4+ from 665.6±141.66 to 841±143.36 (p=0.002).  This elevation in T cells was lost by increasing the dose of N. sativa to 2g. The rest of the parameters were not changed significantly in all doses. The results show a promising immunopotentiation effect of N. sativa by elevating helper T cells and the optimum dose for young age group seems to be 1 g.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cross-sectional assessment of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with knee osteoarthritis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are prevalent in India. However, there is dearth of literature among Indians studying the relationship between the two. This study was carried out to assess various cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in patients with knee OA with an objective to investigate their association, screening and management.  Methods: In total, 225 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were diagnosed with knee OA on the basis of the Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) classification of their radiograph. Participants were also assessed for CV risk factors (age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, smoking) with the help of the Joint British Society QRisk3 calculator (JBS3) a comprehensive risk score calculator as well as a screening tool, which produces three more variables, namely 10-years risk of developing CVD, physiological heart age and life expectancy. Chi Square, Fishers exact test and one-way ANOVA tests were used to compare the categorical and quantitative variables, respectively. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between CV risk factors and knee OA. Multiple regression analysis was done to adjust the multiple con-founders and determine their significance. Results: Patients with severe knee OA had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of CV risk factors (p<0.05). Grade 4 knee OA patients were found to have a mean JBS3 risk of 38%, heart age of 82 years and life expectancy of 77 years as compared to grade 2 patients who had a mean JBS3 risk of 11%, heart age of 63 years and life expectancy of 82 years.  Conclusions: Our study concluded that there is a strong positive correlation between knee OA and CVD, with CV risk score being directly proportional to the severity of OA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The alpha/B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant exhibits significantly higher affinity for ACE-2 and requires lower inoculation doses to cause disease in K18-hACE2 mice</a></h4>

              
                The alpha/B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 lineage emerged in autumn 2020 in the United Kingdom and transmitted rapidly until winter 2021 when it was responsible for most new COVID-19 cases in many European countries. The incidence domination was likely due to a fitness advantage that could be driven by the RBD residue change (N501Y), which also emerged independently in other Variants of Concern such as the beta/B.1.351 and gamma/P.1 strains. Here we present a functional characterization of the alpha/B.1.1.7 variant and show an eight-fold affinity increase towards human ACE-2. In accordance with this, transgenic hACE-2 mice showed a faster disease progression and severity after infection with a low dose of B.1.1.7, compared to an early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. When challenged with sera from convalescent individuals or anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies, the N501Y variant showed a minor, but significant elevated evasion potential of ACE-2/RBD antibody neutralization. The data suggest that the single asparagine to tyrosine substitution remarkable rise in affinity may be responsible for the higher transmission rate and severity of the B.1.1.7 variant.

                Identifying the molecular fingerprint of organismal cell types is key for understanding their function and evolution. Here, we use single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to survey the cell types of the sea urchin early pluteus larva, representing an important developmental transition from non-feeding to feeding larva. We identify 21 distinct cell clusters, representing cells of the digestive, skeletal, immune, and nervous systems. Further subclustering of these reveal a highly detailed portrait of cell diversity across the larva, including the identification of neuronal cell types. We then validate important gene regulatory networks driving sea urchin development and reveal new domains of activity within the larval body. Focusing on neurons that co-express <i>Pdx-1</i> and <i>Brn1/2/4</i>, we identify an unprecedented number of genes shared by this population of neurons in sea urchin and vertebrate endocrine pancreatic cells. Using differential expression results from Pdx-1 knockdown experiments, we show that Pdx1 is necessary for the acquisition of the neuronal identity of these cells.  We hypothesize that a network similar to the one orchestrated by Pdx1 in the sea urchin neurons was active in an ancestral cell type and then inherited by neuronal and pancreatic developmental lineages in sea urchins and vertebrates.

                Crosstalk between different receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is thought to drive oncogenic signaling and allow therapeutic escape. EGFR and RON are two such RTKs from different subfamilies, which engage in crosstalk through unknown mechanisms. We combined high-resolution imaging with biochemical and mutational studies to ask how EGFR and RON communicate. EGF stimulation promotes EGFR-dependent phosphorylation of RON, but ligand stimulation of RON does not trigger EGFR phosphorylation – arguing that crosstalk is unidirectional. Nanoscale imaging reveals association of EGFR and RON in common plasma membrane microdomains. Two-color single particle tracking captured formation of complexes between RON and EGF-bound EGFR. Our results further show that RON is a substrate for EGFR kinase, and that transactivation of RON requires formation of a signaling competent EGFR dimer. These results support a role for direct EGFR/RON interactions in propagating crosstalk, such that EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylates RON to activate RON-directed signaling.

                Pathogenic mycobacteria pose a sustained threat to global human health. Recently, cytochrome <i>bcc</i> complexes have gained interest as targets for antibiotic drug development. However, there is currently no structural information for the cytochrome <i>bcc</i> complex from these pathogenic mycobacteria. Here, we report the structures of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> cytochrome <i>bcc</i> alone (2.68 Å resolution) and in complex with clinical drug candidates Q203 (2.67 Å resolution) and TB47 (2.93 Å resolution) determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. <i>M. tuberculosis</i> cytochrome <i>bcc</i> forms a dimeric assembly with endogenous menaquinone/menaquinol bound at the quinone/quinol-binding pockets. We observe Q203 and TB47 bound at the quinol-binding site and stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the side chains of <sub>QcrB</sub>Thr<sup>313</sup> and <sub>QcrB</sub>Glu<sup>314</sup>, residues that are conserved across pathogenic mycobacteria. These high-resolution images provide a basis for the design of new mycobacterial cytochrome <i>bcc</i> inhibitors that could be developed into broad-spectrum drugs to treat mycobacterial infections.

                Macaque monkeys are widely used to study vision. In the traditional approach, monkeys are brought into a lab to perform visual tasks while they are restrained to obtain stable eye tracking and neural recordings. Here, we describe a novel environment to study visual cognition in a more natural setting as well as other natural and social behaviors. We designed a naturalistic environment with an integrated touchscreen workstation that enables high-quality eye tracking in unrestrained monkeys. We used this environment to train monkeys on a challenging same-different task. We also show that this environment can reveal interesting novel social behaviors. As proof of concept, we show that two naïve monkeys were able to learn this complex task through a combination of socially observing trained monkeys and through solo trial-and-error. We propose that such naturalistic environments can be used to rigorously study visual cognition as well as other natural and social behaviors in freely moving monkeys.

In this study, by using a virtual reality (VR) system for an insect, we investigated how the adult silkmoth integrates visual and wind direction information during female search behavior (olfactory behavior). According to the behavioral experiments using a VR system, the silkmoth had the highest navigational success rate when odor, vision, and wind information were correctly provided. However, the success rate of the search was reduced if the wind direction information provided was different from the direction actually detected. This indicates that it is important to acquire not only odor information but also wind direction information correctly. When the wind is received from the same direction as the odor, the silkmoth takes positive behavior; if the odor is detected but the wind direction is not in the same direction as the odor, the silkmoth behaves more carefully. This corresponds to a modulation of behavior according to the degree of complexity (turbulence) of the environment. We mathematically modeled the modulation of behavior using multisensory information and evaluated it using simulations. The mathematical model not only succeeded in reproducing the actual silkmoth search behavior but also improved the search success relative to the conventional odor-source search algorithm.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ANTH domains within CALM, HIP1R, and Sla2 recognize ubiquitin internalization signals</a></h4>

              
                Attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to cell surface proteins serves as a signal for internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). How ubiquitinated membrane proteins engage the internalization apparatus remains unclear. The internalization apparatus contains proteins such as Epsin and Eps15, which bind Ub, potentially acting as adaptors for Ub-based internalization signals. Here we show that additional components of the endocytic machinery including CALM, HIP1R, and Sla2 bind Ub via their N-terminal ANTH domain, a domain belonging to the superfamily of ENTH and VHS domains. Structural studies revealed that Ub binds with µM affinity to a unique C-terminal region within the ANTH domain not found in ENTH domains. Functional studies showed that combined loss of Ub-binding by ANTH-domain proteins and other Ub-binding domains within the yeast internalization apparatus caused defects in the Ub-dependent internalization of the GPCR Ste2 that was engineered to rely exclusively on Ub as an internalization signal. In contrast, these mutations had no effect on the internalization of Ste2 engineered to use an alternate Ub-independent internalization signal. These studies define new components of the internalization machinery that work collectively with Epsin and Eps15 to specify recognition of Ub as an internalization signal.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A functional topography within the cholinergic basal forebrain for encoding sensory cues and behavioral reinforcement outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) project throughout the cortex to regulate arousal, stimulus salience, plasticity, and learning. Although often treated as a monolithic structure, the basal forebrain features distinct connectivity along its rostrocaudal axis that could impart regional differences in BFCN processing. Here, we performed simultaneous bulk calcium imaging from rostral and caudal BFCNs over a one-month period of variable reinforcement learning in mice. BFCNs in both regions showed equivalently weak responses to unconditioned visual stimuli and anticipated rewards. Rostral BFCNs in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band were more responsive to reward omission, more accurately classified behavioral outcomes, and more closely tracked fluctuations in pupil-indexed global brain state. Caudal tail BFCNs in globus pallidus and substantia innominata were more responsive to unconditioned auditory stimuli, orofacial movements, aversive reinforcement, and showed robust associative plasticity for punishment-predicting cues. These results identify a functional topography that diversifies cholinergic modulatory signals broadcast to downstream brain regions.

                The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is a critical co-activator for transcription of most cellular and viral genes, including those of HIV. While P-TEFb is regulated by 7SK snRNA in proliferating cells, P-TEFb is absent due to diminished levels of CycT1 in quiescent and terminally differentiated cells, which has remained unexplored. In these cells, we found that CycT1 not bound to CDK9 is rapidly degraded. Moreover, productive CycT1:CDK9 interactions are increased by PKC mediated phosphorylation of CycT1 in human cells. Conversely, dephosphorylation of CycT1 by PP1 reverses this process. Thus, PKC inhibitors or removal of PKC by chronic activation results in P-TEFb disassembly and CycT1 degradation. This finding not only recapitulates P-TEFb depletion in resting CD4+ T cells but also in anergic T cells. Importantly, our studies reveal mechanisms of P-TEFb inactivation underlying T cell quiescence, anergy, and exhaustion as well as proviral latency and terminally differentiated cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Golgi membrane protein Erd1 Is essential for recycling a subset of Golgi glycosyltransferases</a></h4>

              
                Protein glycosylation in the Golgi is a sequential process that requires proper distribution of transmembrane glycosyltransferase enzymes in the appropriate Golgi compartments. Some of the cytosolic machinery required for the steady-state localization of some Golgi enzymes are known but existing models do not explain how many of these enzymes are localized. Here, we uncover the role of an integral membrane protein in yeast, Erd1, as a key facilitator of Golgi glycosyltransferase recycling by directly interacting with both the Golgi enzymes and the cytosolic receptor, Vps74. Loss of Erd1 function results in mislocalization of Golgi enzymes to the vacuole/lysosome. We present evidence that Erd1 forms an integral part of the recycling machinery and ensures productive recycling of several early Golgi enzymes. Our work provides new insights on how the localization of Golgi glycosyltransferases is spatially and temporally regulated, and is finely tuned to the cues of Golgi maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neutrophil-mediated oxidative stress and albumin structural damage predict COVID-19-associated mortality</a></h4>

              
                Human serum albumin (HSA) is the frontline antioxidant protein in blood with established anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation functions. Here we report that COVID-19-induced oxidative stress inflicts structural damages to HSA and is linked with mortality outcome in critically ill patients. We recruited 39 patients who were followed up for a median of 12.5 days (1-35 days), among them 23 had died. Analyzing blood samples from patients and healthy individuals (n=11), we provide evidence that neutrophils are major sources of oxidative stress in blood and that hydrogen peroxide is highly accumulated in plasmas of non-survivors. We then analyzed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of spin labelled fatty acids (SLFA) bound with HSA in whole blood of control, survivor, and non-survivor subjects (n=10-11). Non-survivor' HSA showed dramatically reduced protein packing order parameter, faster SLFA correlational rotational time, and smaller S/W ratio (strong-binding/weak-binding sites within HSA), all reflecting remarkably fluid protein microenvironments. Following loading/unloading of 16-DSA we show that transport function of HSA maybe impaired in severe patients. Stratified at the means, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that lower values of S/W ratio and accumulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plasma significantly predicted in-hospital mortality (S/W≤0.15, 81.8% (18/22) vs. S/W&gt;0.15, 18.2% (4/22), <i>p</i>=0.023; plasma [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]&gt;8.6 mM, 65.2% (15/23) vs. 34.8% (8/23), <i>p</i>=0.043). When we combined these two parameters as the ratio ((S/W)/[H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]) to derive a risk score, the resultant risk score lower than the mean (&lt; 0.019) predicted mortality with high fidelity (95.5% (21/22) vs. 4.5% (1/22), logrank c<sup>2</sup> = 12.1, <i>p</i>=4.9x10<sup>-4</sup>). The derived parameters may provide a surrogate marker to assess new candidates for COVID-19 treatments targeting HSA replacements and/or oxidative stress.

                Fully automated proteomic pipelines have the potential to achieve deep coverage of cellular proteomes with high throughput and scalability. However, it is important to evaluate performance, including both reproducibility and ability to provide meaningful levels of biological insight. Here, we present an approach combining high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometer (FAIMS) interface and data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics approach developed as part of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale effort to understand how inherited diseases may manifest in neuronal cells. Our FAIMS-DIA approach identified more than 8000 proteins per mass spectrometry (MS) acquisition as well as superior total identification, reproducibility, and accuracy compared to other existing DIA methods. Next, we applied this approach to perform a longitudinal proteomic profiling of the differentiation of iPSC-derived neurons from the KOLF2.1J parental line used in iNDI. This analysis demonstrated a steady increase in expression of mature cortical neuron markers over the course of neuron differentiation. We validated the performance of our proteomics pipeline by comparing it to single cell RNA-Seq datasets obtained in parallel, confirming expression of key markers and cell type annotations. An interactive webapp of this temporal data is available for aligned-UMAP visualization and data browsing (https://share.streamlit.io/anant-droid/singlecellumap). In summary, we report an extensively optimized and validated proteomic pipeline that will be suitable for large-scale studies such as iNDI.

                Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). A plethora of evidence has indicated a role for LRRK2 in endolysosomal trafficking in neurons, while LRRK2 function in glia, although highly expressed, remains largely unknown. Here we present evidence that LRRK2/dLRRK mediates a glial lysosomal pathway that contributes to the mechanism of PD. Independent of its kinase activity, glial LRRK2/dLRRK knockdown in the immortalized microglial cells or flies results in enlarged and swelling lysosomes fewer in number. These lysosomes are less mobile, wrongly acidified, and exhibit defective membrane permeability and reduced activity of the lysosome hydrolase cathespin B. In addition, microglial LRRK2 depletion causes increased Caspase 3 levels, leading to glial apoptosis, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and locomotor deficits in an age-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a functional role of LRRK2/dLRRK in regulating the glial lysosomal pathway; deficits in lysosomal biogenesis and function linking to glial apoptosis potentially underlie the mechanism of DA neurodegeneration, contributing to the progression of PD.

                Our understanding of the molecular pathology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is rapidly evolving and is being driven by advances in sequencing techniques. Conventional short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a central tool in transcriptomics research that enables unbiased gene expression profiling. With the recent emergence of Oxford Nanopore direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq), it is now also possible to interrogate diverse RNA modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome. Here, we present our analyses of the male and female mouse amygdala transcriptome and epitranscriptome, obtained using parallel Illumina RNA-seq and Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq, associated with the acquisition of PTSD-like fear induced by Pavlovian cued-fear conditioning. We report significant sex-specific differences in the amygdala transcriptional response during fear acquisition, and a range of shared and dimorphic epitranscriptomic signatures. Differential RNA modifications are enriched among mRNA transcripts associated with neurotransmitter regulation and mitochondrial function, many of which have been previously implicated in PTSD. Very few differentially modified transcripts are also differentially expressed, suggesting an influential, expression-independent role for epitranscriptional regulation in PTSD-like fear-acquisition. Overall, our application of conventional and newly developed methods provides a platform for future work that will lead to new insights into and therapeutics for PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateralization of autonomic activity in response to limb-specific threat</a></h4>

              
                In times of stress or danger, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) signals the fight or flight response. A canonical function of ANS activity is to globally mobilize metabolic resources, preparing the organism to respond to threat. Yet a body of research has demonstrated that, rather than displaying a homogenous pattern across the body, autonomic responses to arousing events - as measured through changes in electrodermal activity (EDA) - can differ between right and left body locations. Surprisingly, the metabolic function of such ANS asymmetry has not been investigated. In the current study, we investigated whether asymmetric autonomic responses could be induced through limb-specific aversive stimulation. Participants were given mild electric stimulation to either the left or right arm while EDA was monitored bilaterally. Across participants, a strong ipsilateral EDA response bias was observed, with increased EDA response in the hand adjacent to the stimulation. This effect was observable in over 50% of individual subjects. These results demonstrate that autonomic output is more complex than canonical interpretations suggest. We suggest that, in stressful situations, autonomic outputs can prepare either the whole-body fight or flight response, or a simply a limb-localized flick, which can effectively neutralize the threat while minimizing global resource consumption. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary pathway of neural systems processing general arousal by linking observed asymmetry in the peripheral arousal response to a historical leveraging of neural structures organized to mediate responses to localized threat.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Hybrid Communication Pattern in Brain Structural Network Revealed by Evolutionary Computation</a></h4>

              
                The human brain functional connectivity network (FCN) is constrained and shaped by the information communication processes in the structural connectivity network (SCN). The underlying communication model thus becomes a critical issue for understanding structure-function coupling in the human brain. A number of communication models featuring different point-to-point routing strategies have been proposed, with shortest path (SP), diffusion (DIF), and navigation (NAV) as the typical, respectively requiring network global knowledge, local knowledge, and their combination for path seeking. Yet these models all assumed the entire brain to use a uniform routing strategy, which contradicted lumping evidence supporting the wide variety of brain regions in both terms of biological substrates and functional exhibitions. In this study, we developed a novel communication model that allowed each brain region to choose a routing strategy from SP, DIF, and NAV independently. A genetic algorithm was designed to uncover the underlying region-wise hybrid routing strategy (namely HYB) for maximizing the structure-function coupling. The HYB-based model outperformed the three typical models in terms of predicting FCN and supporting robust communication. In HYB, brain regions in lower-order functional modules inclined to choose the routing strategies requiring more global knowledge, while those in higher-order functional components preferred to choose DIF. Additionally, compared to regions using SP and NAV, regions using DIF had denser structural connections, participated in more functional modules, but were less dominant within them. Together, our findings revealed and evidenced the possibility and advantages of hybrid routing underpinning efficient SCN communication.

                Background: Virally-mediated chemogenetic techniques hold the promise of circuit-specific neuromodulation for human brain disorders. Their protracted development in primates and issues related to the specificity of the actuator drugs has significantly slowed their implementation. Here we took a multi-disciplinary approach to assessing the translational appropriateness of a newly identified actuator drug, deschloroclozapine (DCZ). Methods: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data was acquired from seven rhesus macaques (6 males and 1 female) after administration of either vehicle, 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg DCZ, the latter of which produce 80% and near 100% chemogenetic receptor occupancy, respectively. Seed-based comparative-connectome analysis and independent component analysis assessed dose dependent neural impact. Two subsets of subjects were tested on socio-emotional tasks (N = 4), and a probabilistic learning task (N = 3), assessing DCZ's impact on unconditioned and conditioned affective responses, respectively. Results: Neither vehicle nor 0.1 mg/kg DCZ changed overall functional connectivity, affective responses, or reaction times in the learning task. 0.3 mg/kg DCZ increased functional connectivity, particularly in frontal regions, and increased reaction times in the learning task. Notably, there was a positive correlation between changes in overall functional connectivity and reaction time. Conclusions: These experiments show the utility of rs-fMRI for in-vivo drug screening and benchmarking. We found that low dose DCZ does not alter brain function or affective behavior. However, higher doses of DCZ impacts frontal connectivity and is associated with deficits in task execution. Implementation of these methods will accelerate the development of chemogenetic in primates for research and therapeutic approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated methodology for optimal selection of the minimum electrode subset for accurate EEG source localization based on Genetic Algorithm optimization</a></h4>

              
                High-density Electroencephalography (HD-EEG) has been proven to be the most accurate option to estimate the neural activity inside the brain. Although multiple studies report the effect of electrode number on source localization for specific sources and specific electrode configurations, the electrodes for each configuration have been manually selected to uniformly cover the entire head, going from 32 to 128 electrodes, where electrodes were not selected according to their contribution to accuracy. In this work, an optimization-based study aimed to determine the minimum number of electrodes and identify optimal combinations of electrodes that can keep the localization accuracy of HD-EEG reconstructions. This optimization approach incorporates scalp landmark positions of widely used EEG montages. In this way, a systematic search for the minimum electrode subset is performed for single and multiple source localization problems. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) combined with source reconstruction methods is used to formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that minimize (1) the localization error for each source and (2) the number of required EEG electrodes. It can be used for evaluating the source localization quality of low-density EEG systems (consumer-grade wearable EEG). We performed an evaluation over synthetic and real EEG dataset with known ground-truth. The experimental results shown that selected electrode combinations with 6 electrodes can obtain for a single source case, an equal or better accuracy than HD-EEG (with more than 200 channels) when reconstructing a particular brain activity in more than 88% of the cases (in synthetic signals) and 63% (in real signals), and more than 88% and 73% of the cases when considering combinations with 8 channels. For a multiple-source case of three sources (only with synthetic signals), it was found that an equal or better accuracy than HD-EEG with 231 electrodes was attained in at least 58%, 76%, and 82% of the cases, when using optimized combinations of 8, 12, and 16 electrodes, respectively. Additionally, in such electrode numbers a lower mean error and standard deviation than with 231 electrodes was obtained.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered neurogenic pathways in experimental rat models of ischemic cerebral stroke: A transcriptome based meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Promoting neurogenesis mediated recovery is one of the most sought after strategies in recovery after cerebral stroke. In this paper we elucidate how neurogenesis related genes are altered in the early stroke environment, to hint at potential pathways for therapeutic recovery. Materials and Methods: Around 97 microarray datasets derived from stroke affected rat brains were collected from NCBI-GEO. Datasets were normalized and subjected to a meta-analysis in Network Analyst to identify differentially expressed genes. Gene enrichment analyses were carried out using GSEA, and WebGestalt and results were visualized using Cytoscape Enrichment mapping. Results: Nearly 939 differentially expressing genes were identified in the cerebral stroke group. Among them, 30 neurogenesis related genes were identified through enrichment mapping analysis, and 35 genes through Protein-Protein Interaction analysis. Highest upregulated neurogenesis genes were found to be TSPO, GFAP, VIM, and TGFB1. The Highest Downregulated neurogenesis genes were found to be THY1, NR1D1, CDK5, STX1B, and NOG. Conclusions: Through this study, we have identified that during the acute time frame after stroke, the majority of the neurogenesis genes related to neural proliferation and neural differentiation are downregulated, while the majority of the genes related to neuronal migration were upregulated. A single or combined therapeutic approach against the identified dysregulated genes could greatly aid neural restoration and functional recovery during the postischemic stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Scalable and Modular Automated Pipeline for Stitching of Large Electron Microscopy Datasets</a></h4>

              
                Serial section Electron Microscopy can produce high throughput imaging of large biological specimen volumes. The high-resolution images are necessary to reconstruct dense neural wiring diagrams in the brain, so called connectomes. A high fidelity volume assembly is required to correctly reconstruct neural anatomy and synaptic connections. It involves seamless 2D stitching of the images within a serial section followed by 3D alignment of the stitched sections. The high throughput of ssEM necessitates 2D stitching to be done at the pace of imaging, which currently produces tens of terabytes per day. To achieve this, we present a modular volume assembly software pipeline ASAP(Assembly Stitching and Alignment Pipeline) that is scalable and parallelized to work with distributed systems. The pipeline is built on top of the Render [18] services used in the volume assembly of the brain of adult Drosophila melanogaster [2]. It achieves high throughput by operating on the meta-data and transformations of each image stored in a database, thus eliminating the need to render intermediate output. The modularity of ASAP allows for easy adaptation to new algorithms without significant changes to the workflow. The software pipeline includes a complete set of tools to do stitching, automated quality control, 3D section alignment, and rendering of the assembled volume to disk. We also implemented a workflow engine that executes the volume assembly workflow in an automated fashion triggered following the transfer of raw data. ASAP has been successfully utilized for continuous processing of several large-scale datasets of the mouse visual cortex and human brain samples including one cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex [1, 25]. The pipeline also has multi-channel processing capabilities and can be applied to fluorescence and multi-modal datasets like array tomography.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Neuroanatomically-Based Age Prediction in Youth</a></h4>

              
                Application of machine learning algorithms to structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data has yielded behaviorally meaningful estimates of the biological age of the brain (brain-age). The choice of the machine learning approach in estimating brain-age in children and adolescents is important because age-related brain changes in these age-groups are dynamic. However, the comparative performance of the multiple machine learning algorithms available has not been systematically appraised. To address this gap, the present study evaluated the accuracy (Mean Absolute Error; MAE) and computational efficiency of 21 machine learning algorithms using sMRI data from 2,105 typically developing individuals aged 5 to 22 years from five cohorts. The trained models were then tested in an independent holdout datasets, comprising 4,078 pre-adolescents (aged 9-10 years). The algorithms encompassed parametric and nonparametric, Bayesian, linear and nonlinear, tree-based, and kernel-based models. Sensitivity analyses were performed for parcellation scheme, number of neuroimaging input features, number of cross-validation folds, and sample size. The best performing algorithms were Extreme Gradient Boosting (MAE of 1.25 years for females and 1.57 years for males), Random Forest Regression (MAE of 1.23 years for females and 1.65 years for males) and Support Vector Regression with Radial Basis Function Kernel (MAE of 1.47 years for females and 1.72 years for males) which had acceptable and comparable computational efficiency. Findings of the present study could be used as a guide for optimizing methodology when quantifying age-related changes during development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A scale-invariant perturbative approach to study information communication in dynamic brain networks</a></h4>

              
                How communication among neuronal ensembles shapes functional brain dynamics at the large scale is a question of fundamental importance to Neuroscience. To date, researchers have primarily relied on two alternative ways to address this issue 1) in-silico neurodynamical modelling of functional brain dynamics by choosing biophysically inspired non-linear systems, interacting via a connection topology driven by empirical data; and 2) identifying topological measures to quantify network structure and studying them in tandem with functional metrics of interest, e.g. co-variation of time series in brain regions from fast (EEG/ MEG) and slow (fMRI) timescales. While the modelling approaches are limited in scope to only scales of the nervous system for which dynamical models are well defined, the latter approach does not take into account how the network architecture and intrinsic regional node dynamics contribute together to inter-regional communication in the brain. Thus, developing a generalized scale-invariant measure of interaction between network topology and constituent regional dynamics can potentially resolve how transmission of perturbations in brain networks alter function e.g. by neuropathologies, or the intervention strategies designed to mitigate them. In this work, we introduce a recently developed theoretical perturbative framework in network science into a neuroscientific framework, to conceptualize the interaction of regional dynamics and network architecture in a quantifiable manner. This framework further provides insights into the information communication contributions of putative regions and sub-networks in the brain, irrespective of the observational scale of the phenomenon (firing rates to BOLD fMRI time series). The proposed approach can directly quantify network-dynamical interactions without reliance on a specific class of models or response characteristics: linear/nonlinear. By simply gauging the asymmetries in responses to perturbations, we obtain insights into the significance of regions in communication and their influence over the rest of the network. Moreover, coupling perturbations with functional lesions can also answer which regions contribute the most to information spread: a quantity termed Flow. The simplicity of the proposed technique allows translation to an experimental setting where the response asymmetries and flow can inversely act as a window into the dynamics of regions. For proof-of-concept, we apply the perturbative approach on in-silico data generated for human resting state network dynamics, using different established dynamical models that mimic empirical observations. We also apply the perturbation approach at the level of large scale Resting State Networks (RSNs) to gauge the range of network-dynamical interactions in mediating information flow across brain regions.

                Background: Human milk contains large amounts of exosomes (MEs) and their regulatory microRNA cargos, whereas infant formulas contain only trace amounts of MEs and microRNAs. Breastfeeding has been implicated in optimal brain development but experimental evidence linking ME intake with brain development is limited. Objectives: We assessed the transport of MEs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and ME accumulation in distinct regions of the brain in brain endothelial cells and suckling mice. We further assessed BME-dependent gene expression profiles and effects on the dendritic complexity of hippocampal granule cells and phenotypes of BME depletion in neonate, juvenile and adult mice. Methods: The transfer of MEs across the BBB was assessed by using bovine MEs labeled with FM4-64 or loaded with IRDye-labeled miR-34a in murine brain endothelial bEnd.3 cell monolayers and dual chamber systems, and in wild-type newborn pups fostered to exosome and cargo tracking (ECT) dams that express MEs endogenously labeled with a CD63-eGFP fusion protein for subsequent analysis by serial two-photon tomography and staining with anti-eGFP antibodies. Effects of MEs on gene expression and dendritic architecture of granule cells was analyzed in hippocampi from juvenile mice fed exosome and RNA-depleted (ERD) and exosome and RNA-sufficient (ERS) diets by using RNA-sequencing analysis and Golgi-Cox staining followed by integrated neuronal tracing and morphological analysis of neuronal dendrites, respectively. Spatial learning and severity of kainic acid-induced seizures were assessed in mice fed ERD and ERS diets. Results: bEnd.3 cells internalized MEs by using a saturable transport mechanism and secreted miR-34a across the basal membrane. MEs penetrated the entire brain in fostering experiments; major regions of accumulation included the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum. Two hundred ninety-five genes were differentially expressed in hippocampi from male mice fed ERD and ERS diets; high-confidence gene networks included pathways implicated in axon guidance and calcium signaling. Only one gene was differentially expressed in females fed the experimental diets. Juvenile pups fed the ERD diet had reduced dendritic complexity of dentate granule cells in the hippocampus, scored nine-fold lower in the Barnes maze test of spatial learning and memory (P < 0.01), and the severity of seizures was 5-fold higher following kainic acid administration in adult mice fed the ERD diet compared to mice fed the ERS diet (P < 0.01). Conclusions: MEs cross the BBB and contribute toward optimal neuronal development, spatial learning and memory, and resistance to kainic acid-induced seizures in mice.

                Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are strongly innervated by GABAergic neurons in the tail of the VTA (tVTA), also known as the rostralmedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). Disinhibition of dopamine neurons through firing of the GABAergic neurons projecting from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) leads to reward seeking and consumption through dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. VTA dopamine neurons respond to changes in motivational state, yet less is known of whether tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons or the LH GABAergic neurons that project to them are also affected by changes in motivational state, such as fasting. An acute 16 h overnight fast decreased the excitability of tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons of male and female mice. In addition, fasting decreased synaptic strength at LH GABA to tVTA/RMTg GABAergic synapses, indicated by reduced amplitude of optically evoked currents, decreased readily releasable pool (RRP) size and replenishment. Optical stimulation of LH GABA terminals suppressed evoked action potentials of tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons in unfasted mice, but this effect decreased following fasting in both males and females. Furthermore, during fasting, LH GABA inputs to tVTA/RMTg neurons maintained functional connectivity during depolarization, as depolarization block was reduced following fasting. Taken together, inhibitory synaptic transmission from LH GABA inputs onto tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons decreases following fasting, however ability to functionally inhibit tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons is preserved, allowing for possible disinhibition of dopamine neurons and subsequent foraging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interaction between theta-phase and spike-timing dependent plasticity simulates theta induced memory effects</a></h4>

              
                Rodent studies suggest that spike timing relative to hippocampal theta activity determines whether potentiation or depression of synapses arise. Such changes also depend on spike timing between pre- and post-synaptic neurons, known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). STDP, together with theta-phase-dependent learning, has inspired several computational models of learning and memory. However, evidence to elucidate how these mechanisms directly link to human episodic memory is lacking. In a computational model, we modulate long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of STDP, by opposing phases of a simulated theta rhythm. We fit parameters to a hippocampal cell culture study in which LTP and LTD were observed to occur in opposing phases of a theta rhythm. Further, we modulated two inputs by cosine waves with synchronous and asynchronous phase offsets and replicate key findings in human episodic memory. Learning advantage was found for the synchronous condition, as compared to the asynchronous conditions, and was specific to theta modulated inputs. Importantly, simulations with and without each mechanism suggest that both STDP and theta-phase-dependent plasticity are necessary to replicate the findings. Together, the results indicate a role for circuit-level mechanisms, which bridges the gap between slice preparation studies and human memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population-level asymmetry of the cerebral cortex: reproducibility, lifespan changes, heritability, and individual differences</a></h4>

              
                Cortical asymmetry is a ubiquitous feature of brain organization that is altered in neurodevelopmental disorders and aging. Achieving consensus on cortical asymmetries in humans is necessary to uncover the genetic-developmental mechanisms that shape them and factors moderating cortical lateralization. Here, we delineate population-level asymmetry in cortical thickness and surface area vertex-wise in 7 datasets and chart asymmetry trajectories across life (4-89 years; observations = 3937; 70% longitudinal). We reveal asymmetry interrelationships, heritability, and test associations in UK Biobank (N=~37,500). Cortical asymmetry was robust across datasets. Whereas areal asymmetry is predominantly stable across life, thickness asymmetry grows in development and declines in aging. Areal asymmetry correlates in specific regions, whereas thickness asymmetry is globally interrelated across cortex and suggests high directional variability in global thickness lateralization. Areal asymmetry is moderately heritable (max h2SNP ~19%), and phenotypic correlations are reflected by high genetic correlations, whereas heritability of thickness asymmetry is low. Finally, we detected an asymmetry association with cognition and confirm recently-reported handedness links. Results suggest areal asymmetry is developmentally stable and arises in early life, whereas developmental changes in thickness asymmetry may lead to directional variability of global thickness lateralization. Our results bear enough reproducibility to serve as a standard for future brain asymmetry studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mesoscopic Quantification of Cortical Architecture in the Living Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Mesoscopic (0.1-0.5 mm) interrogation of the living human brain is critical for a comprehensive understanding of brain structure and function. However, in vivo techniques for mesoscopic imaging have been hampered by the sensitivity challenges of acquiring data at very high resolutions and the lack of analysis tools that can retain fine-scale detail while also accurately positioning measurements relative to the complex folded structure of the cerebral cortex. Here, we present an experimental dataset in which we image the anatomical structure of the visual and auditory cortices of five participants at 0.35 x 0.35 x 0.35 mm3 resolution. To analyze this challenging dataset, we design and implement two sets of novel methodology: a method for mitigating imaging artifacts related to blood motion and a suite of software tools for accurate quantification and visualization of the mesoscopic structure of the cortical surface. Applying these methods, we demonstrate the ability to clearly identify structures that are visible only at the mesoscopic scale, including cortical layers and intracortical blood vessels. We freely share our dataset and tools with the research community, thereby enabling investigations of fine-scale neurobiological structures in both the current and future datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate the viability of mesoscopic imaging as a quantitative tool for studying the living human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An exploratory study of EEG connectivity during the first year of life in preterm and full-term infants</a></h4>

              
                Aim: to evaluate EEG connectivity during the first year of age in healthy full-term infants and preterm infants with prenatal and perinatal risk factors for perinatal brain damage. Methods: Three groups of infants were studied: healthy at full-term infants (n = 71), moderate and late preterm infants (n = 54), and very preterm infants (n = 56). All preterm infants had perinatal or/and perinatal risk factors for brain damage. EEG was obtained during phase II of natural NREM sleep. EEG analysis was performed in 24 segments of 2.56 s free of artifacts. For the calculation of EEG sources, the spectral Structured Sparse Bayesian Learning (sSSBL) was used. Connectivity was computed by the phase-lag index. Results: In healthy full-term infants, EEG interhemispheric connectivity in the different frequency bands followed similar trends with age to those reported in each frequency band: delta connectivity decreases, theta increases at the end of the year, in the alpha band, different trends were observed according to the region studied, and beta interhemispheric connectivity decreases with age. EEG connectivity in preterm infants showed differences from the results of the term group. Discussion: Important structural findings may explain the differences observed in EEG connectivity between the term and preterm groups. Conclusion: The study of EEG connectivity during the first year of age gives essential information on normal and abnormal brain development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reducing voltage-dependent potassium channel Kv3.4 levels ameliorates synapse loss in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Synapse loss is associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease (AD) and owing to their plastic nature, synapses are an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. Oligomeric amyloid beta (Ab) around amyloid plaques is known to contribute to synapse loss in mouse models and is associated with synapse loss in human AD brain tissue, but the mechanisms leading from Ab; to synapse loss remain unclear. Recent data suggest that the fast-activating and -inactivating voltage-gated potassium channel subtype 3.4 (Kv3.4) may play a role in Ab-mediated neurotoxicity. Here, we tested whether this channel could also be involved in Ab synaptotoxicity. Using adeno-associated virus and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology, we reduced Kv3.4 expression in neurons of the somatosensory cortex of APP/PS1 mice. These mice express human familial AD associated mutations in amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 and develop amyloid plaques and plaque-associated synapse loss similar to that observed in AD brain. We observe that reducing Kv3.4 levels ameliorates dendritic spine loss and changes spine morphology compared to control virus. In support of translational relevance, Kv3.4 protein was observed in human AD and control brain and is associated with synapses in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Interestingly, we observe a decrease in Kv3.4 expression in iPSC derived cortical neurons when they are challenged with human Alzheimers disease derived brain homogenate. These results suggest that approaches to reduce Kv3.4 expression and/or function could be protective against Ab-induced synaptic alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-invasive real-time access to spatial attention information from 3T fMRI BOLD signals</a></h4>

              
                Access to higher cognitive functions in real-time remains very challenging, because these functions are internally driven and their assessment is based onto indirect measures. In addition, recent finding show that these functions are highly dynamic. Previous studies using intra-cortical recordings in monkeys, succeed to access the (x,y) position of covert spatial attention, in real-time, using classification methods applied to monkey prefrontal multi-unit activity and local field potentials. In contrast, the direct access to attention with non-invasive methods is limited to predicting the attention localisation based on a quadrant classification. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility to track covert spatial attention localization using non-invasive fMRI BOLD signals, with an unprecedented spatial resolution. We further show that the errors produced by the decoder are not randomly distributed but concentrate on the locations neighbouring the cued location and that behavioral errors correlate with weaker decoding performance. Last, we also show that the voxels contributing to the decoder precisely match the visual retinotopic organization of the occipital cortex and that single trial access to attention is limited by the intrinsic dynamics of spatial attention. Taken together, these results open the way to the development of remediation and enhancement neurofeedback protocols targeting the attentional function.

                Intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau) in the brain is associated with cognitive and motor impairments, and ultimately neurodegeneration. We investigate how human pTau affects cells and network activity in the hippocampal formation of THY-Tau22 tauopathy model mice in vivo. We find that pTau preferentially accumulates in deep-layer pyramidal neurons, leading to neurodegeneration, and we establish that pTau spreads to oligodendrocytes. During goal-directed virtual navigation in aged transgenic mice, we detect fewer high-firing pyramidal cells, with the remaining cells retaining their coupling to theta oscillations. Analysis of network oscillations and firing patterns of pyramidal and GABAergic neurons recorded in head-fixed and freely-moving mice suggests preserved neuronal coordination. In spatial memory tests, transgenic mice have reduced short-term familiarity but spatial working and reference memory are surprisingly normal. We hypothesize that unimpaired subcortical network mechanisms implementing cortical neuronal coordination compensate for the widespread pTau aggregation, loss of high-firing cells and neurodegeneration.

                INTRODUCTION: Plasma phospho-tau 181 (p-tau181) is a promising blood biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. However, its predictive validity for age-related cognitive decline without dementia remains unclear. Several forms of p-tau have been shown to contribute to synapse degeneration, but it is unknown whether p-tau181 is present in synapses. Here, we tested whether plasma p-tau181predicts cognitive decline and whether it is present in synapses in human brain. METHODS: General cognitive ability and plasma p-tau181 concentration were measured in 195 participants at ages 72 and 82. Levels of p-tau181 in total homogenate and synaptic fractions were compared with western blot (n=10-12 per group), and synaptic localisation was examined using array tomography. RESULTS: Elevated baseline plasma p-tau181 and increasing p-tau181 over time predicted steeper general cognitive decline. We observe p-tau181 in neurites, presynapses, and post-synapses in the brain. DISCUSSION: Baseline and subsequent change in plasma p-tau181 may represent rare biomarkers of differences in cognitive ageing across the 8th decade of life and may play a role in synaptic function in the brain.

                Infancy is a dynamic and immensely important period in human brain development. Studies of infant functional development using resting-state fMRI rely on precisely defined cortical parcellation maps. However, available adult-based functional parcellation maps are not applicable for infants due to their substantial differences in functional organizations. Fine-grained infant-dedicated cortical parcellation maps are highly desired but remain scarce, due to difficulties ranging from acquiring to processing of infant brain MRIs. In this study, leveraging 1,064 high-resolution longitudinal rs-fMRIs from 197 infants from birth to 24 months and advanced infant-dedicated processing tools, we create the first set of infant-specific, fine-grained cortical functional parcellation maps. Besides the conventional folding-based cortical registration, we specifically establish the functional correspondences across individuals using functional gradient densities and generate both age-specific and age-common fine-grained parcellation maps. The first set of comprehensive brain functional developmental maps are accordingly derived, and reveals a complex, hitherto unseen multi-peak fluctuation development pattern in temporal variations of gradient density, network sizes, and local efficiency, with more dynamic changes during the first 9 months than other ages. Our proposed method is applicable in generating fine-grained parcellations for the whole lifespan, and our parcellation maps will be available online to advance the neuroimaging field.

                Objective: We developed a novel transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device to generate flexible stimuli and patterns. The system synthesizes digital equivalents of analog waveforms, relying on the filtering properties of the nervous system. Here, we test the hypothesis that the novel pulses can mimic the effect of conventional pulses on the cortex. Approach: A second-generation programmable TMS (pTMS2) stimulator with magnetic pulse shaping capabilities using pulse-width modulation (PWM) was tested. A computational and an in-human study on twelve healthy participants compared the neuronal effects of conventional and modulation-based stimuli. Main results: Both the computational modeling and the in-human stimulation showed that the PWM-based system can synthesize pulses to effectively stimulate the human brain, equivalent to conventional stimulators. The comparison includes motor threshold, MEP latency and input-output curve measurements. Significance: PWM stimuli can fundamentally imitate the effect of conventional magnetic stimuli while adding considerable flexibility to TMS systems, enabling the generation of highly configurable TMS protocols.

                Multiple distinct brain areas have been implicated in memory including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (STR), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Information-exchange across these widespread networks requires flexible coordination at a fine time-scale. In the present study, we collected high-density recordings from the PFC, STR, and VTA of male rats during baseline, encoding, consolidation, and retrieval stages of memory formation. Novel sub-regional clustering analyses identified patterns of spatially restricted, temporally coherent, and frequency specific signals that were reproducible across days and were modulated by behavioral states. Clustering identified miniscule patches of neural tissue. Generalized eigen decomposition (GED) reduced each cluster to a single time series. Amplitude envelope correlation of the cluster time series was used to assess functional connectivity between clusters. Dense intra- and inter regional functional connectivity characterized the baseline period, with delta oscillations playing an outsized role. There was a dramatic pruning of network connectivity during encoding. Connectivity rebounded during consolidation, but connections in the theta band became stronger, and those in the delta band were weaker. Finally, during retrieval, connections were not as severely reduced as they had been during encoding, and specifically theta and higher-frequency connections were stronger. Underlying these connectivity changes, the anatomical extent of clusters observed in the gamma band in the PFC and in both the gamma and delta bands in the VTA changed markedly across behavioral conditions. These results demonstrate the brain's ability to reorganize functionally at both the intra- and inter-regional levels during different stages of memory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human-in-the-loop optimization of visual prosthetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Retinal prostheses are a promising strategy to restore sight to patients with retinal degenerative diseases. These devices compensate for the loss of photoreceptors by electrically stimulating neurons in the retina. Currently, the visual function that can be recovered with such devices is very limited. This is due, in part, to current spread, unintended axonal activation, and the limited resolution of existing devices. Here we show, using a recent model of prosthetic vision, that optimizing how visual stimuli are encoded by the device can help overcome some of these limitations, leading to dramatic improvements in visual perception. We propose a strategy to do this in practice, using patients' feedback in a visual task. The main challenge of our approach comes from the fact that, typically, one only has access to a limited number of noisy responses from patients. We propose two ways to deal with this: first, we use a model of prosthetic vision to constrain and simplify the optimisation; second, we use preferential Bayesian optimisation to efficiently learn the encoder using minimal trials. As a proof-of concept, we presented healthy subjects with visual stimuli generated by a recent model of prosthetic vision, to replicate the perceptual experience of patients fitted with an implant. Our optimisation procedure led to significant and robust improvements in perceived image quality, that transferred to increased performance in other tasks. Importantly, our strategy is agnostic to the type of prosthesis and thus could readily be implemented in existing implants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping of morpho-electric features to molecular identity of cortical inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge of the cell-type-specific composition of the brain is useful in order to understand the role of each cell type as part of the network. Here, we estimated the composition of the whole cortex in terms of well characterised morphological and electrophysiological inhibitory neuron types (me-types). We derived probabilistic me-type densities from an existing atlas of molecularly defined cell-type densities in the mouse cortex. We used a well-established me-type classification from rat somatosensory cortex to populate the cortex. These me-types were well characterized morphologically and electrophysiologically but they lacked molecular marker identity labels. To extrapolate this missing information, we employed an additional dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science containing molecular identity as well as morphological and electrophysiological data for mouse cortical neurons. We first built a latent space based on a number of comparable morphological and electrical features common to both data sources. We then identified 13 morpho-electrical clusters that merged neurons from both datasets while being molecularly homogeneous. The resulting clusters best mirror the molecular identity classification solely using available morpho-electrical features. Finally, we stochastically assigned a molecular identity to a me-type neuron based on the latent space cluster it was assigned to. The resulting mapping was used to derive inhibitory me-types densities in the cortex.

	<p>Treatment refractory Tourette syndrome has been shown to be improved with deep brain stimulation, but with multiple possible stimulation locations and variable and incomplete benefit. This study presents a single case of complete amelioration of motor and verbal tics in a patient with Tourette syndrome during placement of 12 stereo-EEG electrodes to identify optimal targets for permanent stimulating electrodes. Subsequently, substantial improvement in motor and verbal tic frequency occurred with placement and programming of permanent electrodes in bilateral globus pallidus internus and nucleus accumbens, but without the complete resolution seen during depth electrode placement. We suggest that simultaneous stimulation at multiple patient-specific targets could provide effective control of Tourette symptomatology, but further study will be needed.</p>

	<p>About 25&amp;amp;ndash;35% of United States veterans who fought in the 1990&amp;amp;ndash;1991 Gulf War report several moderate or severe chronic systemic symptoms, defined as Gulf War illness (GWI). Thirty years later, there is little consensus on the causes or biological underpinnings of GWI. The Gulf War Era Cohort and Biorepository (GWECB) was designed to investigate genetic and environmental associations with GWI and consists of 1343 veterans. We investigate candidate gene&amp;amp;ndash;toxicant interactions that may be associated with GWI based on prior associations found in human and animal model studies, focusing on SNPs in or near ACHE, BCHE, and PON1 genes to replicate results from prior studies. SOD1 was also considered as a candidate gene. CDC Severe GWI, the primary outcome, was observed in 26% of the 810 deployed veterans included in this study. The interaction between the candidate SNP rs662 and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills was found to be associated with CDC Severe GWI. Interactions between PB pill exposure and rs3917545, rs3917550, and rs2299255, all in high linkage disequilibrium in PON1, were also associated with respiratory symptoms. These SNPs could point toward biological pathways through which GWI may develop, which could lead to biomarkers to detect GWI or to better treatment options for veterans with GWI.</p>

                To guide behavior, perceptual systems must operate on intrinsically ambiguous sensory input. Observers are usually able to acknowledge the uncertainty of their perception, but in some cases, they critically fail to do so. Here, we show that a physiological correlate of ambiguity can be found in pupil dilation even when...

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Off-Target Expression of Cre-Dependent Adeno-Associated Viruses in Wild-Type C57BL/6J Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are a commonly used tool in neuroscience to efficiently label, trace, and/or manipulate neuronal populations. Highly specific targeting can be achieved through recombinase-dependent AAVs in combination with transgenic rodent lines that express Cre-recombinase in specific cell types. Visualization of viral expression is typically achieved through fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g., GFP or mCherry) packaged within the AAV genome. Although nonamplified fluorescence is usually sufficient to observe viral expression, immunohistochemical amplification of the fluorescent reporter is routinely used to improve viral visualization. In the present study, Cre-dependent AAVs were injected into the neocortex of wild-type C57BL/6J mice. While we observed weak but consistent nonamplified off-target double inverted open reading frame (DIO) expression in C57BL/6J mice, antibody amplification of the GFP or mCherry reporter revealed notable Cre-independent viral expression. Off-target expression of DIO constructs in wild-type C57BL/6J mice occurred independent of vendor, AAV serotype, or promoter. We also evaluated whether Cre-independent expression had functional effects via designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADD agonist C21 (compound 21) had no effect on contextual fear conditioning or c-Fos expression in DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells of C57BL/6J mice. Together, our results indicate that DIO constructs have off-target expression in wild-type subjects. Our findings are particularly important for the design of experiments featuring sensitive systems and/or quantitative measurements that could be negatively impacted by off-target expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deletion of Stim1 in Hypothalamic Arcuate Nucleus Kiss1 Neurons Potentiates Synchronous GCaMP Activity and Protects against Diet-Induced Obesity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are essential for reproduction, but their role in the control of energy balance and other homeostatic functions remains unclear. High-frequency firing of hypothalamic arcuate Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons releases kisspeptin into the median eminence, and neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin onto neighboring Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to generate a slow EPSP mediated by TRPC5 channels that entrains intermittent, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. High-frequency optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also releases glutamate to excite the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and inhibit the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons via metabotropic glutamate receptors. At the molecular level, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is critically involved in the regulation of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and neuronal excitability through its interaction with plasma membrane (PM) calcium (e.g., TRPC) channels. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons would increase neuronal excitability and their synchronous firing, which ultimately would affect energy homeostasis. Using optogenetics in combination with whole-cell recording and GCaMP6 imaging in slices, we discovered that deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1 neurons significantly increased the amplitude and duration of the slow EPSP and augmented synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i oscillations in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons amplified the actions of NKB and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD). Therefore, STIM1 appears to play a critical role in regulating synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, which ultimately affects the coordination between energy homeostasis and reproduction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are essential for stimulating the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and maintaining fertility. However, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons appear to be a key player in coordinating energy balance with reproduction. The regulation of calcium channels and hence calcium signaling is critically dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) calcium channels. We have conditionally deleted <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and found that it significantly increased the excitability of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tonic GABAA Receptor-Mediated Currents of Human Cortical GABAergic Interneurons Vary Amongst Cell Types</a></h4>

              
                <p>Persistent anion conductances through GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are important modulators of neuronal excitability. However, it is currently unknown how the amplitudes of these currents vary among different cell types in the human neocortex, particularly among diverse GABAergic interneurons. We have recorded 101 interneurons in and near layer 1 from cortical tissue surgically resected from both male and female patients, visualized 84 of them and measured tonic GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R currents in 48 cells with an intracellular [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>] of 65 m<scp>m</scp> and in the presence of 5 &mu;<scp>m</scp> GABA. We compare these tonic currents among five groups of interneurons divided by firing properties and four types of interneuron defined by axonal distributions; rosehip, neurogliaform, stalked-bouton, layer 2&ndash;3 innervating and a pool of other cells. Interestingly, the rosehip cell, a type of interneuron only described thus far in human tissue, and layer 2&ndash;3 innervating cells exhibit larger tonic currents than other layer 1 interneurons, such as neurogliaform and stalked-bouton cells; the latter two groups showing no difference. The positive allosteric modulators of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs allopregnanolone and DS2 also induced larger current shifts in the rosehip and layer 2&ndash;3 innervating cells, consistent with higher expression of the  subunit of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R in these neurons. We have also examined how patient parameters, such as age, seizures, type of cancer and anticonvulsant treatment may alter tonic inhibitory currents in human neurons. The cell type-specific differences in tonic inhibitory currents could potentially be used to selectively modulate cortical circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tonic currents through GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are a potential therapeutic target for a number of neurologic and psychiatric conditions. Here, we show that these currents in human cerebral cortical GABAergic neurons display cell type-specific differences in their amplitudes which implies differential modulation of their excitability. Additionally, we examine whether the amplitudes of the tonic currents measured in our study show any differences between patient populations, finding some evidence that age, seizures, type of cancer, and anticonvulsant treatment may alter tonic inhibition in human tissue. These results advance our understanding of how pathology affects neuronal excitability and could potentially be used to selectively modulate cortical circuitry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Extent of Task Specificity for Visual and Tactile Sequences in the Auditory Cortex of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing</a></h4>

              
                <p>It has been proposed that the auditory cortex in the deaf humans might undergo task-specific reorganization. However, evidence remains scarce as previous experiments used only two very specific tasks (temporal processing and face perception) in visual modality. Here, congenitally deaf/hard of hearing and hearing women and men were enrolled in an fMRI experiment as we sought to fill this evidence gap in two ways. First, we compared activation evoked by a temporal processing task performed in two different modalities, visual and tactile. Second, we contrasted this task with a perceptually similar task that focuses on the spatial dimension. Additional control conditions consisted of passive stimulus observation. In line with the task specificity hypothesis, the auditory cortex in the deaf was activated by temporal processing in both visual and tactile modalities. This effect was selective for temporal processing relative to spatial discrimination. However, spatial processing also led to significant auditory cortex recruitment which, unlike temporal processing, occurred even during passive stimulus observation. We conclude that auditory cortex recruitment in the deaf and hard of hearing might involve interplay between task-selective and pluripotential mechanisms of cross-modal reorganization. Our results open several avenues for the investigation of the full complexity of the cross-modal plasticity phenomenon.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies suggested that the auditory cortex in the deaf may change input modality (sound to vision) while keeping its function (e.g., rhythm processing). We investigated this hypothesis by asking deaf or hard of hearing and hearing adults to discriminate between temporally and spatially complex sequences in visual and tactile modalities. The results show that such function-specific brain reorganization, as has previously been demonstrated in the visual modality, also occurs for tactile processing. On the other hand, they also show that for some stimuli (spatial) the auditory cortex activates automatically, which is suggestive of a take-over by a different kind of cognitive function. The observed differences in processing of sequences might thus result from an interplay of task-specific and pluripotent plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Sexually Dimorphic Olfactory Neuron Mediates Fixed Action Transition during Courtship Ritual in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals perform a series of actions in a fixed order during ritualistic innate behaviors. Although command neurons and sensory pathways responding to external stimuli that trigger these behaviors have been identified, how each action is induced in a fixed order in response to multimodal sensory stimuli remains unclear. Here, the sexually dimorphic lateral antennal lobe tract projection neuron 4 (lPN4) in male <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> mediates the expression of a fixed behavioral action pattern at the beginning of the courtship ritual, in which a male taps a female body and then extends a wing unilaterally to produce a courtship song. We found that blocking the synaptic output of lPN4 caused an increase in the ratio of male flies that extended a wing unilaterally without tapping the female body, whereas excitation of lPN4 suppressed the transition from the tapping phase to the unilateral wing extension phase. Real-time calcium imaging showed that lPN4 is activated by a volatile pheromone, palmitoleic acid, whose responses were inhibited by simultaneous gustatory stimulation with female cuticular hydrocarbons, showing the existence of an "AND-gate" for multimodal sensory inputs during male courtship behaviors. These results suggest that the function of lPN4 is to suppress unilateral wing extension while responding to a female smell, which is released by appropriate contact chemosensory inputs received when tapping a female. As the female smell also promotes male courtship behaviors, the olfactory system is ready to simultaneously promote and suppress the progress of courtship actions while responding to a female smell.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although it has been 80 years since Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen introduced how multiple acts comprising separate innate behaviors are released in a fixed order according to external stimuli, the neural circuits responsible for such fixed action patterns remain largely unknown. The male courtship behavior of <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> is a good model to investigate how such a fixed behavioral sequence is determined in the brain. Here, we show that lateral antennal lobe tract projection neuron 4 (lPN4) in <I>D. melanogaster</I> functions as an "AND-gate" for volatile and contact chemosensory inputs, mediating the expression of tapping behaviors before unilateral wing extension during male courtship rituals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perigenual and Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Afferents Converge on Common Pyramidal Cells in Amygdala Subregions of the Macaque</a></h4>

              
                <p>The subgenual (sgACC) and perigenual (pgACC) anterior cingulate are important afferents of the amygdala, with different cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and function. The sgACC is associated with arousal mechanisms linked to salient cues, whereas the pgACC is engaged in conflict decision-making, including in social contexts. After placing same-size, small volume tracer injections into sgACC and pgACC of the same hemisphere in male macaques, we examined anterogradely labeled fiber distribution to understand how these different functional systems communicate in the main amygdala nuclei at both mesocopic and cellular levels. The sgACC has broad-based termination patterns. In contrast, the pgACC has a more restricted pattern, which was always nested in sgACC terminals. Terminal overlap occurred in subregions of the accessory basal and basal nuclei, which we termed "hotspots." In triple-labeling confocal studies, the majority of randomly selected CaMKII&alpha;-positive cells (putative amygdala glutamatergic neurons) in hotspots received dual contacts from the sgACC and pgACC. The ratio of dual contacts occurred over a surprisingly narrow range, suggesting a consistent, tight balance of afferent contacts on postsynaptic neurons. Large boutons, which are associated with greater synaptic strength, were ~3 times more frequent on sgACC versus pgACC axon terminals in hotspots, consistent with a fast "driver" function. Together, the results reveal a nested interaction in which pgACC ("conflict/social monitoring") terminals converge with the broader sgACC ("salience") terminals at both the mesoscopic and cellular level. The presynaptic organization in hotspots suggests that shifts in arousal states can rapidly and flexibly influence decision-making functions in the amygdala.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subgenual (sgACC) and perigenual cingulate (pgACC) have distinct structural and functional characteristics and are important afferent modulators of the amygdala. The sgACC is critical for arousal, whereas the pgACC mediates conflict-monitoring, including in social contexts. Using dual tracer injections in the same monkey, we found that sgACC inputs broadly project in the main amygdala nuclei, whereas pgACC inputs were more restricted and nested in zones containing sgACC terminals (hotspots). The majority of CaMKII&alpha; + (excitatory) amygdala neurons in hotspots received converging contacts, which were tightly balanced. pgACC and sgACC afferent streams are therefore highly interdependent in these specific amygdala subregions, permitting "internal arousal" states to rapidly shape responses of amygdala neurons involved in conflict and social monitoring networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Global Configuration of Visual Stimuli Alters Co-Fluctuations of Cross-Hemispheric Human Brain Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>We tested how a stimulus gestalt, defined by the neuronal interaction between local and global features of a stimulus, is represented within human primary visual cortex (V1). We used high-resolution fMRI, which serves as a surrogate of neuronal activation, to measure co-fluctuations within subregions of V1 as (male and female) subjects were presented with peripheral stimuli, each with different global configurations. We found stronger cross-hemisphere correlations when fine-scale V1 cortical subregions represented parts of the same object compared with different objects. This result was consistent with the vertical bias in global processing and, critically, was independent of the task and local discontinuities within objects. Thus, despite the relatively small receptive fields of neurons within V1, global stimulus configuration affects neuronal processing via correlated fluctuations between regions that represent different sectors of the visual field.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We provide the first evidence for the impact of global stimulus configuration on cross-hemispheric fMRI fluctuations, measured in human primary visual cortex. Our results are consistent with changes in the level of -band synchrony, which has been shown to be affected by global stimulus configuration, being reflected in the level fMRI co-fluctuations. These data help narrow the gap between knowledge of global stimulus configuration encoding at the single-neuron level versus at the behavioral level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distal CA1 Maintains a More Coherent Spatial Representation than Proximal CA1 When Local and Global Cues Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>Entorhinal cortical projections show segregation along the transverse axis of CA1, with the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) sending denser projections to proximal CA1 (pCA1) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) sending denser projections to distal CA1 (dCA1). Previous studies have reported functional segregation along the transverse axis of CA1 correlated with the functional differences in MEC and LEC. pCA1 shows higher spatial selectivity than dCA1 in these studies. We employ a double rotation protocol, which creates an explicit conflict between the local and the global cues, to understand the differential contributions of these reference frames to the spatial code in pCA1 and dCA1 in male Long&ndash;Evans rats. We show that pCA1 and dCA1 respond differently to this local-global cue conflict. pCA1 representation splits as predicted from the strong conflicting inputs it receives from MEC and dCA3. In contrast, dCA1 rotates more in concert with the global cues. In addition, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable levels of spatial selectivity in this study. This finding differs from the previous studies, perhaps because of richer sensory information available in our behavior arena. Together, these observations indicate that the functional segregation along proximodistal axis of CA1 is not of the amount of spatial selectivity but that of the nature of the different inputs used to create and anchor spatial representations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Subregions of the hippocampus are thought to play different roles in spatial navigation and episodic memory. It was previously thought that the distal part of area CA1 of the hippocampus carries lesser information about space than proximal CA1 (pCA1). We report that distal CA1 (dCA1) spatial representation moves more in concert with the global cues than pCA1 when the local and the global cues conflict. We also show that spatial selectivity is comparable along the proximodistal axis in this experimental protocol. Thus, different parts of the brain receiving differential outputs from pCA1 and dCA1 receive spatial information in different spatial reference frames encoded using different sets of inputs, rather than different amounts of spatial information as thought earlier.</p>

                <p>Multiply-innervated muscle fibers (MIFs) are peculiar to the extraocular muscles as they are non-twitch but produce a slow build up in tension on repetitive stimulation. The motoneurons innervating MIFs establish en grappe terminals along the entire length of the fiber, instead of the typical en plaque terminals that singly-innervated muscle fibers (SIFs) motoneurons establish around the muscle belly. MIF motoneurons have been proposed to participate only in gaze holding and slow eye movements. We aimed to discern the function of MIF motoneurons by recording medial rectus motoneurons of the oculomotor nucleus. Single-unit recordings in awake cats demonstrated that electrophysiologically-identified medial rectus MIF motoneurons participated in different types of eye movements, including fixations, rapid eye movements or saccades, convergences, and the slow and fast phases of the vestibulo-ocular nystagmus, the same as SIF motoneurons did. However, MIF medial rectus motoneurons presented lower firing frequencies, were recruited earlier and showed lower eye position (EP) and eye velocity (EV) sensitivities than SIF motoneurons. MIF medial rectus motoneurons were also smaller, had longer antidromic latencies and a lower synaptic coverage than SIF motoneurons. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) revealed that electrical stimulation to the myotendinous junction, where palisade endings are located, did not recurrently affect the firing probability of medial rectus motoneurons. Therefore, we conclude there is no division of labor between MIF and SIF motoneurons based on the type of eye movement they subserve.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In addition to the common singly-innervated muscle fiber (SIF), extraocular muscles also contain multiply-innervated muscle fibers (MIFs), which are non-twitch and slow in contraction. MIF motoneurons have been proposed to participate only in gaze holding and slow eye movements. In the present work, by single-unit extracellular recordings in awake cats, we demonstrate, however, that both SIF and MIF motoneurons, electrophysiologically-identified, participate in the different types of eye movements. However, MIF motoneurons showed lower firing rates (FRs), recruitment thresholds, and eye-related sensitivities, and could thus contribute to the fine adjustment of eye movements. Electrical stimulation of the myotendinous junction activates antidromically MIF motoneurons but neither MIF nor SIF motoneurons receive a synaptic reafferentation that modifies their discharge probability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brainstem Mechanisms of Pain Modulation: A within-Subjects 7T fMRI Study of Placebo Analgesic and Nocebo Hyperalgesic Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain perception can be powerfully influenced by an individual's expectations and beliefs. Although the cortical circuitry responsible for pain modulation has been thoroughly investigated, the brainstem pathways involved in the modulatory phenomena of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia remain to be directly addressed. This study used ultra-high-field 7 tesla functional MRI (fMRI) to accurately resolve differences in brainstem circuitry present during the generation of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia in healthy human participants (<I>N</I> = 25, 12 male). Over 2 successive days, through blinded application of altered thermal stimuli, participants were deceptively conditioned to believe that two inert creams labeled lidocaine (placebo) and capsaicin (nocebo) were acting to modulate their pain relative to a third Vaseline (control) cream. In a subsequent test phase, fMRI image sets were collected while participants were given identical noxious stimuli to all three cream sites. Pain intensity ratings were collected and placebo and nocebo responses determined. Brainstem-specific fMRI analysis revealed altered activity in key pain modulatory nuclei, including a disparate recruitment of the periaqueductal gray (PAG)&ndash;rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) pathway when both greater placebo and nocebo effects were observed. Additionally, we found that placebo and nocebo responses differentially activated the parabrachial nucleus but overlapped in engagement of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. These data reveal that placebo and nocebo effects are generated through differential engagement of the PAG&ndash;RVM pathway, which in concert with other brainstem sites likely influences the experience of pain by modulating activity at the level of the dorsal horn.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms would support development of effective clinical treatment strategies for both acute and chronic pain. Specific brainstem nuclei have long been known to play a central role in nociceptive modulation; however, because of the small size and complex organization of the nuclei, previous neuroimaging efforts have been limited in directly identifying how these subcortical networks interact during the development of antinociceptive and pro-nociceptive effects. We used ultra-high-field fMRI to resolve brainstem structures and measure signal change during placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. We define overlapping and disparate brainstem circuitry responsible for altering pain perception. These findings extend our understanding of the detailed organization and function of discrete brainstem nuclei involved in pain processing and modulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatially Adjacent Regions in Posterior Cingulate Cortex Represent Familiar Faces at Different Levels of Complexity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Extensive research has shown that perceptual information of faces is processed in a network of hierarchically-organized areas within ventral temporal cortex. For familiar and famous faces, perceptual processing of faces is normally accompanied by extraction of semantic knowledge about the social status of persons. Semantic processing of familiar faces could entail progressive stages of information abstraction. However, the cortical mechanisms supporting multistage processing of familiar faces have not been characterized. Here, using an event-related fMRI experiment, familiar faces from four celebrity groups (actors, singers, politicians, and football players) and unfamiliar faces were presented to the human subjects (both males and females) while they were engaged in a face categorization task. We systematically explored the cortical representations for faces, familiar faces, subcategories of familiar faces, and familiar face identities using whole-brain univariate analysis, searchlight-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and functional connectivity analysis. Convergent evidence from all these analyses revealed a set of overlapping regions within posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) that contained decodable fMRI responses for representing different levels of semantic knowledge about familiar faces. Our results suggest a multistage pathway in PCC for processing semantic information of faces, analogous to the multistage pathway in ventral temporal cortex for processing perceptual information of faces.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recognizing familiar faces is an important component of social communications. Previous research has shown that a distributed network of brain areas is involved in processing the semantic information of familiar faces. However, it is not clear how different levels of semantic information are represented in the brain. Here, we evaluated the multivariate response patterns across the entire cortex to discover the areas that contain information for familiar faces, subcategories of familiar faces, and identities of familiar faces. The searchlight maps revealed that different levels of semantic information are represented in topographically adjacent areas within posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The results suggest that semantic processing of faces is mediated through progressive stages of information abstraction in PCC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in Protein Kinase A Signaling of the Latent Postoperative Pain Sensitization That Is Masked by Kappa Opioid Receptors in the Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <p>Latent sensitization (LS) of pain engages pronociceptive signaling pathways in the dorsal horn that include NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-&gt;adenylyl cyclase-1 (AC1)-&gt;protein kinase A (PKA), and exchange proteins directly activated by cyclic AMP (Epacs). To determine whether these pathways operate similarly between males and females or are under the inhibitory control of spinal  opioid receptors (KOR), we allowed hyperalgesia to resolve after plantar incision and then blocked KOR with intrathecal administration of LY2456302, which reinstated hyperalgesia and facilitated touch-evoked immunoreactivity of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in neurons (NeuN) but not astrocytes (GFAPs) nor microglia (Iba1). LY2456302 reinstated hyperalgesia even when administered 13 months later, indicating that chronic postoperative pain vulnerability persists for over a year in a latent state of remission. In both sexes, intrathecal MK-801 (an NMDAR competitive antagonist) prevented LY2456302-evoked reinstatement of hyperalgesia as did AC1 gene deletion or the AC1 inhibitor NB001. NB001 also prevented stimulus-evoked pERK. In both sexes, the Epac inhibitor ESI-09 prevented reinstatement, whereas the Epac activator 8-CPT reinstated hyperalgesia. By contrast, the PKA inhibitor H89 prevented reinstatement only in male mice, whereas the PKA activator 6-bnz-cAMP itself evoked reinstatement at all doses tested (3&ndash;30 nmol, i.t.). In neither sex did incision change gene expression of KOR, GluN1, PKA, or Epac1 in dorsal horn. We conclude that sustained KOR signaling inhibits spinal PKA-dependent mechanisms that drive postoperative LS in a sex-dependent manner. Our findings support the development of AC1, PKA, and Epac inhibitors toward a new pharmacotherapy for chronic postoperative pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Because of neural mechanisms that are not well understood, men and women respond differently to treatments for chronic pain. We report that surgical incision recruits a pronociceptive latent pain sensitization that persisted for over a year and was kept in check by the sustained analgesic activity of  opioid receptors. NMDAR-&gt;AC1-&gt;cAMP-&gt;Epac signaling pathways in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord maintain latent sensitization in both males and females; however, only males recruit a PKA-dependent mechanism. This work presents a novel male-specific mechanism for the promotion of chronic postoperative pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subthalamic-Cortical Network Reorganization during Parkinson's Tremor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tremor, a common and often primary symptom of Parkinson's disease, has been modeled with distinct onset and maintenance dynamics. To identify the neurophysiologic correlates of each state, we acquired intraoperative cortical and subthalamic nucleus recordings from 10 patients (9 male, 1 female) performing a naturalistic visual&ndash;motor task. From this task, we isolated short epochs of tremor onset and sustained tremor. Comparing these epochs, we found that the subthalamic nucleus was central to tremor onset, as it drove both motor cortical activity and tremor output. Once tremor became sustained, control of tremor shifted to cortex. At the same time, changes in directed functional connectivity across sensorimotor cortex further distinguished the sustained tremor state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tremor is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). While tremor pathophysiology is thought to involve both basal ganglia and cerebello&ndash;thalamic&ndash;cortical circuits, it is unknown how these structures functionally interact to produce tremor. In this article, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the subthalamic nucleus and sensorimotor cortex in patients with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Using an intraoperative task, we examined tremor in two separate dynamic contexts: when tremor first emerged, and when tremor was sustained. We believe that these findings reconcile several models of Parkinson's tremor, while describing the short-timescale dynamics of subcortical&ndash;cortical interactions during tremor for the first time. These findings may describe a framework for developing proactive and responsive neurostimulation models for specifically treating tremor.</p>

                Background: Hospitals have constituted the limiting resource of the healthcare systems for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic progressed, knowledge of the disease improved, and healthcare systems were expected to be more adapted to provide a more efficient response. The objective of this research was to compare the flow of COVID-19 patients in emergency rooms and hospital wards, between the pandemic's first and second waves at the University Hospital of Vall d’Hebron (Barcelona, Spain), and to compare the profiles, severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients between the two waves. Methods: A retrospective observational analysis of COVID-19 patients attending the hospital from February 24 to April 26, 2020 (first wave) and from July 24, 2020, to May 18, 2021 (second wave) was carried out. We analysed the data of the electronic medical records on patient demographics, comorbidity, severity, and mortality. Results: The daily number of COVID-19 patients entering the emergency rooms (ER) dropped by 65% during the second wave compared to the first wave. During the second wave, patients entering the ER were significantly younger (61 against 63 years old p<0.001) and less severely affected (39% against 48% with a triage level of resuscitation or emergency; p<0.001). ER mortality declined during the second wave (1% against 2%; p<0.000). The daily number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients dropped by 75% during the second wave. Those hospitalised during the second wave were more severely affected (20% against 10%; p<0.001) and were referred to the intensive care unit (ICU) more frequently (21% against 15%; p<0.001). Inpatient mortality showed no significant difference between the two waves. Conclusions: Changes in the flow, severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients entering this tertiary hospital during the two waves may reflect a better adaptation of the health care system and the improvement of knowledge on the disease.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Developmentally regulated pathways for motor skill learning in songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vocal learning in songbirds is mediated by cortico-basal ganglia circuits that govern diverse functions during different stages of development. We investigated developmental changes in axonal projections to and from motor cortical regions that underlie learned vocal behavior in juvenile zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>). Neurons in LMAN-core project to RA, a motor cortical region that drives vocal output; these RA-projecting neurons send a transient collateral projection to AId, a region adjacent to RA, during early vocal development. Both RA and AId project to a region of dorsal thalamus (DLM), which forms a feedback pathway to cortico-basal ganglia circuitry. These projections provide pathways conveying efference copy and a means by which information about vocal motor output could be reintegrated into cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, potentially aiding in the refinement of juvenile vocalizations during learning. We used tract-tracing techniques to label the projections of LMAN-core to AId and of RA to DLM in juvenile songbirds. The volume and density of terminal label in the LMAN-core→AId projection declined substantially during early stages of sensorimotor learning. In contrast, the RA→DLM projection showed no developmental change. The retraction of LMAN-core→AId axon collaterals indicates a loss of efference copy to AId and suggests that projections that are present only during early stages of sensorimotor learning mediate unique, temporally restricted processes of goal-directed learning. Conversely, the persistence of the RA→DLM projection may serve to convey motor information forward to the thalamus to facilitate song production during both learning and maintenance of vocalizations.</p>

                Nanotoxicology is a relatively new field of research concerning the study and application of nanomaterials to evaluate the potential for harmful effects in parallel with the development of applications. Nanotoxicology as a field spans materials synthesis and characterisation, assessment of fate and behaviour, exposure science, toxicology / ecotoxicology, molecular biology and toxicogenomics, epidemiology, safe and sustainable by design approaches, and chemoinformatics and nanoinformatics, thus requiring scientists to work collaboratively, often outside their core expertise area. This interdisciplinarity can lead to challenges in terms of interpretation and reporting, and calls for a platform for sharing of best-practice in nanotoxicology research. The F1000Research Nanotoxicology collection, introduced via this editorial, will provide a place to share accumulated best practice, via original research reports including no-effects studies, protocols and methods papers, software reports and living systematic reviews, which can be updated as new knowledge emerges or as the domain of applicability of the method, model or software is expanded. This editorial introduces the Nanotoxicology Collection in F1000Research. The aim of the collection is to provide an open access platform for nanotoxicology researchers, to support an improved culture of data sharing and documentation of evolving protocols, biological and computational models, software tools and datasets, that can be applied and built upon to develop predictive models and move towards in silico nanotoxicology and nanoinformatics. Submissions will be assessed for fit to the collection and subjected to the F1000Research open peer review process.

                Background: Sapovirus has emerged as a viral cause of acute gastroenteritis. However, there is limited data on sapovirus in Egypt. . The present study aimed to evaluate the presence of sapovirus in children with acute gastroenteritis <5 years in Mansoura, Egypt from January 2019 to February 2020 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: The cross-sectional study enrolled a 100 children <5 years who presented with acute gastroenteritis at an outpatient clinic in Mansoura, Egypt between January 2019 and February 2020. Clinical data, demographic data and a stool sample was collected from each child. Stools were screened by microscopy for parasites and culture methods for bacteria and excluded from the study if positive for either. Specimens were also screened for rotavirus by enzyme immune assays (EIA) and sapovirus by reverse transcription PCR. Results: The most frequently detected virus was rotavirus by ELISA 25% (25/100). RT-PCR detected sapovirus in 7% (7/100) of the stool samples. The children with sapovirus were all from rural regions and presented mainly during the winter season in Egypt 42.9% (3/7). The main presenting symptoms were fever 71.4% (5/7) and vomiting 57.1% (4/7). None of the children with sapovirus had dehydration. Rotavirus was significantly associated with sapovirus infections in  five samples (5/7) , 71.4%, P=0.01. Conclusion: The present study highlights the emergence of sapovirus as a frequent pathogen associated with acute gastroenteritis in children. There is a need for a national survey program for the study of sapovirus among other pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis for better management of such infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Platelet count can predict the grade of esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bleeding from esophageal varices is a life-threatening complication in cirrhosis. Screening endoscopy is recommended in cirrhotic patients to identify patients at risk of variceal hemorrhage, but this is an invasive procedure and has limitations. Therefore, thrombocytopenia has been proposed to predict the existence and grade of esophageal varices. The aim of the current study was to determine a correlation between platelet count and grades of esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the POF Hospital, Wah Cantt from 1st October, 2017 to 30th May, 2018. Newly diagnosed cases of cirrhosis having varices of any grade on endoscopy were included. Endoscopic findings of patients were standardized using Paquet grading system. On the basis of platelet count, patients were divided into four subgroups. Platelet count groups were correlated with grading of esophageal varices using Spearman rank correlations. Chi Square test was used to see association between the platelet count and grade of esophageal varices. Results: 110 patients were included in the study, 55.5% (n=61) were male. Mean age of the patients was 59.89±9.01 years. Platelet count was <50,000/uL in 35.5% patients, 50,000-99,000/uL in 26.4%, 100,000-150000 in 12.7%, and >150,000/uL in 25.5% patients. Grade I esophageal varices were found in 23.6% of patients, whereas grade II, III and IV were found in 24.5%, 33.6% and 18.2% of patients, respectively. Mean platelet count was 213884.62/mm3 in patients with grade I varices, whereas it was 119518.52/mm3, 58386.49/mm3 and 21600.00/mm3 in patients with grade II, III and IV varices, respectively (p=<0.0001). A significant negative correlation between platelet count and grades of esophageal varices was found (p<0.001). Conclusion: Platelet count can predict the grade of esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients. There is significant negative correlation between platelet count and grades of esophageal varices.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Knowledge on cortical development is based mainly on rodent besides primates and carnivores, all being altricial. Here, we analyzed a precocial animal, the pig, looking at dorsoparietal cortex from E45 to P90. At E45, most ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1-positive (Iba1+) cells had a macrophage-like morphology and resided in meninges and choroid plexus. Only a few cells were scattered in ventricular and subventricular zone (VZ and SVZ). At E60/E70, all laminar compartments displayed microglia cells at a low-to-moderate density, being highest in VZ and SVZ followed by intermediate zone/white matter (IZ/WM). Cortical plate and marginal zone displayed only a few Iba1+ cells. Cells were intensely labeled, but still had poorly arborized somata and many resembled ameboid, macrophage-like microglia. Concurrent with a massive increase in cortical volume, microglia cell density increased until E85, and further until E100/E110 (birth at E114) to densities that resemble those seen postnatally. A fraction of microglia co-labeled with Ki67 suggesting proliferation in all laminar compartments. Cell-to-cell distance decreased substantially during this time, and the fraction of microglia to all nuclei and to neurons increases in the laminar compartments. Eventually, of all cortical DAPI+ nuclei 7–12% were Iba1+ microglia. From E70 onwards, more and more cells with ramified processes were present in MZ down to IZ/WM, showing for instance a close association with NeuN+, NPY+ and GAD65/67+ somata and axon initial segments. These results suggested that development of microglia cell density and morphology proceeds rapidly from mid-gestation onwards reaching near-adult status already before birth.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Acedia, loneliness, and the mandatory celibacy of Catholic parish clergy: a theological-sociological exploratory analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This article utilizes the analytical concept of acedia as the fundamental theoretical framework and applies a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed materials and documents on spiritual sloth, spiritual dryness, Catholic clerical celibacy, social bonding and communal spirituality. This article explores how the Catholic parish clergy’s mandatory celibacy intensifies loneliness and facilitates the spiritual sloth of parish clergy or what is theologically known as acedia. Unlike religious priests who live in religious communities, parish clerics fundamentally live, work, and pray alone in the parish, without strong communal support from fellow priests, bishops, and lay parishioners; thus, making them prone to loneliness, a main component of acedia. This article argues that mandatory celibacy further deprives parish clerics of the social and spiritual support necessary to enhance diocesan clerical spirituality and strengthen spiritual resistance against acedia. It recommends a structural adjustment in the social and spiritual life of parish priests, creating small communities of priests situated in similar territory or districts to allow them to live and work as a team with strong social and spiritual support in the spirit of “living baptismally” to overcome priestly acedia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An Atlas of Plant Transposable Elements [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Advances in genomic sequencing have recently offered vast opportunities for biological exploration, unraveling the evolution and improving our understanding of Earth biodiversity. Due to distinct plant species characteristics in terms of genome size, ploidy and heterozygosity, transposable elements (TEs) are common characteristics of many genomes. TEs are ubiquitous and dispersed repetitive DNA sequences that frequently impact the evolution and composition of the genome, mainly due to their redundancy and rearrangements. For this study, we provided an atlas of TE data by employing an easy-to-use portal (APTE website). To our knowledge, this is the most extensive and standardized analysis of TEs in plant genomes. We evaluated 67 plant genomes assembled at chromosome scale, recovering a total of 49,802,023 TE records, representing a total of 47,992,091,043 (~47,62%) base pairs (bp) of the total genomic space. We observed that new types of TEs were identified and annotated compared to other data repositories. By establishing a standardized catalog of TE annotation on 67 genomes, new hypotheses, exploration of TE data and their influences on the genomes may allow a better understanding of their function and processes. All original code and an example of how we developed the TE annotation strategy is available on GitHub (Extended data).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-driven multi-scale mathematical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals heterogeneity among COVID-19 patients</a></h4>

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often exhibit diverse disease progressions associated with various infectious ability, symptoms, and clinical treatments. To systematically and thoroughly understand the heterogeneous progression of COVID-19, we developed a multi-scale computational model to quantitatively understand the heterogeneous progression of COVID-19 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The model consists of intracellular viral dynamics, multicellular infection process, and immune responses, and was formulated using a combination of differential equations and stochastic modeling. By integrating multi-source clinical data with model analysis, we quantified individual heterogeneity using two indexes, i.e., the ratio of infected cells and incubation period. Specifically, our simulations revealed that increasing the host antiviral state or virus induced type I interferon (IFN) production rate can prolong the incubation period and postpone the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic outcomes. We further identified the threshold dynamics of T cell exhaustion in the transition between mild-moderate and severe symptoms, and that patients with severe symptoms exhibited a lack of naïve T cells at a late stage. In addition, we quantified the efficacy of treating COVID-19 patients and investigated the effects of various therapeutic strategies. Simulations results suggested that single antiviral therapy is sufficient for moderate patients, while combination therapies and prevention of T cell exhaustion are needed for severe patients. These results highlight the critical roles of IFN and T cell responses in regulating the stage transition during COVID-19 progression. Our study reveals a quantitative relationship underpinning the heterogeneity of transition stage during COVID-19 progression and can provide a potential guidance for personalized therapy in COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deciphering conformational selectivity in the A2A adenosine G protein-coupled receptor by free energy simulations</a></h4>

Transmembranal G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) transduce extracellular chemical signals to the cell, via conformational change from a resting (inactive) to an active (canonically bound to a G-protein) conformation. Receptor activation is normally modulated by extracellular ligand binding, but mutations in the receptor can also shift this equilibrium by stabilizing different conformational states. In this work, we built structure-energetic relationships of receptor activation based on original thermodynamic cycles that represent the conformational equilibrium of the prototypical A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor (AR). These cycles were solved with efficient free energy perturbation (FEP) protocols, allowing to distinguish the pharmacological profile of different series of A<sub>2A</sub>AR agonists with different efficacies. The modulatory effects of point mutations on the basal activity of the receptor or on ligand efficacies could also be detected. This methodology can guide GPCR ligand design with tailored pharmacological properties, or allow the identification of mutations that modulate receptor activation with potential clinical implications.

                <p>by Ana Luisa Carvalho, Dominique Fernandes</p>

Synaptic scaling allows neurons to adjust synaptic strength in response to chronic alterations in neuronal activity. A new study in PLOS Biology identifies a pathway that synergizes protein synthesis and degradation with remodeling of the microRNA (miRNA)-induced silencing complex (miRISC) to mediate synaptic scaling.

This Primer explores the implications of a new study in PLOS Biology which reveals how homeostatic synaptic plasticity requires coordinated and inter-dependent protein synthesis and degradation, as well as remodeling of the miRNA-induced silencing complex.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">High resolution diffusion tensor imaging of the hippocampus across the healthy lifespan</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The human hippocampus is difficult to image given its small size, location, shape, and complex internal architecture. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown age-related hippocampal volume changes that vary along the anterior–posterior axis. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides complementary measures related to microstructure, but there are few hippocampus DTI studies investigating change with age in healthy participants, and all have been limited by low spatial resolution. The current study uses high resolution 1 mm isotropic DTI of 153 healthy volunteers aged 5–74 years to investigate diffusion and volume trajectories of the hippocampus (whole, head, body, and tail) and correlations with memory. Hippocampal volume showed age-related changes that differed between head (peaking at midlife), body (no changes), and tail (decreasing across the age span). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, axial, and radial diffusivities (MD, AD, RD) yielded peaks or minima, respectively, at ~30–35 years in all three subregions of the hippocampus. Greater magnitude changes were observed during development than in aging. Age trajectories for both volume and DTI were similar between males and females. Correlations between tests of memory and FA and/or volume were significant in younger subjects (5–17 years), but not in 18–49 year olds or 50–74 year olds. MD was significantly correlated with memory performance in 18–49 year olds, but not in other age groups. Given the diffusion-weighted image contrast and resolution, head digitations could be examined revealing that the majority of subjects had 3–4 (48%) or 2 (32%) bilaterally with no effect of age. One millimeter isotropic DTI yielded high quality diffusion-weighted maps of the human hippocampus that showed regionally specific age effects and cognitive correlations along the anterior–posterior axis from 5 to 74 years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Lateral entorhinal cortex supports the development of prefrontal network activity that bridges temporally discontiguous stimuli</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is an essential component of the brain circuitry supporting long-term memory by serving as an interface between the hippocampus and neocortex. Dysfunction of the LEC affects sensory coding in the hippocampus, leading to a view that the LEC provides the hippocampus with highly processed sensory information. It remains unclear, however, how the LEC modulates neural processing in the neocortical regions. To address this point, we pharmacologically inactivated the LEC of male rats during a temporal associative learning task and examined its impact on local network activity in one of the LEC's efferent targets, the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Rats were exposed to two neutral stimuli, one of which was paired with an aversive eyelid shock over a short temporal delay. The LEC inhibition reduced the expression of anticipatory blinking responses to the reinforced stimuli without increasing responses to nonreinforced stimuli. In control rats, both the reinforced and nonreinforced stimuli evoked a short-lived, wide-band increase in the prelimbic network activity. With learning, the initial increase of gamma-band activity started to extend into the interval between the reinforced neutral stimulus and the eyelid shock. LEC inhibition attenuated the learning-induced sustained activity, without affecting the initial transient activity. These results suggest that the integrity of LEC is necessary for the formation of temporal stimulus associations and its neural correlates in the mPFC. Given the minimal effects on the innate network responses to sensory stimuli, the LEC appears not to be the main source of sensory inputs to the mPFC; rather it may provide a framework that shapes the mPFC network response to behaviorally relevant cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Imaging human engrams using 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The investigation of the physical traces of memories (engrams) has made significant progress in the last decade due to optogenetics and fluorescent cell tagging applied in rodents. Engram cells were identified. The ablation of engram cells led to the loss of the associated memory, silent memories were reactivated, and artificial memories were implanted in the brain. Human engram research lags behind engram research in rodents due to methodological and ethical constraints. However, advances in multivariate analysis techniques of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and machine learning algorithms allowed the identification of stable engram patterns in humans. In addition, MRI scanners with an ultrahigh field strength of 7 Tesla (T) have left their prototype state and became more common around the world to assist human engram research. Although most engram research in humans is still being performed with a field strength of 3T, fMRI at 7T will push engram research. Here, we summarize the current state and findings of human engram research and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying 7 versus 3T fMRI to image human memory traces.</p>

     alt="Morphological analysis of the cerebellum and its efferent system in a basal actinopterygian fish, Polypterus senegalus"/>
<p>In the present study, we revealed that the cerebellar efferent neurons in <i>Polypterus senegalus</i> are localized in restricted regions within the granular layer (i.e., mainly in the ventrolateral region of the auricula cerebelli) and have long dendrites extending within the granular layer to reach the clusters of the Purkinje cells (PCs) but not the molecular layer (ML). The morphological feature of these long extending dendrites passing through the granular layer in <i>Polypterus</i> is more similar to those of teleostean eurydendroid cells (EC) than to mammalian cerebellar efferent neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). These findings suggest that the efferent system of the <i>Polypterus</i> cerebellum has intermediate features between teleosts and amniote vertebrates.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although all vertebrate cerebella contain granule cells, Purkinje cells, and efferent neurons, the cellular arrangement and neural circuitry are highly diverse. In amniotes, cerebellar efferent neurons form clusters, deep cerebellar nuclei, lie deep in the cerebellum, and receive synaptic inputs from Purkinje cells but not granule cells. However, in the cerebellum of teleosts, the efferent neurons, called eurydendroid cells, lie near the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and receive inputs both from axons of Purkinje cells and granule cell parallel fibers. It is largely unknown how the cerebellar structure evolved in ray-finned fish (actinopterygians). To address this issue, we analyzed the cerebellum of a bichir <i>Polypterus senegalus</i>, one of the most basal actinopterygians. We found that the cell bodies of Purkinje cells are not aligned in a layer; incoming climbing fibers terminate mainly on the basal portion of Purkinje cells, revealing that the <i>Polypterus</i> cerebellum has unique features among vertebrate cerebella. Retrograde labeling and marker analyses of the efferent neurons revealed that their cell bodies lie in restricted granular areas but not as deep cerebellar nuclei in the cerebellar white matter. The efferent neurons have long dendrites like eurydendroid cells, although they do not reach the molecular layer. Our findings suggest that the efferent system of the bichir cerebellum has intermediate features between teleosts and amniote vertebrates, and provides a model to understand the basis generating diversity in actinopterygian cerebella.</p>

                Adequate adoption of evidence-based practice is deeply rooted in accessing methodological quality and completeness of systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting. Nonetheless, this assumption might be flawed if the methodological quality assessment has not been properly conducted. Taking the former statement into consideration, this correspondence article encourages the improvement of future tertiary manuscripts, especially in the field of restorative dentistry. Thus, this article addresses an overview of reviews in restorative dentistry by Sarkis-Onofre et al. in the May 2019 issue of the Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry as an example of evaluating tertiary evidence for increasing the awareness of reviewers, authors, and readers.

                Background: Cannabis use remains a major public health concern, and its use typically begins in adolescence. Chronic administration of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, during adolescence can produce deficits in adult learning and memory, stress reactivity and anxiety. One possible mechanism behind the disruptions in adulthood from adolescent exposure to THC includes changes in social behaviours, such as social play, which has been shown to be critical to socio-cognitive development. Methods: Here, using an established animal model of adolescent THC exposure in male and female Long–Evans rats, we explored the effects of THC on play behaviour during the chronic administration period. Following puberty onset, as indicated by external changes to the genitalia, THC (5mg/kg) was administered for 14 days. Play behaviour was assessed seven days following the onset of the injection period at approximately 1 hour post treatment. The frequency of nape attacks, the likelihood and tactics of defensive behaviour, and pins were scored and analyzed. Results: THC exposure decreased playfulness in adolescent rats including the number of attacks, likelihood of defense and pins compared to control and vehicle treated rats. Conclusion: This suggests that THC suppresses both the attack and defense components of social play. This is an important finding because there is evidence that attack and defense may be mediated by different mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of THC exposure decreasing playfulness occurred similarly in males and females.

                Background: This paper focuses on advances in crowd control study with an emphasis on high-density crowds, particularly Hajj crowds. Video analysis and visual surveillance have been of increasing importance in order to enhance the safety and security of pilgrimages in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Hajj is considered to be a particularly distinctive event, with hundreds of thousands of people gathering in a small space, which does not allow a precise analysis of video footage using advanced video and computer vision algorithms. This paper aims to propose an algorithm based on a Convolutional Neural Networks model specifically for Hajj applications. Additionally, the work introduces a system for counting and then estimating the crowd density. Methods: The model adopts an architecture which detects each person in the crowd, spots head location with a bounding box and does the counting in our own novel dataset (HAJJ-Crowd). Results: Our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art method, and attains a remarkable Mean Absolute Error result of 200 (average of 82.0 improvement) and Mean Square Error of 240 (average of 135.54 improvement). Conclusions: In our new HAJJ-Crowd dataset for evaluation and testing, we have a density map and prediction results of some standard methods.

                Many patients with COVID-19 experience a range of debilitating symptoms months after being infected, a syndrome termed long-haul COVID. A 68-year-old male presented with lung opacity, fatigue, physical and cognitive weaknesses, loss of smell and lymphocytopenia. After rounds of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), the patient returned to normal activities and work. Mechanistically in the patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), markers of inflammatory macrophages diminished and markers of lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic CD8 T-cells, increased. Circulating inflammatory proteins diminished, while positive regulators of tissue repair increased. This case study suggests that TPE has the capacity to treat long-haul COVID.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current">Forceful synapses reveal mechanical interactions in the brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature, Published online: 24 November 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03516-0">doi:10.1038/d41586-021-03516-0</a></p>Communication between neurons in the brain is generally associated with electrochemical signalling. Here we reveal that neurons can also communicate through the force generated by the enlargement of dendritic spines. This force is comparable to that of muscle contraction and might underlie learning and memory, suggesting that brain function is more mechanical than was previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct dendritic Ca2+ spike forms produce opposing input-output transformations in rat CA3 pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                Proper integration of different inputs targeting the dendritic tree of CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs) is critical for associative learning and recall. Dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been proposed to perform associative computations in other PC types by detecting conjunctive activation of different afferent input pathways, initiating afterdepolarization (ADP), and triggering burst firing. Implementation of such operations fundamentally depends on the actual biophysical properties of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes; yet little is known about these properties in dendrites of CA3PCs. Using dendritic patch-clamp recordings and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in acute slices from male rats, we report that, unlike CA1PCs, distal apical trunk dendrites of CA3PCs exhibit distinct forms of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Besides ADP-type global Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, a majority of dendrites expresses a novel, fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike type that is initiated locally without bAPs, can recruit additional Na<sup>+</sup> currents, and is compartmentalized to the activated dendritic subtree. Occurrence of the different Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike types correlates with dendritic structure, indicating morpho-functional heterogeneity among CA3PCs. Importantly, ADPs and dendritically initiated spikes produce opposing somatic output: bursts versus strictly single-action potentials, respectively. The uncovered variability of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes may underlie heterogeneous input-output transformation and bursting properties of CA3PCs, and might specifically contribute to key associative and non-associative computations performed by the CA3 network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beamforming seizures from the temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Background: Surgical treatment of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) depends on proper identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ), and differentiation of mesial, temporolimbic seizure onsets from temporal neocortical seizure onsets. Non-invasive source imaging using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) can provide accurate information on interictal spike localization; however, EEG and MEG have low sensitivity for epileptiform activity restricted to deep temporolimbic structures. Moreover, in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), interictal spikes frequently arise in neocortical foci distant from the SOZ, rendering interictal spike localization potentially misleading for presurgical planning. Methods: In this study, we used two different beamformer techniques applied to the MEG signal of ictal events acquired during EEG-MEG recordings in six patients with TLE (three neocortical, three MTLE). The ictal source localization results were compared to the patients' ground truth SOZ localizations determined from intracranial EEG and/or clinical, neuroimaging and postsurgical outcome evidence. Results: Beamformer analysis proved to be highly accurate in all cases and able to reliably identify focal seizure onsets localized to mesial, temporolimbic structures. In three patients, interictal spikes were either absent, too complex for inverse dipole modeling, or localized to anterolateral temporal neocortex distant to a mesial temporal SOZ. Conclusions: This report demonstrates the suitability of MEG beamformer analysis of ictal events in TLE, which can supersede or complement the traditional analysis of interictal spikes. The method outlined is applicable to any type of epileptiform event, greatly expanding the information value of MEG and broadening its utility for presurgical recording in epilepsy.
