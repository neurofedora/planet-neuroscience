              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09862">Towards a Quantitative Theory of Digraph-Based Complexes and its Applications in Brain Network Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we developed new mathematical methods for analyzing network topology and applied these methods to the analysis of brain networks. More specifically, we rigorously developed quantitative methods based on complexes constructed from digraphs (digraph-based complexes), such as path complexes and directed clique complexes (alternatively, we refer to these complexes as "higher-order structures," or "higher-order topologies," or "simplicial structures"), and, in the case of directed clique complexes, also methods based on the interrelations between the directed cliques, what we called "directed higher-order connectivities." This new quantitative theory for digraph-based complexes can be seen as a step towards the formalization of a "quantitative simplicial theory." Subsequently, we used these new methods, such as characterization measures and similarity measures for digraph-based complexes, to analyze the topology of digraphs derived from brain connectivity estimators, specifically the estimator known as information partial directed coherence (iPDC), which is a multivariate estimator that can be considered a representation of Granger causality in the frequency-domain, particularly estimated from electroencephalography (EEG) data from patients diagnosed with left temporal lobe epilepsy, in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands, to try to find new biomarkers based on the higher-order structures and connectivities of these digraphs. In particular, we attempted to answer the following questions: How does the higher-order topology of the brain network change from the pre-ictal to the ictal phase, from the ictal to the post-ictal phase, at each frequency band and in each cerebral hemisphere? Does the analysis of higher-order structures provide new and better biomarkers for seizure dynamics and also for the laterality of the seizure focus than the usual graph theoretical analyses?

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10189">Orienting gaze toward a visual target: Neurophysiological synthesis with epistemological considerations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of an object triggers an orienting gaze movement toward its location. The movement consists of a rapid rotation of the eyes, the saccade, which is accompanied by a head rotation if the target eccentricity exceeds the oculomotor range, by a slow eye movement if it moves. Completing a previous report, we explain the numerous points that lead to questioning the validity of a one-to-one correspondence relation between measured physical values of gaze or head orientation and neuronal activity. Conflating kinematic (or dynamic) numerical values with neurophysiological recordings carries the risk of believing that central neuron activity directly encodes gaze or head orientation rather than mediating changes in extraocular and neck muscle contraction. Rather than reducing mismatches between extrinsic physical parameters (such as position or velocity errors), eye and head movements are behavioral expressions of intrinsic processes that restore a poly-equilibrium, i.e., balances of activities opposing antagonistic visuomotor channels. Past results obtained in the cat and monkey left a treasure allowing a synthesis, which illustrates the tremendous complexity underlying the changes in the orientations of the eyes and head. Its aim is to serve as a guide for further investigations in marmosets or for comparison with other species.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10322">Fairness, not Emotion, Drives Socioeconomic Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion and fairness play a key role in mediating socioeconomic decisions in humans; however, the underlying neurocognitive mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we explored the interplay between proposers' emotions and fairness of offer magnitudes in rational decision-making. Employing a time-bound UG paradigm, 40 (male, age: 18-20) participants were exposed to three distinct proposers' emotions (Happy, Neutral, and Disgusted) followed by one of the three offer ranges (Low, Intermediate, Maximum). Our findings show a robust influence of fairness of offer on acceptance rates, with the impact of emotions obtained only within the low offer range. The increment of the offer amount resulted in shorter reaction times, while emotional stimuli resulted in prolonged reaction times. A multilevel generalized linear model showed offer as the dominant predictor of trial-specific responses. Subsequent agglomerative clustering grouped participants into five primary clusters based on responses modulated by emotions/offers. The Drift Diffusion Model based on the clustering further corroborated our findings. Emotion-sensitive markers, including N170 and LPP, demonstrated the participants' effect on facial expressions; however, facial emotions had minimal effect on subsequent socioeconomic decisions. Our study suggests that, in general, participants gave more preference to the fairness of the offer with a slight effect of emotions in decision-making. We show that though emotion is perceived and has an effect on decision-making time, people mostly prioritise financial gain and fairness of offer. Moreover, it establishes a connection between reaction time and responses and further dives deep into individualistic decision-making processes revealing different cognitive strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409">A point process approach for the classification of noisy calcium imaging data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study noisy calcium imaging data, with a focus on the classification of spike traces. As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron's activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response. Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory, the study explores spike-time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron's firing events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of spike traces.

                arXiv:2409.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron models using Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point-like models, excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites, introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group, excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460">Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the associated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07671">A standardised open science framework for sharing and re-analysing neural data acquired to continuous stimuli</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2309.07671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurophysiology research has demonstrated that it is possible and valuable to investigate sensory processing in scenarios involving continuous sensory streams, such as speech and music. Over the past 10 years or so, novel analytic frameworks combined with the growing participation in data sharing has led to a surge of publicly available datasets involving continuous sensory experiments. However, open science efforts in this domain of research remain scattered, lacking a cohesive set of guidelines. This paper presents an end-to-end open science framework for the storage, analysis, sharing, and re-analysis of neural data recorded during continuous sensory experiments. We propose a data structure that builds on existing custom structures (Continuous-event Neural Data or CND), providing precise naming conventions and data types, as well as a workflow for storing and loading data in the general-purpose BIDS structure. The framework has been designed to interface with existing EEG/MEG analysis toolboxes, such as Eelbrain, NAPLib, MNE, and mTRF-Toolbox. We present guidelines by taking both the user view (rapidly re-analyse existing data) and the experimenter view (store, analyse, and share), making the process straightforward and accessible. Additionally, we introduce a web-based data browser that enables the effortless replication of published results and data re-analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04525">Enhancing learning in spiking neural networks through neuronal heterogeneity and neuromodulatory signaling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.04525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from neuroscience, particularly with the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs). This has significantly enhanced the replication of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and natural language processing. Despite these advances, ANNs struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency - capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, ANNs often overlook the functional and morphological diversity of the brain, hindering their computational capabilities. Furthermore, incorporating cell-type specific neuromodulatory effects into ANNs with neuronal heterogeneity could enable learning at two spatial scales: spiking behavior at the neuronal level, and synaptic plasticity at the circuit level, thereby potentially enhancing their learning abilities. In this article, we summarize recent bio-inspired models, learning rules and architectures and propose a biologically-informed framework for enhancing ANNs. Our proposed dual-framework approach highlights the potential of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for emulating diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartments to simulate morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how the proposed approach integrates brain-inspired compartmental models and task-driven SNNs, balances bioinspiration and complexity, and provides scalable solutions for pressing AI challenges, such as continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency.

                arXiv:2409.09125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding of how biological neural networks process information is one of the biggest open scientific questions of our time. Advances in machine learning and artificial neural networks have enabled the modeling of neuronal behavior, but classical models often require a large number of parameters, complicating interpretability. Quantum computing offers an alternative approach through quantum machine learning, which can achieve efficient training with fewer parameters. In this work, we introduce a quantum generative model framework for generating synthetic data that captures the spatial and temporal correlations of biological neuronal activity. Our model demonstrates the ability to achieve reliable outcomes with fewer trainable parameters compared to classical methods. These findings highlight the potential of quantum generative models to provide new tools for modeling and understanding neuronal behavior, offering a promising avenue for future research in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09210">ORS: A novel Olive Ridley Survival inspired Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-heuristic algorithmic development has been a thrust area of research since its inception. In this paper, a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Olive Ridley Survival (ORS), is proposed which is inspired from survival challenges faced by hatchlings of Olive Ridley sea turtle. A major fact about survival of Olive Ridley reveals that out of one thousand Olive Ridley hatchlings which emerge from nest, only one survive at sea due to various environmental and other factors. This fact acts as the backbone for developing the proposed algorithm. The algorithm has two major phases: hatchlings survival through environmental factors and impact of movement trajectory on its survival. The phases are mathematically modelled and implemented along with suitable input representation and fitness function. The algorithm is analysed theoretically. To validate the algorithm, fourteen mathematical benchmark functions from standard CEC test suites are evaluated and statistically tested. Also, to study the efficacy of ORS on recent complex benchmark functions, ten benchmark functions of CEC-06-2019 are evaluated. Further, three well-known engineering problems are solved by ORS and compared with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics. Simulation results show that in many cases, the proposed ORS algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The sub-optimal behavior of ORS in some recent benchmark functions is also observed.

                arXiv:2409.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first parameterized analysis of a standard (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm on a distribution of vertex cover problems. We show that if the planted cover is at most logarithmic, restarting the (1+1) EA every $O(n \log n)$ steps will find a cover at least as small as the planted cover in polynomial time for sufficiently dense random graphs $p > 0.71$. For superlogarithmic planted covers, we prove that the (1+1) EA finds a solution in fixed-parameter tractable time in expectation.
  We complement these theoretical investigations with a number of computational experiments that highlight the interplay between planted cover size, graph density and runtime.

                arXiv:2409.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Y-Drop, a regularization method that biases the dropout algorithm towards dropping more important neurons with higher probability. The backbone of our approach is neuron conductance, an interpretable measure of neuron importance that calculates the contribution of each neuron towards the end-to-end mapping of the network. We investigate the impact of the uniform dropout selection criterion on performance by assigning higher dropout probability to the more important units. We show that forcing the network to solve the task at hand in the absence of its important units yields a strong regularization effect. Further analysis indicates that Y-Drop yields solutions where more neurons are important, i.e have high conductance, and yields robust networks. In our experiments we show that the regularization effect of Y-Drop scales better than vanilla dropout w.r.t. the architecture size and consistently yields superior performance over multiple datasets and architecture combinations, with little tuning.

                arXiv:2409.09359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for symbolic regression (SR), the task of searching for compact programmatic hypotheses that best explain a dataset. The problem is commonly solved using genetic algorithms; we show that we can enhance such methods by inducing a library of abstract textual concepts. Our algorithm, called LaSR, uses zero-shot queries to a large language model (LLM) to discover and evolve concepts occurring in known high-performing hypotheses. We discover new hypotheses using a mix of standard evolutionary steps and LLM-guided steps (obtained through zero-shot LLM queries) conditioned on discovered concepts. Once discovered, hypotheses are used in a new round of concept abstraction and evolution. We validate LaSR on the Feynman equations, a popular SR benchmark, as well as a set of synthetic tasks. On these benchmarks, LaSR substantially outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art SR approaches based on deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we show that LaSR can be used to discover a novel and powerful scaling law for LLMs.

                arXiv:2409.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In time-series classification, understanding model decisions is crucial for their application in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Counterfactual explanations, which provide insights by presenting alternative inputs that change model predictions, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations for time-series data often struggle with balancing key objectives like proximity, sparsity, and validity. In this paper, we introduce TX-Gen, a novel algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). TX-Gen leverages evolutionary multi-objective optimization to find a diverse set of counterfactuals that are both sparse and valid, while maintaining minimal dissimilarity to the original time series. By incorporating a flexible reference-guided mechanism, our method improves the plausibility and interpretability of the counterfactuals without relying on predefined assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TX-Gen outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality counterfactuals, making time-series models more transparent and interpretable.

                arXiv:2409.09645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series classification is an important task with widespread domains of applications. Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time series classification. However, they often require large expert-labeled training datasets which can be infeasible in practice. In few-shot settings, i.e. only a limited number of samples per class are available in training data, DNNs show a significant drop in testing accuracy and poor generalization ability. In this paper, we propose to address these problems from an optimization and a loss function perspective. Specifically, we propose a new learning framework named COSCO consisting of a sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) optimization and a Prototypical loss function to improve the generalization ability of DNN for multivariate time series classification problems under few-shot setting. Our experiments demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/JRB9/COSCO.

                arXiv:2409.09990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of neural networks to perform robotic perception and control tasks such as depth and optical flow estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and automatic control has led to their widespread adoption in recent years. Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, leverages multi-view learning to construct more interpretable representations within the latent space. Subsequently, we present the Analytic Neural Network, which implements a consistency penalty that encourages analytic signal representations in the Steinmetz neural network's latent space. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship between the real and imaginary components. Utilizing an information-theoretic construction, we demonstrate that the upper bound on the generalization error posited by the analytic neural network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performance and robustness to additive noise, afforded by our proposed networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples.

                arXiv:2409.10111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world tabular learning production scenarios typically involve evolving data streams, where data arrives continuously and its distribution may change over time. In such a setting, most studies in the literature regarding supervised learning favor the use of instance incremental algorithms due to their ability to adapt to changes in the data distribution. Another significant reason for choosing these algorithms is \textit{avoid storing observations in memory} as commonly done in batch incremental settings. However, the design of instance incremental algorithms often assumes immediate availability of labels, which is an optimistic assumption. In many real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection or credit scoring, labels may be delayed. Consequently, batch incremental algorithms are widely used in many real-world tasks. This raises an important question: "In delayed settings, is instance incremental learning the best option regarding predictive performance and computational efficiency?" Unfortunately, this question has not been studied in depth, probably due to the scarcity of real datasets containing delayed information. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation and analysis of this question using a real-world fraud detection problem and commonly used generated datasets. Our findings indicate that instance incremental learning is not the superior option, considering on one side state-of-the-art models such as Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) and other side batch learning models such as XGBoost. Additionally, when considering the interpretability of the learning systems, batch incremental solutions tend to be favored.

                arXiv:2404.08786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) play a crucial role in the architectural configuration and training of Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a process known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is hindered by its inherent computational expense, requiring multiple generations, a large population, and numerous epochs. The most computationally intensive aspect lies in evaluating the fitness function of a single candidate solution. To address this challenge, we employ Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs). While a few SAEAs approaches have been proposed in neuroevolution, none have been applied to truly large DNNs due to issues like intractable information usage. In this work, drawing inspiration from Genetic Programming semantics, we use phenotypic distance vectors, outputted from DNNs, alongside Kriging Partial Least Squares (KPLS), an approach that is effective in handling these large vectors, making them suitable for search. Our proposed approach, named Neuro-Linear Genetic Programming surrogate model (NeuroLGP-SM), efficiently and accurately estimates DNN fitness without the need for complete evaluations. NeuroLGP-SM demonstrates competitive or superior results compared to 12 other methods, including NeuroLGP without SM, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and autoencoders. Additionally, it is worth noting that NeuroLGP-SM is 25% more energy-efficient than its NeuroLGP counterpart. This efficiency advantage adds to the overall appeal of our proposed NeuroLGP-SM in optimising the configuration of large DNNs.

Abstract: Understanding spatial location and relationships is a fundamental capability for modern artificial intelligence systems. Insights from human spatial cognition provide valuable guidance in this domain. Neuroscientific discoveries have highlighted the role of grid cells as a fundamental neural component for spatial representation, including distance computation, path integration, and scale discernment. In this paper, we introduce a novel positional encoding scheme inspired by Fourier analysis and the latest findings in computational neuroscience regarding grid cells. Assuming that grid cells encode spatial position through a summation of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate the translational invariance of the grid representation during inner product calculations. Additionally, we derive an optimal grid scale ratio for multi-dimensional Euclidean spaces based on principles of biological efficiency. Utilizing these computational principles, we have developed a Grid-cell inspired Positional Encoding technique, termed GridPE, for encoding locations within high-dimensional spaces. We integrated GridPE into the Pyramid Vision Transformer architecture. Our theoretical analysis shows that GridPE provides a unifying framework for positional encoding in arbitrary high-dimensional spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPE significantly enhances the performance of transformers, underscoring the importance of incorporating neuroscientific insights into the design of artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have emerged as a predominant approach for addressing multi-objective optimization problems. However, the theoretical foundation of multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), particularly the fundamental aspects like running time analysis, remains largely underexplored. Existing theoretical studies mainly focus on basic MOEAs, with little attention given to practical MOEAs. In this paper, we present a running time analysis of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) for the first time. Specifically, we prove that the expected running time of SPEA2 for solving three commonly used multi-objective problems, i.e., $m$OneMinMax, $m$LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes, and $m$-OneJumpZeroJump, is $O(\mu n\cdot \min\{m\log n, n\})$, $O(\mu n^2)$, and $O(\mu n^k \cdot \min\{mn, 3^{m/2}\})$, respectively. Here $m$ denotes the number of objectives, and the population size $\mu$ is required to be at least $(2n/m+1)^{m/2}$, $(2n/m+1)^{m-1}$ and $(2n/m-2k+3)^{m/2}$, respectively. The proofs are accomplished through general theorems which are also applicable for analyzing the expected running time of other MOEAs on these problems, and thus can be helpful for future theoretical analysis of MOEAs.

                arXiv:2407.08742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dense Associative Memory generalizes the Hopfield network by allowing for sharper interaction functions. This increases the capacity of the network as an autoassociative memory as nearby learned attractors will not interfere with one another. However, the implementation of the network relies on applying large exponents to the dot product of memory vectors and probe vectors. If the dimension of the data is large the calculation can be very large and result in imprecisions and overflow when using floating point numbers in a practical implementation. We describe the computational issues in detail, modify the original network description to mitigate the problem, and show the modification will not alter the networks' dynamics during update or training. We also show our modification greatly improves hyperparameter selection for the Dense Associative Memory, removing dependence on the interaction vertex and resulting in an optimal region of hyperparameters that does not significantly change with the interaction vertex as it does in the original network.

Abstract: In the present paper, I describe a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture which, can be used in wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It is assumed, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) have spiking nature. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. The plasticity rules are local and do not use the backpropagation principle. Besides that, as in my previous studies, I was guided by the requirement that the all neuron/plasticity models should be easily implemented on modern neurochips. I illustrate the high performance of my network on a task related to model-based reinforcement learning, namely, evaluation of proximity of an external world state to the target state.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01815">Neuromorphic Split Computing with Wake-Up Radios: Architecture and Design via Digital Twinning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.01815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing leverages the sparsity of temporal data to reduce processing energy by activating a small subset of neurons and synapses at each time step. When deployed for split computing in edge-based systems, remote neuromorphic processing units (NPUs) can reduce the communication power budget by communicating asynchronously using sparse impulse radio (IR) waveforms. This way, the input signal sparsity translates directly into energy savings both in terms of computation and communication. However, with IR transmission, the main contributor to the overall energy consumption remains the power required to maintain the main radio on. This work proposes a novel architecture that integrates a wake-up radio mechanism within a split computing system consisting of remote, wirelessly connected, NPUs. A key challenge in the design of a wake-up radio-based neuromorphic split computing system is the selection of thresholds for sensing, wake-up signal detection, and decision making. To address this problem, as a second contribution, this work proposes a novel methodology that leverages the use of a digital twin (DT), i.e., a simulator, of the physical system, coupled with a sequential statistical testing approach known as Learn Then Test (LTT) to provide theoretical reliability guarantees. The proposed DT-LTT methodology is broadly applicable to other design problems, and is showcased here for neuromorphic communications. Experimental results validate the design and the analysis, confirming the theoretical reliability guarantees and illustrating trade-offs among reliability, energy consumption, and informativeness of the decisions.

                arXiv:2404.02031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely accepted way to assess the performance of iterative black-box optimizers is to analyze their empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of pre-defined quality targets achieved not later than a given runtime. In this work, we consider an alternative approach, based on the empirical attainment function (EAF) and we show that the target-based ECDF is an approximation of the EAF. We argue that the EAF has several advantages over the target-based ECDF. In particular, it does not require defining a priori quality targets per function, captures performance differences more precisely, and enables the use of additional summary statistics that enrich the analysis. We also show that the average area over the convergence curves is a simpler-to-calculate, but equivalent, measure of anytime performance. To facilitate the accessibility of the EAF, we integrate a module to compute it into the IOHanalyzer platform. Finally, we illustrate the use of the EAF via synthetic examples and via the data available for the BBOB suite.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07684">Towards Human-Like Driving: Active Inference in Autonomous Vehicle Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.07684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) control through the application of active inference, a theory derived from neuroscience that conceptualizes the brain as a predictive machine. Traditional autonomous driving systems rely heavily on Modular Pipelines, Imitation Learning, or Reinforcement Learning, each with inherent limitations in adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. Active inference addresses these challenges by minimizing prediction error (termed "surprise") through a dynamic model that balances perception and action. Our method integrates active inference with deep learning to manage lateral control in AVs, enabling them to perform lane following maneuvers within a simulated urban environment. We demonstrate that our model, despite its simplicity, effectively learns and generalizes from limited data without extensive retraining, significantly reducing computational demands. The proposed approach not only enhances the adaptability and performance of AVs in dynamic scenarios but also aligns closely with human-like driving behavior, leveraging a generative model to predict and adapt to environmental changes. Results from extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show promising outcomes, outperforming traditional methods in terms of adaptability and efficiency, thereby advancing the potential of active inference in real-world autonomous driving applications.

	<p>Background: This report aims to supplement the existing knowledge on the inferior oblique muscle. In particular, this study presents detailed anatomical and histological data concerning the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s entry point (or entry zone) of the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle. Particular attention was paid to the topographical relationships of the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle (NTIO), including the location of its entry point to the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly and its anatomical variations. Methods: Sixty orbits from cadaveric hemi-heads fixed in 10% formalin were studied. The course of the NTIO was traced along the lateral border of the inferior rectus muscle as far as its entry point to the inferior oblique muscle. Particular attention was paid to the various ways in which the NTIO&amp;amp;rsquo;s muscular sub-branches penetrated between the fibers of the inferior oblique muscle. Results: Three types of NTIO entries to the inferior oblique muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly were distinguished. In the most common type (48.3%), the nerve entered the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s inferior (orbital) surface. In the next most common type (36.7%), terminal muscular sub-branches of the NTIO joined the superior (also referred to as ocular or global) surface of the inferior oblique muscle. In the remaining four cases (15%), the terminal sub-branches of the NTIO were divided into two main groups (superior and inferior) that joined both the superior and inferior surfaces of the muscle. Histological examination confirmed that the distal part of the NTIO shows a characteristic arcuate course (angulation) just before reaching the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly. The process for splitting and forming separate muscular sub-branches of the NTIO was observed for all the examined histological specimens at the level of the nerve&amp;amp;rsquo;s angulation. Conclusions: The presented findings enhance the understanding of the anatomical variations and precise distribution of motor sub-branches reaching the inferior oblique muscle, which may deepen anatomical knowledge and potentially enhance the management of ocular motor disorders.</p>

	<p>Need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) confers an increased risk of hearing loss in the newborn and of later neurodevelopmental impairment. In this retrospective longitudinal case-controlled study, we assess how the degree of prematurity, measured via gestational age, birth weight, and z-scores, in 138 infants admitted to the NICU are associated with permanent childhood hearing loss (PCHI) and 2-year developmental outcomes. Logistic regression analyses, Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis analysis of variance, and Chi-squared tests were used. Independent of prematurity, PCHI and NICU admission were predictive of poor developmental outcomes. Twenty-one (47%) children with PCHI had a moderate-to-severe developmental delay, compared to three (7%) matched controls. Days in the NICU but not z-scores predicted PCHI. Z-score was not prognostic of moderate or severe developmental impairment in children with PCHI. The odds ratio of moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment with PCHI was high, at 12.48 [95% CI = 3.37&amp;amp;ndash;46.40]. Children with PCHI were significantly more likely to have cerebral palsy than their matched counterparts (30% vs. 2%). These findings challenge the conventional focus on gestational age and birth weight on neurodevelopmental outcomes for children with PCHI and NICU admission. A more nuanced approach to monitoring and intervention is needed.</p>

                <p>Contemporary research has begun to show a strong relationship between movements and the perception of time. More specifically, concurrent movements serve to both bias and enhance time estimates. To explain these effects, we recently proposed a mechanism by which movements provide a secondary channel for estimating duration that is combined optimally with sensory estimates. However, a critical test of this framework is that by introducing "noise" into movements, sensory estimates of time should similarly become noisier. To accomplish this, we had human participants move a robotic arm while estimating intervals of time in either auditory or visual modalities (<I>n</I> = 24, ea.). Crucially, we introduced an artificial "tremor" in the arm while subjects were moving, that varied across three levels of amplitude (1&ndash;3 N) or frequency (4&ndash;12 Hz). The results of both experiments revealed that increasing the frequency of the tremor led to noisier estimates of duration. Further, the effect of noise varied with the base precision of the interval, such that a naturally less precise timing (i.e., visual) was more influenced by the tremor than a naturally more precise modality (i.e., auditory). To explain these findings, we fit the data with a recently developed drift-diffusion model of perceptual decision-making, in which the momentary, within-trial variance was allowed to vary across conditions. Here, we found that the model could recapitulate the observed findings, further supporting the theory that movements influence perception directly. Overall, our findings support the proposed framework, and demonstrate the utility of inducing motor noise via artificial tremors.</p>

                Background - The new increasing homeless lately consist of women, children, youth, the elderly and marginalized ethnic or migrant groups. Some of them are working and earn salaries, however, the income is not sufficient to live modestly. Purpose – The purpose of this research is to establish a desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness in the country. Design/methodology/approach – This is an exploratory descriptive method study which employed quantitative techniques.  The study employed a social ecological model to investigate behavior of homeless via multiple levels of influences including intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and public policy. Surveys have been conducted on sixty-five homeless individuals.  Findings – It was found that support systems and structures should be derived from the whole streams from families, communities, organizations and government. Employment opportunities, long-term shelters within the community places and highly demanded skills are needed to improve their living condition. Research limitations – This study is only focused on the socio-economic structures of the homeless in a capital city. Originality/value – This is an empirical research using a social ecological model for the homeless in the Kuala Lumpur area. Research on homeless study has received little attention and has yet to be fully explored.

                Background We evaluated if the course of recovery from sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) can be predicted using variables collected at admission. Methods A total of 63 patients admitted for sepsis-induced AKI in our Mangalore ICU were evaluated and baseline demographic and clinical/laboratory parameters, including serum creatinine (SCr), base excess (BE), Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI), Caval Index, R wave variability index (RVI), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal resistivity index (RI) using renal doppler and need for inotropes were assessed on admission. Patients were managed as per standard protocol. After six hours of fluid resuscitation, patients were classified as volume responders or non-responders. Re-assessment was done at 24 hours and 72 hours after admission. Primary outcome was persistent AKI after 72 hours. Secondary outcome was initiation of dialysis or death within 15 days of admission. Results A total of 34 subjects recovered from AKI, of whom 32 patients were volume responders and 31 were non-responders. Response to fluid, MAP at admission and six hours, BE at admission, inotrope requirement, and PVI at admission did not correlate with recovery. Multiple logistic regression showed that SCr < 2.36 mg%, RVI > 14.45 and RI < 0.8 on admission correlated with recovery and they were evaluated further to model AKI recovery and develop PASS. PASS score = (SCr points × 5.4) + (RVI points × 4.0) + (RI points × 6.2). One point each was allotted if SCr was < 2.36, RVI was > 14.45 and RI was <0.8, and 0 otherwise. A score > 7.8 predicted recovery with a sensitivity of 79.4%, specificity of 72.4%, PPV 81.8%, NPV 76.7% and AuROC of 0.85. Conclusions The PASS score can be used to identify salvageable cases of sepsis-AKI, guiding fluid resuscitation and aiding early referral from rural to tertiary care centers for better management.

                Background Patient-related factors and limited medication adherence in patients with chronic diseases, are associated with poor clinical outcomes, long-term complications, and increased overall disease costs. Many methods have been tested with mixed results, and innovative approaches are needed to encourage patients to adhere to their prescribed drug regimens. Methods This randomised controlled trial examined a new multifactorial pharmacist-led intervention protocol (MPIP), including a medication therapy management (MTM) program with face-to-face counselling, patient-specific medication booklets, and a mobile application, from July 2021 to September 2022 in the Oud Al Touba diagnostic and screening ambulatory centre in 192 patients with type 2 diabetes in the United Arab Emirates. Medication adherence was assessed using the fixed medication possession ratio of medication refills and the medication adherence questionnaire. Results At 12 months follow-up, participants in the MPIP showed significant improvement in overall medication adherence with total (composite) medication possession ratio (MPRt) of mean (±SD) 0.95 (±0.09) compared to 0.92 (± 0.09) in the control group with mean difference of 0.03 (95%, CI 0.01–0.06), P =0.02. In addition, improvement trend was evident in the MPIP group for all medication regimens with P value <0.01. Comparable results were noticeable in adherence questionnaire scores at the end of the study, with 66 participants in the intervention group scored zero on the questionnaire, suggesting high adherence to medication compared to the control group (48 participants only). The MTM program performed 41 clinical interventions on drug-related problems, compared to six interventions in the control group, and the use of mobile application and medication booklet have increased to 45.7% compared to 21.4% before study exit. Conclusions The pharmacy intervention protocol effectively improved medication adherence and optimised medication regimens in diabetic patients with chronic medication regimens in an ambulatory healthcare centre.

                Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, apathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Method A systematic search was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework with studies published on leisure-based intervention from January 1990 to December 2023. Results The review included 11 articles in the study. In total two studies were pilot interventional study, one randomized controlled study, one case-control, one retrospective study, three were cross sectional, one was cross sectional longitudinal study and two were qualitative in nature. Studies used different types of leisure activities like cooking group, discussions, board games, arts and craft, painting, beading, sewing, clay work, paper craft, etc were used as an intervention. Qualitative studies found that individuals with schizophrenia spent less time in social and leisure activities and more time relaxing and doing nothing. Conclusion The study highlights the need to conduct further research on leisure-based interventions using various study designs like randomized controlled trials and mixed methods to understand its effectiveness among individuals with schizophrenia.

                Background Knee osteoarthritis affects the performance of daily activities, independence, and quality of life. The etiopathogenesis of this condition considers the mechanisms of activation of metalloproteinase and reactive oxygen species production pathways. Metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) may be responsible for cartilage destruction. Aquatic physiotherapy promotes a positive impact on the clinical picture of osteoarthritis, and this study presents an intervention protocol that aims to evaluate the effects of a single session of different aquatic physiotherapy modalities on the biochemical and functional behavior of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods This will be a crossover randomized controlled trial in which 15 individuals will be submitted to three aquatic physiotherapy modalities with a minimum 15-day wash-out period in patients over 50 years old and diagnosed with OA in at least one knee, presence of pain and at least one functional dysfunction for at least 6 months, absence of physical limitation that prevents the exercise protocol from being performed, Kellgren and Lawrence ranking between I and IV, walk independently and without auxiliary device. Variations in the concentrations of MMP-3 and GPx in peripheral blood, pain, edema, and flexibility resulting from the three aquatic physiotherapeutic interventions will be evaluated both pre- and immediate post-intervention. The reference group will be submitted to the same aquatic physiotherapy protocols, however, only the biochemical parameters and the self-perception questionnaires will be evaluated.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                Future viability depends on ensuring a sustainable society because green energy methods may efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, stakeholders, consumers, and developers continue to be notably ignorant of the financial incentives connected to green technology. Moreover, there is still a dearth of studies on the range of financial incentives offered by different authorities in India. Monetary incentives, such as tax breaks, indirect tax exemptions, and refunds, are crucial in encouraging the use of green technology in the modern world. This study explores the importance of financial incentives for green building technologies in India, which also looks at the wide range of incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. Furthermore, the study highlights various state government programs such as goods subsidies, exemptions from local taxes, and fee waivers. Notably, several incentives aimed at consumers, developers, and other stakeholders have been implemented by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). This review study emphasizes the effectiveness of financial incentives in green construction projects and draws attention to a clear knowledge gap regarding the adoption of green technology. This study also provides insights into potential future directions. Studies and research results emphasize the importance of spreading the word about financial incentives as a key factor in determining the adoption of green technologies. Many parties, including governmental organizations, municipal governments, developers, and clients engaged in green building technology projects, stand to gain increased awareness.

An exploration using a novel, value-based, publication metric framework: the EMPIRE Index [version 4; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index is a value-based, multi-component metric framework to assess the impact of medical publications in terms of relevance to different stakeholders. It comprises three component scores (social, scholarly and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics that indicate a different aspect of engagement with the publication. Here, we present an exploratory investigation of whether publication types or disease indications influence EMPIRE Index scores. Methods Article-level metrics were extracted and EMPIRE Index scores were calculated for 5825 journal articles published from 1 May 2017 to 1 May 2018, representing 12 disease indications (chosen to reflect a wide variety of common and rare diseases with a variety of aetiologies) and five publication types. Results There were significant differences in scores between article types and disease indications. Median (95% CI) social and scholarly impact scores ranged from 1.2 (0.3–1.6) to 4.8 (3.1–6.6), respectively, for phase 3 clinical trials, and from 0.3 (0.3–0.4) to 2.3 (1.9–2.6), respectively, for observational studies. Social and scholarly impact scores were highest for multiple sclerosis publications and lowest for non-small cell lung cancer publications. Systematic reviews achieved greater impact than regular reviews. Median trends in the social impact of different disease areas matched the level of public interest as assessed through Google search interest. Although most articles did not register societal impact, mean societal impact scores were highest for migraine publications. Conclusions The EMPIRE Index successfully identified differences in impact by disease area and publication type, which supports the notion that the impact of each publication needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors, and potentially others. These findings should be considered when using the EMPIRE Index to assess publication impact.

                <p>by Anibal S. Amaral, Damien P. Devos</p>

An often-overlooked aspect of biology is formed by the outliers of the protein length distribution, specifically those proteins with more than 5000 amino acids, which we refer to as huge proteins (HPs). By examining UniprotKB, we discovered more than 41 000 HPs throughout the tree of life, with the majority found in eukaryotes. Notably, the phyla with the highest propensity for huge proteins are Apicomplexa and Fornicata. Moreover, we observed that certain bacteria, such as Elusomicrobia or Planctomycetota, have a higher tendency for encoding huge proteins, even more than the average eukaryote. To investigate if these macro-polypeptides represent “real” proteins, we explored several indirect metrics. Additionally, orthology analyses reveals thousands of clusters of homologous sequences of HPs, revealing functional groups related to key cellular processes such as cytoskeleton organization and functioning as chaperones or as E3-ubiquitin ligases in eukaryotes. In the case of bacteria, the major clusters have functions related to Non-Ribosomomal peptide synthesis/Polyketide synthesis, followed by pathogen-host attachment or recognition surface proteins. Further exploration of the annotations for each HPs supported the previously identified functional groups. These findings underscore the need for further investigation of the cellular and ecological roles of these HPs and their potential impact on biology and biotechnology.

In addition to the classical HLA genes, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) harbors a high number of other polymorphic genes with less established roles in disease associations and transplantation matching. To facilitate studies of the non-classical and non-HLA genes in large patient and biobank cohorts, we trained imputation models for <i>MICA</i>, <i>MICB</i>, <i>HLA-E</i>, <i>HLA-F</i> and <i>HLA-G</i> alleles on genome SNP array data. We show, using both population-specific and multi-population 1000 Genomes references, that the alleles of these genes can be accurately imputed for screening and research purposes. The best imputation model for <i>MICA</i>, <i>MICB</i>, <i>HLA-E</i>, <i>-F</i> and <i>-G</i> achieved a mean accuracy of 99.3% (min, max: 98.6, 99.9). Furthermore, validation of the 1000 Genomes exome short-read sequencing-based allele calling against a clinical-grade reference data showed an average accuracy of 99.8%, testifying for the quality of the 1000 Genomes data as an imputation reference. We also fitted the models for Infinium Global Screening Array (GSA, Illumina, Inc.) and Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array (PMRA, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) SNP content, with mean accuracies of 99.1% (97.2, 100) and 98.9% (97.4, 100), respectively.

Dengue virus (DENV) is currently causing epidemics of unprecedented scope in endemic settings and expanding to new geographical areas. It is therefore critical to track this virus using genomic surveillance. However, the complex patterns of viral genomic diversity make it challenging to use the existing genotype classification system. Here, we propose adding 2 sub-genotypic levels of virus classification, named major and minor lineages. These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national, and subnational discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance. Information about our lineage system, including methods to assign lineages to sequence data and propose new lineages, can be found at: dengue-lineages.org.

Ancient divergences within Opisthokonta—a major lineage that includes organisms in the kingdoms Animalia, Fungi, and their unicellular relatives—remain contentious. To assess progress toward a genome-scale Opisthokonta phylogeny, we conducted the most taxon rich phylogenomic analysis using sets of genes inferred with different orthology inference methods and established the geological timeline of Opisthokonta diversification. We also conducted sensitivity analysis by subsampling genes or taxa from the full data matrix based on filtering criteria previously shown to improve phylogenomic inference. We found that approximately 85% of internal branches were congruent across data matrices and the approaches used. Notably, the use of different orthology inference methods was a substantial contributor to the observed incongruence: analyses using the same set of orthologs showed high congruence of 97% to 98%, whereas different sets of orthologs resulted in somewhat lower congruence (87% to 91%). Examination of unicellular Holozoa relationships suggests that the instability observed across varying gene sets may stem from weak phylogenetic signals. Our results provide a comprehensive Opisthokonta phylogenomic framework that will be useful for illuminating ancient evolutionary episodes concerning the origin and diversification of the 2 major eukaryotic kingdoms and emphasize the importance of investigating effects of orthology inference on phylogenetic analyses to resolve ancient divergences.

<p>Schematic of glymphatic system and hypothetical influence factors in MMD. CSF crosses the perivascular space from arteries entering the interstitium and drives metabolic waste toward perivenous spaces. Advanced Suzuki stage, abnormal anastomoses, and decreased CBF in MMD would alter para-arterial CSF flow. Enlarged perivascular space (EPVS) and deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensities (DSWMH) are markers of neuronal dysfunction, small vessel damage, and blocked glymphatic system circulation. These factors are associated with DTI-ALPS in MMD. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; DTI-ALPS, diffusion tensor imaging analysis along perivascular spaces; ISF, interstitial fluid; MMD, moyamoya disease.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Assessing the glymphatic system activity using diffusion tensor imaging analysis along with the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) may be helpful to understand the pathophysiology of moyamoya disease (MMD). 63 adult patients with MMD and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were included for T1-weighted images, T2-FLAIR, pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling, and DTI. 60 patients had digital subtraction angiography more than 6 months after combined revascularization. The Suzuki stage, postoperative Matsushima grade, periventricular anastomoses (PA), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensities (DSWMH), DTI-ALPS, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cognitive scales of MMD patients were assessed. MMD patients were divided into early and advanced stage based on the Suzuki stage. We detected lower DTI-ALPS in patients with advanced stage relative to HCs (<i>p</i> = 0.046) and patients with early stage (<i>p</i> = 0.004), hemorrhagic MMD compared with ischemic MMD (<i>p</i> = 0.048), and PA Grade 2 compared with Grade 0 (<i>p</i> = 0.010). DTI-ALPS was correlated with the EPVS in basal ganglia (<i>r</i> = −0.686, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Suzuki stage (<i>r</i> = −0.465, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), DSWMH (<i>r</i> = −0.423, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and global CBF (<i>r</i> = 0.300, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and cognitive scores (<i>r</i> = 0.343, <i>p</i> = 0.018). The DTI-ALPS of patients with good postoperative collateral formation was higher compared to those with poor postoperative collateral formation (<i>p</i> = 0.038). In conclusion, the glymphatic system was impaired in advanced MMD patients and may affected cognitive function and postoperative neoangiogenesis.</p>

<br/>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The clinical continuum of AD spans from preclinical disease to subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages (mild, moderate, and severe). Neuropathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) into extracellular plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral vasculature, and by abnormally phosphorylated tau that accumulates intraneuronally forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Development of treatment approaches that prevent or even reduce the cognitive decline because of AD has been slow compared to other major causes of death. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to 2 different Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies. However, this breakthrough disease modifying approach only applies to a limited subset of patients in the AD continuum and there are stringent eligibility criteria. Furthermore, these approaches do not prevent progression of disease, because other AD-related pathologies, such as NFTs, are not directly targeted. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is to address lifestyle interventions that can help reduce the risk of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). It is estimated that addressing such modifiable risk factors could potentially delay up to 40% of AD/ADRD cases. In this review, we discuss some of the many modifiable risk factors that may be associated with prevention of AD/ADRD and/or increasing brain resilience, as well as other factors that may interact with these modifiable risk factors to influence AD/ADRD progression.

                <p>Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multi-faceted theoretical construct associated with stroke risk and outcomes. Knowing which SES measures best correlate with population stroke metrics would improve its accounting in observational research and inform interventions. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES) and other publicly available databases, we conducted an ecological study comparing correlations of different United States county-level SES, health care access and clinical risk factor measures with age-adjusted stroke prevalence. The prevalence of adults living below 150% of the federal poverty level most strongly correlated with stroke prevalence compared to other SES and non-SES measures (correlation coefficient = 0.908, <i>R</i>

                <p>Many antiseizure medications cause apoptotic cell death in developing brains. The newer antiseizure medication lacosamide is increasingly used in neonates and infants. Neurotoxicity of lacosamide and its combination with levetiracetam was studied in neonatal mice. Animals received single or repeat injections of saline, phenobarbital (75mg/kg), lacosamide (20–40mg/kg), levetiracetam (100mg/kg), lacosamide (40mg/kg) + levetiracetam (100mg/kg) and euthanized at 6 to 30 hours. Cells undergoing apoptosis were increased in the brains of phenobarbital-treated animals. Densities of apoptotic profiles following lacosamide and levetiracetam treatment did not differ from saline-treated controls. Findings suggest that lacosamide, levetiracetam and their combination do not cause apoptosis in developing mouse brains. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:812–818</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27016?af=R">Inflammation‐Triggered Enlargement of Choroid Plexus in Subacute COVID‐19 Patients with Neurological Symptoms</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether choroid plexus volumes in subacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with neurological symptoms could indicate inflammatory activation or barrier dysfunction and assess their association with clinical data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Choroid plexus volumes were measured in 28 subacute COVID-19 patients via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy patients (n = 25), asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 21). Associations with inflammatory serum markers (peak counts of leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6), an MRI-based marker of barrier dysfunction (CSF volume fraction [V-CSF]), and clinical parameters like olfactory performance and cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>COVID-19 patients showed significantly larger choroid plexus volumes than control groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.172). These volumes correlated significantly with peak leukocyte levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.621) and V-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.009, Spearman's rho = 0.534), but neither with CRP nor interleukin 6. No significant correlations were found with clinical parameters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with subacute COVID-19, choroid plexus volume is a marker of central nervous system inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the presence of neurologic symptoms. The absence of plexus enlargement in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy suggests a specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 effect. This study also documents an increase in choroid plexus volume for the first time as a parainfectious event. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:715–725</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation and considered an inborn error of metabolism. In recent years, we have diagnosed an increasing number of patients where, despite extensive investigation, no disease-causing mutations have been found. We therefore investigated a cohort of consecutive patients, with the objective to detect possible non-genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We searched the patient records and the registry of muscle biopsies, for patients with MADD, diagnosed within the past 10 years. The patient records were reviewed regarding symptoms, clinical findings, comorbidities, drugs, diagnostic investigations, and response to treatment. In addition, complementary investigations of muscle tissue were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 9 patients diagnosed with late-onset MADD. All presented with muscle weakness and elevated levels of creatine kinase. A lipid storage myopathy was evident in the muscle biopsies, as was elevated acylcarnitines in blood. Despite thorough genetic investigations, a probable genetic cause was found in only 2 patients. Remarkably, all 7 patients without disease-causing mutations were treated with sertraline. In some cases, a deterioration of symptoms closely followed dose increase, and discontinuation resulted in an improved acylcarnitine profile. All 9 patients responded to riboflavin treatment with normalization of creatine kinase and muscle biopsy findings, and in 8 patients the clinical symptoms clearly improved.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings strongly suggest that sertraline may induce an acquired form of MADD in some patients. Importantly, riboflavin treatment seems to be similarly effective as in genetic MADD, but discontinuation of sertraline is reasonably warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:802–811</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess comparative effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of off-label rituximab, compared with frequently used therapies approved for multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A Swedish cohort study of persons with relapsing–remitting MS, age 18 to 75 years at inclusion and with a first therapy start or a first therapy switch between 2011 and 2018. Low-dose rituximab was compared with MS-approved therapies. Primary outcomes were proportions with 12 months confirmed disability worsening and change in MS Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) scores, respectively. Secondary endpoints included relapses, therapy discontinuation, and serious adverse events. Analyses used an intention-to-treat approach and were adjusted for demographics, MS features, and health characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 2,449 participants as first therapy start and 2,463 as first therapy switch. Proportions with disability worsening at 3 years were 9.1% for rituximab as first therapy and 5.1% after therapy switch, with no differences to MS-approved comparators. Worsening on rituximab was mostly independent of relapses. MSIS-29 with rituximab at 3 years improved by 1.3/8.4 points (physical/psychological) for first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and 0.4/3.6 for DMT switch, and was mostly similar across therapies. Rituximab had lower relapse rates and higher therapy persistence in both groups. The rate of hospital-treated infections was higher with rituximab after a therapy switch, but not as a first therapy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This population-based real-world cohort study found low rates of disability progression, mostly independent of relapses, and without significant differences between rituximab and MS-approved comparators. Rituximab led to lower rates of inflammatory activity and higher treatment persistence, but was associated with an increased rate of serious infections. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:678–693</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27015?af=R">Lesions Causing Alice in Wonderland Syndrome Map to a Common Brain Network Linking Body and Size Perception</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) profoundly affects human perception of size and scale, particularly regarding one's own body and the environment. Its neuroanatomical basis has remained elusive, partly because brain lesions causing AIWS can occur in different brain regions. Here, we aimed to determine if brain lesions causing AIWS map to a distributed brain network.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective case–control study analyzing 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS identified through systematic literature review was conducted. Using resting-state functional connectome data from 1,000 healthy individuals, the whole-brain connections of each lesion were estimated and contrasted with those from a control dataset comprising 1,073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric syndromes. Additionally, connectivity findings from lesion-induced AIWS cases were compared with functional neuroimaging results from 5 non-lesional AIWS cases.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AIWS-associated lesions were located in various brain regions with minimal overlap (≤33%). However, the majority of lesions (≥85%) demonstrated shared connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, known to be selectively activated by viewing body part images, and the inferior parietal cortex, involved in size and scale judgements. This pattern was uniquely characteristic of AIWS when compared with other neuropsychiatric disorders (family-wise error-corrected <i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) and consistent with functional neuroimaging observations in AIWS due to nonlesional causes (median correlation <i>r =</i> 0.56, interquartile range 0.24).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AIWS-related perceptual distortions map to one common brain network, encompassing regions critical for body representation and size-scale processing. These findings lend insight into the neuroanatomical localization of higher-order perceptual functions, and may inform future therapeutic strategies for perceptual disorders.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We investigated whether patients with large infarct and the presence or absence of perfusion mismatch are associated with endovascular treatment benefit.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a post-hoc analysis of the Endovascular Therapy in Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion with a Large Infarct (ANGEL-ASPECT) randomized trial, which enrolled patients within 24 hours of onset with ASPECTS 3 to 5 or ASPECTS 0 to 2 with an infarct core 70 to 100 ml. Mismatch ratio was defined as time-to-maximum (T<sub>max</sub>) &gt;6 s cerebral volume/ischemic core volume, and mismatch volume was defined as T<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s volume minus ischemic core volume. We divided patients into mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml, and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups. The primary outcome was the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ordinal distribution. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day mortality.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 425 patients included. In both the mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 395; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 31) and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 346; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 80), better 90-day modified Rankin Scale outcomes were found in the endovascular treatment group compared with the MM group (4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], common odds ratio [cOR], 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.001; 4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], cOR, 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively), but not in patients without mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (5 [3–6] vs 5 [4–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.3–4.1, <i>p</i> = 0.83), and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml (4 [3–6] vs 5 [3–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.60). However, no interaction effect was found in both subgroups (<i>p</i> interaction &gt;0.10).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Endovascular treatment was more efficacious than MM in patients with mismatch profiles, but no treatment effect or interaction was noted in the no mismatch profile patients. However, the small sample size of patients with no mismatch may have underpowered our analysis. A pooled analysis of large core trials stratified by mismatch is warranted.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Most paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) cases are hereditary, yet approximately 60% of patients remain genetically undiagnosed. We undertook the present study to uncover the genetic basis for undiagnosed PKD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 106 <i>PRRT2</i>-negative PKD probands. The functional impact of the genetic variants was investigated in HEK293T cells and <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> were identified in 11 individuals from 8 unrelated families, which accounted for 7.5% (8/106) of the <i>PRRT2</i>-negative probands. Both co-segregation of the identified variants and the significantly higher frequency of rare <i>KCNJ10</i> variants in PKD cases supported impacts from the detected <i>KCNJ10</i> heterozygous variants on PKD pathogenesis. Moreover, a <i>KCNJ10</i> mutation-carrying father from a typical EAST/SeSAME family was identified as a PKD patient. All patients manifested dystonia attacks triggered by sudden movement with a short episodic duration. Patch-clamp recordings in HEK293T cells revealed apparent reductions in K<sup>+</sup> currents of the patient-derived variants, indicating a loss-of-function. In <i>Drosophila</i>, milder hyperexcitability phenotypes were observed in heterozygous <i>Irk2</i> knock-in flies compared to homozygotes, supporting haploinsufficiency as the mechanism for the detected heterozygous variants. Electrophysiological recordings showed that excitatory neurons in <i>Irk2</i> haploinsufficiency flies exhibited increased excitability, and glia-specific complementation with human Kir4.1 rescued the <i>Irk2</i> mutant phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study established haploinsufficiency resulting from heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> can be understood as a previously unrecognized genetic cause for PKD and provided evidence of glial involvement in the pathophysiology of PKD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:758–773</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although metabolic abnormalities are implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a subject of controversy. We aimed to identify the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study included 395,987 participants from the UK Biobank to investigate the relationship between MetS and ALS. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Stratified analyses were performed based on gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and education level. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore potential mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this study, a total of 539 cases of ALS were recorded after a median follow-up of 13.7 years. Patients with MetS (defined harmonized) had a higher risk of developing ALS after adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19–1.89). Specifically, hypertension and high triglycerides were linked to a higher risk of ALS (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19–1.95; HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.61, respectively). Moreover, the quantity of metabolic abnormalities showed significant results. Stratified analysis revealed that these associations are particularly significant in individuals with a BMI &lt;25. These findings remained stable after sensitivity analysis. Notably, mediation analysis identified potential metabolites and metabolomic mediators, including alkaline phosphatase, cystatin C, γ-glutamyl transferase, saturated fatty acids to total fatty acids percentage, and omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids ratio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MetS exhibits a robust association with an increased susceptibility to ALS, particularly in individuals with a lower BMI. Furthermore, metabolites and metabolomics, as potential mediators, provide invaluable insights into the intricate biological mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:788–801</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated entorhinal cortex (EC) tau in low beta-amyloid individuals can predict accumulation of pathology and cognitive decline. We compared the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived locus coeruleus integrity, neocortical beta-amyloid burden by positron emission tomography (PET), and hippocampal volume in identifying elevated entorhinal tau signal in asymptomatic individuals who are considered beta-amyloid PET-negative.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 188 asymptomatic individuals (70.78 ± 11.51 years, 58% female) who underwent 3T-MRI of the locus coeruleus, Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), and Flortaucipir (FTP) PET. Associations between elevated EC tau and neocortical PiB, hippocampal volume, or locus coeruleus integrity were evaluated and compared using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses in the PiB− sample with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. Associations with clinical progression (CDR-sum-of-boxes) over a time span of 6 years were evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 26 (21%) individuals with high EC FTP in the CDR = 0/PiB− sample. Locus coeruleus integrity was a significantly more sensitive and specific predictor of elevated EC FTP (area under the curve [AUC] = 85%) compared with PiB (AUC = 77%) or hippocampal volume (AUC = 76%). Based on the Youden-index, locus coeruleus integrity obtained a sensitivity of 77% and 85% specificity. Using the resulting locus coeruleus Youden cut-off, lower locus coeruleus integrity was associated with a two-fold increase in clinical progression, including mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Locus coeruleus integrity has promise as a low-cost, non-invasive screening instrument to detect early cortical tau deposition and associated clinical progression in asymptomatic, low beta-amyloid individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:650–661</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine/chemokine profile of central nervous system (CNS) neurosarcoidosis (NS), and its utility in differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this case–control study, we validated 17 cytokines/chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) in a multiplexed automated immunoassay system (ELLA; Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and assessed them in CSF and serum of symptomatic patients with probable or definite CNS NS (01/2011–02/2023) with gadolinium enhancement and/or CSF pleocytosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis, primary CNS lymphoma, aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positivity, non-inflammatory disorders, and healthy individuals were used as controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 32 NS patients (59% women; median age, 59 years [19–81]) were included; concurrent sera were available in 12. CSF controls consisted of 26 multiple sclerosis, 8 primary CNS lymphoma, 84 aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positive, and 34 patients with non-inflammatory disorders. Gadolinium enhancement was present in 31 of 32 NS patients, and CSF pleocytosis in 27 of 32 (84%). CSF IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in NS patients compared with non-inflammatory controls (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.02); elevations were more common in CSF than serum. Concurrent elevation of IL-6, CXCL9, CXCL10, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha was present in 18 of 32 NS patients, but only in 1 control. Elevated IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, CXCL9, CXL10, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha associated with measures of disease activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NS CSF cytokine/chemokine profiles suggest T cell (mainly T helper cell type 1), macrophage, and B-cell involvement. These signatures aid in NS diagnosis, indicate disease activity, and suggest therapeutic avenues. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:704–714</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27026?af=R">Hospital‐Treated Infections and Risk of Disability Worsening in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the association between infections and disability worsening in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with either B-cell depleting therapy (rituximab) or interferon-beta/glatiramer acetate (IFN/GA).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study spanned from 2000 to 2021, using data from the Swedish MS Registry linked to national health care registries, comprising 8,759 rituximab and 7,561 IFN/GA treatment episodes. The risk of hospital-treated infection was estimated using multivariable Cox models. The association between infections and increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores was assessed using a doubly robust generalized estimating equations model. Additionally, a piece-wise exponential model analyzed events of increased disability beyond defined cut-off values, controlling for relapses, and MRI activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with IFN/GA, rituximab displayed increased risk of both inpatient- and outpatient-treated infections (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50–2.90 and HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13–1.67, respectively). An inpatient-treated infection was associated with a 0.19-unit increase in EDSS (95% CI, 0.12–0.26). Degree of worsening was greatest for progressive MS, and under IFN/GA treatment, which unlike rituximab, was more commonly associated with MRI activity. After controlling for relapses and MRI activity, inpatient-treated infections were associated with disability worsening in people with relapsing–remitting MS treated with IFN/GA (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.59–2.53), but not in those treated with rituximab.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to IFN/GA, rituximab doubled the infection risk, but reduced the risk of subsequent disability worsening. Further, the risk of worsening after hospital-treated infection was greater with progressive MS than with relapsing–remitting MS. Infection risk should be considered to improve long term outcomes.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. Objective surrogate markers sensitive to detect changes in disease severity are needed to reduce sample sizes in interventional trials and identification of predictors of faster disease progression would facilitate patient selection, enrichment, or stratification in such trials.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal, multimodal study in 34 ataxic SCA1 individuals and 21 healthy controls. We collected clinical, patient-reported outcomes, biochemical and magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers at baseline and after 1 year. We determined 1-year progression and evaluated the potential predictive value of several baseline markers on 1-year disease progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, multiple structural and spectroscopic MR markers in pons and cerebellum differentiated SCA1 from healthy controls and correlated with disease severity. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) chain and CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were elevated in SCA1. In longitudinal analysis, total brainstem and pontine volume change, inventory of non-ataxia signs (INAS) count, and SCA functional index (SCAFI) showed larger responsiveness compared to the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).</p>
<p>Longer disease duration, longer non-expanded CAG repeat length, and higher disease burden were associated with faster SARA increase after 1-year in the SCA1 group. Similarly, lower baseline brainstem, pontine, and cerebellar volumes, as well as lower levels of N-acetylaspartate and glutamate in the cerebellar white matter, were also associated with faster SARA increase.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results guide the selection of the most sensitive measures of disease progression in SCA1 and have identified features associated with accelerated progression that could inform the design of clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:774–787</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blepharospasm (BSP), focal dystonia with the highest risk of spread, lacks clear understanding of early spreading risk factors and objective prognostic indicators. We aimed to identify these risk factors through clinical and electrophysiological assessments, and to establish a predictive model for dystonic spread in BSP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We prospectively followed BSP patients for 4 years, collecting data on dystonic spread, and conducting electrophysiological evaluations. The blink reflex, masseter inhibitory reflex, and trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential were assessed. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess clinical characteristics associated with BSP dystonic spread. A predictive model was constructed using a nomogram, and performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 136 enrolled participants (mean age 56.34 years) completed a 4-year follow-up. Among them, 62 patients (45.6%) showed spread to other body regions. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that a high Hamilton Anxiety Scale score (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.13–1.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), prolonged trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential mandibular branch P1-N2 peak interval (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.017), and elevated trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential mandibular branch P1-N2 peak amplitude (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for BSP dystonic spread within 4 years. Combining these factors, the predictive models demonstrated excellent discriminative ability, with the receiver operating characteristic curve score being 0.797, 0.790, 0.847, and 0.820 at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years after enrollment, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We established a predictive model with significant value for anticipating dystonic spread in BSP, offering crucial evidence. These findings contribute essential insights into the early clinical identification of the development and evolution of BSP diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:747–757</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Training clinician–scientists is a primary objective of many academic neurology departments, as these individuals are uniquely positioned to perform insightful clinical or laboratory-based research informed both by clinical knowledge and their own experiences caring for patients. Despite its importance, training clinician–scientists has perhaps never been so challenging. The National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) R25 program was designed in an attempt to support these individuals, decrease the time needed to obtain National Institutes of Health K awards, and to help educate a cohort of trainees preparing for a career in academic neurology. We endeavored to describe the structure and features of the program while examining its outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>R25 outcome data from 2009 to 2024 were reviewed. Statistical comparisons were made using 2-sided Mann–Whitney <i>U</i> testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 67% of adult neurologists who received an R25 had a successful application for a National Institutes of Health K award compared with 45% of adult neurologists who had not received R25 support (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Among child neurologists, 73% who applied went on to receive K funding after R25 support, compared with 45% who had not been part of the R25 program (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The average time between completion of residency and obtaining a K award for R25 participants was decreased by 26 months among those with an MD/PhD degree, and 32 months for those with an MD degree compared with non-R25 individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The R25 program has been successful in achieving its training goals, but stands as only one component of support for aspiring clinician–scientists. Investments and commitments made by academic neurology departments are key to supporting this success. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:625–632</p>

                Background Dentocraniofacial asymmetry is a common condition that affects many individuals. Accurate diagnosis of this condition is essential for effective treatment planning. Aim This study aimed to compare the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial asymmetry using two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at the Orthodontic Specialist Clinic of the Dental Hospital Faculty of Dentistry, University of Indonesia from March to April 2023. The study included 15 patients who had not undergone orthodontic treatment and were diagnosed with dentocraniofacial asymmetry. The study compared the results of diagnosing asymmetry in 15 different facial features, including the anterior nasal spine, upper and lower first incisors, pterygomaxillary fissure, orbita, menton, porion, upper and lower first molars, coronoid process, gonion, zygoma, latero nasale, and jugulare. Results The study found that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two- and three-dimensional methods across all 15 parameters measured. The researchers used Fisher's Exact Test to compare the proportion between dependent variables and found that the p-value was greater than 0.05, indicating that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two methods. The study also used Kappa Cohen analysis to measure the strength of agreement between the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods on each parameter. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that both two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods are equally effective in diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry. This information may be useful for orthodontists in deciding which method to use when diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry.

                Reddy and Reddy (2014) discuss the optimal timing for lithium levels in patients taking once-daily extended-release lithium formulations. They argue for blood sampling 24 h after the previous dose rather than the standard 12 h. I interpret the data quite differently. The authors start with the assumption that the clinician wants a trough level. I disagree. What one wants is to be able to compare a patient’s lithium level to the large body of published knowledge about lithium dosing. Almost all of that data comes from standard 12-h blood draws with plain (immediate-release) lithium carbonate or lithium citrate. So, the real question of interest is, with extended-release lithium formulations, at what time point does one draw the lithium level to compare most accurately with a standard 12-h blood draw with plain lithium carbonate? The answer is not obvious because extended-release formulations affect only the absorption and not the excretion of lithium. Their primary benefit is reducing the transient peak lithium serum concentration, not delaying the (already relatively slow) elimination of lithium. Emami and colleagues (2004) provide the needed data. First they show that 90% of the administered dose of a commercial extended-release formulation (Eskalith CR®) is absorbed by 4 h after a dose, and ~100% is absorbed by 8 h (their Figure 2A). Second, they show that at 12 h after a dose, the blood levels for immediate and extended release formulations are essentially identical (their Figure 3).  Thus 12 h after the previous dose is the ideal time for drawing blood levels for extended-release lithium tablets.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-649/v2?src=rss">Psychological interventions for early-phase schizophrenia: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Treating the early phase of schizophrenia is crucial for preventing further episodes and improving quality of life, functioning, and social inclusion. Pharmacotherapies are first-line treatments, but have limitations. There is consensus on the need for non-pharmacological interventions for individuals in the early phase of schizophrenia. Several psychological interventions have shown promising effects; however, their comparative effectiveness remains largely unknown. To address this issue, a network meta-analysis will be performed. We aim to develop a hierarchy of existing psychological treatments concerning their efficacy and tolerability, which will inform treatment guidelines. Protocol Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychological interventions for first-episode psychosis, first-episode schizophrenia, or early phase schizophrenia will be included. The primary outcome will be overall schizophrenia symptoms (measured up to 6 and 12 months, and at the longest follow-up) and relapse as a co-primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are premature discontinuation; change in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia; response; quality of life; overall functioning; satisfaction with care; adherence; adverse events; and mortality. The study selection and data extraction are performed by two independent reviewers. We will assess the risk of bias of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 and evaluate the confidence in the results using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of our findings. Discussion This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to compare multiple existing psychological interventions, establishing which are best for symptom reduction, relapse prevention, and other important outcomes in early phase schizophrenia. Our results may provide practical guidance concerning the most effective psychological intervention to reduce symptom severity and the societal burden associated with the disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91432">Cryo-EM structure of the CBC-ALYREF complex</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotes, RNAs transcribed by RNA Pol II are modified at the 5′ end with a 7-methylguanosine (m<sup>7</sup>G) cap, which is recognized by the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). The CBC plays multiple important roles in mRNA metabolism, including transcription, splicing, polyadenylation, and export. It promotes mRNA export through direct interaction with a key mRNA export factor, ALYREF, which in turn links the TRanscription and EXport (TREX) complex to the 5′ end of mRNA. However, the molecular mechanism for CBC-mediated recruitment of the mRNA export machinery is not well understood. Here, we present the first structure of the CBC in complex with an mRNA export factor, ALYREF. The cryo-EM structure of CBC-ALYREF reveals that the RRM domain of ALYREF makes direct contact with both the NCBP1 and NCBP2 subunits of the CBC. Comparing CBC-ALYREF with other cellular complexes containing CBC and/or ALYREF components provides insights into the coordinated events during mRNA transcription, splicing, and export.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90992">Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in Sertoli cells regulates age-dependent changes in sperm DNA methylation</a></h4>

              
                Over the past several decades, a trend toward delayed childbirth has led to increases in parental age at the time of conception. Sperm epigenome undergoes age-dependent changes increasing risks of adverse conditions in offspring conceived by fathers of advanced age. The mechanism(s) linking paternal age with epigenetic changes in sperm remain unknown. The sperm epigenome is shaped in a compartment protected by the blood-testes barrier (BTB) known to deteriorate with age. Permeability of the BTB is regulated by the balance of two mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells where mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes the opening of the BTB and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) promotes its integrity. We hypothesized that this balance is also responsible for age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed reproductive outcomes, including sperm DNA methylation in transgenic mice with Sertoli cell-specific suppression of mTORC1 (<i>Rptor</i> KO) or mTORC2 (<i>Rictor</i> KO). mTORC2 suppression accelerated aging of the sperm DNA methylome and resulted in a reproductive phenotype concordant with older age, including decreased testes weight and sperm counts, and increased percent of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and mitochondrial DNA copy number. Suppression of mTORC1 resulted in the shift of DNA methylome in sperm opposite to the shift associated with physiological aging – sperm DNA methylome rejuvenation and mild changes in sperm parameters. These results demonstrate for the first time that the balance of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells regulates the rate of sperm epigenetic aging. Thus, mTOR pathway in Sertoli cells may be used as a novel target of therapeutic interventions to rejuvenate the sperm epigenome in advanced-age fathers.

                Under physiological conditions, proteins continuously undergo structural fluctuations on different timescales. Some conformations are only sparsely populated, but still play a key role in protein function. Thus, meaningful structure–function frameworks must include structural ensembles rather than only the most populated protein conformations. To detail protein plasticity, modern structural biology combines complementary experimental and computational approaches. In this review, we survey available computational approaches that integrate sparse experimental data from electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with molecular modeling techniques to derive all-atom structural models of rare protein conformations. We also propose strategies to increase the reliability and improve efficiency using deep learning approaches, thus advancing the field of integrative structural biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96643">PPI-hotspotID for detecting protein–protein interaction hot spots from the free protein structure</a></h4>

              
                Experimental detection of residues critical for protein–protein interactions (PPI) is a time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive process. Hence, high-throughput PPI-hot spot prediction methods have been developed, but they have been validated using relatively small datasets, which may compromise their predictive reliability. Here, we introduce PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup>, a novel method for identifying PPI-hot spots using the free protein structure, and validated it on the largest collection of experimentally confirmed PPI-hot spots to date. We explored the possibility of detecting PPI-hot spots using (i) FTMap in the PPI mode, which identifies hot spots on protein–protein interfaces from the <i>free</i> protein structure, and (ii) the interface residues predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer. PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup> yielded better performance than FTMap and SPOTONE, a webserver for predicting PPI-hot spots given the protein sequence. When combined with the AlphaFold-Multimer-predicted interface residues, PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup> yielded better performance than either method alone. Furthermore, we experimentally verified several PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup>-predicted PPI-hot spots of eukaryotic elongation factor 2. Notably, PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup> can reveal PPI-hot spots not obvious from complex structures, including those in <i>indirect</i> contact with binding partners. PPI-hotspot<sup>ID</sup> serves as a valuable tool for understanding PPI mechanisms and aiding drug design. It is available as a web server (<a href="https://ppihotspotid.limlab.dnsalias.org/">https://ppihotspotid.limlab.dnsalias.org/</a>) and open-source code (<a href="https://github.com/wrigjz/ppihotspotid/">https://github.com/wrigjz/ppihotspotid/</a>).

">Manipulating attentional priority creates a trade-off between memory and sensory representations in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                People often remember visual information over brief delays while actively engaging with ongoing inputs from the surrounding visual environment. Depending on the situation, one might prioritize mnemonic contents (i.e., remembering details of a past event), or preferentially attend sensory inputs (i.e., minding traffic while crossing a street). Previous fMRI work has shown that early sensory regions can simultaneously represent both mnemonic and passively viewed sensory information. Here we test the limits of such simultaneity by manipulating attention towards sensory distractors during a working memory task performed by human subjects during fMRI scanning. Participants remembered the orientation of a target grating while a distractor grating was shown during the middle portion of the memory delay. Critically, there were several subtle changes in the contrast and the orientation of the distractor, and participants were cued to either ignore the distractor, detect a change in contrast, or detect a change in orientation. Despite sensory stimulation being matched in all three conditions, the fidelity of memory representations in early visual cortex was highest when the distractor was ignored, intermediate when participants attended distractor contrast, and lowest when participants attended the orientation of the distractor during the delay. In contrast, the fidelity of distractor representations was lowest when ignoring the distractor, intermediate when attending distractor-contrast, and highest when attending distractor-orientation. These data suggest a trade-off in early sensory representations when engaging top-down feedback to attend both seen and remembered features and may partially explain memory failures that occur when subjects are distracted by external events.

">Establishment of an optimized and automated workflow for whole brain probing of neuronal activity.</a></h4>

              
                Behaviors are encoded by widespread neural circuits within the brain that change with age and experience. Immunodetection of the immediate early gene c-Fos has been successfully used for decades to reveal neural circuits active during specific tasks or conditions. Our objectives here were to develop and benchmark a workflow that circumvents classical temporal and spatial limitations associated with c-Fos quantification. We combined c-Fos immunohistochemistry with c-Fos driven Cre-dependant tdTomato expression in the TRAP2 mice, to visualize and perform a direct comparison of neural circuits activated at different times or during different tasks. By using open-source software (QuPath and ABBA), we established a workflow that optimize and automate cell detection, cell classification (e.g. c-Fos vs. c-Fos/tdTomato) and whole brain registration. We demonstrate that this workflow, based on fully automatic scripts, allows accurate cell number quantification with minimal interindividual variability. Further, interrogation of brain atlases at different scales (from simplified to detailed) allows gradually zooming on brain regions to explore spatial distribution of activated cells. We illustrate the potential of this approach by comparing patterns of neuronal activation in various contexts (two vigilance states, complex behavioral tasks...), in separate groups of mice or at two time points in the same animals. Finally, we explore software (BrainRender) for intuitive representation of the results. Altogether, this automated workflow accessible to all labs with some expertise in histology, allows an unbiased, fast and accurate analysis of the whole brain activity pattern at the cellular level, in various contexts.

">Ipsilateral stimulation shows somatotopy of thumb and shoulder auricular points on the left primary somatosensory cortex using high-density fNIRS</a></h4>

              
                Auriculotherapy is a technique based on stimulation applied to specific ear points. Its mechanism of active and clinical efficacy remain to be established. This study aims to assess the role that primary somatosensory cortex may play to validate auriculotherapy mechanisms. This study examined whether tactile stimulation at specific auricular points is correlated with distinct cortical activation in the primary somatosensory cortex. Seventeen healthy adults participated in the study. Tactile stimuli were delivered to the thumb, shoulder, and skin master points on the ear using von Frey filaments. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure and spatially map cortical responses. This study revealed distinct hemodynamic activity patterns in response to ear point stimulation, consistent with the classic homunculus model of somatotopic organization. Ipsilateral stimulation showed specific cortical activations for the thumb and shoulder points, while contralateral stimulation showed less significant activity. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy effectively captured localized cortical responses to ear tactile stimuli, supporting the somatotopic mapping hypothesis. These findings enhance the understanding of sensory processing with auricular stimulation and supports the concepts of auricular cartography that underpins some schools of auriculotherapy practice. Future research should explore bilateral cortical mapping and the integration of other neuroimaging techniques.

                Multisensory object discrimination is essential in everyday life, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we trained rats to perform a two-alternative forced-choice task using both auditory and visual cues. Our findings reveal that multisensory perceptual learning actively engages auditory cortex (AC) neurons in both visual and audiovisual processing. Importantly, many audiovisual neurons in the AC exhibited experience-dependent associations between their visual and auditory preferences, displaying a unique integration model. This model employed selective multisensory enhancement for specific auditory-visual pairings, which facilitated improved multisensory discrimination. Additionally, AC neurons effectively distinguished whether a preferred auditory stimulus was paired with its associated visual stimulus using this distinct integrative mechanism. Our results highlight the capability of sensory cortices to develop sophisticated integrative strategies, adapting to task demands to enhance multisensory discrimination abilities.

                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of CGG repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Many FXS patients experience sleep disruptions, and we sought to explore these symptoms along with the possible benefits of a scheduled feeding intervention using the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model. These mutants displayed clear evidence for sleep and circadian disturbances including delay in the onset of sleep and fragmented activity rhythms with increases in cycle-to-cycle variability. The Fmr1 KO mice exhibited deficits in their circadian behavioral response to light with reduced masking, longer time to resetting to shifts in the LD cycle, altered synchronization to a skeleton photoperiod and lower magnitude light-induced phase shifts of activity rhythms. Investigation of the retinal input to the surprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) with the neurotracer cholera toxin ({beta}subunit) and quantification of the light-evoked cFos expression in the SCN revealed an abnormal retinal innervation of the SCN in the Fmr1 KO, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed behavioral deficits. Interestingly, disruptions in social and repetitive behavior correlated with sleep duration and fragmentation. Understanding the nature of the deficits, we decided to apply a scheduled feeding regimen (6-hr/18-hr feed/fast cycle) as a circadian-based strategy to boast circadian rhythms independently of light. This intervention significantly improved the activity rhythms and sleep in the mutants. Strikingly, the scheduled feeding ameliorated social interactions and reduced repetitive behaviors as well as the levels of Interferon-gamma and Interleukin-12 in the Fmr1 KO mutants, suggesting that timed eating may be an effective way to reduce inflammation. Collectively, this work adds support to efforts to develop circadian based interventions to help with symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders.

">A mosaic of whole-body representations in human motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the body is represented in motor cortex is key to understanding how the brain controls movement. The precentral gyrus (PCG) has long been thought to contain largely distinct regions for the arm, leg and face (represented by the "motor homunculus"). However, mounting evidence has begun to reveal a more intermixed, interrelated and broadly tuned motor map. Here, we revisit the motor homunculus using microelectrode array recordings from 20 arrays that broadly sample PCG across 8 individuals, creating a comprehensive map of human motor cortex at single neuron resolution. We found whole-body representations throughout all sampled points of PCG, contradicting traditional leg/arm/face boundaries. We also found two speech-preferential areas with a broadly tuned, orofacial-dominant area in between them, previously unaccounted for by the homunculus. Throughout PCG, movement representations of the four limbs were interlinked, with homologous movements of different limbs (e.g., toe curl and hand close) having correlated representations. Our findings indicate that, while the classic homunculus aligns with each area's preferred body region at a coarse level, at a finer scale, PCG may be better described as a mosaic of functional zones, each with its own whole-body representation.

">Positional information drives distinct traits in transcriptomically identified neuronal types</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal phenotypic traits such as morphology, connectivity, and function are dictated, to a large extent, by a specific combination of differentially expressed genes. Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases (e. g., C. elegans neurons and retinal ganglion cells) have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. While the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized. To uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We then measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profile. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Surprisingly, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can diverge functionally and morphologically. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons.

">Rebalance the inhibitory system in the elderly brain: Influence of balance learning on GABAergic inhibition and functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Aging involves complex processes that impact the structure, function, and metabolism of the human brain. Declines in both structural and functional integrity along with reduced local inhibitory tone in the motor areas, as indicated by reduced gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, are often associated with compromised motor performance in elderly adults. Using multi-modal neuroimaging techniques including magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), this study explores whether these age-related changes can be mitigated by motor learning. The investigation focused on the effects of long-term balance learning (3 months) on intracortical inhibition, metabolism, structural and functional connectivity in the cortical sensorimotor network among an elderly cohort. We found that after three months of balance learning, subjects significantly improved balance performance, upregulated sensorimotor cortical GABA levels and ventral sensorimotor network functional connectivity (VSN-FC) compared to a passive control group. Furthermore, correlation analysis suggested a positive association between baseline VSN-FC and balance performance, between baseline VSN-FC and SICI, and between improvements in balance performance and upregulation in SICI in the training group, though these correlations did not survive the false discovery rate correction. These findings demonstrate that balance learning has the potential to counteract aging-related decline in functional connectivity and cortical inhibition on the "tonic" (MRS) and "functional" (SICI) level and shed new light on the close interplay between the GABAergic system, functional connectivity, and behavior.

">Synaptic Specializations at Dopamine Release Sites Orchestrate Efficient and Precise Neuromodulatory Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is a key chemical neuromodulator that plays vital roles in various brain functions. Traditionally, neuromodulators like dopamine are believed to be released in a diffuse manner and are not commonly associated with synaptic structures where pre- and postsynaptic processes are closely aligned. Our findings challenge this conventional view. Using single-bouton optical measurements of dopamine release, we discovered that dopamine is predominantly released from varicosities that are juxtaposed against the processes of their target neurons. Dopamine axons specifically target neurons expressing dopamine receptors, forming synapses to release dopamine. Interestingly, varicosities that were not directly apposed to dopamine receptor-expressing processes or associated with neurons lacking dopamine receptors did not release dopamine, regardless of their vesicle content. The ultrastructure of dopamine release sites share common features of classical synapses. We further show that the dopamine released at these contact sites induces a precise, dopamine-gated biochemical response in the target processes. Our results indicate that dopamine release sites share key characteristics of conventional synapses that enable relatively precise and efficient neuromodulation of their targets.

">Age-related alterations in functional and structural networks in the brain in macaque monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state networks (RSNs) have been used as biomarkers of brain diseases and cognitive performance. However, age-related changes in the RSNs of macaques, a representative animal model, are still not fully understood. In this study, we measured the RSNs in macaques aged 3-20 years and investigated the age-related changes from both functional and structural perspectives. The proportion of structural connectivity in the RSNs significantly decreased, whereas functional connectivity showed an increasing trend with age. Additionally, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations tended to increase with age, indicating that resting-state neural activity may be more active in the RSNs may increase with age. These results indicate that structural and functional alterations in typical RSNs are age-dependent and can be a marker of aging in the brain.

">Changes in nucleus accumbens core translatome accompanying incubation of cocaine craving</a></h4>

              
                In the incubation of cocaine craving model of relapse, rats exhibit progressive intensification (incubation) of cue-induced craving over several weeks of forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration. The expression of incubated craving depends on plasticity of excitatory synaptic transmission in nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) medium spiny neurons (MSN). Previously, we found that the maintenance of this plasticity and the expression of incubation depends on ongoing protein translation, and the regulation of translation is altered after incubation of cocaine craving. Here we used male and female rats that express Cre recombinase in either dopamine D1 receptor- or adenosine 2a (A2a) receptor-expressing MSN to express a GFP-tagged ribosomal protein in a cell-type specific manner, enabling us to use Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) to isolate actively translating mRNAs from both MSN subtypes for analysis by RNA-seq. We compared rats that self-administered saline or cocaine. Saline rats were assessed on abstinence day (AD) 1, while cocaine rats were assessed on AD1 or AD40-50. For both D1-MSN and A2a-MSN, there were few differentially translated genes between saline and cocaine AD1 groups. In contrast, pronounced differences in the translatome were observed between cocaine rats on AD1 and AD40-50, and this was far more robust in D1-MSN. Notably, all comparisons revealed sex differences in translating mRNAs. Sequencing results were validated by qRT-PCR for several genes of interest. This study, the first to combine TRAP-seq, transgenic rats, and a cocaine self-administration paradigm, identifies translating mRNAs linked to incubation of cocaine craving in D1-MSN and A2a-MSN of the NAcC.

                This study explores the impact of stress on working memory (WM) performance, and the potential mitigating effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The study had a crossover, randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled design, with stress induction as within-subject and stimulation condition as between-subject factors. We assessed stress-induced WM deficits using aversive video clips to induce stress and a verbal n-back task to assess WM performance. We analyzed physiological (cortisol and heart rate), behavioral, and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes due to stress before, during, and after WM task performance and their modulation by tDCS. Stress impaired WM performance in the sham stimulation condition for the 3-back load, but not for 2-back or 4-back loads in the WM task, and was associated with elevated physiological stress markers. tDCS over the vmPFC led to better WM task performance while stimulation over the dlPFC did not. Active tDCS with both dlPFC and vmPFC stimulation blunted cortisol release in stress conditions compared to sham. The EEG analysis revealed potential mechanisms explaining the behavioral effects of vmPFC stimulation. vmPFC stimulation led to a decreased P200 event-related potential (ERP) component compared to the sham stimulation condition and resulted in higher task-related alpha desynchronization, indicating reduced distractions and better focus during task performance. This study thus shows that the vmPFC might be a potential target for mitigating the effects of stress on WM performance, and contributes to the development of targeted interventions for stress-related cognitive impairments.

">Global and compartmentalized serotonergic control of sensorimotor integration underlying motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                The vertebrate serotonergic system plays a critical role in modulating adaptive behavior. Yet, it has been challenging to unravel the downstream targets and the effects of serotonin on ongoing neural dynamics due to its widespread innervation and the complex nature of receptor signaling. Here, we show that the serotonergic system controls brain-wide neural dynamics in a spatially dualistic manner, global and compartmentalized, during motor adaptation behavior in zebrafish. Larval zebrafish adapt the vigor of tail motions depending on environmental drag force during visual pursuit behavior in a serotonin-dependent manner. Whole-brain imaging of serotonin release and systematic spatial mapping of serotonin receptors showed highly compartmentalized patterns that span multiple brain areas. Interestingly, whole-brain neural activity imaging combined with the perturbation of tph2+ raphe serotonin neurons revealed dualistic modulation of neural activity depending on behavioral encoding: global suppression of locomotor networks and the compartmentalized enhancement of midbrain sensory networks, both of which synergistically enabled motor adaptation. The compartmentalized modulation resulted from local serotonin release and receptor expression, while the global effect was due to modulation of a key network hub that broadcasts behavioral state signals. Our results reveal how the serotonergic system interacts with brain-wide neural dynamics through its parallel interactions and provide a conceptual framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of widespread serotonergic behavioral control.

">Probing the role of Nogo receptor homolog NgR2 in setting up cochlear connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Sound encoding depends on the precise and reliable neurotransmission at the afferent synapses between the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation, as well as interplay between the pre- and postsynaptic components remains largely unclear. Here, we tested the role of the Nogo receptor homolog NgR2 (RTN4rl2) in the development and function of afferent IHC-SGN synapses. Upon deletion of NgR2 in mice (NgR2-/-), presynaptic IHC active zones showed enlarged synaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs were smaller and deficient of GluA2/3 despite maintained Gria2 mRNA expression in SGNs. Next to synaptically engaged PSDs we observed "orphan" PSDs located away from IHCs. They likely belong to a subset of SGN peripheral neurites that do not contact the IHCs in NgR2-/- cochleae as found by volume electron microscopy reconstruction of SGN neurites. Auditory brainstem responses of NgR2-/- mice showed increased sound thresholds indicating impaired hearing. Together, these findings suggest that NgR2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing.

">Optic nerve crush does not induce retinal ganglion cell loss in the contralateral eye.</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Optic nerve crush (ONC) is a model for studying optic nerve trauma. Unilateral ONC induces massive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration in the affected eye, leading to vision loss within a month. A common assumption has been that the non-injured contralateral eye is unaffected due to the minimal anatomical decussation of the RGC projections at the chiasm. Yet, recently, microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, have shown a responsive phenotype in the contralateral eye after ONC. Whether RGC loss accompanies this phenotype is still controversial. Methods: Using the available RGCode algorithm and developing our own RGC-Quant deep-learning-based tool, we quantify the total number and density of RGCs across the entire retina after ONC. Results: We confirm a short-term microglia response in the contralateral eye after ONC, but this did not affect microglia number. Furthermore, we cannot confirm the previously reported RGC loss between naive and contralateral retinas five weeks after ONC induction across the commonly used Cx3cr1creERT2 and C57BL6/J mouse models. Neither sex nor the direct comparison of the RGC markers Brn3a and RBPMS, with Brn3a co-labeling, on average, 89% of the RBPMS+-cells, explained this discrepancy, suggesting that the early microglia-responsive phenotype does not have immediate consequences on the RGC number. Conclusions: Our results corroborate that unilateral optic nerve injury elicits a microglial response in the uninjured contralateral eye but without RGC loss. Therefore, the contralateral eye should be treated separately and not as an ONC control.

">Voltage imaging reveals circuit computations in the raphe underlying serotonin-mediated motor vigor learning</a></h4>

              
                As animals adapt to new situations, neuromodulation is a potent way to alter behavior, yet mechanisms by which neuromodulatory nuclei compute during behavior are underexplored. The serotonergic raphe supports motor learning in larval zebrafish by visually detecting distance traveled during swims, encoding action effectiveness, and modulating motor vigor. We found that swimming opens a gate for visual input to cause spiking in serotonergic neurons, enabling encoding of action outcomes and filtering out learning-irrelevant visual signals. Using light-sheet microscopy, voltage sensors, and neurotransmitter/modulator sensors, we tracked millisecond-timescale neuronal input-output computations during behavior. Swim commands initially inhibited serotonergic neurons via GABA, closing the gate to spiking. Immediately after, the gate briefly opened: voltage increased consistent with post-inhibitory rebound, allowing swim-induced visual motion to evoke firing through glutamate, triggering serotonin secretion and modulating motor vigor. Ablating GABAergic neurons impaired raphe coding and motor learning. Thus, serotonergic neuromodulation arises from action-outcome coincidence detection within the raphe, suggesting the existence of similarly fast and precise circuit computations across neuromodulatory nuclei.

">Vocal processing networks in the human and marmoset brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the brain circuitry involved in vocal processing across species is crucial for unraveling the evolutionary roots of human communication. While previous research has pinpointed voice-sensitive regions in primates, direct cross-species comparisons using standardized protocols are limited. This study utilizes ultra-high field fMRI to explore vocal processing mechanisms in humans and marmosets. By employing voice-sensitive regions of interest (ROIs) identified via auditory localizers, we analyzed response time courses to species-specific vocalizations and non-vocal sounds using a dynamic auditory-stimulation paradigm. This approach gradually introduced sounds into white noise over 33 seconds. Results revealed that both species have responsive areas in the temporal, frontal, and cingulate cortices, with a distinct preference for vocalizations. Significant differences were found in the response time courses between vocal and non-vocal sounds, with humans displaying faster responses to vocalizations than marmosets. We also identified a shared antero-ventral auditory pathway in both species for vocal processing, originating from the superior temporal gyrus. Conversely, a posterior-dorsal pathway was more prominent in humans, whereas in marmosets, this pathway processed both sound types similarly. This comparative study sheds light on both conserved and divergent auditory pathways in primates, providing new insights into conspecific vocalization processing.

">Heritability of movie-evoked brain activity and connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The neural bases of sensory processing are conserved across people, but no two individuals experience the same stimulus in exactly the same way. Recent work has established that the idiosyncratic nature of subjective experience is underpinned by individual variability in brain responses to sensory information. However, the fundamental origins of this individual variability have yet to be systematically investigated. Here, we establish a genetic basis for individual differences in sensory processing by quantifying (1) the heritability of high-dimensional brain responses to movies and (2) the extent to which this heritability is grounded in lower-level aspects of brain function. Specifically, we leverage 7T fMRI data collected from a twin sample to first show that movie-evoked brain activity and connectivity patterns are heritable across the cortex. Next, we use hyperalignment to decompose this heritability into genetic similarity in where vs. how sensory information is processed. Finally, we show that the heritability of brain activity patterns can be partially explained by the heritability of the neural timescale, a one-dimensional measure of local circuit functioning. These results demonstrate that brain responses to complex stimuli are heritable, and that this heritability is due, in part, to genetic control over stable aspects of brain function.

">Glutamatergic regulation of miRNA-containing exosome precursor trafficking and secretion from cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal exosomes are emerging secreted signals that play important roles in the CNS. Currently little is known about how glutamatergic signaling affects the subcellular localization of exosome precursor intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), microRNA (miR) packaging into ILVs, and in vivo neuronal exosome spreading. By selectively labeling ILVs and exosomes with GFP-tagged human CD63 (hCD63-GFP) in cortical neurons, we found that glutamate stimulation significantly redistributes subcellular localization of hCD63-GFP+ ILVs especially decreases its co-localization with multi-vesicular body (MVB) marker Rab7 while substantially promoting exosome secretion. Interestingly, glutamate stimulation only modestly alters exosomal miR profiles based on small RNA sequencing. Subsequent in vivo cortical neuronal DREADD activation leads to significantly more widespread hCD63-GFP+ area in hCD63-GFPf/+ mice, consistently supporting the stimulatory effect of glutamatergic activation on neuronal exosome secretion and spreading. Moreover, in situ localization of hCD63-GFP+ ILVs and secreted exosomes from specialized Hb9+ and DAT+ neurons were also illustrated in the CNS.

">Exploring Differences in Functional Connectivity in Australian Rules Football Players : A Resting-State fMRI Study on the Default Mode Network</a></h4>

              
                The effects of non-concussive impacts in contact-sports such as in Australian rules football (ARF) are still largely unexplored. These impacts are often but not always lower in intensity, but occur more frequently than actual concussions. Since non-concussive impacts are often asymptomatic, their significance may be underestimated. Acute or subacute measurement of non-concussive injury is challenging as the pathological response and injury is poorly described. There is therefore a need for a greater understanding of the pathological consequences of exposure. Growing evidence indicates that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fMRI) changes in the Default Mode Network (DMN) may be an important biomarker that is sensitive to characterize these impacts. In this work, we examined functional connectivity changes within the DMN of ARF players to evaluate its potential as an early biomarker for non-concussive impacts. Based on rs-fMRI, we compare the DMN of 47 sub-elite ARF players (mean age 21.5+/-2.7 years [SD], males 57%) and 42 age-matched healthy controls (mean age 23.2+/-2.3 years [SD], males 48%) using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Dual Regression. This approach permits an unbiased decomposition of brain activity into networks with principled handling of statistical error. An 83% increase in DMN connectivity (as measured by the Strictly Standardized Mean Difference on values derived from Dual Regression) was observed in ARF players in the left retrosplenial cingulate cortex compared to healthy controls (FDR-corrected p-value from dual regression = 0.03, 95% CI computed via bootstrapping was 58% to 116%). The AUC for distinguishing ARF players from controls was 0.80 (95% CI; [0.71, 0.89]), equating to a PPV of 78% and a NPV of 74%. These results are preliminary; future work could investigate robustness to different random initializations of ICA and validate the findings on an independent testing set, as well as investigate longitudinal changes in ARF players over the course of a playing season.

">Genetic-Dependent Brain Signatures of Resilience: Interactions among Childhood Abuse, Genetic Risks and Brain Function</a></h4>

              
                Resilience to emotional disorders is critical for adolescent mental health, especially following childhood abuse. Yet, brain signatures of resilience remain undetermined due to the differential susceptibility of the brain emotion processing system to environmental stresses. Analyzing brain's responses to angry faces in a longitudinally large-scale adolescent cohort (IMAGEN), we identified two functional networks related to the orbitofrontal and occipital regions as candidate brain signatures of resilience. In girls, but not boys, higher activation in the orbitofrontal-related network was associated with fewer emotional symptoms following childhood abuse, but only when the polygenic burden for depression was high. This finding defined a genetic-dependent brain (GDB) signature of resilience. Notably, this GDB signature predicted subsequent emotional disorders in late adolescence, extending into early adulthood and generalizable to another independent prospective cohort (ABCD). Our findings underscore the genetic modulation of resilience-brain connections, laying the foundation for enhancing adolescent mental health through resilience promotion.

">A Hopfield network model of neuromodulatory arousal state</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits display both input-driven activity that is necessary for the real-time control of behavior and internally generated activity that is necessary for memory, planning, and other cognitive processes. A key mediator between these intrinsic and evoked dynamics is arousal, an internal state variable that determines an animal's level of engagement with its environment. It has been hypothesized that arousal state acts through neuromodulatory gain control mechanisms that suppress recurrent connectivity and amplify bottom-up input. In this paper, we instantiate this longstanding idea in a continuous Hopfield network embellished with a gain parameter that mimics arousal state by suppressing recurrent interactions between the network's units. We show that dynamics capturing some essential effects of arousal state at the neural and cognitive levels emerge in this simple model as a single parameter, recurrent gain, is varied. Using the model's formal connections to the Boltzmann machine and the Ising model, we offer functional interpretations of arousal state rooted in Bayesian inference and statistical physics. Finally, we liken the dynamics of neuromodulator release to an annealing schedule that facilitates adaptive behavior in ever-changing environments. In summary, we present a minimal neural network model of arousal state that exhibits rich but analytically tractable emergent behavior and reveals conceptually clarifying parallels between arousal state and seemingly unrelated phenomena.

">Automated speech artefact removal from MEG data utilizing facial gestures and mutual information</a></h4>

              
                The ability to speak is one of the most crucial human skills, motivating neuroscientific studies of speech production and speech-related neural dynamics. Increased knowledge in this area, allows e.g., for development of rehabilitation protocols for language-related disorders. While our understanding of speech-related neural processes has greatly enhanced owing to non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, the interpretations have been limited by speech artefacts caused by the activation of facial muscles that mask important language-related information. Despite earlier approaches applying independent component analysis (ICA), the artefact removal process continues to be time-consuming, poorly replicable and affected by inconsistencies between different observers, typically requiring manual selection of artefactual components. The artefact component selection criteria have been variable, leading to non-standardized speech artefact removal processes. To address these issues, we propose here a pipeline for automated speech artefact removal from MEG data. We developed an ICA-based speech artefact removal routine by utilizing EMG data measured from facial muscles during a facial gesture task for isolating the speech-induced artefacts. Additionally, we used mutual information (MI) as a similarity measure between the EMG signals and the ICA-decomposed MEG to provide a feasible way to identify the artefactual components. Our approach efficiently and in an automated manner removed speech artefacts from MEG data. The method can be feasibly applied to improve the understanding of speech-related cortical dynamics, while transparently evaluating the removed and preserved MEG activation.

">FEATURE-SPECIFIC ANTICIPATORY PROCESSING FADES DURING HUMAN SLEEP</a></h4>

              
                The brain's ability to extract statistical regularities from sensory input allows it to predict future stimuli. This process appears to be automatic, requiring no conscious effort or attentional resources. Given that attention is naturally reduced during sleep, recent studies have explored the extent to which the brain continues to engage in predictive processing of auditory inputs. Here, for the first time, we examine the brain's ability to predict or pre-activate the low-level stimulus features of an expected stimulus prior to its actual presentation during sleep. In a passive listening paradigm, 34 participants listened to tone sequences comprising of four simple tones (i.e., low to high-pitch), while recording simultaneous EEG and MEG brain activity during wakefullness (20 mins) and a 2.5 hour nap. We presented the tones continuously at a fixed presentation rate (3 Hz), to establish strong temporal predictions, and manipulated the tone transition probabilities to create predictable and unpredictable/random tone sequences. Using multi-level pattern analysis (MVPA), we show that the low level stimulus properties of the four tones remain decodable in light non-REM N1 and non-REM N2 sleep. However, compared to wakefulness decoding accuracies dropped significantly and were less sustained over time. In addition, we find that in wakefulness the featurespecific neural activations of an expected tone are even decodable before its actual presentation. Going beyond previous findings, we show that these neuronal prediction or pre-activation patterns are still evident in light N1 sleep but cease during N2. Altogether, the data suggest that stimulus-specific auditory processing is retained despite the fading of consciousness, while stimulus-specific anticipatory processing is dependent upon minimal levels of conscious processing such as in transitory N1 sleep.

">Policy complexity suppresses dopamine responses</a></h4>

              
                Limits on information processing capacity impose limits on task performance. We show that animals achieve performance on a perceptual decision task that is near-optimal given their capacity limits, as measured by policy complexity (the mutual information between states and actions). This behavioral profile could be achieved by reinforcement learning with a penalty on high complexity policies, realized through modulation of dopaminergic learning signals. In support of this hypothesis, we find that policy complexity suppresses midbrain dopamine responses to reward outcomes, thereby reducing behavioral sensitivity to these outcomes. Our results suggest that policy compression shapes basic mechanisms of reinforcement learning in the brain.

                As developing neural circuits become functional, they undergo a phase of heightened plasticity in response to intrinsic and/or extrinsic stimuli. These developmental windows are termed critical periods (CPs), because perturbations during the CP can lead to lasting and significant change in subsequent development, such as sub-optimal and/or unstable networks. By contrast, the same manipulations before or after the CP does not create lasting changes. Here, we have used the Drosophila larval locomotor network to study how different identified, connected elements respond to a CP perturbation, from pre-motor interneuron to motoneuron, to neuromuscular junction. Using heat stress as an ecologically relevant stimulus, we show that increasing temperature causes increased network activity that, when applied during the CP, leads to larvae that crawl more slowly and that require longer to recover from electroshock-induced seizures, indicative of decreased network stability. Within the central nervous system, we find CP perturbation leads to pre-motor interneurons delivering increased synaptic drive to motoneurons, which in turn display reduced excitability. The peripheral neuromuscular junction, on the other hand, maintains normal synaptic transmission, despite significant structural changes of synaptic terminal overgrowth and altered postsynaptic receptor field composition. Overall, our data demonstrate that different connected elements within a network respond differentially to a CP perturbation. Our results suggest an underlying sequence, or hierarchy, of network adjustment during developmental CPs, and present the larval locomotor network as a highly tractable experimental model system with which to study CP biology.

">The impact of high-fat and obesogenic diets on brain volume in a commercially available mouse model of fatty liver disease</a></h4>

              
                The obesity pandemic poses significant health challenges, despite recent advancements in weight loss medications. Mouse models fed obesogenic diets serve as invaluable tools for dissecting the pleiotropic mechanisms underlying weight gain. Here, we utilize these models to analyze brain morphometrics using MRI techniques, inspired by similar findings in human studies linking obesity to brain volume changes. We hypothesize that the mouse model of obesity will exhibit brain volume alterations akin to those observed in obese humans, potentially shedding light on the neurological implications of obesity. To test our hypothesis, mice were provided free access to either regular chow or a diet consisting of high fat and high sugar and MRI scans for total brain volumes as well as volumes of specific brain regions were estimated and compared between obese and control mice. We found that obesogenic diets resulted in ~13% greater weight gain compared to control chow diets. MRI brain scans revealed reduced total brain volume in obese mice that trended towards significance. In contrast, analysis of specific brain volumes showed an increase in neocortical regions of obese mice, that were significant when compared to controls. In conclusion, diet-induced obesity mouse models are a readily available avatar for studying the obesity epidemic, with significant increases in body weight within a reasonable timeframe. While weight gain among individual mice fed obesogenic diets showed some variability, MRI brain scans were able to reveal significant differences, especially within different anatomical regions of the brain.

">Individual differences in decision-making shape how mesolimbic dopamine regulates choice confidence and change-of-mind</a></h4>

              
                Nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling is an important neural substrate for decision-making. Dominant theories generally discretize and homogenize decision-making, when it is in fact a continuous process, with evaluation and re-evaluation components that extend beyond simple outcome prediction into consideration of past and future value. Extensive work has examined mesolimbic dopamine in the context of reward prediction error, but major gaps persist in our understanding of how dopamine regulates volitional and self-guided decision-making. Moreover, there is little consideration of individual differences in value processing that may shape how dopamine regulates decision-making. Here, using an economic foraging task in mice, we found that dopamine dynamics in the nucleus accumbens core reflected decision confidence during evaluation of decisions, as well as both past and future value during re-evaluation and change-of-mind. Optogenetic manipulations of mesolimbic dopamine release selectively altered evaluation and re-evaluation of decisions in mice whose dopamine dynamics and behavior reflected future value.

">Embryonic exposure to valproic acid and neonicotinoid deteriorates the developmental GABA switch and impairs long-term potentiation in the local circuit of intermediate medial mesopallium of chick telencephalon</a></h4>

              
                Embryonic exposure to valproic acid (VPA) and imidacloprid (IMI, a neonicotinoid insecticide) impairs filial imprinting in hatchlings, and the deteriorating effects of VPA are mitigated by post-hatch injection of bumetanide, a blocker of the chloride intruder NKCC1. Here, we report that these exposures depolarized the reversal potential of local GABAergic transmission in the neurons of the intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM), the pallial region critical for imprinting. Furthermore, exposure increased field excitatory post-synaptic potentials in pre-tetanus recordings (fEPSPs) and impaired long-term potentiation by low-frequency tetanic stimulation (LTP). Bath-applied bumetanide rescued the impaired LTP in the VPA slices, whereas VU0463271, a blocker of the chloride extruder KCC2, suppressed LTP in the control slices, suggesting that hyperpolarizing GABA action is necessary for the potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission. However, the transcriptional profiles of IMM slices did not support the expected increase in the NKCC1/KCC2 ratio, suggesting a potential modification of post-transcriptional processes. Instead, exposure to both VPA and IMI downregulated several transcriptional regulators (FOS, NR4A1, and NR4A2) and upregulated the RNA component of signal recognition particles (RN7SL1). As a limited set of response genes were shared, VPA and IMI could cause common neuronal malfunctions via distinct molecular cascades.

">Glial scar formation by reactive astrocytes derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells after closed-head injury</a></h4>

              
                The diversity of reactive astrocytes is key to understanding complicated pathological processes in the brain. The accumulation of reactive astrocytes expressing the neural stem/precursor cell marker Nestin is common after brain injury, but the pathological implications of this reactive astrocyte subpopulation remain elusive. This study initially aimed to determine the origin and fate of these reactive astrocytes expressing Nestin by characterizing cells labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) after closed-head injury, using a Nestin promoter region widely utilized to study neural stem/precursor cells. Unexpectedly, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), rather than astrocytes, were robustly and selectively labeled with GFP. A fraction of these cells showed a subsequent upregulation of astrocyte markers and were incorporated into glial scars. These glial scars are aggregates of reactive astrocytes that form between lesion cores and the perilesional recovering region. Deletion of the Stat3 gene, which is essential for astrocyte activation, using a Nestin promoter reduced glial scars, further confirming that OPCs are involved in glial scar formation. Reactive astrocytes labeled with a glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter differed in morphology and distribution from astrocytes derived from OPCs. This confirms that astrocytes and OPCs produce distinct reactive astrocyte subpopulations. Some GFP-labeled OPCs lacking astrocyte markers were found to distribute in perilesional recovering regions. The reduced expression of Nestin and OPC markers in these non-astrocytic descendants of OPCs, coupled with a significant fraction of these cells remaining olig2-positive, suggests that OPCs give rise to both reactive astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that OPCs are activated by a novel process after brain injury.

	<p>Compelling evidence supports the foundational importance of early self-regulation (SR). It also supports parents in the home environment as having the foremost influence on early development. Yet, prevailing approaches to support early SR growth have tended to leverage early education and clinical settings. Partners in Play (PiP) was developed as a sustainable approach for parents to learn how and when to support children through experiences of self-regulation challenges in the home learning environment. This study reports the first randomised control trial evaluation of the PiP program, with 21 parent&amp;amp;ndash;child dyads (consisting of twelve girl&amp;amp;ndash;mother dyads, eight boy&amp;amp;ndash;mother dyads, and one boy&amp;amp;ndash;father dyad; mean child age = 4.12 years, SD = 0.65). Dyads were randomised to a PiP intervention group (n = 10), which entailed four online parent information sessions and four out-of-home guided practice dyadic play sessions across 8 weeks, or an active control group (n = 11). The primary outcome was parent autonomy support, and the secondary outcome was child SR. Results indicated a significant increase in parents&amp;amp;rsquo; use of autonomy support and a non-significant but moderate-sized effect on child SR. This innovative proof-of-concept program and evaluation provides a roadmap for effecting change in parental support during children&amp;amp;rsquo;s play, to the prospective benefit of important abilities such as child SR. Analyses show promise for a parent-based model toward parent behaviour change and child SR improvement.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Previous research has established that bilinguals automatically activate lexical items in both of their languages in a nonselectivemanner, even when processing linguistic information in the second language (L2) alone. However, whether this co-activation extends to the sub-lexical level remains debated. In this study, we investigate whether bilinguals access sub-lexical information while processing in their L2. Thirty-two Chinese&amp;amp;ndash;English bilinguals and thirty-one English monolinguals completed an EEG-based semantic relatedness task, during which they judged whether pairs of English words were related in meaning or not (&amp;amp;plusmn;S). Unbeknownst to the participants, the form (&amp;amp;plusmn;F) of the Chinese translations in half of the pairs shared a sub-lexical semantic radical. This leads to four conditions: +S+F, +S&amp;amp;minus;F, &amp;amp;minus;S+F, and &amp;amp;minus;S&amp;amp;minus;F. This design, along with the comparison to English monolinguals, allows us to examine if bilinguals&amp;amp;rsquo; native language is activated at the sub-lexical level when they are exposed only to L2. The results revealed that both groups showed sensitivity to semantic relatedness, as evidenced by a greater N400 for semantic unrelated pairs than related pairs, with monolinguals eliciting a more pronounced difference. Bilinguals, on the other hand, exhibited a greater P200 difference compared to monolinguals, indicating greater sensitivity to the hidden Chinese radical/form manipulation. These results suggest that highly proficient bilinguals automatically engage in lexical co-activation of their native language during L2 processing. Crucially, this co-activation extends to the sub-lexical semantic radical level.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the connection between the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) values and failure patterns of patients with IDH wild-type glioblastoma (GB) who underwent radiotherapy (RT) with FLAIR-based gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation. Methods: Seventy-one patients who received RT at a dose of 60 Gy to the GTV and 50 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV) and had documented recurrence were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s maximum distance of recurrence (MDR) from the GTV was documented in whichever plane it extended the farthest. The failure patterns were described as intra-GTV, in-CTV/out-GTV, distant, and intra-GTV and distant. For analytical purposes, the failure pattern was categorized into two groups, namely Group 1, intra-GTV or in-CTV/out-GTV, and Group 2, distant or intra-GTV and distant. The SIRI was calculated before surgery and corticosteroid administration. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal SIRI cut-off that distinguishes between the different failure patterns. Results: Failure occurred as follows: intra-GTV in 40 (56.3%), in-CTV/out-GTV in 4 (5.6%), distant in 18 (25.4%), and intra-GTV + distant in 9 (12.7%) patients. The mean MDR was 13.5 mm, and recurrent lesions extended beyond 15 mm in only seven patients. Patients with an SIRI score &amp;amp;ge; 3 demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of Group 1 failure patterns than their counterparts with an SIRI score &amp;amp;lt; 3 (74.3% vs. 50.0%; p = 0.035). Conclusions: The present results show that using the SIRI with a cut-off value of &amp;amp;ge;3 significantly predicts failure patterns. Additionally, the margin for the GTV can be safely reduced to 15 mm when using FLAIR-based target delineation in patients with GB.</p>

     alt="Activity-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex of Male Rats Underlies Resilience-Related Behaviors to Social Adversity"/>
<p>One adverse social experience in adulthood such as social defeat promotes vulnerability. Two adverse social experiences during development (maternal separation + social defeat) foster resilience. Activity-dependent plasticity in the mPFC seems to be crucial for resilience to social adversity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Individuals considered resilient can overcome adversity, achieving normal physical and psychological development, while those deemed vulnerable may not. Adversity promotes structural and functional alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. Moreover, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is intricately linked to neuronal shaping resulting from experiences. We hypothesize that this plasticity plays a crucial role in resilience processes. However, there is a notable absence of studies investigating this plasticity and behavioral changes following social adversity at different life stages. Consequently, we evaluated the impact of social adversity during early postnatal development (maternal separation [MS]), adulthood (social defeat [SD]), and a combined exposure (MS + SD) on behavioral outcomes (anxiety, motivation, anhedonia, and social interaction). We also examined cFos expression induced by social interaction in mPFC and hippocampus of adult male rats. Behavioral analyses revealed that SD-induced anhedonia, whereas MS + SD increased social interaction and mitigated SD-induced anhedonia. cFos evaluation showed that social interaction heightened plasticity in the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices, dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1. Social interaction-associated plasticity was compromised in IL and PrL cortices of the MS and SD groups. Interestingly, social interaction-induced plasticity was restored in the MS + SD group. Furthermore, plasticity was impaired in DG by all social stressors, and in CA3 was impaired by SD. Our findings suggest in male rats (i) two adverse social experiences during development foster resilience; (ii) activity-dependent plasticity in the mPFC is a foundation for resilience to social adversity; (iii) plasticity in DG is highly susceptible to social adversity.</p>

                The cis interaction between CD80 and PD-L1 disrupts PD-L1 function. Robinson et al. show that CTLA-4 restores PD-L1 activity, but this requires rigid bivalent binding of CTLA-4 to CD80. The unusual angle of the PD-L1-CD80 interaction indicates that PD-L1 release occurs via a physical reorientation of CD80, which is then unfavorable for PD-L1 binding.

	<p>Study Objectives: The Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) Informatics System contains individual-patient-level traumatic brain injury (TBI) data, which when combined, allows for the examination of rates and outcomes for key subpopulations at risk for developing sleep disturbance. Methods: This proof-of-concept study creates a model system for harmonizing data (i.e., combining and standardizing data) across FITBIR studies for participants with and without a history of TBI to estimate rates of sleep disturbance and identify risk factors. Results: Three studies were eligible for harmonization (N = 1753). Sleep disturbance was common among those with a history of mild TBI (63%). Individuals with mild TBI were two to four times more likely to have sleep disturbance compared to those with no history of TBI. Conclusions: This study established methods, harmonization code, and meta-databases that are publicly available on the FITBIR website. We demonstrated how the harmonization of FITBIR studies can answer TBI research questions, showing that associations between TBI and sleep disturbance may be influenced by demographic factors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in <i>Fmr1 KO</i> whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during <i>Fmr1</i>-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the <i>Fmr1-</i>KO hippocampus formation.</p>

                <p>Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks. However, a major technical challenge for investigating astrocyte function and disease-related pathophysiology has been the limited ability to obtain functional human astrocytes. Despite recent advances in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) techniques, primary rodent astrocytes remain the gold standard in coculture with human neurons. We demonstrate that a combination of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) directs hPSC-derived neural precursor cells to a highly pure population of astroglia in 28&nbsp;d. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we confirm the astroglial identity of these cells and highlight profound transcriptional adaptations in cocultured hPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons, consistent with their further maturation. In coculture with human neurons, multielectrode array recordings revealed robust network activity of human neurons in a coculture with hPSC-derived or rat astrocytes [3.63 &plusmn; 0.44&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (hPSC-derived), 2.86 &plusmn; 0.64&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>= 0.19]. In comparison, we found increased spike frequency within network bursts of human neurons cocultured with hPSC-derived astrocytes [56.31 &plusmn; 8.56&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 24.77 &plusmn; 4.04&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.01], and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed an increase of postsynaptic currents [2.76 &plusmn; 0.39&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 1.07 &plusmn; 0.14&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001], consistent with a corresponding increase in synapse density [14.90 &plusmn; 1.27/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (hPSC-derived), 8.39 &plusmn; 0.63/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001]. Taken together, we show that hPSC-derived astrocytes compare favorably with rat astrocytes in supporting human neural network activity and maturation, providing a fully human platform for investigating astrocyte function and neuronal-glial interactions.</p>

                <p>Much of what has been discovered concerning neurophysiological mechanisms can be credited to ex vivo biomedical experiments. Beyond these discoveries, ex vivo research techniques have enhanced the global understanding of human physiology and pathology in almost every biomedical specialty. Naturally, ex vivo experiments are among the most desired methods of research, particularly in the field of neuroscience. Ex vivo experiment platforms may be purchased commercially. However, their substantial cost and sometimes limited availability can render them inaccessible to many research labs. Moreover, these manufactured systems are often rigid in function with no possibility of customization, severely narrowing their capabilities. However, developing essential components for ex vivo laboratory systems with a fused deposition modeling printer provides a practical solution to each of these obstacles. Here, we provide the designs and construction process for an easily accessible, highly adaptable recording stage with modifiable submersion chambers using a 3D printer for a total cost under $15.00. With the versatility afforded by the exchangeable custom chambers, the system may be used to conduct research on a variety of ex vivo tissue preparations, paving the way for novel research.</p>

                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                Background The current report describes a unimodular thyroid goiter (TGo), identified unilaterally in a female cadaver, causing displacement or compression effects in the adjacent neck structures (common carotid artery (CCA) and internal jugular vein (IJV),). Methods Routine dissection of the neck of an 86-year-old female donated a Greek cadaver. Results A thyroid gland variant was identified coexisting with a TGo originating from the left thyroid lobe. The variant is a pyramidal lobe located on the left side of the isthmus. Owing to the presence of the TGo, the left CCA, along with the left IJV, deviated 50.6 mm ipsilaterally from the midline of the neck. The right CCA had a minor deviation of 30.8 mm, from the midline to the right side due to the proximity of the shifted trachea and esophagus with the CCA origin. The trachea and esophagus deviated contralaterally to the TGo, 24.4 mm from the midline. Conclusions CCA compression, stenosis, and angulation may cause dizziness, weakness, and hypomnesia. The potential outcomes were worse with IJV compression. Atherosclerosis tends to occur more often in arteries with inclined (angulated) parts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-612/v2?src=rss">Édouard Louis´s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background In this paper we analyse the novel The End of Eddy by Édouard Louis. The motivation for this paper is Bourdeau’s (2020) observation that Louis’s book explores working class politics, sexuality, and masculinity. Methods We analysed the amendment through narrative content analysis, the application of which allows us to answer the following question: Édouard Louis’s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? Results We conclude that this narrative is built on contradictions that can be summarized as a conflict between a socio-cultural norm anchored in a French village and a person who does not fulfil this concept, who is outside of it. We believe that hegemonic masculinity, that is, one part of the cultural norm of a given village, causes Eddy’s inclination or consciousness of homonationalism. Thus, on the one hand, hegemonic masculinity is undoubtedly present in this novel; on the other hand, it forms a kind of background or socio-cultural environment which, although it defines itself against the given, unconsciously causes the “birth of the conscious homosexual”. Conclusions Thus, we dare to claim that the narrative under analysis is not only a representation of hegemonic masculinity, but also an accentuation of its external and internal influence on one’s own perception of (sexual) difference.

                Background Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent condition caused by weakened pelvic floor support structures. Extracellular matrix alterations, including changes in collagen type I, collagen type III, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. Human platelet-rich fibrin lysate (hPRF-L) is a novel regenerative treatment that has shown beneficial results in treating structural weaknesses related to various pelvic floor diseases, including POP. Methods This study protocol aims to investigate the effects of hPRF-L injection on collagen I, III, and MMP-1 in the vaginal mucosa of a rat POP model. POP will be induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats, which will be randomly assigned to control, sham, and hPRF-L treatment groups. The hPRF-L group will receive weekly injections of hPRF-L (25, 50, or 75 μL) into the vaginal mucosa for 4 weeks. Vaginal tissue samples will be collected, and collagen type I, collagen type III, and MMP-1 expression will be evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. Data analysis will be performed with ANOVA and post-hoc tests. Discussion The findings from this study protocol are expected to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which hPRF-L impacts the structural integrity of the pelvic floor. By elucidating these mechanisms, this study aims to inform future POP treatment strategies. The anticipated results are an increase in collagen type I and III expression and a reduction in MMP-1 levels in the hPRF-L treatment group compared to the control and sham groups. These outcomes could support the use of hPRF-L as a regenerative therapy for managing POP, offering a potential alternative to more invasive surgical interventions. Conclusion The expected results will contribute to the development of less invasive treatments for POP, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

                CSNK1A1 is a key regulator of various signalling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Playing a central role in cellular function and disease pathology, CSNK1A1 has emerged as an attractive protein target for therapeutic development. In this study we characterize ten CSNK1A1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Monitoring and strict control of anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events. The objective of this research was to explore the association of the quality of anticoagulation control with the occurrence of stroke, thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, or death during follow-up in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) on vitamin K antagonists. Methods A retrospective and observational study was carried out in clinical practice (real world data). Data were collected on age, sex, income level, occupational status, ischemic stroke, thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, death, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) was measured using TAONet software and TTR ≥60% was considered indicative of good anticoagulation control. Survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models to compare time-to-event by quality of anticoagulation control. Determinants of anticoagulation quality were identified using logistic regression. Results Of 856 patients recruited, only 286 (33%) had a TTR ≥60%. Cox models including sociodemographic and clinical variables showed that the risk of all four events was much higher in the subsample with TTR <60% and the differences were statistically significant. Specifically, the hazard ratios (HRs) for this group were 1.94 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.30) for stroke, 1.60 (CI: 1.10-2.33) for thrombotic events, 1.61 (CI: 1.08-2.42) for hemorrhagic events and 2.97 (CIs: 1.86-4.75) for death. Conclusions The positive conclusion of the study was the markedly lower rate of events associated with TTR ≥60% and the negative conclusion was the low percentage of patients achieving good anticoagulation control. This implies that despite being “protected”, they continue to have a high risk of stroke, embolism, hemorrhagic complications and death. We believe it is necessary to develop and implement strategies to tackle this problem.

                Background Industry 4.0 is a significant technical revolution that combines big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems to improve manufacturing productivity. This study investigates the impact of digital trust and sustainable attitude on perceived value and the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. It also examines the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance in these relationships. Methods Data were collected from 189 employees of leading manufacturing companies in Indonesia that are recognized for their Industry 4.0 practices. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology with SmartPLS software to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the moderating effects. Results The findings reveal that both digital trust and sustainable attitude significantly influence perceived value. However, these factors do not directly affect the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between digital trust and adoption intention. Specifically, in environments with high uncertainty avoidance, digital trust becomes a critical factor influencing the decision to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Conclusions The study provides valuable insights for organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives. It highlights the importance of fostering digital trust and considering cultural dimensions, such as uncertainty avoidance, in their technology adoption strategies.

                <p>by Brian C. O’Meara, Jeremy M. Beaulieu</p>

Across a variety of biological datasets, from genomes to conservation to the fossil record, evolutionary rates appear to increase toward the present or over short time scales. This has long been seen as an indication of processes operating differently at different time scales, even potentially as an indicator of a need for new theory connecting macroevolution and microevolution. Here we introduce a set of models that assess the relationship between rate and time and demonstrate that these patterns are statistical artifacts of time-independent errors present across ecological and evolutionary datasets, which produce hyperbolic patterns of rates through time. We show that plotting a noisy numerator divided by time versus time leads to the observed hyperbolic pattern; in fact, randomizing the amount of change over time generates patterns functionally identical to observed patterns. Ignoring errors can not only obscure true patterns but create novel patterns that have long misled scientists.

                <p>by Israel Luis, Maarten Afschrift, Friedl De Groote, Elena M. Gutierrez-Farewik</p>

The metabolic energy rate of individual muscles is impossible to measure without invasive procedures. Prior studies have produced models to predict metabolic rates based on experimental observations of isolated muscle contraction from various species. Such models can provide reliable predictions of metabolic rates in humans if muscle properties and control are accurately modeled. This study aimed to examine how muscle-tendon model individualization and metabolic energy models influenced estimation of muscle-tendon states and time-series metabolic rates, to evaluate the agreement with empirical data, and to provide predictions of the metabolic rate of muscle groups and gait phases across walking speeds. Three-dimensional musculoskeletal simulations with prescribed kinematics and dynamics were performed. An optimal control formulation was used to compute muscle-tendon states with four levels of individualization, ranging from a scaled generic model and muscle controls based on minimal activations, inclusion of calibrated muscle passive forces, personalization of Achilles and quadriceps tendon stiffnesses, to finally informing muscle controls with electromyography. We computed metabolic rates based on existing models. Simulations with calibrated passive forces and personalized tendon stiffness most accurately estimate muscle excitations and fiber lengths. Interestingly, the inclusion of electromyography did not improve our estimates. The whole-body average metabolic cost was better estimated with a subset of metabolic energy models. We estimated metabolic rate peaks near early stance, pre-swing, and initial swing at all walking speeds. Plantarflexors accounted for the highest cost among muscle groups at the preferred speed and were similar to the cost of hip adductors and abductors combined. Also, the swing phase accounted for slightly more than one-quarter of the total cost in a gait cycle, and its relative cost decreased with walking speed. Our prediction might inform the design of assistive devices and rehabilitation treatment. The code and experimental data are available online.

In recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access R package that quantifies the impact of vector control interventions depending on mosquito species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 <i>Anopheles</i> species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.

An understanding of human brain individuality requires the integration of data on brain organization across people and brain regions, molecular and systems scales, as well as healthy and clinical states. Here, we help advance this understanding by leveraging methods from computational genomics to integrate large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, neuroimaging, and electronic-health record data sets. We estimated genetically regulated gene expression (gr-expression) of 18,647 genes, across 10 cortical and subcortical regions of 45,549 people from the UK Biobank. First, we showed that patterns of estimated gr-expression reflect known genetic–ancestry relationships, regional identities, as well as inter-regional correlation structure of directly assayed gene expression. Second, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to discover 1,065 associations between individual variation in gr-expression and gray-matter volumes across people and brain regions. We benchmarked these associations against results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the same sample and found hundreds of novel associations relative to these GWAS. Third, we integrated our results with clinical associations of gr-expression from the Vanderbilt Biobank. This integration allowed us to link genes, via gr-expression, to neuroimaging and clinical phenotypes. Fourth, we identified associations of polygenic gr-expression with structural and functional MRI phenotypes in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), a small neuroimaging-genomic data set with high-quality functional imaging data. Finally, we showed that estimates of gr-expression and magnitudes of TWAS were generally replicable and that the <i>p</i>-values of TWAS were replicable in large samples. Collectively, our results provide a powerful new resource for integrating gr-expression with population genetics of brain organization and disease.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite bilateral hippocampal damage dating to the perinatal or early childhood period and severely impaired episodic memory, patients with developmental amnesia continue to exhibit well-developed semantic memory across the developmental trajectory. Detailed information on the extent and focality of brain damage in these patients is needed to hypothesize about the neural substrate that supports their remarkable capacity for encoding and retrieval of semantic memory. In particular, we need to assess whether the residual hippocampal tissue is involved in this preservation, or whether the surrounding cortical areas reorganize to rescue aspects of these critical cognitive memory processes after early injury. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, automatic (FreeSurfer) and manual segmentation to characterize structural changes in the brain of an exceptionally large cohort of 23 patients with developmental amnesia in comparison with 32 control subjects. Both the VBM and the FreeSurfer analyses revealed severe structural alterations in the hippocampus and thalamus of patients with developmental amnesia. Milder damage was found in the amygdala, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Manual segmentation demonstrated differences in the degree of atrophy of the hippocampal subregions in patients. The level of atrophy in CA-DG subregions and subicular complex was more than 40%, while the atrophy of the uncus was moderate (−24%). Anatomo-functional correlations were observed between the volumes of residual hippocampal subregions in patients and selective aspects of their cognitive performance, viz, intelligence, working memory, and verbal and visuospatial recall. Our findings suggest that in patients with developmental amnesia, cognitive processing is compromised as a function of the extent of atrophy in hippocampal subregions. More severe hippocampal damage may be more likely to promote structural and/or functional reorganization in areas connected to the hippocampus. In this hypothesis, different levels of hippocampal function may be rescued following this variable reorganization. Our findings document not only the extent, but also the limits of circuit reorganization occurring in the young brain after early bilateral hippocampal damage.</p>

     alt="Covariation of Skull and Brain Morphology in Domestic Dogs"/>
<p>Using T2-weighted MRI studies of 79 dogs, we find that skull shape covaries with brain morphology. Dogs with extreme skull shapes – brachycephaly and dolichocephaly – show regional reductions in relative gray matter volume.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Despite their distinct embryonic origins, the skull and brain are highly integrated. Understanding the covariation between the skull and brain can shed light on anatomical, cognitive, and behavioral traits in extant and extinct species. Domestic dogs offer a unique opportunity to investigate skull–brain covariation due to their diverse skull morphologies and neural anatomy. To assess this question, we examined <i>T</i>2-weighted MRI studies of 62 dogs from 33 breeds, plus an additional 17 dogs of mixed or unknown breeds. Scans were opportunistically collected from a veterinary teaching hospital of dogs that were referred for neurological examination but did not have grossly observable structural brain abnormalities. As the neurocrania of dogs become broader and shorter, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the right olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, marginal gyrus, and cerebellum. On the other hand, as the neurocrania of dogs become narrower and longer, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, cerebellum, and brainstem. Selective breeding for specific skull shapes may impact canine brain anatomy and function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1394/v7?src=rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 7; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to acid-catalysed cyclization of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 413 hemp-based products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 48 products (12%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC, with the safety of CBD itself currently being unclear with significant uncertainties regarding possible liver and reproductive toxicity. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91619">Conserved regulatory motifs in the juxtamembrane domain and kinase N-lobe revealed through deep mutational scanning of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase domain</a></h4>

              
                MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (METΔEx14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of the MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild-type and METΔEx14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase ⍺C-helix, pointing to potential differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a β5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for the kinase domain in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95289">Limited column formation in the embryonic growth plate implies divergent growth mechanisms during pre- and postnatal bone development</a></h4>

              
                Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.

These CLP-derived pDCs, which we refer to as ‘B-pDCs’, have a unique gene expression profile that includes hallmark B cell genes, normally not expressed in conventional pDCs. Despite expressing most classical pDC markers such as SIGLEC-H and PDCA1, B-pDCs lack IFN-α secretion, exhibiting a distinct inflammatory profile. Functionally, B-pDCs induce T cell proliferation more robustly than canonical pDCs following Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement. B-pDCs, along with another homogeneous subpopulation of myeloid-derived pDCs, display elevated levels of the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, mirroring human AXL<sup>+</sup> transitional DCs in function and transcriptional profile. Murine B-pDCs therefore represent a phenotypically and functionally distinct CLP-derived DC lineage specialized in T cell activation and previously not described in mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91636">Language experience shapes predictive coding of rhythmic sound sequences</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual systems heavily rely on prior knowledge and predictions to make sense of the environment. Predictions can originate from multiple sources of information, including contextual short-term priors, based on isolated temporal situations, and context-independent long-term priors, arising from extended exposure to statistical regularities. While the effects of short-term predictions on auditory perception have been well-documented, how long-term predictions shape early auditory processing is poorly understood. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography data from native speakers of two languages with different word orders (Spanish: functor-initial vs Basque: functor-final) listening to simple sequences of binary sounds alternating in duration with occasional omissions. We hypothesized that, together with contextual transition probabilities, the auditory system uses the characteristic prosodic cues (duration) associated with the native language’s word order as an internal model to generate long-term predictions about incoming non-linguistic sounds. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the amplitude of the mismatch negativity elicited by sound omissions varied orthogonally depending on the speaker’s linguistic background and was most pronounced in the left auditory cortex. Importantly, listening to binary sounds alternating in pitch instead of duration did not yield group differences, confirming that the above results were driven by the hypothesized long-term ‘duration’ prior. These findings show that experience with a given language can shape a fundamental aspect of human perception – the neural processing of rhythmic sounds – and provides direct evidence for a long-term predictive coding system in the auditory cortex that uses auditory schemes learned over a lifetime to process incoming sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97568">The bacterial quorum sensing signal 2’-aminoacetophenone rewires immune cell bioenergetics through the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis to mediate tolerance to infection</a></h4>

              
                How bacterial pathogens exploit host metabolism to promote immune tolerance and persist in infected hosts remains elusive. To achieve this, we show that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>PA</i>)<i>,</i> a recalcitrant pathogen, utilizes the quorum sensing (QS) signal 2’-aminoacetophenone (2-AA). Here, we unveil how 2-AA-driven immune tolerization causes distinct metabolic perturbations in murine macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. We present evidence indicating that these effects stem from decreased pyruvate transport into mitochondria. This reduction is attributed to decreased expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (<i>Mpc1</i>), which is mediated by diminished expression and nuclear presence of its transcriptional regulator, estrogen-related nuclear receptor alpha (Esrra). Consequently, Esrra exhibits weakened binding to the <i>Mpc1</i> promoter. This outcome arises from the impaired interaction between Esrra and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a). Ultimately, this cascade results in diminished pyruvate influx into mitochondria and, consequently reduced ATP production in tolerized murine and human macrophages. Exogenously added ATP in infected macrophages restores the transcript levels of <i>Mpc1</i> and <i>Esrra and</i> enhances cytokine production and intracellular bacterial clearance. Consistent with the in vitro findings, murine infection studies corroborate the 2-AA-mediated long-lasting decrease in ATP and acetyl-CoA and its association with <i>PA</i> persistence, further supporting this QS signaling molecule as the culprit of the host bioenergetic alterations and <i>PA</i> persistence. These findings unveil 2-AA as a modulator of cellular immunometabolism and reveal an unprecedented mechanism of host tolerance to infection involving the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis in its influence on Mpc1/OXPHOS-dependent energy production and <i>PA</i> clearance. These paradigmatic findings pave the way for developing treatments to bolster host resilience to pathogen-induced damage. Given that QS is a common characteristic of prokaryotes, it is likely that 2-AA-like molecules with similar functions may be present in other pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98579">Engineering PEG10assembled endogenous virus-like particles with genetically encoded neoantigen peptides for cancer vaccination</a></h4>

              
                Tumor neoantigen peptide vaccines hold potential for boosting cancer immunotherapy, yet efficiently co-delivering peptides and adjuvants to antigen-presenting cells in vivo remains challenging. Virus-like particle (VLP), which is a kind of multiprotein structure organized as virus, can deliver therapeutic substances into cells and stimulate immune response. However, the weak targeted delivery of VLP in vivo and its susceptibility to neutralization by antibodies hinder their clinical applications. Here, we first designed a novel protein carrier using the mammalian-derived capsid protein PEG10, which can self-assemble into endogenous VLP (eVLP) with high protein loading and transfection efficiency. Then, an engineered tumor vaccine, named ePAC, was developed by packaging genetically encoded neoantigen into eVLP with further modification of CpG-ODN on its surface to serve as an adjuvant and targeting unit to dendritic cells (DCs). Significantly, ePAC can efficiently target and transport neoantigens to DCs, and promote DCs maturation to induce neoantigen-specific T cells. Moreover, in mouse orthotopic liver cancer and humanized mouse tumor models, ePAC combined with anti-TIM-3 exhibited remarkable antitumor efficacy. Overall, these results support that ePAC could be safely utilized as cancer vaccines for antitumor therapy, showing significant potential for clinical translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94088">Ethnic and region-specific genetic risk variants of stroke and its comorbid conditions can define the variations in the burden of stroke and its phenotypic traits</a></h4>

              
                Burden of stroke differs by region, which could be attributed to differences in comorbid conditions and ethnicity. Genomewide variation acts as a proxy marker for ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. We present an integrated approach to understand this variation by considering prevalence and mortality rates of stroke and its comorbid risk for 204 countries from 2009 to 2019, and Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk variant for all these conditions. Global and regional trend analysis of rates using linear regression, correlation, and proportion analysis, signifies ethnogeographic differences. Interestingly, the comorbid conditions that act as risk drivers for stroke differed by regions, with more of metabolic risk in America and Europe, in contrast to high systolic blood pressure in Asian and African regions. GWAS risk loci of stroke and its comorbid conditions indicate distinct population stratification for each of these conditions, signifying for population-specific risk. Unique and shared genetic risk variants for stroke, and its comorbid and followed up with ethnic-specific variation can help in determining regional risk drivers for stroke. Unique ethnic-specific risk variants and their distinct patterns of linkage disequilibrium further uncover the drivers for phenotypic variation. Therefore, identifying population- and comorbidity-specific risk variants might help in defining the threshold for risk, and aid in developing population-specific prevention strategies for stroke.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87935">Vangl2 suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates sepsis by targeting p65 for NDP52-mediated autophagic degradation</a></h4>

              
                Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core planar cell polarity component, plays an important role in polarized cellular and tissue morphology induction, growth development, and cancer. However, its role in regulating inflammatory responses remains elusive. Here, we report that Vangl2 is upregulated in patients with sepsis and identify Vangl2 as a negative regulator of The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling by regulating the protein stability and activation of the core transcription component p65. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Vangl2 (<i>Vangl2</i><sup>ΔM</sup>) are hypersusceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. Vangl2-deficient myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation and expression of p65, therefore, promoting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, NF-κB signaling-induced-Vangl2 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Vangl2 as a suppressor of NF-κB-mediated inflammation and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95888">TMC7 deficiency causes acrosome biogenesis defects and male infertility in mice</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are a highly conserved ion channel family consisting of eight members (TMC1–TMC8) in mammals. TMC1/2 are components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells, and mutations of TMC1/2 cause deafness in humans and mice. However, the physiological roles of other TMC proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we show that <i>Tmc7</i> is specifically expressed in the testis and that it is required for acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. <i>Tmc7</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids, similar to human oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. We further demonstrate that TMC7 is colocalized with GM130 at the <i>cis</i>-Golgi region in round spermatids. TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the developing acrosome. Moreover, upon loss of TMC7 intracellular ion homeostasis is impaired and ROS levels are increased, which in turn causes Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, these results suggest that TMC7 is required to maintain pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for acrosome biogenesis. Our findings unveil a novel role for TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis.

	<p>Social withdrawal in rodents is a measure of asociality, an important negative symptom of schizophrenia. The Roman high- (RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) rat strains have been reported to exhibit differential profiles in schizophrenia-relevant behavioral phenotypes. This investigation was focused on the study of social and non-social behavior of these two rat strains following acute administration of dizocilpine (MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist), a pharmacological model of schizophrenia-like features used to produce asociality and hyperactivity. Also, since oxytocin (OXT) has been proposed as a natural antipsychotic and a potential adjunctive therapy for social deficits in schizophrenia, we have evaluated the effects of OXT administration and its ability to reverse the MK801-impairing effects on social and non-social behavior and MK801-induced hyperactivity. MK801 administration produced hyperlocomotion and a decrease in social and non-social behavior in both rat strains, but these drug effects were clearly more marked in RHA rats. OXT (0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) attenuated MK801-induced hyperlocomotion in both rat strains, although this effect was more marked in RHA rats. The MK801-decreasing effect on exploration of the &amp;amp;ldquo;social hole&amp;amp;rdquo; was moderately but significantly attenuated only in RLA rats. This study is the first to demonstrate the differential effects of OXT on MK801-induced impairments in the two Roman rat strains, providing some support for the potential therapeutic effects of OXT against schizophrenia-like symptoms, including both a positive-like symptom (i.e., MK801-induced hyperlocomotion) and a negative-like symptom (i.e., MK801 decrease in social behavior), while highlighting the importance of the genetic background (i.e., the rat strain) in influencing the effects of both MK801 and oxytocin.</p>

	<p>Background: Developing and testing methods for reliably measuring the state of consciousness of individuals is important for both basic research and clinical purposes. In recent years, several promising measures of consciousness, grounded in theoretical developments, have been proposed. However, the degrees to which these measures are affected by changes in brain activity that are not related to changes in the degree of consciousness has not been well tested. In this study, we examined whether several of these measures are modulated by the loading of cognitive resources. Methods: We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 12 participants in two conditions: (1) while passively attending to sensory stimuli related to the measures and (2) during increased cognitive load consisting of a demanding working memory task. We investigated whether a set of proposed objective EEG-based measures of consciousness differed between the passive and the cognitively demanding conditions. Results: The P300b event-related potential (sensitive to conscious awareness of deviance from an expected pattern in auditory stimuli) was significantly affected by concurrent performance on a working memory task, whereas various measures based on signal diversity of spontaneous and perturbed EEG were not. Conclusion: Because signal diversity-based measures of spontaneous or perturbed EEG are not sensitive to the degree of cognitive load, we suggest that these measures may be used in clinical situations where attention, sensory processing, or command following might be impaired.</p>

	<p>This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) method on chronic subjective tinnitus. The research was planned as an observational study. The study group comprises individuals who applied to the training and research hospital in Ankara between 2019 and 2020 and were aged between 15 and 60 years old. They were identified as having tinnitus. The study samples were determined as 36 participants selected through purposeful sampling. The samples of the 36 participants included in the study. 12 were assigned to the 1st Group EMDR and Masking Group, 12 to the 2nd Group Masking and EMDR Group, and 12 to the 3rd Control Group. The study&amp;amp;rsquo;s dependent variable was the tinnitus levels of the participants, and the independent variable was EMDR and the Masking method. The dependent variable data of the study was collected with the Visual Analog Scale and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). EMDR and Masking methods used as independent variables in the study were conducted in eight sessions for two months. As a result of the Wilcoxon Sign test used to determine whether the EMDR Method is effective on tinnitus severity level, the difference between tinnitus severity level pretest and post-test median scores of tinnitus patients was found to be statistically significant. Our research findings show that the EMDR method reduces and improves chronic subjective tinnitus, and further studies with a larger sample size could confirm our results.</p>

	<p>Background: As one of the leading causes of disability in the world, stroke can determine a reduction of balance performance with a negative impact on daily activity and social life. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of sensor-based balance training with exergaming feedback on balance skills in chronic stroke patients. Methods: 21 individuals (11F, 57.14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.82 years) with a single event of ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to the sensor-based balance training group (SB-group) or the usual care balance training group (UC-group). Both groups received 10 add-on sessions with exergaming feedback (SB-group) or conventional training (UC-group). Clinical and instrumental evaluation was performed before (t0), after (t1), and after one month (t2) from intervention. Participation level was assessed using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale at the end of each session. Results: The SB-group showed an improvement in postural stability (p = 0.02) when compared to the UC-group. In the evaluation of motivational level, the score was statistically higher in the SB-group with respect to the UC-group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Except for the improvement in postural stability, no difference was recorded in clinical score, suggesting a comparable gain in both groups. However, patients undergoing sensor-based training exhibited a higher participation score, ultimately indicating the use of this training to improve the adherence to rehabilitation settings, especially in patients with lower compliance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0243-24.2024?rss=1">Presaccadic Attention Enhances and Reshapes the Contrast Sensitivity Function Differentially around the Visual Field</a></h4>

              
                <p>Contrast sensitivity (CS), which constrains human vision, decreases from fovea to periphery, from the horizontal to the vertical meridian, and from the lower vertical to the upper vertical meridian. It also depends on spatial frequency (SF), and the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) depicts this relation. To compensate for these visual constraints, we constantly make saccades and foveate on relevant objects in the scene. Already before saccade onset, presaccadic attention shifts to the saccade target and enhances perception. However, it is unknown whether and how it modulates the interplay between CS and SF, and if this effect varies around polar angle meridians. CS enhancement may result from a horizontal or vertical shift of the CSF, increase in bandwidth, or any combination. In addition, presaccadic attention could enhance CS similarly around the visual field, or it could benefit perception more at locations with poorer performance (i.e., vertical meridian). Here, we investigated these possibilities by extracting key attributes of the CSF of human observers. The results reveal that presaccadic attention (1) increases CS across SF, (2) increases the most preferred and the highest discernable SF, and (3) narrows the bandwidth. Therefore, presaccadic attention helps bridge the gap between presaccadic and postsaccadic input by increasing visibility at the saccade target. Counterintuitively, this CS enhancement was more pronounced where perception is better&mdash;along the horizontal than the vertical meridian&mdash;exacerbating polar angle asymmetries. Our results call for an investigation of the differential neural modulations underlying presaccadic perceptual changes for different saccade directions.</p>

                <p>When presented shortly after another, discrete pictures are naturally perceived as continuous. The neuronal mechanism underlying such continuous or discrete perception is not well understood. While continuous alpha oscillations are a candidate for orchestrating such neuronal mechanisms, recent evidence is mixed. In this study, we investigated the influence of prestimulus alpha oscillation on visual temporal perception. Specifically, we were interested in whether prestimulus alpha phase modulates neuronal and perceptual processes underlying discrete or continuous perception. Participants had to report the location of a missing object in a visual temporal integration task, while simultaneously MEG data were recorded. Using source reconstruction, we evaluated local phase effects by contrasting phase angle values between correctly and incorrectly integrated trials. Our results show a phase opposition cluster between &ndash;0.8 and &ndash;0.5&nbsp;s (relative to stimulus presentation) and between 6 and 20&nbsp;Hz. These momentary phase angle values were correlated with behavioral performance and event-related potential amplitude. There was no evidence that frequency defined a window of temporal integration.</p>

                Background Case detection for Tuberculosis remains low in high-burden communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the first point of contact for many rural Nigerians and have been useful in active case finding. This study assessed the effectiveness of cash incentives and training on tuberculosis case detection by CHWs in six Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Materials and Methods A cluster randomized control trial with three arms was conducted. Arm A received cash incentives and training, Arm B received only training, and the control arm (C) received neither. CHWs already working in the communities participated. TB case notification and number of community outreaches held were used to assess intervention effects. Data were analyzed using STATA (v.13) and GraphPad Prism (v.8). Effect sizes were calculated using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Associations were tested using Chi-square (χ²) tests, with significance set at P=0.05. Results Arm A had a 14.4% increase in case notification, Arm B showed a 7.4% increase, and the control arm showed a 39.7% increase from the previous year. Arms A and B had lower odds of TB case notification post-intervention, compared to the control (OR = 0.819 and 0.769, respectively), with no significant difference between them. Arm A also saw a 144.8% increase in community outreaches, compared to 46.7% in Arm B and 22.7% in Control Arm C. Arms A and B had higher odds of carrying out community outreaches post-intervention compared to the control (OR = 1.995 and 1.195, respectively), but no significant differences were found between the groups regarding community outreach. Conclusion While the interventions resulted in an increased number of community outreaches compared to the control, case notification improved more in the control arm than in the intervention arms. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the potential of combining cash incentives with training to improve TB control efforts at the community level. Further exploration of the implementation process may shed light on the observed outcomes and guide future intervention strategies.

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscripts’ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

                Background In acute settings around the globe, renal/ureteric colic remains one of the most common diagnoses for patients presenting with loin-to-groin pain. Even though management spans from medical expulsive therapies to surgical options, pain as a significant component of a patient’s presentation must be dealt with quickly, decisively, and safely, as it can be excruciating and its effects on overall health are dire. This study aimed to explore compliance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for pain management in patients with suspected renal/ureteric colic. It includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous paracetamol, and opioids as first-, second-, and third-line analgesics, respectively, and does not offer antispasmodics. In the event of deviations from the standard, the aim was to put in corrective measures, followed by re-exploration of compliance with patient care. Methods This study involved a single healthcare facility with the study type being retrospective before interventions and prospective after interventions. In the first cycle, we retrieved and analysed 78 patients records whom had been suspected to have renal/ureteric colic between July and September 2022. The inclusion criteria were documented complaints of “flank/loin-to-groin pain” and diagnosis prior to performing diagnostic tests. We surveyed the first-, second-, and third-line painkillers issued, and whether an antispasmodic was given. We collected and entered data into a Microsoft Excel file and correlated it with NICE standards. Having found deviations from the standard, we conducted interventions, allowed time for clinicians to adapt, and re-explored compliance using patient case records [n=58] between February and May 2023. Results In the 1st cycle, 78 patients were suspected of having renal/ureteric colic. M: F = 1.2:1. Non-contrast computerized tomography of the kidney ureters and bladder (NC-CTKUB) confirmed 87% of patients with stones and 3% had no stones. NC-CTKUB was not performed in 9% of patients because they were young, and urinalysis showed no microscopic hematuria. One patient had discharged against medical advise before the NC-CTKUB was performed. Compliance with the NICE pain management guidelines for suspected renal/ureteric colic was full in 23% of cases but unsatisfactory in 78% of cases. In the 2nd cycle, M: F = 1.5:1, NC-CTKUB was not re-audited, as the first cycle study yielded excellent results, and our action plan resulted in an NICE pain management compliance rate of 56%. Although our interventions resulted in improvements of more than twice the initial results, work still needs to be performed. Conclusion Clinicians’ ability to correctly diagnose renal/ureteric colic is remarkable. However, the pain management compliance rate indicates room for improvement. This may be due to the limited awareness of the NICE guideline or the fact that the clinical team has an affinity for certain analgesics compared to others. We propose the need to consider select variables to existing standard guidelines to enhance compliance for improved patient care.

                Background: With the tremendous increase in the usage of smart meters for industrial/ household purposes, their implementation is considered a crucial challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) world, leading to a demand for emerging 5G technology. In addition, a large amount of data has to be communicated by smart meters efficiently, which needs a significant enhancement in bandwidth. The power amplifier (PA) plays a major role in deciding the efficiency and bandwidth of the entire communication system. Among the various modes of PAs, a newly developed Class-J mode PA has been proven to achieve high efficiency over a wide bandwidth by maintaining linearity. Methods: This paper proposes a Class-J mode PA design methodology using a CGH40010F-GaN device that operates at a 3.5 GHz frequency to meet the requirements of 5G wireless communication technology for the replacement of existing 4G/LTE technology used for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids. This research's main objective is to design the proper matching networks (M.Ns) to achieve Class-J mode operation that satisfies the bandwidth requirements of 5G smart grid applications. With the target impedances obtained using the load-pull simulation, lumped element matching networks are analyzed and designed in 3 ways using the ADS EDA tool. Results: The simulation results reveal that the proposed Class-J PA provides a maximum drain efficiency (D.E) of 82%, power added efficiency (PAE) of 67% with 13 dB small-signal gain at 3.5 GHz, and output power of 40 dBm (41.4 dBm peak) with a power gain of approximately 7 dB over a bandwidth of approximately 400 MHz with a 28 V power supply into a 50 Ω load. Conclusion: The efficiency and bandwidth of the proposed Class-J PA can be enhanced further by fine-tuning the matching network design to make it more suitable for 5G smart meter/grid applications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1050/v1?src=rss">Comparison of histopathological and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride test in diagnosing myocardial infarction: An autopsy study [version 1; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sudden and unexpected deaths are increasing drastically. The main cause of sudden death is cardiovascular disease, out of which coronary artery disease predominates forming 80% of the cases. Most of the time, detecting early changes in myocardial infarction during the autopsy is challenging since gross infarct changes do not appear until after 24 to 48 hours of myocardial ischemia injury. So, the aim of this study was to compare two test to detect early changes of Myocardial Infarction one by using Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) staining of the myocardial tissue, during autopsy and other by histopathological examination. Methods The sample size of 60 hearts taken from all the sudden deaths cases brought to Mortuary with suspected cause of death due to cardiac origin. The heart was obtained from the deceased by standard post-mortem technique. Serial full-thickness transverse sections of the heart were taken at 2 cm intervals from the apex to the atrioventricular groove. All the serial slices of heart are taken for histochemical staining and TTC staining. Results In histopathological examination 34 hearts were diagnosed with myocardial infarction and 26 hearts reported non myocardial infarction. With TTC 40 hearts remained unstained suggestive of myocardial infarction and 20 hearts were stained suggestive of non-infarcted hearts. TTC staining in our study shows an accuracy of 88.33%. Conclusion The result of this study shows that the Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride test, a histochemical staining technique of heart, is reliable approach for forensic pathologists to diagnose early myocardial infarction during the post-mortem examination.

The involvement of non-coding RNAs in biological processes and diseases has made the exploration of their functions crucial. Most non-coding RNAs have yet to be studied, creating the need for methods that can rapidly classify large sets of non-coding RNAs into functional groups, or classes. In recent years, the success of deep learning in various domains led to its application to non-coding RNA classification. Multiple novel architectures have been developed, but these advancements are not covered by current literature reviews. We present an exhaustive comparison of the different methods proposed in the state-of-the-art and describe their associated datasets. Moreover, the literature lacks objective benchmarks. We perform experiments to fairly evaluate the performance of various tools for non-coding RNA classification on popular datasets. The robustness of methods to non-functional sequences and sequence boundary noise is explored. We also measure computation time and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. With regard to these results, we assess the relevance of the different architectural choices and provide recommendations to consider in future methods.

Cyanobacteria hold great potential to revolutionize conventional industries and farming practices with their light-driven chemical production. To fully exploit their photosynthetic capacity and enhance product yield, it is crucial to investigate their intricate interplay with the environment including the light intensity and spectrum. Mathematical models provide valuable insights for optimizing strategies in this pursuit. In this study, we present an ordinary differential equation-based model for the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 to assess its performance under various light sources, including monochromatic light. Our model can reproduce a variety of physiologically measured quantities, e.g. experimentally reported partitioning of electrons through four main pathways, O<sub>2</sub> evolution, and the rate of carbon fixation for ambient and saturated CO<sub>2</sub>. By capturing the interactions between different components of a photosynthetic system, our model helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms driving system behavior. Our model qualitatively reproduces fluorescence emitted under various light regimes, replicating Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry experiments with saturating pulses. Using our model, we test four hypothesized mechanisms of cyanobacterial state transitions for ensemble of parameter sets and found no physiological benefit of a model assuming phycobilisome detachment. Moreover, we evaluate metabolic control for biotechnological production under diverse light colors and irradiances. We suggest gene targets for overexpression under different illuminations to increase the yield. By offering a comprehensive computational model of cyanobacterial photosynthesis, our work enhances the basic understanding of light-dependent cyanobacterial behavior and sets the first wavelength-dependent framework to systematically test their producing capacity for biocatalysis.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012427">Calibrating dimension reduction hyperparameters in the presence of noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justin Lin, Julia Fukuyama</p>

The goal of dimension reduction tools is to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. These tools are employed for a variety of reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational costs. However, there is a fundamental issue that is discussed in other modeling problems that is often overlooked in dimension reduction—overfitting. In the context of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection, cross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but rarely are such precautions taken when applying dimension reduction. Prior applications of the two most popular non-linear dimension reduction methods, t-SNE and UMAP, fail to acknowledge data as a combination of signal and noise when assessing performance. These methods are typically calibrated to capture the entirety of the data, not just the signal. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging noise when calibrating hyperparameters and present a framework that enables users to do so. We use this framework to explore the role hyperparameter calibration plays in overfitting the data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. More specifically, we show previously recommended values for perplexity and n_neighbors are too small and overfit the noise. We also provide a workflow others may use to calibrate hyperparameters in the presence of noise.

                <p>by Daniel Steiert, Corey Wittig, Priyanka Banerjee, Robert Preissner, Robert Szulcek</p>
Background <p>In the modern era, the growth of scientific literature presents a daunting challenge for researchers to keep informed of advancements across multiple disciplines.</p> Objective <p>We apply natural language processing (NLP) and embedding learning concepts to design PubDigest, a tool that combs PubMed literature, aiming to pinpoint potential drugs that could be repurposed.</p> Methods <p>Using NLP, especially term associations through word embeddings, we explored unrecognized relationships between drugs and diseases. To illustrate the utility of PubDigest, we focused on chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare disease with an overall limited number of scientific publications.</p> Results <p>Our literature analysis identified key clinical features linked to CTEPH by applying term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scoring, a technique measuring a term’s significance in a text corpus. This allowed us to map related diseases. One standout was venous thrombosis (VT), which showed strong semantic links with CTEPH. Looking deeper, we discovered potential repurposing candidates for CTEPH through large-scale neural network-based contextualization of literature and predictive modeling on both the CTEPH and the VT literature corpora to find novel, yet unrecognized associations between the two diseases. Alongside the anti-thrombotic agent caplacizumab, benzofuran derivatives were an intriguing find. In particular, the benzofuran derivative amiodarone displayed potential anti-thrombotic properties in the literature. Our <i>in vitro</i> tests confirmed amiodarone’s ability to reduce platelet aggregation significantly by 68% (p = 0.02). However, real-world clinical data indicated that CTEPH patients receiving amiodarone treatment faced a significant 15.9% higher mortality risk (p<0.001).</p> Conclusions <p>While NLP offers an innovative approach to interpreting scientific literature, especially for drug repurposing, it is crucial to combine it with complementary methods like <i>in vitro</i> testing and real-world evidence. Our exploration with benzofuran derivatives and CTEPH underscores this point. Thus, blending NLP with hands-on experiments and real-world clinical data can pave the way for faster and safer drug repurposing approaches, especially for rare diseases like CTEPH.</p>

                <p>by Seema B. Plaisier, Danielle O. Alarid, Joelle A. Denning, Sara E. Brownell, Kenneth H. Buetow, Katelyn M. Cooper, Melissa A. Wilson</p>

As genomics technologies advance, there is a growing demand for computational biologists trained for genomics analysis but instructors face significant hurdles in providing formal training in computer programming, statistics, and genomics to biology students. Fully online learners represent a significant and growing community that can contribute to meet this need, but they are frequently excluded from valuable research opportunities which mostly do not offer the flexibility they need. To address these opportunity gaps, we developed an asynchronous course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for computational genomics specifically for fully online biology students. We generated custom learning materials and leveraged remotely accessible computational tools to address 2 novel research questions over 2 iterations of the genomics CURE, one testing bioinformatics approaches and one mining cancer genomics data. Here, we present how the instructional team distributed analysis needed to address these questions between students over a 7.5-week CURE and provided concurrent training in biology and statistics, computer programming, and professional development. Scores from identical learning assessments administered before and after completion of each CURE showed significant learning gains across biology and coding course objectives. Open-response progress reports were submitted weekly and identified self-reported adaptive coping strategies for challenges encountered throughout the course. Progress reports identified problems that could be resolved through collaboration with instructors and peers via messaging platforms and virtual meetings. We implemented asynchronous communication using the Slack messaging platform and an asynchronous journal club where students discussed relevant publications using the Perusall social annotation platform. The online genomics CURE resulted in unanticipated positive outcomes, including students voluntarily discussing plans to continue research after the course. These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of this genomics CURE for scientific training, recruitment and student-mentor relationships, and student successes. Asynchronous genomics CUREs can contribute to a more skilled, diverse, and inclusive workforce for the advancement of biomedical science.
