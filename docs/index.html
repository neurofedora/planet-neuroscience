              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14279">The content and structure of dreams are coupled to affect</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.14279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dreams offer a unique window into the cognitive and affective dynamics of the sleeping and the waking mind. Recent quantitative linguistic approaches have shown promise in obtaining corpus-level measures of dream sentiment and topic occurrence. However, it is currently unclear how the affective content of individual dreams relates to their semantic content and structure. Here, we combine word embedding, topic modeling, and network analysis to investigate this relationship. By applying Discourse Atom Topic Modeling (DATM) to the DreamBank corpus of >18K dream reports, we represent the latent themes arising within dreams as a sparse dictionary of topics and identify the affective associations of those topics. We show that variation in dream affect (valence and arousal) is associated with changes in topical content. By representing each dream report as a network of topics, we demonstrate that the affective content of dreams is also coupled to semantic structure. Specifically, positively valenced dreams exhibit more coherent, structured, and linear narratives, whilst negatively valenced dreams have more narrative loops and dominant topics. Additionally, topic networks of high arousal dreams are structurally dominated by few high arousal topics and incoherent topical connections, whereas low arousal dreams contain more loops. These findings suggest that affective processes are associated with both the content and structure of dreams. Our approach showcases the potential of integrating natural language processing and network analysis with psychology to elucidate the interplay of affect, cognition and narrative in dreams. This methodology has broad applications for the study of narrated experience and psychiatric symptomatology.

                arXiv:2409.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research question: This study aims to find whether other neurostructural measurements could be added and combined with the state-of-the-art Alzheimer's imaging marker called MSSM to improve sensitivity to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease patients. Findings: By applying various neurostructural measurements such as the local gyrification index and Jacobian white to the existing Multiscale Structural Mapping of Alzheimer's Disease Neurodegeneration, better results were obtained compared to previous methods, with the addition of LGI proving to be the most effective. Meaning: The extended MSSM imaging marker may provide better ability for the detection of degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This research shows that this method, using a single standard T1- weighted MRI, can support clinical diagnostics and help identify individuals who may need further biomarker evaluation.

                arXiv:2409.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a scalar reduction method beyond weak perturbations for forced or coupled systems to determine the existence and stability of $n{:}m$ phase-locked states affected by heterogeneity. We consider various biologically relevant oscillators including the complex Ginzburg-Landau oscillator, a thalamic neuron oscillator, and a model of circadian rhythms. The scalar reduction successfully captures the emergence and disappearance of phase-locked states as a function of coupling strength and heterogeneity. We find that even small amounts of heterogeneity (often orders of magnitude smaller than the coupling strength) can significantly alter phase-locked states. The proposed method is a straightforward means to both reduce and analyze potentially high dimensional systems of oscillators that exist closer to biologically-realistic settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13997">Drift to Remember</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifelong learning in artificial intelligence (AI) aims to mimic the biological brain's ability to continuously learn and retain knowledge, yet it faces challenges such as catastrophic forgetting. Recent neuroscience research suggests that neural activity in biological systems undergoes representational drift, where neural responses evolve over time, even with consistent inputs and tasks. We hypothesize that representational drift can alleviate catastrophic forgetting in AI during new task acquisition. To test this, we introduce DriftNet, a network designed to constantly explore various local minima in the loss landscape while dynamically retrieving relevant tasks. This approach ensures efficient integration of new information and preserves existing knowledge. Experimental studies in image classification and natural language processing demonstrate that DriftNet outperforms existing models in lifelong learning. Importantly, DriftNet is scalable in handling a sequence of tasks such as sentiment analysis and question answering using large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters on a single Nvidia A100 GPU. DriftNet efficiently updates LLMs using only new data, avoiding the need for full dataset retraining. Tested on GPT-2 and RoBERTa, DriftNet is a robust, cost-effective solution for lifelong learning in LLMs. This study not only advances AI systems to emulate biological learning, but also provides insights into the adaptive mechanisms of biological neural systems, deepening our understanding of lifelong learning in nature.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10235">Reconciliation of weak pairwise spike-train correlations and highly coherent local field potentials across space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:1805.10235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-electrode arrays covering several square millimeters of neural tissue provide simultaneous access to population signals such as extracellular potentials and spiking activity of one hundred or more individual neurons. The interpretation of the recorded data calls for multiscale computational models with corresponding spatial dimensions and signal predictions. Multi-layer spiking neuron network models of local cortical circuits covering about 1 mm$^2$ have been developed, integrating experimentally obtained neuron-type-specific connectivity data and reproducing features of observed in-vivo spiking statistics. Local field potentials (LFPs) can be computed from the simulated spiking activity. We here extend a local network and LFP model to an area of 4x4 mm$^2$, preserving the neuron density and introducing distance-dependent connection probabilities and conduction delays. We find that the upscaling procedure preserves the overall spiking statistics of the original model and reproduces asynchronous irregular spiking across populations and weak pairwise spike-train correlations in agreement with experimental recordings from sensory cortex. Also compatible with experimental observations, the correlation of LFP signals is strong and decays over a distance of several hundred micrometers. Enhanced spatial coherence in the low-gamma band around 50 Hz may explain the recent report of an apparent band-pass filter effect in the spatial reach of the LFP.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10163">Learning temporal relationships between symbols with Laplace Neural Manifolds</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2302.10163v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firing across populations of neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain maintains a temporal memory, a neural timeline of the recent past. Behavioral results demonstrate that people can both remember the past and anticipate the future over an analogous internal timeline. This paper presents a mathematical framework for building this timeline of the future. We assume that the input to the system is a time series of symbols--sparse tokenized representations of the present--in continuous time. The goal is to record pairwise temporal relationships between symbols over a wide range of time scales. We assume that the brain has access to a temporal memory in the form of the real Laplace transform. Hebbian associations with a diversity of synaptic time scales are formed between the past timeline and the present symbol. The associative memory stores the convolution between the past and the present. Knowing the temporal relationship between the past and the present allows one to infer relationships between the present and the future. With appropriate normalization, this Hebbian associative matrix can store a Laplace successor representation and a Laplace predecessor representation from which measures of temporal contingency can be evaluated. The diversity of synaptic time constants allows for learning of non-stationary statistics as well as joint statistics between triplets of symbols. This framework synthesizes a number of recent neuroscientific findings including results from dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic forebrain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12895">The emergence of subjective temporality: the self-simulational theory of temporal extension from the perspective of the free energy principle</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.12895v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the emergence of subjective temporality, along with a Bayesian mechanism for hierarchical duration estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two biases (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states of meditative absorption (i.e. in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns - next to more general scale-invariant effects of explicit timing and central tendency effects - the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01280">Real-Time Machine Learning Strategies for a New Kind of Neuroscience Experiments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.01280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function and dysfunctions of neural systems are tied to the temporal evolution of neural states. The current limitations in showing their causal role stem largely from the absence of tools capable of probing the brain's internal state in real-time. This gap restricts the scope of experiments vital for advancing both fundamental and clinical neuroscience. Recent advances in real-time machine learning technologies, particularly in analyzing neural time series as nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems, are beginning to bridge this gap. These technologies enable immediate interpretation of and interaction with neural systems, offering new insights into neural computation. However, several significant challenges remain. Issues such as slow convergence rates, high-dimensional data complexities, structured noise, non-identifiability, and a general lack of inductive biases tailored for neural dynamics are key hurdles. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for the full realization of real-time neural data analysis for the causal investigation of neural computation and advanced perturbation based brain machine interfaces. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive perspective on the current state of the field, focusing on these persistent issues and outlining potential paths forward. We emphasize the importance of large-scale integrative neuroscience initiatives and the role of meta-learning in overcoming these challenges. These approaches represent promising research directions that could redefine the landscape of neuroscience experiments and brain-machine interfaces, facilitating breakthroughs in understanding brain function, and treatment of neurological disorders.

                arXiv:2408.16570v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.

                arXiv:2409.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the modification of a single-objective algorithm into its multi-objective counterpart. The outcome is a considerable increase in speed in the order of tens to hundreds and the resulting Pareto front is of higher quality compared to conventional state-of-the-art automated inverse design setups. This advancement is possible thanks to a memetic algorithm combining a gradient-based search for local minima with heuristic optimization to maintain sufficient diversity. The local algorithm is based on rank-1 perturbations; the global algorithm is NSGA-II. An important advancement is the adaptive weighting of objective functions during optimization. The procedure is tested on three challenging examples dealing with both physical and topological metrics and multi-objective settings. The results are compared with standard techniques, and the superb performance of the proposed technique is reported. The implemented algorithm applies to antenna inverse design problems and is an efficient data miner for machine learning tools.

                arXiv:2409.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higher-order-ReLU, which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, B-splines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential for physics-informed neural networks. Our detailed experiments on two standard and typical PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLUKANs and HRKANs.

Abstract: DBSCAN is an algorithm that performs clustering in the presence of noise. In this paper, we provide two constructions that allow DBSCAN to be implemented neuromorphically, using spiking neural networks. The first construction is termed "flat," resulting in large spiking neural networks that compute the algorithm quickly, in five timesteps. Moreover, the networks allow pipelining, so that a new DBSCAN calculation may be performed every timestep. The second construction is termed "systolic", and generates much smaller networks, but requires the inputs to be spiked in over several timesteps, column by column. We provide precise specifications of the constructions and analyze them in practical neuromorphic computing settings. We also provide an open-source implementation.

                arXiv:2409.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing large datasets to select optimal features is one of the most important research areas in machine learning and data mining. This feature selection procedure involves dimensionality reduction which is crucial in enhancing the performance of the model, making it less complex. Recently, several types of attribute selection methods have been proposed that use different approaches to obtain representative subsets of the attributes. However, population-based evolutionary algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been proposed to provide remedies for these drawbacks by avoiding local optima and improving the selection process itself. This manuscript presents a sweeping review on GA-based feature selection techniques in applications and their effectiveness across different domains. This review was conducted using the PRISMA methodology; hence, the systematic identification, screening, and analysis of relevant literature were performed. Thus, our results hint that the field's hybrid GA methodologies including, but not limited to, GA-Wrapper feature selector and HGA-neural networks, have substantially improved their potential through the resolution of problems such as exploration of unnecessary search space, accuracy performance problems, and complexity. The conclusions of this paper would result in discussing the potential that GAs bear in feature selection and future research directions for their enhancement in applicability and performance.

                arXiv:2409.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing dedicated neuromorphic computing platforms optimized for embedded or edge-computing applications requires time-consuming design, fabrication, and deployment of full-custom neuromorphic processors.bTo ensure that initial prototyping efforts, exploring the properties of different network architectures and parameter settings, lead to realistic results it is important to use simulation frameworks that match as best as possible the properties of the final hardware. This is particularly challenging for neuromorphic hardware platforms made using mixed-signal analog/digital circuits, due to the variability and noise sensitivity of their components. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a software spiking neural network simulator explicitly designed to account for the properties of mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits, including device mismatch variability. The simulator, called ARCANA (A Realistic Simulation Framework for Analog/Digital Neuromorphic Architectures), is designed to reproduce the dynamics of mixed-signal synapse and neuron electronic circuits with autogradient differentiation for parameter optimization and GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by matching software simulation results with measurements made from an existing neuromorphic processor. We show how the results obtained provide a reliable estimate of the behavior of the spiking neural network trained in software, once deployed in hardware. This framework enables the development and innovation of new learning rules and processing architectures in neuromorphic embedded systems.

                arXiv:2409.13854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the gated perceptron, an enhancement of the conventional perceptron, which incorporates an additional input computed as the product of the existing inputs. This allows the perceptron to capture non-linear interactions between features, significantly improving its ability to classify and regress on complex datasets. We explore its application in both linear and non-linear regression tasks using the Iris dataset, as well as binary and multi-class classification problems, including the PIMA Indian dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Our results demonstrate that the gated perceptron can generate more distinct decision regions compared to traditional perceptrons, enhancing its classification capabilities, particularly in handling non-linear data. Performance comparisons show that the gated perceptron competes with state-of-the-art classifiers while maintaining a simple architecture.

                arXiv:2409.14429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is permeating every conceivable domain to promote data-driven decision support. The focus is often on advanced black-box models due to their assumed performance advantages, whereas interpretable models are often associated with inferior predictive qualities. More recently, however, a new generation of generalized additive models (GAMs) has been proposed that offer promising properties for capturing complex, non-linear patterns while remaining fully interpretable. To uncover the merits and limitations of these models, this study examines the predictive performance of seven different GAMs in comparison to seven commonly used machine learning models based on a collection of twenty tabular benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair and robust model comparison, an extensive hyperparameter search combined with cross-validation was performed, resulting in 68,500 model runs. In addition, this study qualitatively examines the visual output of the models to assess their level of interpretability. Based on these results, the paper dispels the misconception that only black-box models can achieve high accuracy by demonstrating that there is no strict trade-off between predictive performance and model interpretability for tabular data. Furthermore, the paper discusses the importance of GAMs as powerful interpretable models for the field of information systems and derives implications for future work from a socio-technical perspective.

                arXiv:2409.15022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep State-Space Models (SSM) demonstrate state-of-the art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. While the recurrent structure of SSMs can be efficiently implemented as a convolution or as a parallel scan during training, recurrent token-by-token processing cannot currently be implemented efficiently on GPUs. Here, we demonstrate efficient token-by-token inference of the SSM S4D on Intel's Loihi 2 state-of-the-art neuromorphic processor. We compare this first ever neuromorphic-hardware implementation of an SSM on sMNIST, psMNIST, and sCIFAR to a recurrent and a convolutional implementation of S4D on Jetson Orin Nano (Jetson). While we find Jetson to perform better in an offline sample-by-sample based batched processing mode, Loihi 2 outperforms during token-by-token based processing, where it consumes 1000 times less energy with a 75 times lower latency and a 75 times higher throughput compared to the recurrent implementation of S4D on Jetson. This opens up new avenues towards efficient real-time streaming applications of SSMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces KAMoE, a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework based on Gated Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (GRKAN). We propose GRKAN as an alternative to the traditional gating function, aiming to enhance efficiency and interpretability in MoE modeling. Through extensive experiments on digital asset markets and real estate valuation, we demonstrate that KAMoE consistently outperforms traditional MoE architectures across various tasks and model types. Our results show that GRKAN exhibits superior performance compared to standard Gating Residual Networks, particularly in LSTM-based models for sequential tasks. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains in MoE and KAMoE architectures.

                arXiv:2407.08742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dense Associative Memory generalizes the Hopfield network by allowing for sharper interaction functions. This increases the capacity of the network as an autoassociative memory as nearby learned attractors will not interfere with one another. However, the implementation of the network relies on applying large exponents to the dot product of memory vectors and probe vectors. If the dimension of the data is large the calculation can be very large and result in imprecisions and overflow when using floating point numbers in a practical implementation. We describe the computational issues in detail, modify the original network description to mitigate the problem, and show the modification will not alter the networks' dynamics during update or training. We also show our modification greatly improves hyperparameter selection for the Dense Associative Memory, removing dependence on the interaction vertex and resulting in an optimal region of hyperparameters that does not significantly change with the interaction vertex as it does in the original network.

                arXiv:2404.02031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely accepted way to assess the performance of iterative black-box optimizers is to analyze their empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of pre-defined quality targets achieved not later than a given runtime. In this work, we consider an alternative approach, based on the empirical attainment function (EAF) and we show that the target-based ECDF is an approximation of the EAF. We argue that the EAF has several advantages over the target-based ECDF. In particular, it does not require defining a priori quality targets per function, captures performance differences more precisely, and enables the use of additional summary statistics that enrich the analysis. We also show that the average area over the convergence curves is a simpler-to-calculate, but equivalent, measure of anytime performance. To facilitate the accessibility of the EAF, we integrate a module to compute it into the IOHanalyzer platform. Finally, we illustrate the use of the EAF via synthetic examples and via the data available for the BBOB suite.

Abstract: We show that the time-resolved dynamics of an underdamped harmonic oscillator can be used to do multifunctional computation, performing distinct computations at distinct times within a single dynamical trajectory. We consider the amplitude of an oscillator whose inputs influence its frequency. The activity of the oscillator at fixed time is a nonmonotonic function of its inputs, and so it can solve problems such as XOR that are not linearly separable. The activity of the oscillator at fixed input is a nonmonotonic function of time, and so it is multifunctional in a temporal sense, able to carry out distinct nonlinear computations at distinct times within the same dynamical trajectory. We show that a single oscillator, observed at different times, can act as all of the elementary logic gates and can perform binary addition, the latter usually implemented in hardware using 5 logic gates. We show that a set of $n$ oscillators, observed at different times, can perform an arbitrary number of analog-to-$n$-bit digital conversions. We also show that oscillators can be trained by gradient descent to perform distinct classification tasks at distinct times. Computing with time-dependent functionality can be done in or out of equilibrium, and suggests a way of reducing the number of parameters or devices required to do nonlinear computations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04440">Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Traffic Flow using Wavelet-based Temporal Attention</a></h4>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow data represents a typical problem in the field of machine learning, impacting urban traffic management systems. In general, spatiotemporal forecasting problems involve complex interactions, nonlinearities, and long-range dependencies due to the interwoven nature of the temporal and spatial dimensions. Due to this, traditional statistical and machine learning methods cannot adequately handle the temporal and spatial dependencies in these complex traffic flow datasets. A prevalent approach in the field combines graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal processing. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet-based dynamic spatiotemporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Wavelet decomposition can help by decomposing the signal into components that can be analyzed independently, reducing the impact of non-stationarity and handling long-range dependencies of traffic flow datasets. Benchmark experiments using three popularly used statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models (including both temporal and spatiotemporal benchmarks) on three publicly available traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble method can better handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make reliable long-term forecasts. In addition to point forecasts, our proposed model can generate interval forecasts that significantly enhance probabilistic forecasting for traffic datasets.

	<p>Violence against women impacts a minimum of 35% of the global female population, encompassing sexual, physical, and psychological forms. Perpetrators of this violence include partners, family members, or strangers. Its ramifications are substantial, evident in the prevalence of chronic pain reported by between 48% and 84% of women who have experienced abuse, with an odds ratio of 2.08. Notably associated diagnoses include pelvic/vaginal pain, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome/bowel symptoms, abdominal pain, migraine/headache, and back and neck pain. These diagnoses significantly limit a woman&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to participate in daily activities, such as exercising or working, leading to genuine disability. Despite substantial evidence, the precise cause and etiology of these conditions remain unclear. Adhering to the bio-psycho-social model, it is conceivable that chronic pain in victims of violence cannot be attributed to a single factor alone, but rather to a combination of all three: biological, psychological, and social factors. Uncovering these factors could have significant clinical and legal implications. On one hand, it would be possible to conduct screenings to avoid developing chronic pain. and guide individuals toward the correct treatment. On the other hand, victims could seek compensation for chronic pain resulting from violence. Considering the limited knowledge about the causes of chronic pain and the absence of tools to identify risk factors or a set of tests for evaluating victims of violence, the goal of the research described in this project protocol is to pinpoint the specific contributing factors for chronic pain due to violence victimization. Additionally, it aims to devise a comprehensive protocol for assessing these factors in forensic science.</p>

	<p>Background: Headache is a common complaint during childhood and adolescence. It is important to be aware of the characteristics of pediatric headaches in order to make a precise and timely diagnosis. This study investigated the clinical characteristics of pediatric headaches according to the underlying etiology and age group. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 3374 pediatric patients (2667 with primary headache [PH] and 707 with secondary headache [SH]) who presented with headaches at two centers between January 2012 and November 2023. Results: The incidence of PH was significantly higher in adolescents (40.1% vs. 22.9%), whereas that of SH was considerably higher in preschoolers (37.5% vs. 16.3%) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The prevalence of headaches attributed to infection was significantly higher in preschool and school-aged children (90.8% vs. 80.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); adolescents exhibited significantly higher frequencies of cranial and cervical vascular disorders (3.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.044) and psychiatric disorders (5.6% vs. 0.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Statistically significant differences were observed between preschool/school-aged children and adolescents in terms of headache characteristics and the prevalence of headache-associated symptoms (60.4% vs. 74.1%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in PH), neurologic abnormalities (10.2% vs. 23.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in PH; 2.4% vs. 11.7%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in SH), and headache triggers (19.9% vs. 24.2%, p = 0.008 in PH; 2.0% vs. 8.0%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 in SH). Conclusions: Recognizing the etiology and age-specific differences in the clinical characteristics of headaches is crucial for an accurate and timely diagnosis. Tailoring the diagnostic approach accordingly helps to achieve optimal outcomes in pediatric patients with headaches.</p>

                <p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (CaBPs; CaBP1&ndash;5) are a subfamily of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors with high homology to calmodulin. Notably, CaBP4, which is exclusively expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors, is crucial for maintaining normal retinal functions. However, the functional roles of CaBP1, CaBP2, and CaBP5 in the retina remain elusive, primarily due to limited understanding of their expression patterns within inner retinal neurons. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive transcript analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to investigate the gene expression profiles of CaBPs in mouse and human retinal neurons. Our findings revealed notable similarities in the overall expression patterns of CaBPs across both species. Specifically, nearly all amacrine cell, ganglion cell, and horizontal cell types exclusively expressed CaBP1. In contrast, the majority of bipolar cell types, including rod bipolar (RB) cells, expressed distinct combinations of CaBP1, CaBP2, and CaBP5, rather than a single CaBP as previously hypothesized. Remarkably, mouse rods and human cones exclusively expressed CaBP4, whereas mouse cones and human rods coexpressed both CaBP4 and CaBP5. Our single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the coexpression CaBP1 and CaBP5 in individual RBs from mice of either sex. Additionally, all three splice variants of CaBP1, primarily L-CaBP1, were detected in mouse RBs. Taken together, our study offers a comprehensive overview of the distribution of CaBPs in mouse and human retinal neurons, providing valuable insights into their roles in visual functions.</p>

                <p>Social recognition is an essential part of social function and often promotes specific social behaviors based on prior experience. Social and defensive behaviors in particular often emerge with prior experiences of familiarity or novelty/stress, respectively. This is also commonly seen in rodents toward same-strain and interstrain conspecifics. Medial amygdala (MeA) activity guides social choice based on age and sex recognition and is sensitive to social experiences. However, little is known about whether the MeA exhibits differential responses based on strain or how this is impacted by experience. Social stress impacts posterior MeA (MeAp) function and can shift measures of social engagement. However, it is unclear how stress impacts MeAp activity and contributes to altered social behavior. The primary goal of this study in adult male Sprague Dawley rats was to determine whether prior stress experience with a different-strain (Long&ndash;Evans) rat impacts MeAp responses to same-strain and different-strain conspecifics in parallel with a change in behavior using in vivo fiber photometry. We found that MeAp activity was uniformly activated during social contact with a novel same-strain rat during a three-chamber social preference test following control handling but became biased toward a novel different-strain rat following social stress. Socially stressed rats also showed initially heightened social interaction with novel same-strain rats but showed social avoidance and fragmented social behavior with novel different-strain rats relative to controls. These results indicate that heightened MeAp activity may guide social responses to novel, threatening, rather than non-threatening, social stimuli after stress.</p>

                <p>The goal of connectomics is to reveal the links between neural circuits and behavior. Larvae of the primitive chordate <I>Ciona</I> are well-suited to make contributions in this area. In addition to having a described connectome, <I>Ciona</I> larvae have a range of readily quantified behaviors. Moreover, the small number of neurons in the larval CNS (~180) holds the promise of a comprehensive characterization of individual neurons. We present single-neuron predictions for glutamate receptor (GlutR) expression based on in situ hybridization. Included are both ionotropic receptors (AMPA, NMDA, and kainate) and metabotropic receptors. The predicted glutamate receptor expression dataset is discussed in the context of known circuits driving behaviors such as phototaxis, mechanosensation, and looming shadow response. The predicted expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors may help resolve issues regarding the co-production of GABA and glutamate by a subset of photoreceptors. The targets of these photoreceptors in the midbrain appear to express NMDA receptors, but not AMPA receptors. This is in agreement with previous results indicating that GABA is the primary neurotransmitter from the photoreceptors evoking a swimming response through a disinhibition mechanism and that glutamate may, therefore, have only a modulatory action in this circuit. Other findings reported here are more unexpected. For example, many of the targets of glutamatergic epidermal sensory neurons (ESNs) do not express any of the ionotropic receptors, yet the ESNs themselves express metabotropic receptors. Thus, we speculate that their production of glutamate may be for communication with neighboring ESNs, rather than to their interneuron targets.</p>

                Abstract* Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of fine-tuning their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

                Background Building Metagenome–Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from highly complex metagenomics datasets encompasses a series of steps covering from cleaning the sequences, assembling them to finally group them into bins. Along the process, multiple tools aimed to assess the quality and integrity of each MAG are implemented. Nonetheless, even when incorporated within end–to–end pipelines, the outputs of these pieces of software must be visualized and analyzed manually lacking integration in a complete framework. Methods We developed a Nextflow pipeline (MAGFlow) for estimating the quality of MAGs through a wide variety of approaches (BUSCO, CheckM2, GUNC and QUAST), as well as for annotating taxonomically the metagenomes using GTDB-Tk2. MAGFlow is coupled to a Python–Dash application (BIgMAG) that displays the concatenated outcomes from the tools included by MAGFlow, highlighting the most important metrics in a single interactive environment along with a comparison/clustering of the input data. Results By using MAGFlow/BIgMAG, the user will be able to benchmark the MAGs obtained through different workflows or establish the quality of the MAGs belonging to different samples following the divide and rule methodology. Conclusions MAGFlow/BIgMAG represents a unique tool that integrates state-of-the-art tools to study different quality metrics and extract visually as much information as possible from a wide range of genome features.

                Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a change in brain function or evidence of brain pathology caused by external mechanical forces. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a neurotropin that functions as a neuron protective. Nigella sativa L is reported to have an antioxidant effect, administration of Nigella Sativa L to rats treated with ischemia-reperfusion brain injury. Propofol is an anesthetic agent frequently used intravenously in the management of TBI. The effect of propofol on brain tissue after TBI may be neuroprotective. We aimed to compare the potential of Nigella sativa L and propofol as neuroplasticity and neuroprotection in rats with TBI. Methods This was a laboratory experimental animal model with the post-test only control group design, namely measuring the effect of treatment by comparing the five groups of rats consisting of 30 rats. BDNF levels in rat brain tissue were collected at day 7 of treatment and measured by ELISA. Results The average BDNF protein levels per group, namely G1 (221,243 pg/mL), G2 (172,139 pg/mL), G3 (255,483 pg/mL), G4 (227,089 pg/mL), and G5 (272,603 pg/mL) respectively. Based on the ANOVA statistic, p-value = 0.032 (there was a significant difference between groups), with the Levene Test (0.077) or having variance between the same groups, sequentially the difference in average BDNF protein levels of the five groups is G5>G3>G4>G1>G2, meaning that the combination of Nigella sativa and propofol has more potential to increase BDNF protein levels than Nigella sativa, and Nigella sativa has more potential than propofol. Conclusion We concluded that both nigella sativa and propofol have the potential to increase BDNF protein levels. Nigella Sativa L had a better effect than propofol in repairing damaged neuron cells (neuroplasticity) and increasing BDNF protein levels (neuroprotection) for 7 days of administration in rat traumatic brain injury.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-689/v2?src=rss">Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for individuals with gambling disorder in Indonesia: protocol for a pilot and feasibility study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Gambling disorder (GD) has become a wide concern in Indonesia, as many negative consequences arise from this psychiatric condition. Prompt treatment with an appropriate method of delivery is required to achieve optimal outcomes in GD patients. This protocol paper outlines a study to determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) in treating GD in Indonesia. Methods This non-randomized pilot and feasibility study will recruit 20 people with GD. All participants will receive the iCBT intervention through self-learning videos and guided weekly group sessions. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed at baseline (week 0), post- treatment completion (week 10), and 6 weeks post-treatment (week 16). The outcomes measured will be the change in gambling symptoms, gambling urges, cognitive distortions, readiness to change, emotional problems, and quality of life of the participants. Discussion The feasibility of iCBT for GD patients in Indonesia will be assessed by this study. The study’s results will give an indication of the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of a subsequent conclusive trial. The delivery of iCBT may help to address the issue of treatment access in an extensive geographical region and provide immediate implications as a treatment resource for GD in practice.

                Wireless capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive medical imaging modality used for diagnosing and monitoring digestive tract diseases. However, the analysis of images obtained from wireless capsule endoscopy is a challenging task, as the images are of low resolution and often contain a large number of artifacts. In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the analysis of medical images, including wireless capsule endoscopy images. This paper provides a review of the current trends and future directions in deep learning for wireless capsule endoscopy. We focus on the recent advances in transfer learning, attention mechanisms, multi-modal learning, automated lesion detection, interpretability and explainability, data augmentation, and edge computing. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of current deep learning methods and discuss the potential future directions for the field. Our review provides insights into the ongoing research and development efforts in the field of deep learning for wireless capsule endoscopy, and can serve as a reference for researchers, clinicians, and engineers working in this area inspection process.

                <p>by Jolanda Malamud, Sinan Guloksuz, Ruud van Winkel, Philippe Delespaul, Marc A. F. De Hert, Catherine Derom, Evert Thiery, Nele Jacobs, Bart P. F. Rutten, Quentin J. M. Huys</p>
Background <p>Mood disorders involve a complex interplay between multifaceted internal emotional states, and complex external inputs. Dynamical systems theory suggests that this interplay between aspects of moods and environmental stimuli may hence determine key psychopathological features of mood disorders, including the stability of mood states, the response to external inputs, how controllable mood states are, and what interventions are most likely to be effective. However, a comprehensive computational approach to all these aspects has not yet been undertaken.</p> Methods <p>Here, we argue that the combination of ecological momentary assessments (EMA) with a well-established dynamical systems framework—the humble Kalman filter—enables a comprehensive account of all these aspects. We first introduce the key features of the Kalman filter and optimal control theory and their relationship to aspects of psychopathology. We then examine the psychometric and inferential properties of combining EMA data with Kalman filtering across realistic scenarios. Finally, we apply the Kalman filter to a series of EMA datasets comprising over 700 participants with and without symptoms of depression.</p> Results <p>The results show a naive Kalman filter approach performs favourably compared to the standard vector autoregressive approach frequently employed, capturing key aspects of the data better. Furthermore, it suggests that the depressed state involves alterations to interactions between moods; alterations to how moods responds to external inputs; and as a result an alteration in how controllable mood states are. We replicate these findings qualitatively across datasets and explore an extension to optimal control theory to guide therapeutic interventions.</p> Conclusions <p>Mood dynamics are richly and profoundly altered in depressed states. The humble Kalman filter is a well-established, rich framework to characterise mood dynamics. Its application to EMA data is valid; straightforward; and likely to result in substantial novel insights both into mechanisms and treatments.</p>

                <p>by Matt J. Keeling, Louise Dyson</p>

We discuss the invasion of the Omicron BA.1 variant into England as a paradigm for real-time model fitting and projection. Here we use a mixture of simple SIR-type models, analysis of the early data and a more complex age-structure model fit to the outbreak to understand the dynamics. In particular, we highlight that early data shows that the invading Omicron variant had a substantial growth advantage over the resident Delta variant. However, early data does not allow us to reliably infer other key epidemiological parameters—such as generation time and severity—which influence the expected peak hospital numbers. With more complete epidemic data from January 2022 are we able to capture the true scale of the epidemic in terms of both infections and hospital admissions, driven by different infection characteristics of Omicron compared to Delta and a substantial shift in estimated precautionary behaviour during December. This work highlights the challenges of real time forecasting, in a rapidly changing environment with limited information on the variant’s epidemiological characteristics.

                <p>by Juan Pablo Franco, Peter Bossaerts, Carsten Murawski</p>

Many everyday tasks require people to solve computationally complex problems. However, little is known about the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving such problems. Here, we draw on computational complexity theory to address this issue. We performed an experiment in which participants solved several instances of the 0-1 knapsack problem, a combinatorial optimization problem, while undergoing ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Instances varied in computational hardness. We characterize a network of brain regions whose activation was correlated with computational complexity, including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the intra-parietal sulcus/angular gyrus. Activation and connectivity changed dynamically as a function of complexity, in line with theoretical computational requirements. Overall, our results suggest that computational complexity theory provides a suitable framework to study the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving complex cognitive tasks.

                <p>by Nafiseh Atapour, Marcello G. P. Rosa, Shi Bai, Sylwia Bednarek, Agata Kulesza, Gabriela Saworska, Sadaf Teymornejad, Katrina H. Worthy, Piotr Majka</p>

The diversity of the mammalian cerebral cortex demands technical approaches to map the spatial distribution of neurons with different biochemical identities. This issue is magnified in the case of the primate cortex, characterized by a large number of areas with distinctive cytoarchitectures. To date, no full map of the distribution of cells expressing a specific protein has been reported for the cortex of any primate. Here we have charted the 3-dimensional distribution of neurons expressing the calcium-binding protein calbindin (CB<sup>+</sup> neurons) across the entire marmoset cortex, using a combination of immunohistochemistry, automated cell identification, computerized reconstruction, and cytoarchitecture-aware registration. CB<sup>+</sup> neurons formed a heterogeneous population, which together corresponded to 10–20% of the cortical neurons. They occurred in higher proportions in areas corresponding to low hierarchical levels of processing, such as sensory cortices. Although CB<sup>+</sup> neurons were concentrated in the supragranular and granular layers, there were clear global trends in their laminar distribution. For example, their relative density in infragranular layers increased with hierarchical level along sensorimotor processing streams, and their density in layer 4 was lower in areas involved in sensorimotor integration, action planning and motor control. These results reveal new quantitative aspects of the cytoarchitectural organization of the primate cortex, and demonstrate an approach to mapping the full distribution of neurochemically distinct cells throughout the brain which is readily applicable to most other mammalian species.

                <p>by Nicola Dietler, Alia Abbara, Subham Choudhury, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that nonlinear selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.

Many distantly related organisms have convergently evolved traits and lifestyles that enable them to live in similar ecological environments. However, the extent of phenotypic convergence evolving through the same or distinct genetic trajectories remains an open question. Here, we leverage a comprehensive dataset of genomic and phenotypic data from 1,049 yeast species in the subphylum Saccharomycotina (Kingdom Fungi, Phylum Ascomycota) to explore signatures of convergent evolution in cactophilic yeasts, ecological specialists associated with cacti. We inferred that the ecological association of yeasts with cacti arose independently approximately 17 times. Using a machine learning–based approach, we further found that cactophily can be predicted with 76% accuracy from both functional genomic and phenotypic data. The most informative feature for predicting cactophily was thermotolerance, which we found to be likely associated with altered evolutionary rates of genes impacting the cell envelope in several cactophilic lineages. We also identified horizontal gene transfer and duplication events of plant cell wall–degrading enzymes in distantly related cactophilic clades, suggesting that putatively adaptive traits evolved independently through disparate molecular mechanisms. Notably, we found that multiple cactophilic species and their close relatives have been reported as emerging human opportunistic pathogens, suggesting that the cactophilic lifestyle—and perhaps more generally lifestyles favoring thermotolerance—might preadapt yeasts to cause human disease. This work underscores the potential of a multifaceted approach involving high-throughput genomic and phenotypic data to shed light onto ecological adaptation and highlights how convergent evolution to wild environments could facilitate the transition to human pathogenicity.

                Background In a rehabilitation centre designed for drug and alcohol recovery, the therapeutic environment may enhance the psychosocial well-being of sufferers and facilitate a speedy recovery. This study aims to investigate the psychosocial well-being needs (PWNs) of users in an alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre (ADRC) and how therapeutic architectural solutions (TASs) can promote a healing environment through design. Methods The study employed a mixed research method (qualitative and quantitative). The research strategy was a case study of four rehabilitation centres in Nigeria’s busiest cities; Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Enugu. Data were collected via survey questionnaires, an in-depth interview guide, an observation guide, and a checklist of TACs in a healthcare facility. We first investigated what the PWNs of alcohol and drug sufferers (ADSs) are, then identified the therapeutic architectural components (TACs) of an ADRC, before determining what effect TACs have on the recovery process of substance abuse patients. Results The findings identify eight PWNs and nine TACs essential in an ADRC. The result indicates that TACs have a significant effect on the recovery process of ADSs. However, based on the study results, a framework (framework here refers to using an intelligent and sensitive conceptual design structure as a standard guide for the building archetype rehabilitation facility, which supports mental health service delivery) may be recommended for rehabilitation facilities with TASs for Substance Abuse Disorder (SUD). Conclusion The study result presents a correlation between ADSs’ recovery rates and a well-designed therapeutic environment. So, there is a need for evidence-based design (EBD) of rehabilitation centres with full compliments of a therapeutic architectural environment and integration of mental health services into routine care in sub-Saharan Africa. Limitations include that analyses were cross-sectional and thus may not deduce causal directions, and the authors based the result on self-report.

                Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, an increase in the incidence of fungal infections was observed. However, the real magnitude of these fungal infections and their risk factors among COVID-19 patients in the Indian population is unknown. Aim: To study the frequency, and spectrum of invasive fungal infections (IFI) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and the risk factors associated with invasive fungal infections. Methods: We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study; including all adult patients, admitted to Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), a tertiary care hospital in Southern India between April 2020 and August 2021, with COVID-19. Based on clinical-radiological features, patients with fungal infections were grouped into three diagnostic categories. Demographics, clinical, and laboratory features of patients with fungal infections were analyzed to identify the risk factors. Results: About 10% (449 out of 4650) of the admitted patients with recent COVID-19, had some form of IFI. Among the patients with IFI, 80% (366 out of 449) were hospitalized for active COVID-19, whereas almost all the patients admitted with post-COVID complications had IFI. Of the 449 patients with IFI, 377 had mold infections and 88 had invasive candidiasis. Mucormycosis was the most common mold infection. Diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis were strong independent predictors of IFI. We also found an association between end-stage renal disease, central venous catheterization, antibiotic usage, prior stroke, and corticosteroid therapy with IFI. Conclusions: The frequency of fungal infections among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. Special precautions in COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy, and prior antibiotic usage may help to reduce invasive fungal infections.

                Cell division is fundamental to all healthy tissue growth, as well as being rate-limiting in the tissue repair response to wounding and during cancer progression. However, the role that cell divisions play in tissue growth is a collective one, requiring the integration of many individual cell division events. It is particularly difficult to accurately detect and quantify multiple features of large numbers of cell divisions (including their spatio-temporal synchronicity and orientation) over extended periods of time. It would thus be advantageous to perform such analyses in an automated fashion, which can naturally be enabled using deep learning. Hence, we develop a pipeline of deep learning models that accurately identify dividing cells in time-lapse movies of epithelial tissues in vivo. Our pipeline also determines their axis of division orientation, as well as their shape changes before and after division. This strategy enables us to analyse the dynamic profile of cell divisions within the <i>Drosophila</i> pupal wing epithelium, both as it undergoes developmental morphogenesis and as it repairs following laser wounding. We show that the division axis is biased according to lines of tissue tension and that wounding triggers a synchronised (but not oriented) burst of cell divisions back from the leading edge.

                Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare melanoma originating in the eye’s uvea, with 50% of patients experiencing metastasis predominantly in the liver. In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, there is only a limited effectiveness of combined immune checkpoint therapies, and half of patients with uveal melanoma metastases succumb to disease within 2 years. This study aimed to provide a path toward enhancing immunotherapy efficacy by identifying and functionally validating tumor-reactive T cells in liver metastases of patients with UM. We employed single-cell RNA-seq of biopsies and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to identify potential tumor-reactive T cells. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of UM metastases were created from patients, and tumor sphere cultures were generated from these models for co-culture with autologous or MART1-specific HLA-matched allogenic TILs. Activated T cells were subjected to TCR-seq, and the TCRs were matched to those found in single-cell sequencing data from biopsies, expanded TILs, and in livers or spleens of PDX models injected with TILs. Our findings revealed that tumor-reactive T cells resided not only among activated and exhausted subsets of T cells, but also in a subset of cytotoxic effector cells. In conclusion, combining single-cell sequencing and functional analysis provides valuable insights into which T cells in UM may be useful for cell therapy amplification and marker selection.

                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) plays critical roles in the motor and cognitive function of the basal ganglia (BG), but the exact nature of these roles is not fully understood, especially in the context of decision-making based on uncertain evidence. Guided by theoretical predictions of specific STN contributions, we used single-unit recording and electrical microstimulation in the STN of healthy monkeys to assess its causal, computational roles in visual-saccadic decisions based on noisy evidence. The recordings identified subpopulations of STN neurons with distinct task-related activity patterns that related to different theoretically predicted functions. Microstimulation caused changes in behavioral choices and response times that reflected multiple contributions to an ‘accumulate-to-bound’-like decision process, including modulation of decision bounds and evidence accumulation, and to non-perceptual processes. These results provide new insights into the multiple ways that the STN can support higher brain function.

">GABAergic neuron dysregulation in a human neurodevelopmental model for major psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                GABA dysfunction is a major hypothesis for the biological basis of schizophrenia with indirect supporting evidence from human post-mortem brain and genetic studies. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a valuable platform for modeling psychiatric disorders, and previous modeling has revealed glutamatergic synapse deficits. Whether GABAergic synapse properties are affected in patient-derived human neurons and how this impacts neuronal network activity remain poorly understood. Here we optimized a protocol to differentiate iPSCs into highly enriched ganglionic eminence-like neural progenitors and GABAergic neurons. Using a collection of iPSCs derived from patients of psychiatric disorders carrying a Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) mutation and their unaffected family member, together with respective isogenic lines, we identified mutation-dependent deficits in GABAergic synapse formation and function, a phenotype similar to that of mutant glutamatergic neurons. However, mutant glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons contribute differentially to neuronal network excitability and synchrony deficits. Finally, we showed that GABAergic synaptic transmission is also defective in neurons derived from several idiopathic schizophrenia patient iPSCs. Transcriptome analysis further showed some shared gene expression dysregulation, which is more prominent in DISC1 mutant neurons. Together, our study supports a functional GABAergic synaptic deficit in major psychiatric disorders.

                How astrocytes regulate neuronal circuits is a fundamental, unsolved question in neurobiology. Nevertheless, few studies have explored the rules that govern when astrocytes respond to different neurotransmitters in vivo and how they affect downstream circuit modulation. Here, we report an unexpected mechanism in Drosophila by which G-protein coupled adrenergic signaling in astrocytes can control, or ''gate,'' their ability to respond to other neurotransmitters. Further, we show that manipulating this pathway potently regulates neuronal circuit activity and animal behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that this gating mechanism is conserved in mammalian astrocytes, arguing it is an ancient feature of astrocyte circuit function. Our work establishes a new mechanism by which astrocytes dynamically respond to and modulate neuronal activity in different brain regions and in different behavioral states.

                Social cognition develops through a complex interplay between neural maturation and environmental factors, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm, we investigated the effects of age and parental caregiving on social brain development and Theory of Mind (ToM) in 50 mother-child dyads. The functional maturity of social brain networks was positively associated with age, while mother-child neural synchronization during movie viewing was related to dyadic relationship quality. Crucially, parenting and child factors interactively shaped social cognition outcomes, mediated by ToM abilities. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of neurocognitive development and interpersonal synchrony in early childhood social cognition, and provide novel evidence for Bandura's theory of social learning and reciprocal determinism. This integrative approach, bridging brain, behavior, and parenting environment, advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms shaping social cognition. The insights gained can inform personalized interventions promoting social competence, emphasizing the critical importance of nurturing parental relationships in facilitating healthy social development.

">Hippocampal representations of alternative possibilities are flexibly generated to meet cognitive demands</a></h4>

              
                The cognitive ability to go beyond the present to consider alternative possibilities, including potential futures and counterfactual pasts, can support adaptive decision making. Complex and changing real-world environments, however, have many possible alternatives. Whether and how the brain can select among them to represent alternatives that meet current cognitive needs remains unknown. We therefore examined neural representations of alternative spatial locations in the rat hippocampus during navigation in a complex patch foraging environment with changing reward probabilities. We found representations of multiple alternatives along paths ahead and behind the animal, including in distant alternative patches. Critically, these representations were modulated in distinct patterns across successive trials: alternative paths were represented proportionate to their evolving relative value and predicted subsequent decisions, whereas distant alternatives were prevalent during value updating. These results demonstrate that the brain modulates the generation of alternative possibilities in patterns that meet changing cognitive needs for adaptive behavior.

                When analysing high-dimensional time-series datasets, the inference of effective networks has proven to be a valuable modelling technique. This technique produces networks where each target node is associated with a set of source nodes that are capable of providing explanatory power for its dynamics. Multivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) has proven to be a popular and effective tool for inferring these networks. Recently, a continuous-time estimator of TE for event-based data such as spike trains has been developed which, in more efficiently representing event data in terms of inter-event intervals, is significantly more capable of measuring multivariate interactions. The new estimator thus presents an opportunity to more effectively use TE for the inference of effective networks from spike trains, and we demonstrate in this paper for the first time its efficacy at this task. Using data generated from models of spiking neurons - for which the ground-truth connectivity is known - we demonstrate the accuracy of this approach in various dynamical regimes. We further show that it exhibits far superior inference performance to a pairwise TE-based approach as well as a recently-proposed convolutional neural network approach. Moreover, comparison with Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), which are commonly applied to spike-train data, showed clear benefits, particularly in cases of high synchrony. Finally, we demonstrate its utility in revealing the patterns by which effective connections develop from recordings of developing neural cell cultures.

">Postnatal Enrichment Corrects Deficits in Perineuronal Net Formation and Reversal Learning in Adult Mice Exposed to Early Adversity</a></h4>

              
                Childhood neglect is associated with cortical thinning, hyperactivity, and deficits in cognitive flexibility that are difficult to reverse later in life. Despite being the most prevalent form of early adversity, little is currently understood about the mechanisms responsible for these neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and no animal models have yet replicated key structural and behavioral features of childhood neglect/deprivation. To address these gaps, we have recently demonstrated that mice exposed to impoverished conditions, specifically limited bedding (LB), exhibit behavioral and structural changes that resemble those observed in adolescents who have experienced severe neglect. Here, we show that LB leads to long-term deficits in reversal learning, which can be fully reversed by briefly exposing LB pups to enrichment (toys) in their home cage from postnatal days 14 to 25. Reversal learning failed to induce normal c-fos activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of LB mice, a deficit that was normalized by early enrichment. Additionally, LB decreased the density of parvalbumin-positive cells surrounded by perineuronal nets (PV+PNN+) and increased the ratio of glutamatergic to inhibitory synapse densities in the OFC, deficits that were also reversed by enrichment. Degradation of PNN in the OFC of adult mice impaired reversal learning, reduced c-fos activation, and increased the ratio of glutamatergic to inhibitory synapse densities in the OFC to levels comparable to those observed in LB mice. Collectively, our findings suggest that postnatal deprivation and enrichment impact the formation of PV+PNN+ cells in the OFC, a developmental process that is essential for cognitive flexibility in adulthood.

">Systematic changes in neural selectivity reflect the acquired salience of category-diagnostic dimensions</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals develop remarkable behavioral specializations for identifying, differentiating, and acting on classes of ecologically important signals. Ultimately, this expertise is flexible enough to support diverse perceptual judgments: a voice, for example, simultaneously conveys what a talker says as well as myriad cues about her identity and state. Mature perception across complex signals thus involves both discovering and learning regularities that best inform diverse perceptual judgments, and weighting this information flexibly as task demands change. Here, we test whether this flexibility may involve endogenous attentional gain to task-relevant dimensions. We use two prospective auditory category learning tasks to relate a complex, entirely novel soundscape to four classes of ''alien identity'' and two classes of ''alien size. '' Identity, but not size, categorization requires discovery and learning of patterned acoustic input situated in one of two simultaneous, frequency-delimited bands. This allows us to capitalize on the coarsely segregated frequency-band-specific channels of auditory tonotopic maps using fMRI to ask whether category-relevant perceptual information is prioritized relative to simultaneous, uninformative information. Among participants expert at alien identity categorization, we observe prioritization of the diagnostic frequency band that persists even when the diagnostic information becomes irrelevant in the size categorization task. Tellingly, the neural selectivity evoked implicitly in categorization aligns closely with activation driven by explicit, sustained selective attention to other sounds presented in the same frequency band. Additionally, we observe fingerprints of individual differences in the learning trajectories taken to achieve expert-level categorization in patterns of neural activity associated with the diagnostic dimension. In all, this indicates that acquiring categories can drive the emergence of acquired attentional salience to dimensions of acoustic input.

">Cholinergic Neuronal Activity Promotes Diffuse Midline Glioma Growth through Muscarinic Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity promotes the proliferation of healthy oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) and their malignant counterparts, gliomas. Many gliomas arise from and closely resemble oligodendroglial lineage precursors, including diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a cancer affecting midline structures such as the thalamus, brainstem and spinal cord. In DMG, glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal activity promotes progression through both paracrine signaling and through bona-fide neuron-to-glioma synapses. However, the putative roles of other neuronal subpopulations - especially neuromodulatory neurons located in the brainstem that project to long-range target sites in midline anatomical locations where DMGs arise - remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of cholinergic midbrain neurons modulates both healthy OPC and malignant DMG proliferation in a circuit-specific manner at sites of long-range cholinergic projections. Optogenetic stimulation of the cholinergic pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) promotes glioma growth in pons, while stimulation of the laterodorsal tegmentum nucleus (LDT) facilitates proliferation in thalamus, consistent with the predominant projection patterns of each cholinergic midbrain nucleus. Reciprocal signaling was evident, as increased activity of cholinergic neurons in the PPN and LDT was observed in pontine DMG-bearing mice. In co-culture, hiPSC-derived cholinergic neurons form neuron-to-glioma networks with DMG cells and robustly promote proliferation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed prominent expression of the muscarinic receptor genes CHRM1 and CHRM3 in primary patient DMG samples, particularly enriched in the OPC-like tumor subpopulation. Acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter cholinergic neurons release, exerts a direct effect on DMG tumor cells, promoting increased proliferation and invasion through muscarinic receptors. Pharmacological blockade of M1 and M3 acetylcholine receptors abolished the activity-regulated increase in DMG proliferation in cholinergic neuron-glioma co-culture and in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that midbrain cholinergic neuron long-range projections to midline structures promote activity-dependent DMG growth through M1 and M3 cholinergic receptors, mirroring a parallel proliferative effect on healthy OPCs.

">The ER stress transcription factor Luman/CREB3 is a novel regulator of Schwann cell survival and myelinating capacity through the activation of the unfolded protein response and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways</a></h4>

              
                Misfolded protein accumulation in demyelinating disorders or injury can trigger internal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress alleviation mechanisms, namely the unfolded protein response (UPR) and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. Here we demonstrate that the ER stress-associated transcription factor Luman/CREB3, herein called Luman, shown to drive axon regeneration by UPR-dependent regulation of adaptive low-level stress, also positively regulates rat Schwann cell (SC) survival, myelination, the UPR, and cholesterol production in vitro. siRNA knockdown of SC Luman expression decreased SC viability and increased apoptosis 48 hours post-transfection. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron/SC co-cultures where SCs overexpressed Luman exhibited increased myelination. Simulation of unstressed, mild and moderate ER stress by tunicamycin mediated UPR induction in SCs, allowed examination of Luman on expression of known UPR regulators, including Xbp1, Xbp1s, CHOP, and pIRE1. They collectively demonstrate a cytoprotective role for Luman under manageable ER stress. Total cholesterol levels and sterol precursor Srebf1 expression, key to myelination, also decreased following Luman knockdown. Finally, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF), a positive regulator of myelination and also regulated by the UPR, decreased with Luman knockdown. In contrast, proapoptotic BDNF precursor (proBDNF) levels increased in Luman-deficient SCs at higher ER stress levels, indicating that any protection Luman confers at moderate ER stress levels is lost upon its reduced expression. In conclusion, a connection between Luman and adaptive beneficial ER stress pathways linked to survival and myelination capacity in SCs exists. These Luman-driven cytoprotective mechanisms including survival and myelination open avenues for targeting this pathway in nerve trauma and myelinating disorders.

">Rational inattention in neural coding for economic choice</a></h4>

              
                Mental operations like computing the value of an option are computationally expensive. Even before we evaluate options, we must decide how much attentional effort to invest in the evaluation process. More precise evaluation will improve choice accuracy, and thus reward yield, but the gain may not justify the cost. Rational Inattention theories provide an accounting of the internal economics of attentionally effortful economic decisions. To understand this process, we examined choices and neural activity in several brain regions in six macaques making risky choices. We extended the rational inattention framework to incorporate the foraging theoretic understanding of local environmental richness or reward rate, which we predict will promote attentional effort. Consistent with this idea, we found local reward rate positively predicted choice accuracy. Supporting the hypothesis that this effect reflects variations in attentional effort, richer contexts were associated with increased baseline and evoked pupil size. Neural populations likewise showed systematic baseline coding of reward rate context. During increased reward rate contexts, ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex showed both an increase in value decodability and a rotation in the population geometries for value. This confluence of these results suggests a mechanism of attentional effort that operates by controlling gain through using partially distinct population codes for value. Additionally, increased reward rate accelerated value code dynamics, which have been linked to improved signal-to-noise. These results extend the theory of rational inattention to static and stationary contexts and align theories of rational inattention with specific costly, neural processes.

">Neural geometry efficiently representing abstract form of value and modality in the primate basal ganglia</a></h4>

              
                Basal ganglia process diverse values from various modalities using limited resources, necessitating efficient processing. This involves converging tactile and visual information within bimodal value-coding neurons, ensuring efficient processing with limited number of neurons. However, convergence at the single neuron level may compromise modality-specific information, raising the question: Does efficient processing inevitably degrade information quality? We investigated the representational geometry in the putamen of macaque monkeys trained to learn values from tactile and visual inputs. Here, we demonstrated that the population representation of bimodal value-coding neurons in the putamen preserved both value and modality information, and these representations were shared to efficiently maintain quality. Notably, these representations were generalized across identical modalities and values, resulting in an efficient low-dimensional representation. Furthermore, a faster transformation to a generalized value representation within neural geometry reflected greater confidence in value-guided choice behavior-this correlation not observed in conventional decoding. Our results suggest that bimodal value-coding neurons play a key role in balancing efficiency and information fidelity, facilitating cognitive states required for confident decision-making.

">Widespread brain activity increases in frontal lobe seizures with impaired consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Impaired consciousness is a serious clinical manifestation of epilepsy with negative consequences on quality of life. Little work has investigated impaired consciousness in frontal lobe seizures, a common form of focal epilepsy. In temporal lobe seizures, previous studies showed widespread cortical slow waves associated with depressed subcortical arousal and impaired consciousness. However, in frontal lobe epilepsy, it is not known whether cortical slow waves are present, or whether a very different cortical activity pattern may be related to impaired consciousness. We used intracranial EEG recordings of 65 frontal lobe seizures in 30 patients for quantitative analysis of ictal cortical activity and its relationship to impaired consciousness. Behavioral changes based on blinded review of seizure videos were used to classify focal aware, focal impaired awareness, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Changes in intracranial EEG power from preictal baseline were analyzed in different cortical regions and across frequency ranges in these three categories. We found that frontal lobe focal aware seizures showed approximately 40% increases in intracranial EEG power localized to the frontal lobe of seizure onset across frequency ranges, with relatively smaller changes in other cortical regions. Frontal lobe focal impaired awareness seizures showed approximately 50% increases in intracranial EEG power, not significantly different from focal aware seizures in the frontal lobe of seizure onset (P = 1.038), but significantly greater than focal aware seizures in other broad cortical regions (P < 0.001). Importantly, the widespread cortical increases in EEG power observed in focal impaired awareness versus focal aware seizures were seen not just in the frequency range of slow waves, but were also observed across other frequencies including fast activity. However, the widespread cortical increases in focal impaired awareness seizures differed from focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures where intracranial EEG power increased to a much higher level by approximately 600%. The large power increases in focal to bilateral tonic-clonic were significantly greater than in focal impaired awareness seizures both in the frontal lobe of seizure onset and in other cortical regions (P < 0.001). Our findings contrast with focal temporal lobe epilepsy, where impaired consciousness is associated with cortical slow waves. We can speculate that different focal seizure types produce impaired consciousness by impacting widespread cortical regions but through different physiological mechanisms. Insights gained by studying mechanisms of impaired consciousness may be the first step towards developing novel treatments to prevent this important negative consequence of epilepsy.

">Musicianship modulates cortical (but not brainstem) effects of attention on processing musical triads</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many studies have demonstrated benefits of long-term music training (i.e., musicianship) on the neural processing of sound, including simple tones and speech. However, the effects of musicianship on the encoding of simultaneously presented pitches, in the form of complex musical chords, is less well-established. Presumably, musicians' stronger familiarity and active experience with tonal music might enhance harmonic pitch representations, perhaps in an attention-dependent manner. Additionally, attention might influence chordal encoding differently across the auditory system. To this end, we explored the effects of long-term music training and attention on processing of musical chords at brainstem and cortical levels. Method: Young adult participants were separated into musician and nonmusician groups based on extent of formal music training. While recording EEG, listeners heard isolated musical triads that differed only in the chordal third: major, minor, and detuned (4% sharper third from major). Participants were asked to correctly identify chords via key press during active stimulus blocks and watched a silent movie during passive blocks. We logged behavioral identification accuracy and reaction times and calculated information transfer based on the behavioral chord confusion patterns. EEG data were analyzed separately to distinguish between cortical (event-related potential, ERP) and subcortical (frequency-following response, FFR) evoked responses. Results: We found musicians were (expectedly) more accurate, though not faster, than nonmusicians in chordal identification. For subcortical FFRs, responses showed stimulus chord effects but no group differences. However, for cortical ERPs, whereas musicians displayed P2 (~150 ms) responses that were invariant to attention, nonmusicians displayed earlier and reduced P2 during passive listening. Listeners' degree of behavioral information transfer (i.e., success in distinguishing chords) was also better in musicians and correlated with their neural differentiation of chords, assessed via pairwise differences in the ERPs. Conclusions: Our data suggest long-term music training strengthens even the passive cortical processing of musical sounds, supporting more automated brain processing of musical chords with less reliance on attention. Our results also suggest the degree to which listeners can behaviorally distinguish chordal triads is directly related to their neural specificity to musical sounds primarily at cortical rather than subcortical levels.

">Traumatic Brain Injury Exacerbates Alcohol Consumption and Neuroinflammation with Decline in Cognition and Cholinergic Activity</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health challenge, responsible for 30% of injury-related deaths and significantly contributing to disability. Annually, over 50 million TBIs occur worldwide, with most adult patients at emergency departments showing alcohol in their system. TBI is also a known risk factor for alcohol abuse, yet its interaction with alcohol consumption remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the fluid percussion injury (FPI) model of TBI in mice significantly increases alcohol consumption and impairs cognitive function. At cellular levels, FPI markedly reduced the number and activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) while increasing microglial cells. Notably, depleting microglial cells provided neuroprotection, mitigating cholinergic loss and enhancing cholinergic activity. These findings suggest that TBI may promote alcohol consumption and impair cognitive abilities through microglia activation and consequently reduced cholinergic function. Our research provides critical insights into the mechanisms linking TBI with increased alcohol use and cognitive deficits, potentially guiding future therapeutic strategies.

">Distinct Neural Representations of Hunger and Thirst in Neonatal Mice before the Emergence of Food- and Water-seeking Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Hunger and thirst are two fundamental drives for maintaining homeostasis, and elicit distinct food- and water-seeking behaviors essential for survival. For neonatal mammals, however, both hunger and thirst are sated by consuming milk from their mother. While distinct neural circuits underlying hunger and thirst drives in the adult brain have been characterized, it is unclear when these distinctions emerge in neonates and what processes may affect their development. Here we show that hypothalamic hunger and thirst regions already exhibit specific responses to starvation and dehydration well before a neonatal mouse can seek food and water separately. At this early age, hunger drives feeding behaviors more than does thirst. Within neonatal regions that respond to both hunger and thirst, subpopulations of neurons respond distinctly to one or the other need. Combining food and water into a liquid diet throughout the animal's life does not alter the distinct representations of hunger and thirst in the adult brain. Thus, neural representations of hunger and thirst become distinct before food- and water-seeking behaviors mature and are robust to environmental changes in food and water sources.

">Whole-brain dynamics and hormonal shifts throughout women's lifespan: From reproductive stages to menopausal transition and beyond</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies have identified significant age-related disruptions in whole-brain dynamics, yet the influence of women's reproductive stages and associated hormonal shifts remains underexplored. This study leverages resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project in Aging to examine brain dynamics through five reproductive stages: reproductive, late reproductive, perimenopause, early postmenopause, and late postmenopause. Our results indicate that the late reproductive stage is characterized by the highest dynamical complexity across whole-brain and resting-state networks, while brain dynamics significantly decline at menopause onset. Additionally, we employ machine learning classifiers using two approaches: (1) brain dynamics alone and (2) brain dynamics combined with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (brain-hormone model). Both models accurately distinguished reproductive stages, but the brain-hormone model outperformed the brain dynamics model. Key predictors included decreased estradiol, increased FSH, and altered brain dynamics in later life stages. These results offer a framework for assessing brain health across women's reproductive lifespan.

">Congruent brain signatures specific to speech sounds in fronto-temporal cortex during language production and understanding.</a></h4>

              
                In this fMRI study we investigated whether language production and understanding recruit the same phoneme-specific networks. We did so by comparing the brain response to different phoneme categories in minimal pairs: Bilabial-initial words (e.g., monkey) were contrasted to alveolar-initial words (e.g., donkey) in 37 participants performing both language production and perception tasks. Region-of-Interest analyses showed that the same sensori-motor networks were activated across the language modalities. In motor regions, word production and comprehension elicited the same phoneme-specific topographical activity patterns, with stronger haemodynamic activations for alveolar-initial words in the tongue cortex and stronger activations for bilabial-initial words in the lip cortex. In the posterior and middle superior temporal cortex, production and comprehension likewise resulted in similar activity patterns, with enhanced activations to alveolar- compared to bilabial-initial words. These results disagree with the classical separation between speech production and understanding in neurobiological models of language, and instead advocate for a cortical organization where the same phoneme-specific acoustic-and-articulatory representations carry language production and understanding.

">Olfactory and Trigeminal Routes of HSV-1 CNS Infection with Regional Microglial Heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) primarily targets the oral and nasal epithelia before establishing latency in the trigeminal and other peripheral ganglia (TG). HSV-1 can also infect and go latent in the central nervous system (CNS) independent of latency in the TGs. Recent studies suggest entry to the CNS via two distinct routes: the TG-brainstem connection and olfactory nerve; however, to date, there is no characterization of brain regions targeted during HSV-1 primary infection. Furthermore, the immune response by microglia may also contribute to the heterogeneity between different brain regions. However, the response to HSV-1 by microglia has not been characterized in a region-specific manner. This study investigated the time course of HSV-1 spread within the olfactory epithelium (OE) and CNS following intranasal inoculation and the corresponding macrophage/microglial response in a C57BL/6 mouse model. We found an apical to basal spread of HSV-1 within the OE and underlying tissue accompanied by an inflammatory response of macrophages. OE Infection was followed by infection of a small subset of brain regions targeted by the TG in the brainstem, as well as other cranial nerve nuclei, including the vagus and hypoglossal nerve. Furthermore, other brain regions were positive for HSV-1 antigens, such as the locus coeruleus (LC), raphe nucleus (RaN), and hypothalamus, while sparing the hippocampus and cortex. Within each brain region, microglia activation also varied widely. These findings provide critical insights into the region-specific dissemination of HSV-1 within the CNS, elucidating potential mechanisms linking viral infection to neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Effects of sensorimotor delays and muscle force capacity limits on the performance of feedforward and feedback control in animals of different sizes</a></h4>

              
                Animals rely on both feedforward and feedback control for perturbation responses. When comparing animals of different sizes, we find that several features that affect perturbation responses change - larger animals have longer sensorimotor time delays, heavier body segments and proportionally weaker muscles. We used simple computational models to compare fast perturbation response times under feedforward and feedback control, as a function of animal size. We developed two tasks representing common perturbation response scenarios in animal locomotion: a distributed mass pendulum approximating swing limb repositioning (swing task), and an inverted pendulum approximating whole body posture recovery (posture task). First, we used a normalized feedback control system to show how feedback response times can either be limited by the force generation capacity of muscles (force-limited), or by sensorimotor delays which constrain the maximum feedback gains that can be used to produce stable responses (delay-limited). Next, we used more detailed scaled models which represent the full-size range of terrestrial mammals and parameterized the sensorimotor delays, maximum muscle forces, and inertial properties using published scaling relationships from literature. Across animal size and in both tasks, we found that feedback control was primarily delay-limited - the fastest responses used a fraction of the available muscle force capacity. Feedforward control, which is able to fully activate muscles and produce faster responses - was about four times faster than feedback control in the smallest animals, and around two times faster in the largest animals. For rapid perturbation responses, feedback control appears ineffective for terrestrial mammals of all sizes, as the fastest response times exceeded available movement times, while feedforward control did not. Thus, feedforward control is more effective for reacting quickly to sudden and large perturbations in animals of all sizes.

">PHluorin-conjugated secondary nanobodies as a tool for measuring synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal communication relies on synaptic vesicle recycling, which has long been investigated by live imaging approaches. Synapto-pHluorins, genetically encoded reporters that incorporate a pH-sensitive variant of GFP within the lumen of the synaptic vesicle, have been especially popular. However, they require genetic manipulation, implying that a tool combining their excellent reporter properties with the ease of use of classical immunolabeling would be desirable. We introduce this tool here, relying on primary antibodies against the luminal domain of synaptotagmin 1, decorated with secondary single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) carrying a pHluorin moiety. The application of the antibodies and nanobodies to cultured neurons results in labeling their recycling vesicles, without the need for any additional manipulations. The labeled vesicles respond to stimulation, in the expected fashion, and the pHluorin signals enable the quantification of both exo- and endocytosis. We conclude that pHluorin-conjugated secondary nanobodies are a convenient tool for the analysis of vesicle recycling.

">Natural variations of adult neurogenesis and anxiety predict hierarchical status of inbred mice</a></h4>

              
                Hierarchy provides a survival advantage to social animals in challenging circumstances. In mice, social dominance is associated with trait anxiety and reduced stress resilience which are regulated by adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we tested whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis may regulate social dominance behavior. We observed that future dominant individuals exhibited higher trait anxiety and lower levels of hippocampal neurogenesis prior to social hierarchy formation, suggesting that baseline neurogenesis might predict individual social status among a group. This phenotype persisted after social hierarchy was stable. Experimentally reducing neurogenesis prior to the stabilization of social hierarchy in group-housed males increased the probability of mice to become dominant and increased anxiety. Finally, when innate dominance was assessed in socially isolated and anxiety-matched animals, mice with impaired neurogenesis displayed a dominant status toward strangers. Together, these results indicate that adult neurogenesis predicts and regulates hierarchical and situational dominance behavior along with anxiety-related behavior. These results provide a framework to study the mechanisms underlying social hierarchy and the dysregulation of dominance behavior in psychiatric diseases related to anxiety.

">Mouse PAW: reverse-translating the FINGER multimodal lifestyle intervention enhances synaptic plasticity and cognition in adult wild type female mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Targeting multiple risk factors through preventive interventions can halt the onset or progression of dementia. The clinical efficacy of this approach was shown in the multimodal FINGER trial, yet knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms is limited. In the current study, we applied for the first time a multimodal lifestyle intervention in mice to study effects on cognition and associated molecular pathways. Methods: We have established a novel experimental model, the lifestyle intervention PAW (Prevention of Alzheimer's by a Multimodal Lifestyle Protocol - Working-mechanisms for Memory Gains) in mice. In this model, we combined different modalities of intervention aiming to achieve synergistic effects. The animals were given access to running wheels (voluntary exercise), Fortasyn Connect (a medical food that slows disease progression in early Alzheimer's disease), and they were subjected to cognitive training in an IntelliCage environment (PAW group). To separately investigate the effects of pharmacological vascular management as a preventive measure, another group of mice was given Atorvastatin and Enalapril (cholesterol and blood pressure lowering pharmaceuticals, respectively) dosed in the diet (Pharma group). Control mice were housed in normal conditions. We included 12 wild type C57BL/6J female mice 6.5 months of age per group. The full intervention lasted for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and the end of the intervention. All mice underwent a battery of behavioural testing after the eight weeks of intervention. Hippocampi were dissected for proteomics analysis. Results: During the intervention, the PAW group actively participated in the intervention by learning the different cognitive training programs and by using the running wheels. At the end of the intervention, the PAW group showed a lowering of blood pressure to a similar extent as in the Pharma group (systolic 158 mmHg to 139 mmHg, p = 0.003, and 163 mmHg to 136 mmHg, p = 0.042, respectively). Furthermore, the PAW group displayed a better short-term spatial working memory compared to the control group as assessed by the spontaneous alternation in the Y maze test (66.5% and 56.7%, respectively, p = 0.036). Proteomic analysis of the hippocampi and downstream bioinformatic analysis revealed that several pathways were upregulated in the PAW mice including synaptogenesis (Z = 4.27, p = 1.26E-18) and glutamate binding, activation of AMPA receptors and synaptic plasticity (Z = 3.74, p = 3.16E-19). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the PAW model effectively mimics the clinical effects of multimodal lifestyle dementia prevention, and further demonstrates the activation of hippocampal-specific molecular drivers of memory gains.

Here, we present "Twinkle": a microscope for Two-photon Imaging in Neuroscience, and Kit for Learning and Education. It is a fully open, high-performance and cost-effective research and teaching microscope without any custom parts beyond what can be fabricated in a university machine shop. The instrument features a large field of view, using a modern objective with a long working distance and large back aperture to maximize the fluorescence signal. We document our experiences using this system as a teaching tool in several two week long workshops, exemplify scientific use cases, and conclude with a broader note on the place of our work in the growing space of open-source scientific instrumentation.

                Deletion of the SAPAP3 gene in mice results in a characteristic phenotype that manifests from the age of 4-6 months and consists of repetitive bouts of self-grooming, head-body twitches, and anxiety-related behaviors. The phenotype is attenuated by sub-chronic fluoxetine and by single injections of ketamine and psilocybin and is considered a model for OCD. We investigated the premorbid characteristics of SAPAP3 knockout (SAPAP3-KO) mice. Two cohorts of juvenile SAPAP3-KO mice (aged 10-13 weeks) were assessed for anxiety and other behavioral phenotypes. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, male and female homozygous SAPAP3-KO mice manifested significant anxiety-like behaviors in the open field and elevated plus maze tests, reduced marble burying, and altered performance on the buried Oreo test. These behaviors were not alleviated by psilocybin treatment. Adult male SAPAP3-KO mice showed increased levels of synaptic proteins (GAP43, synaptophysin, and SV2A) in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, while adult female SAPAP3-KO mice showed increased SV2A in the frontal cortex. These findings suggest enhanced synaptic growth and vesicle-associated plasticity in adult SAPAP3-KO mice that may reflect a compensatory mechanism. Increased synaptic proteins were not observed in juvenile mice, suggesting age-dependent alterations in neuroplasticity. Our finding that SAPAP3-KO mice exhibit anxiety-like behaviors before the onset of compulsive grooming is analogous to prodromal anxiety observed in patients with OCD. The study provides a basis for further research into the development of OCD-like behaviors and associated neuroplasticity changes and for studying potential treatments.

">The Visual Experience Evaluation Tool: A Myopia Research Instrument for Quantifying Visual Experience</a></h4>

              
                Current myopia research has demonstrated the role of extended visual experience in healthy ocular development. Optical cues and the spectrum, intensity, and temporal characteristics of light landing on the retina are all known factors affecting the development of the eye. However, there is still limited understanding as to which of these extrinsic factors are most important or how they interplay with intrinsic physical and neural differences between individuals. Part of the problem is inadequate tooling. Our team at Reality Labs Research created the Visual Environment Evaluation Tool (VEET), a non-commercial research instrument, to accelerate myopia research. In this paper, we describe the VEET's physical design, sensor suite and capabilities, and the associated software which makes it well-suited for research of quantified visual experience.

">Examination of low-intensity focused ultrasound parameters for human neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a promising form of non-invasive neuromodulation characterized by a rich parameter space that includes intensity, duration, duty cycle and pulsing strategy. The effect and interaction of these parameters to affect human brain activity is poorly understood. A better understanding of how parameters interact is critical to advance LIFU as a potential therapeutic. Objective/Hypothesis: To determine how different parameters, including intensity, duration, and duty cycle interact to produce neuromodulation effects in the human brain. Further, this study assesses the effect of pulsing versus continuous ultrasound. We hypothesize that higher duty cycles will confer excitation. Increasing intensity or duration will increase the magnitude of effect. Pulsing LIFU will not be more effective than continuous wave ultrasound. Methods: N = 18 healthy human volunteers underwent 20 different parameter combinations that included a fully parametrized set of two intensities (ISPPA: 6 & 24 W/cm2), five duty cycles (1, 10, 30, 50, 70%) and two durations (100, 500 msec) with a constant pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz delivered concurrently with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the primary motor cortex (M1). Four of these parameter combinations were also delivered continuously, matched on the number of cycles. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude was the primary outcome measure. All parameter combinations were collected time-locked to MEP generation. Results: There was no evidence of excitation from any parameter combination. 3 of the 24 parameter sets resulted in inhibition. The parameter set that resulted in the greatest inhibition (~ 30%) was an intensity of 6W/cm2 with a duty cycle of 30% and a duration of 500 msec. A three-way ANOVA revealed an interaction of intensity and duty cycle. The analysis of continuous versus pulsed ultrasound revealed a 3-way interaction of intensity, pulsing, and the number of cycles such that under the 6W/cm2 condition higher cycles of pulsed ultrasound resulted in inhibition whereas lower number of cycles using continuous LIFU resulted in inhibition. Conclusions: LIFU to M1 in humans, in the range employed, either conferred inhibition or had no effect. Significant excitation was not observed. In general, lower intensity looks to be more efficacious for inhibition that depends on duration. Finally, pulsed ultrasound looks to be more effective for inhibition as compared to continuous wave after controlling for total energy delivered.

">Tau P301S Transgenic Mice Develop Gait and Eye Movement Impairments That Mimic Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</a></h4>

              
                Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an estimated prevalence of 5-7 people in 100,000. Clinically characterized by impairments in gait, balance, and eye movements, as well as aggregated Tau pathology, PSP leads to death in approximately 5-8 years. No disease-modifying treatments are currently available. The contribution of Tau pathology to the symptoms of patients with PSP is poorly understood, in part due to lack of a rodent model that recapitulates characteristic aspects of PSP. Here, we assessed the hTau.P301S mouse for key clinical features of PSP, finding progressive impairments in balance and gait coordination. Additionally, we found impairments in fast vertical eye movements, one of the most distinctive features of PSP. Across animals, we found that Tau pathology in motor control regions correlated with motor deficits. These findings highlight the utility of the hP301S mouse in modeling key aspects of PSP.

">Constructing a Mouse Brain Atlas of Dendritic Microenvironments Helps Discover Hidden Associations Between Anatomical Layout, Projection Targets and Transcriptomic Profiles of Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Digital brain atlases have become essential anatomical references for understanding the spatial and functional organization of brains. For mice, typical resources include the Allen Reference Atlas, the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF), and their variants, like CCFv3. However, previous whole-brain atlases were constructed based on limited neuronal features, such as cell body (soma) density or average maps from collections of registered brain images, without considering the spatial organization of neuronal arbors. This study introduces a microenvironment representation that incorporates the morphological features of neighboring neurons to better quantify brain modularity. We generated a large dataset containing dendrites from 101,136 neurons across 111 mouse brains, covering 91% of non-ventricular, non-fiber-tract CCF regions, and constructed a multidimensional microenvironment feature map of the whole brain. Our findings reveal that the spatial organization of these microenvironments outperforms the CCFv3 and a state-of-the-art spatial transcriptomic cell atlas by providing complementary subregions within established regions, nearly doubling the total number of brain regions compared to CCFv3. In this way, our atlas enables the identification of previously unobserved neuron groupings or "subtypes". Our results also demonstrate that this microenvironment atlas enhances local spatial homogeneity while maintaining spatial differentiation within established CCF brain regions. For example, we found that the microenvironments of hippocampal neurons are correlated with axonal projection targets and improve the specificity of projection mapping, which implies the potential characterization of long-range axonal projections of mammalian neurons based on only local dendritic organization. The sub-parcellation of the caudoputamen (CP) aligns well with previous studies on projections, connectivity, and transcriptomics, revealing diverse input and output wiring patterns among CP subregions.

">Bridging the gap between the connectome and whole-brain activity in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental goal of neuroscience is to understand how anatomy determines the functional properties of the nervous system. However, it has been challenging to relate large-scale functional measurements of the C. elegans nervous system to the worm's known anatomical connectome1-3. Here, we address this apparent discrepancy using a connectome-constrained model of the nematode brain fit to neural recordings with optogenetic perturbations2. Our model consists of a noisy linear dynamical system with a sparse synaptic weight matrix with non-zero entries only where there are synapses in the C. elegans connectome. We evaluated the model by perturbing neurons in silico and measuring the perturbation response of all other neurons in the network. We compared these responses to those measured in held-out animals and found that this model captured the perturbation-triggered responses of individual neurons 92% as well as the reproducibility of the perturbation responses themselves. This includes perturbation responses of neurons that were not anatomically connected, which the model explains in terms of signal propagation over multiple neurons. In addition to capturing perturbation responses, the model also accurately predicts the activity of held-out neurons using the observed activity of other neurons. Strikingly, alternative models with equivalent levels of sparsity but a shuffled connectome constraint achieved much lower performance. Finally, we demonstrate that adding connections beyond those found in the connectome did not improve the model's prediction of the perturbation measurements. The model described here provides the strongest link yet between the connectivity of the C. elegans nervous system and its causal and correlative functional properties.

">PointTree: Automatic and accurate reconstruction of long-range axonal projections of single-neuron</a></h4>

              
                Single-neuron axonal projections reveal the route map of neuron output and provide a key cue for understanding how information flows across the brain. Reconstruction of single-neuron axonal projections requires intensive manual operations in tens of terabytes of brain imaging data, and is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. The main issue lies in the need for precise reconstruction algorithms to avoid reconstruction errors, yet current methods struggle with densely distributed axons, focusing mainly on skeleton extraction. To overcome this, we introduce a point assignment-based method that uses cylindrical point sets to accurately represent axons and a minimal information flow tree model to suppress the snowball effect of reconstruction errors. Our method successfully reconstructs single-neuron axonal projections across hundreds of GBs images with an average of 80% F1-score, while current methods only provide less than 40% F1-score reconstructions from a few hundred MBs images. This huge improvement is helpful for high-throughput mapping of neuron projections.

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, mainly affecting elderly individuals. AD is characterized by &amp;amp;beta;-amyloid plaques, abnormal tau tangles, neuronal loss, and metabolic disruptions. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of the kynurenine (KP) pathway and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in AD development. The KP pathway metabolizes tryptophan to produce neuroactive substances like kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and quinolinic acid. In AD, high levels of kynurenine and the neurotoxic quinolinic acid are associated with increased neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity; conversely, reduced levels of kynurenic acid, which acts as a glutamate receptor antagonist, compromise neuroprotection. Research has indicated elevated KP metabolites and enzymes in the hippocampus of AD patients and other tissues such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine. However, the finding that KP metabolites are AD biomarkers in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine has been controversial. This controversy, stemming from the lack of consideration of the specific stage of AD, details of the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s treatment, cognitive deficits, and psychiatric comorbidities, underscores the need for more comprehensive research. AhR, a ligand-activated transcription factor, regulates immune response, oxidative stress, and xenobiotic metabolism. Various ligands, including tryptophan metabolites, can activate it. Some studies suggest that AhR activation contributes to AD, while others propose that it provides neuroprotection. This discrepancy may be explained by the specific ligands that activate AhR, highlighting the complex relationship between the KP pathway, AhR activation, and AD, where the same pathway can produce both neuroprotective and harmful effects.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In the past two decades, significant advancements in neuromodulation techniques have occurred, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). According to the assumption that repeated stimulation within a condensed timeframe can yield sustained efficacy, an accelerated protocol may be more effective in reducing time to response. With those premises, this study aimed to evaluate a sample of TRD patients treated with standard repetitive TMS (rTMS) and accelerated rTMS (arTMS). Methods: Nine subjects were treated with standard rTMS and 19 with arTMS. Psychometric assessment was made at the baseline and one week, one month, and three months after the treatment. A linear mixed-effect regression was performed along with other appropriate statistical analyses. Results: A significant improvement over time was observed for both depressive and cognitive symptoms. Moreover, considering the reduction in the Montgomery&amp;amp;ndash;Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores, a better treatment response was observed in subjects treated with arTMS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings showed a significant difference between the two protocols in terms of clinical response. Although further studies are needed to confirm the superiority of arTMS, the better cost-effectiveness of this technique should be considered.</p>

	<p>Background: The advent of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway has transformed the management of migraine, offering newfound optimism for clinicians and individuals with episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided crucial insights into the effectiveness and safety profiles of these treatments, their translation into real-world clinical practice remains a challenge. Objective: This review aims to conduct a comprehensive assessment of real-world studies, offering valuable insights tailored for practical application in clinical settings. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE for real-life studies on erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. Abstracts underwent rigorous screening by two reviewers for relevance. Data extraction from selected articles was performed using a standardized form, with verification by a second reviewer. Data synthesis was narrative, following PRISMA guidelines. Results: Our search included 61 pertinent studies conducted between 2019 and 1 March 2024. Real-world study designs demonstrated notable variability in the selection and inclusion of migraine patients, influenced by factors such as attack frequency, data collection criteria, and primary/secondary objectives. Key findings commonly reported considerable improvements in efficacy outcomes (migraine frequency, analgesic use, pain severity, and disability), high responder rates, and optimal safety and tolerability profiles. Conclusions: Real-world evidence underscores the role of anti-CGRP mAbs as targeted therapies for both CM and EM patients. The overall results indicate that the effectiveness and tolerability of anti-CGRP mAbs in real-world applications may exceed those observed in RCTs, an extraordinary finding in clinical neurology.</p>

	<p>Background: Musculoskeletal pain is a leading cause of medical visits, posing significant challenges both socially and economically, encouraging the scientific community to continue researching and exploring the most effective methods to address the problem. An alternative way to deal with chronic pain is pain neuroscience education (PNE), a lesson plan that addresses the neurobiology, neurophysiology, and nervous system processing of pain. This method takes the place of the conventional one, which connected pain to tissue damage or nociception. Results: As a result, patients are taught that pain is often not a reliable measure of the health of the tissues but rather the outcome of the nervous system interpreting the injury in conjunction with additional psychosocial variables. In addition to finding research that examine, using neuroimaging, whether the administration of PNE has detectable effects at the level of the central nervous system, this narrative review seeks to clarify what PNE is, how it is administered, and if it is an effective treatment for musculoskeletal pain. Conclusions: Based on the findings, it appears that PNE is more therapeutically beneficial when combined with therapeutic exercise, when done one-on-one, and during lengthy, frequent sessions. Lastly, even though PNE has no effect on the morphological properties of the gray matter, it appears to cause decreased activation of the regions linked to pain.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the entorhinal cortex (EC), attempts have been made to identify the human homologue regions of the medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subregions using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a confined border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct whole-brain connectivity profiles. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.</p>

<p>

PTZ-induced seizures caused short-term changes in glial gene expression, with more significant alterations observed in astroglial genes compared to microglial genes.

The changes were directed toward the neuroprotective profile of A2 cell activation.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Astrocytes and microglia can adopt two distinct phenotypes in various pathological processes: neurotoxic A1/M1 and neuroprotective A2/M2. Recent evidence suggests that these cells play a significant role in epileptogenesis. The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotype of astrocytes and microglial cells in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of young male Wistar rats at 3 h, 1, 3, and 7 days after pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. RT-qPCR was employed to examine the expression of glial genes (<i>Gfap</i>, <i>Aif1</i>, <i>Slc1a1</i>, <i>Slc1a2</i>, <i>Slc1a3</i>, <i>Itpr2</i>, <i>Gdnf</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Fgf2</i>, <i>Tgfb</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Tnf</i>, <i>Il1rn</i>, <i>Lcn2</i>, <i>S100a10</i>, <i>Nlrp3</i>, <i>Arg1</i>). The most notable alterations in the expression of glial genes were observed on the first day following seizures in the temporal cortex. An increase in the expression of the <i>Gfap</i>, <i>Slc1a2</i>, <i>Slc1a1</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Tnfa</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, and <i>Fgf2</i> genes, and the A2 astrocyte condition marker <i>S100a10</i>, was observed. An increase in the expression of the <i>Gfap</i> and <i>Slc1a2</i> genes was observed in the hippocampus on the first day after seizures. However, in contrast to the changes observed in the cortex, the changes in the hippocampus were opposite for the <i>Il1rn</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Tgfb</i>, and <i>Arg1</i> genes. Nevertheless, the alterations in GFAP and EAAT2 protein levels were not corroborated by Western blot analysis. Conversely, a more comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis confirmed an augmentation in the number of GFAP-positive cells in the hippocampus 1 day after seizures. Based on the presented evidence, we can conclude that a single convulsive seizure episode in 3-week-old rats results in transient astroglial activation and polarization to a neuroprotective phenotype (A2).</p>

                Chronic stress and the accompanying long-term elevation of glucocorticoids (GCs), the stress hormones of the body, increase the risk and accelerate the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Signatures of AD include intracellular tau (MAPT) tangles, extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, and neuroinflammation. A growing body of work indicates that stress and GCs initiate cellular processes underlying these pathologies through dysregulation of protein homeostasis and trafficking, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and response to damage-associated stimuli. In this review, we integrate findings from mechanistic studies in rodent and cellular models, wherein defined chronic stress protocols or GC administration have been shown to elicit AD-related pathology. We specifically discuss the effects of chronic stress and GCs on tau pathogenesis, including hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, and spreading, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and trafficking culminating in Aβ production, immune priming by proinflammatory cytokines and disease-associated molecular patterns, and alterations to glial cell and blood–brain barrier (BBB) function.

                Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) neuroscience research is rapidly expanding, the fundamental question of how these fish should be maintained in research laboratories remains largely unstudied. This may explain the diverse practices and broad range of environmental parameters used in zebrafish facilities. Here, we provide examples of these parameters and practices, including housing density, tank size, and water chemistry. We discuss the principles of stochastic resonance versus homeostasis and provide hypothetical examples to explain why keeping zebrafish outside of their tolerated range of environmental parameters may increase phenotypical variance and reduce replicability. We call for systematic studies to establish the optimal maintenance conditions for zebrafish. Furthermore, we discuss why knowing more about the natural behavior and ecology of this species could be a guiding principle for these studies.

                Bhat et al. show that the E3-ligase SCFFBXO10 is prenylated at C953 in its C-terminal CaaX motif. Prenylated FBXO10 is specifically delivered to the outer mitochondrial membrane via combined actions of cytosolic PDE6δ and HSP90. The expression of prenylation-deficient FBXO10(C953S) impairs mitochondrial proteostasis and functions. FBXO10 loss impairs myogenic differentiation of human iPSCs and murine myoblasts.

	<p>Objective: This study investigated the degrees of lenition, or consonantal weakening, in the production of Spanish stop consonants by native English speakers during a study abroad (SA) program. Lenition is a key phonological process in Spanish, where voiced stops (/b/, /d/, /&amp;amp;#609;/) typically weaken to fricatives or approximants in specific phonetic environments. For L2 learners, mastering this subtle process is essential for achieving native-like pronunciation. Methods: To assess the learners&amp;amp;rsquo; progress in acquiring lenition, we employed Phonet, a deep learning model. Unlike traditional quantitative acoustic methods that focus on measuring the physical properties of speech sounds, Phonet utilizes recurrent neural networks to predict the posterior probabilities of phonological features, particularly sonorant and continuant characteristics, which are central to the lenition process. Results: The results indicated that while learners showed progress in producing the fricative-like variants of lenition during the SA program and understood how to produce lenition in appropriate contexts, the retention of these phonological gains was not sustained after their return. Additionally, unlike native speakers, the learners never fully achieved the approximant-like realization of lenition. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for sustained exposure and practice beyond the SA experience to ensure the long-term retention of L2 phonological patterns. While SA programs offer valuable opportunities for enhancing L2 pronunciation, they should be supplemented with ongoing support to consolidate and extend the gains achieved during the immersive experience.</p>

	<p>Background: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is effective in regulating mood and high-level cognition in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of taVNS treatment in patients with MDD and an altered brain topological organization of functional networks. Methods: Nineteen patients with MDD were enrolled in this study. Patients with MDD underwent 4 weeks of taVNS treatments; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of the patients were collected before and after taVNS treatment. The graph theory method and network-based statistics (NBS) analysis were used to detect abnormal topological organizations of functional networks in patients with MDD before and after taVNS treatment. A correlation analysis was performed to characterize the relationship between altered network properties and neuropsychological scores. Results: After 4 weeks of taVNS treatment, patients with MDD had increased global efficiency and decreased characteristic path length (Lp). Additionally, patients with MDD exhibited increased nodal efficiency (NE) and degree centrality (DC) in the left angular gyrus. NBS results showed that patients with MDD exhibited reduced connectivity between default mode network (DMN)&amp;amp;ndash;frontoparietal network (FPN), DMN&amp;amp;ndash;cingulo-opercular network (CON), and FPN&amp;amp;ndash;CON. Furthermore, changes in Lp and DC were correlated with changes in Hamilton depression scores. Conclusions: These findings demonstrated that taVNS may be an effective method for reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with MDD, mainly through modulating the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s topological organization. Our study may offer insights into the underlying neural mechanism of taVNS treatment in patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study was to verify whether the level of mental resilience would differentiate reading comprehension performance when using different information carriers. More than 150 people filled out a test regarding the level of resilience. They then participated in a survey using fNIRS. Their task was to read a one-page informational text and answer several questions. The results showed no differences in correct answers between groups of people with different levels of resilience. In the groups of people with high and low levels of resilience, the number of correct answers was not differentiated by the type of carrier. Among those with moderate levels of resilience, better results were obtained by those who read text printed on paper. Analyses of neuronal mechanisms showed that the type of carrier differentiated brain activity in each group. Obtaining the same number of correct answers in the test was the result of different neuronal mechanisms activated in those who used a computer and those who read a printed text.</p>

	<p>Objectives: The main purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of social information processing, self-regulation, and metacognition variables on ToM using path analysis. Methods: For this purpose, path analysis was conducted for the model established according to the relationships between the variables. Theory of mind task battery (ToMTB), Metacognitive Knowledge Interview (McKI), Schultz Test of Emotion Processing&amp;amp;mdash;Preliminary Version (STEP-P), and self-regulation scale were administered to 310 children aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years. Results: The results show that social information processing (except STEP-P.P.B, one of the sub-dimensions of the STEP-P scale) has a significant effect on ToM through metacognition and self-regulation. Conclusions: In this context, it can be said that social information processing, metacognition, and self-regulation are effective in the development of ToM.</p>

	<p>Human biostasis, the preservation of a human when all other contemporary options for extension of quality life are exhausted, offers the speculative potential for survival via continuation of life in the future. While provably reversible preservation, also known as suspended animation, is not yet possible for humans, the primary justification for contemporary biostasis is the preservation of the brain, which is broadly considered the seat of memories, personality, and identity. By preserving the information contained within the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s structures, it may be possible to resuscitate a healthy whole individual using advanced future technologies. There are numerous challenges in biostasis, including inadequacies in current preservation techniques, methods to evaluate the quality of preservation, and potential future revival technologies. In this report, we describe a roadmap that attempts to delineate research directions that could improve the field of biostasis, focusing on optimizing preservation protocols and establishing metrics for querying preservation quality, as well as pre- and post-cardiac arrest factors, stabilization strategies, and methods for long-term preservation. We acknowledge the highly theoretical nature of future revival technologies and the importance of achieving high-fidelity brain preservation to maximize the potential of future repair technologies. We plan to update the research roadmap biennially. Our goal is to encourage multidisciplinary communication and collaboration in this field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Finding innovative digital solutions is fundamental to ensure prompt and continuous care for patients with chronic neurological disorders, whose demand for rehabilitation also in home-based settings is steadily increasing. The aim is to verify the safety and the effectiveness of two telerehabilitation (TR) models in improving recovery from subacute upper limb (UL) disability after stroke, with and without a robotic device. Methods: One hundred nineteen subjects with subacute post-stroke UL disability were assessed for eligibility. Of them, 30 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either the Robotic Group (RG), undergoing a 20-session TR program, using a robotic device, or the Non-Robotic Group (NRG), undergoing a 20-session TR program without robotics. Clinical evaluations were measured at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1, 5 weeks after baseline), and included assessments of quality of life, motor skills, and clinical/functional status. The primary outcome measure was the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, evaluating the change in perceived disability. Results: Statistical analysis shows that patients of both groups improved significantly over time in all domains analyzed (mean decrease from baseline in the WHODAS 2.0 of 6.09 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.62% for the NRG, and of 0.76 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.21% for the RG), with a greater improvement of patients in the NRG in motor (Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity&amp;amp;mdash;motor function, Box and Block Test) and cognitive skills (Trail Making Test-A). Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of TR programs to transform stroke rehabilitation by enhancing accessibility and patient-centered care, promoting autonomy, improving adherence, and leading to better outcomes and quality of life for stroke survivors.</p>

                <p>Some visual neurons in the dragonfly (<I>Hemicordulia tau</I>) optic lobe respond to small, moving targets, likely underlying their fast pursuit of prey and conspecifics. In response to repetitive targets presented at short intervals, the spiking activity of these "small target motion detector" (STMD) neurons diminishes over time. Previous experiments limited this adaptation by including intertrial rest periods of varying durations. However, the characteristics of this effect have never been quantified. Here, using extracellular recording techniques lasting for several hours, we quantified both the spatial and temporal properties of STMD adaptation. We found that the time course of adaptation was variable across STMD units. In any one STMD, a repeated series led to more rapid adaptation, a minor accumulative effect more akin to habituation. Following an adapting stimulus, responses recovered quickly, though the rate of recovery decreased nonlinearly over time. We found that the region of adaptation is highly localized, with targets displaced by ~2.5&deg; eliciting a naive response. Higher frequencies of target stimulation converged to lower levels of sustained response activity. We determined that adaptation itself is a target-tuned property, not elicited by moving bars or luminance flicker. As STMD adaptation is a localized phenomenon, dependent on recent history, it is likely to play an important role in closed-loop behavior where a target is foveated in a localized region for extended periods of the pursuit duration<b>.</b></p>

                <p>Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairments (CRCIs) encompass cognitive deficits in memory, attention, and executive function that arise during and following chemotherapy. CRCI symptoms are predominantly reported by female cancer patients but also occur in males. These impairments may involve reduced estradiol levels, which then increases vulnerability to the impact of tumors and chemotherapy on cognition. This study utilized the MMTV-PyVT mouse model of breast cancer to test the hypothesis that impaired ovarian function and associated estradiol levels play a critical role in CRCI susceptibility. Mice were either ovariectomized (OVX) or underwent sham surgery. The OVX group then received supplemental estradiol (E<sup>2</sup>) <I>ad libitum</I> in the drinking water to maintain physiological hormone levels. After tumor development, mice were trained in the Morris water maze to assess spatial memory, and subsequently, they received weekly injections of either saline or a combination of cyclophosphamide (CYP; 66.7&nbsp;mg/kg, i.v.) and doxorubicin (DOX; 6.7&nbsp;mg/kg, i.v.) for 4&nbsp;weeks. Spatial memory was reassessed 10&nbsp;d and then 35&nbsp;d, after the final injections. Results demonstrated a significant disruption of normal ovarian cycling in sham-operated mice treated with CYP + DOX, as well as significant spatial memory impairments when compared with OVX mice supplemented with E<sup>2</sup>. This study suggests that chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage and the consequent drop in circulating estrogens significantly contribute to vulnerability to CRCIs, underscoring the importance of estradiol in mitigating CRCI risks.</p>

                <p>Learning to solve a new problem involves identifying the operating rules, which can be accelerated if known rules generalize in the new context. We ask how prior experience affects learning a new rule that is distinct from known rules. We examined how rats learned a new spatial navigation task after having previously learned tasks with different navigation rules. The new task differed from the previous tasks in spatial layout and navigation rule. We found that experience history did not impact overall performance. However, by examining navigation choice sequences in the new task, we found experience-dependent differences in exploration patterns during early stages of learning, as well as differences in the types of errors made during stable performance. The differences were consistent with the animals adopting experience-dependent memory strategies to discover and implement the new rule. Our results indicate prior experience shapes the strategies for solving novel problems, and the impact of prior experience remains persistent.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0365-24.2024?rss=1">A Subcortical Model for Auditory Forward Masking with Efferent Control of Cochlear Gain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous physiological and psychophysical studies have explored whether feedback to the cochlea from the efferent system influences forward masking. The present work proposes that the limited growth-of-masking (GOM) observed in auditory nerve (AN) fibers may have been misunderstood; namely, that this limitation may be due to the influence of anesthesia on the efferent system. Building on the premise that the unanesthetized AN may exhibit GOM similar to more central nuclei, the present computational modeling study demonstrates that feedback from the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents may contribute to GOM observed physiologically in onset-type neurons in both the cochlear nucleus and inferior colliculus (IC). Additionally, the computational model of MOC efferents used here generates a decrease in masking with longer masker-signal delays similar to that observed in IC physiology and in psychophysical studies. An advantage of this explanation over alternative physiological explanations (e.g., that forward masking requires inhibition from the superior paraolivary nucleus) is that this theory can explain forward masking observed in the brainstem, early in the ascending pathway. For explaining psychoacoustic results, one strength of this model is that it can account for the lack of elevation in thresholds observed when masker level is randomly varied from interval-to-interval, a result that is difficult to explain using the conventional temporal window model of psychophysical forward masking. Future directions for evaluating the efferent mechanism as a contributing mechanism for psychoacoustic results are discussed.</p>

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscripts’ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

                <p>by Rekha Gopalan-Nair, Aurore Coissac, Ludovic Legrand, Céline Lopez-Roques, Yann Pécrix, Céline Vandecasteele, Olivier Bouchez, Xavier Barlet, Anne Lanois, Alain Givaudan, Julien Brillard, Stéphane Genin, Alice Guidot</p>

Adaptation is usually explained by beneficial genetic mutations that are transmitted from parents to offspring and become fixed in the adapted population. However, genetic mutation analysis alone is not sufficient to fully explain the adaptive processes, and several studies report the existence of nongenetic (or epigenetic) inheritance that can enable adaptation to new environments. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis of the role of DNA methylation, a form of epigenetic modification, in adaptation of the plant pathogen <i>Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum</i> to the host during experimental evolution. Using SMRT-seq technology, we analyzed the methylomes of 31 experimentally evolved clones obtained after serial passages on 5 different plant species during 300 generations. Comparison with the methylome of the ancestral clone revealed a list of 50 differential methylated sites (DMSs) at the GTWWAC motif. Gene expression analysis of the 39 genes targeted by these DMSs revealed limited correlation between differential methylation and differential expression of the corresponding genes. Only 1 gene showed a correlation, the RSp0338 gene encoding the EpsR regulator protein. The MSRE-qPCR technology, used as an alternative approach for DNA methylation analysis, also found the 2 DMSs upstream RSp0338. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated the contribution of these 2 DMSs in host adaptation. As these DMSs appeared very early in the experimental evolution, we hypothesize that such fast epigenetic changes can allow rapid adaptation to the plant stem environment. In addition, we found that the change in DNA methylation upstream RSp0338 remains stable at least for 100 generations outside the host and thus can contribute to long-term adaptation to the host plant. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a direct link between bacterial epigenetic variation and adaptation to a new environment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1080/v1?src=rss">A systematic review of Streptococcus Mutans and Veillonellae species interactions in dental caries progression: Positive or Negative impact? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The interaction between Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and Veillonella species (Veillonella spp.) is unclear. This study aims to investigate the interaction between S. mutans and Veillonella spp. on caries development using systematic review. Methods This systematic review was accorded to the guideline of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Three electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library, were used to conduct a systematic search for eligible studies from their inception until July 18, 2023. PROSPERO registration number was No. CRD42023445968. Results We initially identified 4,774 articles. After eliminating duplicates and irrelevant articles, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies revealed important aspects of the relationship between S. mutans and Veillonellae spp. in dental caries. One significant finding is that Veillonellae spp. can affect the acid production capacity of S. mutans. Some studies indicate that Veillonellae spp. can inhibit the acid production by S. mutans, potentially reducing the cariogenic process. Another aspect is the competition for substrates. Veillonellae spp. utilize lactic acid, which is a by product of S. mutans metabolism, as a source of carbon. This metabolic interaction may decrease the availability of lactic acid for S. mutans, potentially influencing its cariogenic potential. Conclusions This systematic review highlights the emerging evidence on the interaction between S. mutans and Veillonellae spp. in dental caries. The findings suggest that Veillonellae spp. can modulate the acid production, and substrate competition of S. mutans, potentially influencing the cariogenic process.

                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                Background Active venous leg ulcer (VLU) is the most severe manifestation of chronic venous disease which not only affects patients’ health, but also decreases the quality of life, and delivers economic burdens. Treatment of superficial venous reflux with early endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) has been associated with reducing ulcer recurrence levels and promoting faster VLU healing. We reported three cases of patients with active VLU undergoing EVLA with different approaches. Case illustration Three patients came with complaint of leg ulcer, diagnosed with C6sEpAsdPr, with venous clinical severity scores (VCSS) of 15, 23, and 22 respectively. Severe great saphenous veins (GSV) reflux was found in all patients by duplex ultrasound examination. The second patient had undergone above-the-knee EVLA. All patients underwent EVLA using 1470-nano meter wavelength laser device and ELVeS radial fiber (Biolitec, Bonn, Germany). The laser energy protocol used was 6 W linear endovenous energy density (LEED) 50 J/cm for proximal until media ATK GSV ablation, 5 W LEED 40 J/cm for media ATK until proximal below-the-knee (BTK) GSV, and 2 W LEED 20 J/cm for proximal until distal BTK GSV. The third patient was also treated with EVLA for small saphenous vein severe reflux. Follow-up until 6 months post-EVLA showed significant healing of the ulcer with 14, 16, and 17 VCSS reduction consecutively without any complication. Conclusion We’ve reported three cases of patients with active VLU undergoing EVLA until BTK with significant results. The EVLA of GSV until BTK where there is still significant reflux is safe and provides satisfactory results in patients with VLU.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-736/v2?src=rss">Life should be redefined: Any molecule with the ability to self-replicate should be considered life [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the nature of life and its propensity for reproduction has long been a question that humans aspire to answer. Reproduction, a defining characteristic of life, fundamentally involves the replication of genetic material, be it DNA or RNA. The driving force behind this replication process has always intrigued scientists. In recent years, theories involving selfish genes, the RNA world, and entropic forces have been proposed by some scholars. These theories seem to suggest that life, as we know it, exists solely in Earth’s environment and is based on a single type of genetic material, either DNA or RNA. However, if we broaden our definition of life to include any replicable molecules, we might be able to transcend traditional thought. This could potentially enhance our understanding of the impetus behind DNA replication and provide deeper insights into the essence of life.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>De novo variants in <i>cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase</i> (<i>CUL3</i>) have been strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but no large case series have been reported so far. Here, we aimed to collect sporadic cases carrying rare variants in <i>CUL3</i>, describe the genotype–phenotype correlation, and investigate the underlying pathogenic mechanism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Genetic data and detailed clinical records were collected via multicenter collaboration. Dysmorphic facial features were analyzed using GestaltMatcher. Variant effects on CUL3 protein stability were assessed using patient-derived T-cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We assembled a cohort of 37 individuals with heterozygous <i>CUL3</i> variants presenting a syndromic NDD characterized by intellectual disability with or without autistic features. Of these, 35 have loss-of-function (LoF) and 2 have missense variants. <i>CUL3</i> LoF variants in patients may affect protein stability leading to perturbations in protein homeostasis, as evidenced by decreased ubiquitin-protein conjugates in vitro. Notably, we show that 4E-BP1 (EIF4EBP1), a prominent substrate of CUL3, fails to be targeted for proteasomal degradation in patient-derived cells.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further refines the clinical and mutational spectrum of <i>CUL3</i>-associated NDDs, expands the spectrum of cullin RING E3 ligase-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, and suggests haploinsufficiency via LoF variants is the predominant pathogenic mechanism.

                Background Better affordability of data plans and an increase in “budget” smartphones have resulted in an exponential rise in internet and smartphone users. The ease of access to sexually explicit material (SEM) coupled with adolescents’ impulsivity makes them prone to excessive SEM exposure and may affect the development of sexuality via the perceived realism of such content. This study was done to study the influence between problematic smartphone usage (PSU) and sexuality development among late adolescent boys. Methods One hundred and thirty-four adolescents aged 18-19 years, studying in a medical university, participated in this cross-sectional study. Smartphone Addiction Scale – short version (SAS-SV) to evaluate PSU and a content validated semi-structured proforma to evaluate gender identity, sexual orientation, sources of information on pubertal changes, and exposure to pornographic content was used. We expressed results as proportion and summary measures (Mean±SD), Chi-square test to find influence between PSU and adolescent sexuality development. Results We found a 45.5% prevalence of PSU. Among study participants, 88% were attracted to the opposite sex, 6% were attracted to the same-sex, and 6% were attracted to both sexes. Three per cent of participants liked wearing clothes of the opposite sex, 7.5% wanted to be members of the opposite sex, whereas 10.4% were not comfortable with their genitalia. They obtained information regarding pubertal changes from friends (85) and media (78). Many had exposure to pornographic content (90%), with the youngest being nine years old. Conclusion Nearly half of the late adolescents have PSU. Pornographic contents are accessed through Smartphones.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97916">Tumor-infiltrating nerves functionally alter brain circuits and modulate behavior in a mouse model of head-and-neck cancer</a></h4>

              
                Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors (decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96852">Dynamic chromatin architecture identifies new autoimmune-associated enhancers for IL2 and novel genes regulating CD4+ T cell activation</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic signals associated with autoimmune disease. The majority of these signals are located in non-coding regions and likely impact <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (cRE). Because cRE function is dynamic across cell types and states, profiling the epigenetic status of cRE across physiological processes is necessary to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which autoimmune variants contribute to disease risk. We localized risk variants from 15 autoimmune GWAS to cRE active during TCR-CD28 co-stimulation of naïve human CD4+ T cells. To characterize how dynamic changes in gene expression correlate with cRE activity, we measured transcript levels, chromatin accessibility, and promoter–cRE contacts across three phases of naive CD4+ T cell activation using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiC. We identified ~1200 protein-coding genes physically connected to accessible disease-associated variants at 423 GWAS signals, at least one-third of which are dynamically regulated by activation. From these maps, we functionally validated a novel stretch of evolutionarily conserved intergenic enhancers whose activity is required for activation-induced <i>IL2</i> gene expression in human and mouse, and is influenced by autoimmune-associated genetic variation. The set of genes implicated by this approach are enriched for genes controlling CD4+ T cell function and genes involved in human inborn errors of immunity, and we pharmacologically validated eight implicated genes as novel regulators of T cell activation. These studies directly show how autoimmune variants and the genes they regulate influence processes involved in CD4+ T cell proliferation and activation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95393">Sensitivity to vocal emotions emerges in newborns at 37 weeks gestational age</a></h4>

              
                Emotional responsiveness in neonates, particularly their ability to discern vocal emotions, plays an evolutionarily adaptive role in human communication and adaptive behaviors. The developmental trajectory of emotional sensitivity in neonates is crucial for understanding the foundations of early social-emotional functioning. However, the precise onset of this sensitivity and its relationship with gestational age (GA) remain subjects of investigation. In a study involving 120 healthy neonates categorized into six groups based on their GA (ranging from 35 and 40 weeks), we explored their emotional responses to vocal stimuli. These stimuli encompassed disyllables with happy and neutral prosodies, alongside acoustically matched nonvocal control sounds. The assessments occurred during natural sleep states using the odd-ball paradigm and event-related potentials. The results reveal a distinct developmental change at 37 weeks GA, marking the point at which neonates exhibit heightened perceptual acuity for emotional vocal expressions. This newfound ability is substantiated by the presence of the mismatch response, akin to an initial form of adult mismatch negativity, elicited in response to positive emotional vocal prosody. Notably, this perceptual shift’s specificity becomes evident when no such discrimination is observed in acoustically matched control sounds. Neonates born before 37 weeks GA do not display this level of discrimination ability. This developmental change has important implications for our understanding of early social-emotional development, highlighting the role of gestational age in shaping early perceptual abilities. Moreover, while these findings introduce the potential for a valuable screening tool for conditions like autism, characterized by atypical social-emotional functions, it is important to note that the current data are not yet robust enough to fully support this application. This study makes a substantial contribution to the broader field of developmental neuroscience and holds promise for future research on early intervention in neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88256">PITAR, a DNA damage-inducible cancer/testis long noncoding RNA, inactivates p53 by binding and stabilizing TRIM28 mRNA</a></h4>

              
                In tumors with WT p53, alternate mechanisms of p53 inactivation are reported. Here, we have identified a long noncoding RNA, <i>PITAR</i> (<i>p</i>53 <i>I</i>nactivating <i>T</i>RIM28 <i>A</i>ssociated <i>R</i>NA), as an inhibitor of p53. <i>PITAR</i> is an oncogenic Cancer/testis lncRNA and is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSC). We establish that <i>TRIM28</i> mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a direct target of <i>PITAR. PITAR</i> interaction with <i>TRIM28</i> RNA stabilized <i>TRIM28</i> mRNA, which resulted in increased TRIM28 protein levels and reduced p53 steady-state levels due to enhanced p53 ubiquitination. DNA damage activated <i>PITAR</i>, in addition to p53, in a p53-independent manner, thus creating an incoherent feedforward loop to inhibit the DNA damage response by p53. While <i>PITAR</i> silencing inhibited the growth of WT p53 containing GSCs in vitro and reduced glioma tumor growth in vivo, its overexpression enhanced the tumor growth in a <i>TRIM28</i>-dependent manner and promoted resistance to Temozolomide. Thus, we establish an alternate way of p53 inactivation by <i>PITAR</i>, which maintains low p53 levels in normal cells and attenuates the DNA damage response by p53. Finally, we propose <i>PITAR</i> as a potential GBM therapeutic target.

	<p>Background/Objectives: With the rapid expansion of the global sports market, the significance of sports sponsorship has attracted growing attention. However, during the golden age of the sports industry&amp;amp;rsquo;s development in China, international sports brand giants such as Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour have rapidly captured a substantial share of the Chinese sports consumer market through their distinctive product designs and varied marketing strategies. This has resulted in a highly competitive environment for China&amp;amp;rsquo;s sports goods industry. Therefore, fostering the improved development of domestic sports brands has become a crucial issue deserving of thorough scholarly investigation. This study examines how consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; differing levels of sports involvement and the degree of fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event affect their cognitive and emotional responses to sports sponsorships. Methods: By employing Predictive Coding Theory and ERP (event-related potential) brainwave technology, this study delves into the psychological and neurobiological levels to analyze the impact of consumer sports involvement on the processing of sponsorship information. Results: The results indicate significant differences in cognitive and emotional responses between high-involvement and low-involvement consumers. Additionally, the fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event also significantly affects consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; cognitive and emotional responses. These differences stem from consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; complex and sophisticated predictive coding models. Conclusions: This study not only provides scientific evidence for sports brands in selecting and executing sponsorship activities, but also offers new perspectives for evaluating and optimizing sponsorship effectiveness.</p>

	<p>The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cornerstone tool for the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of selected patient populations. EEGs offer significant advantages such as high temporal resolution, real-time cortical function assessment, and bedside usability. The quantitative EEG (qEEG) added the possibility of long recordings being processed in a compressive manner, making EEG revision more efficient for experienced users, and more friendly for new ones. Recent advancements in commercially available software, such as Persyst, have significantly expanded and facilitated the use of qEEGs, marking the beginning of a new era in its application. As a result, there has been a notable increase in the practical, real-world utilization of qEEGs in recent years. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current applications of qEEGs in daily neurological emergencies and ICU practice, and some elementary principles of qEEGs using Persyst software in clinical settings. This article illustrates basic qEEG patterns encountered in critical care and adopts the new terminology proposed for spectrogram reporting.</p>

                Background The use of chemical pesticides without proper health literacy (HL) and necessary pesticide protective behaviors (PPB) can result in adverse effects on human health. Methods This study aims to determine if there is a correlation between HL and PPB among farmers in the Nakhon Ratchasima province, using a random sample of 464 farmers. Structured interviews consisted of three parts: 1. General information, 2. Health literacy (including knowledge, understanding, and other sub-aspects), and 3. Protective behaviors against chemical exposure. Each part of the questionnaire had a reliability index of 0.60 or higher. The reliability of the 2nd and 3rd parts of the questionnaire were as follows: sub-sections of part 2 had a Kuder-Richardson (KR-20) coefficient of 0.79 and Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficient of 0.85-0.86, while part 3 had an α of 0.88. Risk of chemical exposure was assessed using a Cholinesterase Reactive Paper test administered by a finger-prick blood test. Data was analyzed using the Spearman correlation and binary logistic regression. The study was reviewed by the Human Research Ethics Committee with the approval date: August 9, 2021, and expiry date: August 9, 2022. Results Most participants had moderate levels of overall HL (48.8%) and PPB (44.6%). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between HL and PPB (rs(478) = 0.70, p<.005). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that HL had a statistically significant positive association with PPB (p<.001, OR = 6.57, 95% CI 3.95, 10.94) and was associated with blood cholinesterase levels. Conclusions These findings highlight the need for increased health literacy among farmers in Thailand to ensure correct protective behaviors against chemical exposure and reduce the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on human health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1076/v1?src=rss">Prevalence, satisfaction and preference of tooth shades and their correlation with age, gender and skin shade: A cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Shade selection is one of the most important factors that determines the satisfaction of the patient with the dental prosthesis and thus the overall success of the treatment. Conventional methods of shade selection require the presence of existing teeth or past dental/photographic records. In the absence of these, shade selection becomes challenging and must be done subjectively and arbitrarily based on the patient’s age and sex. This study aims to assess the prevalence, satisfaction, and preference of tooth shades, investigating their correlation with age, sex, and skin shade in a diverse sample of 120 participants. Methods A total of 120 participants, evenly distributed among 60 males and 60 females, were surveyed. Participants were categorized into age groups (n=15) and asked about their satisfaction with existing tooth shades and their preferences. Results The most common existing tooth shade was Value 2 (52.5%). Statistical analysis using Chi-square tests revealed that Value 2 was the most desired shade among males and females alike, particularly in the age group of 41 to 50 years (p < 0.001). Shade 2L1.5 was the most prevalent (n=26), with Value 2 (59.16%) being the most sought-after shade, followed by Shade 2L1.5 (n=21), Shade 2M1 (n=18), Shade 1M1 (n=15), and Shade 2R1.5 (n=14). Existing tooth shades of Value 0 were the least common. The highest satisfaction with existing shades was observed in males aged 41 to 50 (n=15), followed by males aged 51 to 60 (n=14) and females aged 31 to 40 (n=12) and 41 to 50 (n=12). Significant differences in satisfaction were noted among males (p < 0.001). Conclusions This study reveals a consistent and strong preference among both males and females for tooth shades classified as Value 2, following the VITA Tooth-Guide 3D Master shade guide. This universal preference suggests the relevance and acceptance of this shade category across diverse patient groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-98/v5?src=rss">Metabolomic characterization of human glioblastomas and patient plasma: a pilot study [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Primary cam morphology, an acquired bony prominence at the head-neck junction of the femur, is highly prevalent in athlete populations, and causally associated with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and early hip osteoarthritis. Experts agreed on key elements for primary cam morphology and a prioritised research agenda for the field. This research agenda will require higher-quality research to achieve meaningful progress on the aetiology, prognosis and treatment of primary cam morphology in athletes. Aim To explore stakeholders’ perspectives of high-quality research in the research field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. Methods Grounded in interpretive description, we used semi-structured interviews to explore stakeholders’ perspectives of high-quality research in the primary cam morphology research field. The framework for INcreasing QUality In patient-orientated academic clinical REsearch (INQUIRE) informed the interview guide. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. We recruited a heterogenous and purposive maximum variation sample, drawing from a network of research contacts. Results Fifteen individuals, several with multiple perspectives on research quality in the field, participated. Exploring stakeholders’ perspectives on research quality through an established research quality framework (INQUIRE) illuminated areas for immediate action for research communities in the field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. We crafted five action inviting themes: research communities should: partner with athletes/patients; champion equity, diversity and inclusion; collaborate with one another; pursue open science; and nurture young scholars. Conclusion The findings of this study could inform concrete actions by research communities to pursue higher quality research—more research value and less waste—in the field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. Although the five action-inviting themes reflect contemporary trends in research, and could therefore be transferable to other areas of research, their practical application remains context- and field-specific.

                Background Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is commonly fatal, with an overall mortality rate of nearly 90%, and the risk of subsequent rupture remains high, especially in large aneurysm diameters or progressive disease. Unfavorable neck anatomy in EVAR is linked to early graft failure and long-term complications. Recently, a novel multiple stiff wire (MSW) technique has been developed to overcome the challenges of hostile neck anatomy without introducing additional devices and procedural complexity. It has also been feasible in a series of elective cases. In this case, we report the first-ever utilization of the MSW technique in an emergency case of an acute contained rAAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck who underwent Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR). Case presentation A 61-year-old man came with intermittent sharp stomach pain radiating to his back since three weeks ago. Physical examination showed elevated blood pressure and anemic conjunctiva. Laboratory examinations showed anemia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer level, high creatinine level, and low eGFR. CT-Scan Angiography (CTA) revealed severely hostile anatomy, a conical-shaped abdominal aorta aneurysm with a length of 13.2 cm and a maximum diameter of 9.3 cm with angulation of 90.1°. The patient was diagnosed with Ruptured AAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck. Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) management with MSW technique was planned for him. After four days, The patient was discharged in a clinically stable condition with optimal medical treatment and education. Conclusion The endovascular approach could be performed in emergency settings and has been proven to reduce length of stay, mortality, and morbidity rates. In this case, the endovascular approach with the MSW technique showed promising results for the patient.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1073/v1?src=rss">A novel hybrid genetic algorithm and Nelder-Mead approach and it’s application for parameter estimation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Traditional optimization methods often struggle to balance global exploration and local refinement, particularly in complex real-world problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel hybrid optimization strategy that integrates the Nelder-Mead (NM) technique and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), named the Genetic and Nelder-Mead Algorithm (GANMA). This hybrid approach aims to enhance performance across various benchmark functions and parameter estimation tasks. Methods GANMA combines the global search capabilities of GA with the local refinement strength of NM. It is first tested on 15 benchmark functions commonly used to evaluate optimization strategies. The effectiveness of GANMA is also demonstrated through its application to parameter estimation problems, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. Results GANMA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of robustness, convergence speed, and solution quality. The hybrid algorithm excels across different function landscapes, including those with high dimensionality and multimodality, which are often encountered in real-world optimization issues. Additionally, GANMA improves model accuracy and interpretability in parameter estimation tasks, enhancing both model fitting and prediction. Conclusions GANMA proves to be a flexible and powerful optimization method suitable for both benchmark optimization and real-world parameter estimation challenges. Its capability to efficiently explore parameter spaces and refine solutions makes it a promising tool for scientific, engineering, and economic applications. GANMA offers a valuable solution for improving model performance and effectively handling complex optimization problems.

Detailed method descriptions are essential for reproducibility, research evaluation, and effective data reuse. We summarize the key recommendations for life sciences researchers and research institutions described in the European Commission PRO-MaP report.

Essential details about study methods are often missing from academic research papers in the life sciences, which can adversely affect reproducibility, undermine trust and impair researchers’ ability to reuse methods and data. This Perspective article describes PRO-MaP (Promoting Reusable and Open Methods And Protocols), which aims to increase and improve the reporting of detailed, structured and open methods and reusable step-by-step protocols in the life sciences.

                <p>by Chonprakun Thagun, Masaki Odahara, Yutaka Kodama, Keiji Numata</p>

Plastids are pivotal target organelles for comprehensively enhancing photosynthetic and metabolic traits in plants via plastid engineering. Plastidial proteins predominantly originate in the nucleus and must traverse membrane-bound multiprotein translocons to access these organelles. This import process is meticulously regulated by chloroplast-targeting peptides (cTPs). Whereas many cTPs have been employed to guide recombinantly expressed functional proteins to chloroplasts, there is a critical need for more efficient cTPs. Here, we performed a comprehensive exploration and comparative assessment of an advanced suite of cTPs exhibiting superior targeting capabilities. We employed a multifaceted approach encompassing computational prediction, in planta expression, fluorescence tracking, and in vitro chloroplast import studies to identify and analyze 88 cTPs associated with <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants with phenotypes linked to chloroplast function. These polypeptides exhibited distinct abilities to transport green fluorescent protein (GFP) to various compartments within leaf cells, particularly chloroplasts. A highly efficient cTP derived from <i>Arabidopsis</i> plastid ribosomal protein L35 (At2g24090) displayed remarkable effectiveness in chloroplast localization. This cTP facilitated the activities of chloroplast-targeted RNA-processing proteins and metabolic enzymes within plastids. This cTP could serve as an ideal transit peptide for precisely targeting biomolecules to plastids, leading to advancements in plastid engineering.

<p>High nicotine dose induces anxiety-like behavior in mice in the Open Field Test, alongside oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) reduction in brain regions. Cannabidiol acts as an anxiolytic, exhibiting antioxidant activities, reducing cytokines, and normalizing BDNF levels.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>High doses of nicotine administered to rodents serve as a model for studying anxiety and test compounds' potential anxiolytic effects. At these doses, anxiety in rodents is accompanied by disruption of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The endocannabinoids and nicotine modulate several central nervous system processes via their specific receptors, impacting locomotion, anxiety, memory, nociception, and reward. Cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient of <i>Cannabis sativa</i> L., is devoid of psychoactive actions and has gained attention for its anxiolytic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, among others. This work aims to examine the potential anxiety-reducing properties of CBD in a well-established experimental mouse model of anxiety-like behavior induced by high doses of nicotine on male C57BL/6 mice. In this context, the open-field behavioral test was specially conducted to assess CBD's effects on anxiety-like behavior and locomotion. Brain neuronal plasticity, modulated by BDNF, along with a diverse array of blood's metabolic markers, was examined as a means of evaluating systemic toxicity under various treatments. Finally, oxidative stress was evaluated through the measurement of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA), while pro-inflammatory cytokine assessments were conducted to evaluate redox status and immune system function. Our research suggests that CBD shows potential in reducing anxiety-like behaviors induced by high doses of nicotine, by mitigating changes in BDNF protein levels in cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. At the same time, CBD targets specific liver enzymes, maintains tissue's systemic toxicity (i.e., renal, kidney, and pancreatic), balances redox status (SOD, GSH, and MDA), and regulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27059?af=R">Laser Ablation of Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia for Medically Refractory Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is the most common neuronal heterotopia, frequently resulting in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Here, we characterize variables that predict good epilepsy outcomes following surgical intervention using stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) -informed magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective review of consecutive cases from a single high-volume epilepsy referral center identified patients who underwent SEEG evaluation for PVNH to characterize the intervention and outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty-nine patients underwent SEEG-guided MRgLITT of the seizure onset zone (SoZ) in PVNH and associated epileptic tissue. PVNH and polymicrogyria (PMG) were densely sampled with a mean of 16.5 (SD = 2)/209.4 (SD = 36.9) SEEG probes/recording contacts per patient. Ablation principally targeted just the PVNH and cortex that was abnormal on imaging was ablated (5 patients) only if implicated in the SoZ. Volumetric analyses revealed a high percentage of PVNH SoZ ablation (96.6%, SD = 5.3%) in unilateral and bilateral (92.9%, SD = 7.2%) cases. Mean follow-up duration was 31.4 months (SD = 20.9). Seizure freedom (ILAE 1) was excellent: unilateral PVNH without other imaging abnormalities, 80%; PVNH with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) or PMG, 63%; bilateral PVNH, 50%. SoZ ablation percentage significantly impacted surgical outcomes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PVNH plays a central role in seizure genesis as revealed by dense recordings and selective targeting by LITT. MRgLITT represents a transformative technological advance in PVNH-associated epilepsy with seizure control outcomes consistent with those seen in focal lesional epilepsies. In localized unilateral cases and otherwise normal imaging, PVNH ablation without invasive recordings may be considered, and this approach deserves to be explored further.

                Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia are linked to accelerated aging leading to reduced lifespan, health span and cognitive decline. Cellular senescence, in which cells lose proliferative capacity and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), plays a role in this process. Emerging research suggests that the senolytic regimen of dasatinib+quercetin (D+Q) reduces senescent cells, potentially mitigating age-related health and cognitive decline. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and safety of D+Q in older adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods This single-center study will recruit 30 participants total aged 50 years or older with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder or 60 years or older with TRD; the difference in age limits is because individuals with schizophrenia are biologically about 10 years older than general population owing to metabolic burden. Each participant will receive two consecutive days of 100 mg oral dasatinib plus 1250 mg oral quercetin at baseline and weeks one through three, (i.e., two days on, five days off) along with lifestyle risk management education. Questionnaires and assessments will measure health and cognitive function as well as psychiatric function at baseline, week 10, and one year. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will measure structural and functional brain health at baseline and 10 weeks. Blood sampling for SASP testing will occur at seven time points: baseline, weeks one through four, week 10, and one year. Conclusion This pilot aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the senolytic regimen and D+Q’s potential to counteract accelerated aging in adults with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and TRD. Trial registration Dasatinib Plus Quercetin for Accelerated Aging in Mental Disorders is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05838560; posted May 1, 2023.

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps are highlighted.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23629?af=R">Don't ignore the middle: Distinct mnemonic functions of intermediate hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal region of the hippocampus (dHC) mediates many of the mnemonic functions traditionally associated with the hippocampus proper, such as spatial and episodic memory, whereas ventral hippocampus (vHC) has been extensively implicated in emotional memory and motivational processes. By contrast, the functions of the intermediate hippocampus (iHC) are far less understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mnemonic functions of iHC by reversibly inactivating iHC prior to testing memory in behavioral tasks dependent on the integrity of dHC, iHC, or vHC, namely, rapid place water maze, inhibitory avoidance, spontaneous alternation, and temporal ordering of odors. Given our previous findings showing that dHC and vHC are involved in mnemonic control of ingestive behavior, we also assessed the effects of iHC inactivation on sucrose intake. The results showed that pharmacological inhibition of iHC impairs rapid place water maze memory, which has been previously shown to be dependent on iHC but not dHC or vHC. iHC inactivation does not impact memory dependent on dHC (spontaneous alternation), vHC (temporal odor memory), or either dHC or vHC (inhibitory avoidance), and only modestly affects sucrose intake. These findings provide support for the involvement of iHC in mnemonic functions that are distinct from dHC and vHC and highlight the need to further advance our understanding of the functions of this hippocampal region that has been relatively understudied.</p>
