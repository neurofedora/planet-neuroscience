              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21996">Limitations of Proprioceptive Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.21996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recalling previously experienced movements is essential for a range of activities, including sports, music, and rehabilitation, yet little is known about the accuracy and decay of proprioceptive working memory. We examined how introducing a short-term memory component affected movement reproduction accuracy by comparing movement reproduction under two conditions: simultaneous reproduction (SimRep) and memorized reproduction (MemRep). In Experiment 1 (N = 191), participants felt a 5-s haptic trajectory with one hand and reproduced it with the other hand simultaneously or immediately after the template ended. Errors were greater in MemRep than SimRep (31.1 deg vs. 21.5 deg, p < 0.001). MemRep trajectories showed systematic temporal distortions: participants lagged fast movements and led slow ones (R = -0.32, p = 0.01), unlike the ~279 ms lag in SimRep. In Experiment 2 (N = 33), we varied template durations (2-8 s). Longer durations increased error for MemRep but not SimRep (p < 0.001). During MemRep, accuracy declined steadily, with replay-template correlations dropping from ~0.4 to ~0.1 over ~3 s, while SimRep correlations rose from ~0.25 to ~0.6. In ~10% of MemRep templates, participants moved in the wrong direction initially, especially for low-amplitude movements (p < 0.001). Templates with more than four movements showed element omission; after four movements had been reproduced participants ceased movement prematurely, affecting up to 40% of 8-s templates. These findings show that transferring proprioceptive experiences into working memory introduces systematic temporal and structural distortions. Accuracy decays within seconds, and memory span for movement trajectories was limited to four movements.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22262">Lateral Ventricular Brain-Computer Interface System with Lantern-Inspired Electrode for Stable Performance and Memory Decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lateral ventricular brain-computer interface (LV-BCI) that deploys an expandable, flexible electrode into the lateral ventricle through a minimally invasive external ventricular drainage pathway. Inspired by the framework of traditional Chinese lanterns, the electrode expands uniformly within the ventricle and conforms to the ependymal wall. Compared with conventional subdural ECoG electrodes, the LV-BCI shows superior signal stability and immunocompatibility. Resting-state spectral analyses revealed a maximum effective bandwidth comparable to subdural ECoG. In evoked potential tests, the LV-BCI maintained a consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio over 112 days without the decline typically associated with scarring or other immune responses. Immunohistochemistry showed only a transient, early microglial activation after implantation, returning to control levels and remaining stable through 168 days. We further designed an "action-memory T-maze" task and developed a microstate sequence classifier (MSSC) to predict rats' turn decisions. The LV-BCI achieved prediction accuracy up to 98%, significantly outperforming subdural ECoG, indicating enhanced access to decision-related information from deep structures such as the hippocampus. These results establish the lateral ventricle as a viable route for neural signal acquisition. Using a lantern-inspired flexible electrode, we achieve long-term stable recordings and robust memory decision decoding from within the ventricular system, opening new directions for BCI technology and systems neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22364">Tuned for Creativity? Graph-Theoretical Mapping of Resting-State EEG Reveals Neural Signatures of Creativity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how creativity is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While resting-state fMRI studies have revealed large-scale network correlates of creative potential, electroencephalography (EEG) offers a temporally precise and scalable approach to capture the fast oscillatory dynamics that underlie spontaneous neural organization. In this study, we used a data-driven network approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults. Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged, differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1, characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity, relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity. Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns can index stable cognitive traits such as creativity. More broadly, they point to an intrinsic neural signature of adaptive brain function marked by efficient yet flexible network organization that may support creative and adaptive cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22924">Neural Recording Power Optimization Through Machine Learning Guided Resolution Reconfiguration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural recording implants are a crucial tool for both neuroscience research and enabling new clinical applications. The power consumption of high channel count implants is dominated by the circuits used to amplify and digitize neural signals. Since circuit designers have pushed the efficiency of these circuits close to the theoretical physical limits, reducing power further requires system level optimization. Recent advances use a strategy called channel selection, in which less important channels are turned off to save power. We demonstrate resolution reconfiguration, in which the resolution of less important channels is scaled down to save power. Our approach leverages variable importance of each channel inside machine-learning-based decoders and we trial this methodology across three applications: seizure detection, gesture recognition, and force regression. With linear decoders, resolution reconfiguration saves 8.7x, 12.8x, and 23.0x power compared to a traditional recording array for each task respectively. It further saves 1.6x, 3.4x, and 5.2x power compared to channel selection. The results demonstrate the power benefits of resolution reconfigurable front-ends and their wide applicability to neural decoding problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23321">Model-Behavior Alignment under Flexible Evaluation: When the Best-Fitting Model Isn't the Right One</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.23321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearly transforming stimulus representations of deep neural networks yields high-performing models of behavioral and neural responses to complex stimuli. But does the test accuracy of such predictions identify genuine representational alignment? We addressed this question through a large-scale model-recovery study. Twenty diverse vision models were linearly aligned to 4.5 million behavioral judgments from the THINGS odd-one-out dataset and calibrated to reproduce human response variability. For each model in turn, we sampled synthetic responses from its probabilistic predictions, fitted all candidate models to the synthetic data, and tested whether the data-generating model would re-emerge as the best predictor of the simulated data. Model recovery accuracy improved with training-set size but plateaued below 80%, even at millions of simulated trials. Regression analyses linked misidentification primarily to shifts in representational geometry induced by the linear transformation, as well as to the effective dimensionality of the transformed features. These findings demonstrate that, even with massive behavioral data, overly flexible alignment metrics may fail to guide us toward artificial representations that are genuinely more human-aligned. Model comparison experiments must be designed to balance the trade-off between predictive accuracy and identifiability-ensuring that the best-fitting model is also the right one.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23391">Conduction velocity of intracortical axons in monkey primary visual cortex grows with distance: implications for computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.23391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical visual computation is to construct global scene properties from activities of early visual cortical neurons which have small receptive fields. Such a computation is enabled by contextual influences, through which a neuron's response to visual inputs is influenced by contextual inputs outside its classical receptive fields. Accordingly, neurons can signal global properties including visual saliencies and figure-ground relationships. Many believe that intracortical axons conduct signals too slowly to bring the contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons. A popular opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback from higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields. This paper re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings: the conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly with the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the contextual influences. Recognizing the importance of intracortical contribution to critical visual computations should enable fresh progress in answering long-standing questions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21748">Automated Tinnitus Detection Through Dual-Modality Neuroimaging: EEG Microstate Analysis and Resting-State fMRI Classification Using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.21748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Tinnitus affects 10-15% of the population yet lacks objective diagnostic biomarkers. This study applied machine learning to EEG and fMRI data to identify neural signatures distinguishing tinnitus patients from healthy controls. Methods: Two datasets were analyzed: 64-channel EEG recordings from 80 participants (40 tinnitus, 40 controls) and resting-state fMRI data from 38 participants (19 tinnitus, 19 controls). EEG analysis extracted microstate features across four to seven clustering states and five frequency bands, producing 440 features per subject. Global Field Power signals were also transformed into wavelet images for deep learning. fMRI data were analyzed using slice-wise convolutional neural networks and hybrid models combining pre-trained architectures (VGG16, ResNet50) with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Results: EEG microstate analysis revealed altered network dynamics in tinnitus, particularly reduced gamma-band microstate B occurrence (healthy: 56.56 vs tinnitus: 43.81, p < 0.001) and diminished alpha coverage. Tree-based classifiers achieved up to 98.8% accuracy, while VGG16 on wavelet-transformed EEG yielded 95.4% and 94.1% accuracy for delta and alpha bands, respectively. fMRI analysis identified 12 high-performing axial slices (>=90% accuracy), with slice 17 reaching 99.0%. The hybrid VGG16-Decision Tree model achieved 98.95% +/- 2.94% accuracy. Conclusion: EEG and fMRI provided effective neural biomarkers for tinnitus classification. Tree-based and hybrid models demonstrated superior performance, highlighting tinnitus as a multi-network disorder requiring multimodal analysis.

                arXiv:2510.22022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wilson-Cowan and Amari-type models capture nonlinear neural population dynamics, providing a fundamental framework for modeling how sensory and other exogenous inputs shape activity in neural tissue. We study the controllability properties of Amari-type neural fields subject to piecewise/constant-in-time inputs. The model describes the time evolution of the polarization of neural tissue within a spatial continuum, with synaptic interactions represented by a convolution kernel. We study the synthesis of piecewise/constant-in-time inputs to achieve two-point boundary-type control objectives, namely, steering neural activity from an initial state to a prescribed target state. This approach is particularly relevant for predicting the emergence of paradoxical neural representations, such as discordant visual illusions that occur in response to overt sensory stimuli. We first present a control synthesis based on the Banach fixed-point theorem, which yields an iterative construction of a constant-in-time input under minimal regularity assumptions on the kernel and transfer function; however, it exhibits practical limitations, even in the linear case. To overcome these challenges, we then develop a generic synthesis framework based on the flow of neural dynamics drift, enabling explicit piecewise constant and constant-in-time inputs. Extensive numerical results in one and two spatial dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed syntheses and demonstrate their superior performance compared to inputs derived from naive linearization at the initial or target states when these states are not equilibria of the drift dynamics. By providing a mathematically rigorous framework for controlling Amari-type neural fields, this work advances our understanding of nonlinear neural population control with potential applications in computational neuroscience, psychophysics, and neurostimulation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22039">Predictive Coding Enhances Meta-RL To Achieve Interpretable Bayes-Optimal Belief Representation Under Partial Observability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability.

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG, we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in generalizable affective computing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22860">Far from the Shallow: Brain-Predictive Reasoning Embedding through Residual Disentanglement</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically, reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG) brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

                arXiv:2510.22913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Upper-limb weakness and tremor (4--12 Hz) limit activities of daily living (ADL) and reduce adherence to home rehabilitation. Objective: To assess technical feasibility and clinician-relevant signals of a sensor-fused wearable targeting the triceps brachii and extensor pollicis brevis. Methods: A lightweight node integrates surface EMG (1 kHz), IMU (100--200 Hz), and flex/force sensors with on-device INT8 inference (Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer) and a safety-bounded assist policy (angle/torque/jerk limits; stall/time-out). Healthy adults (n = 12) performed three ADL-like tasks. Primary outcomes: Tremor Index (TI), range of motion (ROM), repetitions (Reps min$^{-1}$). Secondary: EMG median-frequency slope (fatigue trend), closed-loop latency, session completion, and device-related adverse events. Analyses used subject-level paired medians with BCa 95\% CIs; exact Wilcoxon $p$-values are reported in the Results. Results: Assistance was associated with lower tremor prominence and improved task throughput: TI decreased by $-0.092$ (95\% CI [$-0.102$, $-0.079$]), ROM increased by $+12.65\%$ (95\% CI [$+8.43$, $+13.89$]), and Reps rose by $+2.99$ min$^{-1}$ (95\% CI [$+2.61$, $+3.35$]). Median on-device latency was 8.7 ms at a 100 Hz loop rate; all sessions were completed with no device-related adverse events. Conclusions: Multimodal sensing with low-latency, safety-bounded assistance produced improved movement quality (TI $\downarrow$) and throughput (ROM, Reps $\uparrow$) in a pilot technical-feasibility setting, supporting progression to IRB-approved patient studies. Trial registration: Not applicable (pilot non-clinical).

                arXiv:2502.01299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Listeners adapt language comprehension based on their mental representations of speakers, but how these representations are updated remains unclear. We investigated whether listeners probabilistically adapt comprehension based on the frequency of speakers making stereotype-incongruent statements. In two EEG experiments, participants heard speakers make stereotype-congruent or incongruent statements, with incongruency base rate manipulated. In Experiment 1, stereotype-incongruent statements decreased high-beta (21-30 Hz) and theta (4-6 Hz) oscillatory power in the low base rate condition but increased it in the high base rate condition. The theta effect varied with listeners' openness trait: less open-minded participants tended to show theta increases to stereotype incongruencies, while more open-minded participants tended to show theta decreases. In Experiment 2, we dissociated incongruency base rate from the target speaker by manipulating it using a non-target speaker and found that only the high-beta effect persisted. Our findings reveal two potential mechanisms: a speaker-general mechanism (indicated by high-beta oscillations) that adjusts overall expectations about hearing statements that violate social stereotypes, and a speaker-specific mechanism (indicated by theta oscillations) that updates a more detailed mental model specifically about an individual speaker. These findings provide evidence for how language processing interacts with social cognition.

                arXiv:2505.14806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hippocampus supports spatial navigation by encoding cognitive maps through collective place cell activity. We model the place cell population as non-negative spatial embeddings derived from the spectral decomposition of multi-step random walk transition kernels. In this framework, inner product or equivalently Euclidean distance between embeddings encode similarity between locations in terms of their transition probability across multiple scales, forming a cognitive map of adjacency. The combination of non-negativity and inner-product structure naturally induces sparsity, providing a principled explanation for the localized firing fields of place cells without imposing explicit constraints. The temporal parameter that defines the diffusion scale also determines field size, aligning with the hippocampal dorsoventral hierarchy. Our approach constructs global representations efficiently through recursive composition of local transitions, enabling smooth, trap-free navigation and preplay-like trajectory generation. Moreover, theta phase arises intrinsically as the angular relation between embeddings, linking spatial and temporal coding within a single representational geometry.

                arXiv:2505.17329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major goal of neuroscience is to understand brain computations during visual processing in naturalistic settings. A dominant approach is to use image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring estimation of a large number of linear encoding parameters, this approach ignores the structure of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed alternatives factor the linear mapping into separate sets of spatial and feature weights, thus finding static receptive fields for units, which is appropriate only for early visual areas. In this work, we employ the attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more interpretable as the attention-routing signals for different high-level categorical areas can be easily visualized for any input image. Given its high performance at predicting brain responses to novel images, the model deserves consideration as a candidate mechanistic model of how visual information from retinotopic maps is routed in the human brain based on the relevance of the input content to different category-selective regions.

                arXiv:2507.02064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and place cells in the hippocampus (HC) both form spatial representations. Grid cells fire in triangular grid patterns, while place cells fire at specific locations and respond to contextual cues. How do these interacting systems support not only spatial encoding but also internally driven path planning, such as navigating to locations recalled from cues? Here, we propose a system-level theory of MEC-HC wiring that explains how grid and place cell patterns could be connected to enable cue-triggered goal retrieval, path planning, and reconstruction of sensory experience along planned routes. We suggest that place cells autoassociate sensory inputs with grid cell patterns, allowing sensory cues to trigger recall of goal-location grid patterns. We show analytically that grid-based planning permits shortcuts through unvisited locations and generalizes local transitions to long-range paths. During planning, intermediate grid states trigger place cell pattern completion, reconstructing sensory experiences along the route. Using a single-layer RNN modeling the HC-MEC loop with a planning subnetwork, we demonstrate these effects in both biologically grounded navigation simulations using RatatouGym and visually realistic navigation tasks using Habitat Sim.

Abstract: Depression and suicidality affect cognitive and emotional processes, yet objective, task-evoked neural readouts of mental health remain limited. We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of affective semantic processing using multivariate decoding of time-resolved, 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Participants (N=137) performed a sentence-evaluation task with emotionally salient, self-referential statements. We identified robust neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with rapid, stimulus-driven semantic evaluation and conflict monitoring. Relative to healthy controls, individuals with depression and suicidal ideation showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization and enhanced contributions from frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and establishing a compact and interpretable EEG-based index of semantic-evaluation dynamics with potential diagnostic relevance.

Abstract: In this work, we present a network-specific approach for predicting brain responses to complex multimodal movies, leveraging the Yeo 7-network parcellation of the Schaefer atlas. Rather than treating the brain as a homogeneous system, we grouped the seven functional networks into four clusters and trained separate multi-subject, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models for each. This architecture supports cluster-specific optimization and adaptive memory modeling, allowing each model to adjust temporal dynamics and modality weighting based on the functional role of its target network. Our results demonstrate that this clustered strategy significantly enhances prediction accuracy across the 1,000 cortical regions of the Schaefer atlas. The final model achieved an eighth-place ranking in the Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge, with out-of-distribution (OOD) correlation scores nearly double those of the baseline model used in the selection phase.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for quantifying mental and emotional states over time by combining virtual reality (VR) exposure with EEG recordings. Participants experienced a stress-inducing work scenario in VR, originally designed as a training tool for bank employees, providing a controlled proxy for high-stakes situations. This setup enables integration of subjective emotional self-assessments with objective neural data, from which an algorithm was efficiently used to infer emotional states. Building on these measurements, we propose possible mathematical models to capture the temporal dynamics of mental states, offering a quantitative approach to studying emotional processing and informing adaptive training in complex environments.

Abstract: Inferring synaptic connectivity from neural population activity is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience, complicated by partial observability and mismatches between inference models and true circuit dynamics. In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data generated from ring attractor network models and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model reliably resolves spurious correlations and recovers accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.

                arXiv:2510.17154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When conflicting images are presented to either eye, binocular fusion is disrupted. Rather than experiencing a blend of both percepts, often only one eye's image is experienced, whilst the other is suppressed from awareness. Importantly, suppression is transient - the two rival images compete for dominance, with stochastic switches between mutually exclusive percepts occurring every few seconds with law-like regularity. From the perspective of dynamical systems theory, visual rivalry offers an experimentally tractable window into the dynamical mechanisms governing perceptual awareness. In a recently developed visual rivalry paradigm - tracking continuous flash suppression (tCFS) - it was shown that the transition between awareness and suppression is hysteretic, with a higher contrast threshold required for a stimulus to breakthrough suppression into awareness than to be suppressed from awareness. Here, we present an analytically-tractable model of visual rivalry that quantitatively explains the hysteretic transition between periods of awareness and suppression in tCFS. Grounded in the theory of neural dynamics, we derive closed-form expressions for the duration of perceptual dominance and suppression, and for the degree of hysteresis (i.e. the depth of perceptual suppression), as a function of model parameters. Finally, our model yields a series of novel behavioural predictions, the first of which - distributions of dominance and suppression durations during tCFS should be approximately equal - we empirically validate in human psychophysical data.

                arXiv:2502.19146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Conventional echo planar imaging(EPI) based functional MRI(fMRI) uses the BOLD contrast to map activity changes in human brains. Introducing an efficient ZTE sequence for functional brain mapping can help address limitations of EPI and demonstrate the feasibility of using T1 related changes as a surrogate marker of brain activity. Goals: To test and optimize ZTE sequence for fMRI. Methods: A ZTE sequence with radial inside out spokes was used to prepare a dynamic imaging protocol that matches conventional EPI time course. Temporal SNR and sensitivity to susceptibility differences of ZTE were evaluated and the sequence was benchmarked against BOLD EPI in a task based visual fMRI study with healthy volunteers at 3T. Results: Phantom measurements confirmed sensitivity of the ZTE protocol to the oxygen concentration. Functional activation in primary visual cortex could be detected using ZTE. Resting state networks could also be identified using independent component analysis. Discussion: ZTE-based fMRI is proposed for mapping functional activation in human brain. ZTE is robust against susceptibility artefacts and significantly reduces acoustic noise. Radial sampling pattern allows for high undersampling rates to increase temporal resolution.

                arXiv:2503.19586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice-based AI development faces unique challenges in processing both linguistic and paralinguistic information. This study compares how large audio-language models (LALMs) and humans integrate speaker characteristics during speech comprehension, asking whether LALMs process speaker-contextualized language in ways that parallel human cognitive mechanisms. We compared two LALMs' (Qwen2-Audio and Ultravox 0.5) processing patterns with human EEG responses. Using surprisal and entropy metrics from the models, we analyzed their sensitivity to speaker-content incongruency across social stereotype violations (e.g., a man claiming to regularly get manicures) and biological knowledge violations (e.g., a man claiming to be pregnant). Results revealed that Qwen2-Audio exhibited increased surprisal for speaker-incongruent content and its surprisal values significantly predicted human N400 responses, while Ultravox 0.5 showed limited sensitivity to speaker characteristics. Importantly, neither model replicated the human-like processing distinction between social violations (eliciting N400 effects) and biological violations (eliciting P600 effects). These findings reveal both the potential and limitations of current LALMs in processing speaker-contextualized language, and suggest differences in social-linguistic processing mechanisms between humans and LALMs.

Abstract: We propose a method for discovering and visualizing the differences between two learned representations, enabling more direct and interpretable model comparisons. We validate our method, which we call Representational Differences Explanations (RDX), by using it to compare models with known conceptual differences and demonstrate that it recovers meaningful distinctions where existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques fail. Applied to state-of-the-art models on challenging subsets of the ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, RDX reveals both insightful representational differences and subtle patterns in the data. Although comparison is a cornerstone of scientific analysis, current tools in machine learning, namely post hoc XAI methods, struggle to support model comparison effectively. Our work addresses this gap by introducing an effective and explainable tool for contrasting model representations.

                arXiv:2509.15328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion. Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

                arXiv:2510.21742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.

                arXiv:2409.01969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of the dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks often assume independent and identically distributed couplings, but large-scale connectomics data indicate that biological neural circuits exhibit markedly different connectivity properties. These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytical expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the Drosophila connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics.

Abstract: Despite substantial research into the biological basis of memory, the precise mechanisms by which experiences are encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain remain incompletely understood. A growing body of evidence supports the engram theory, which posits that sparse populations of neurons undergo lasting physical and biochemical changes to support long-term memory. Yet, a comprehensive computational framework that integrates biological findings with mechanistic models remains elusive. This work synthesizes insights from cellular neuroscience and computational modeling to address key challenges in engram research: how engram neurons are identified and manipulated; how synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to stable memory traces; and how sparsity promotes efficient, interference-resistant representations. Relevant computational approaches -- such as sparse regularization, engram gating, and biologically inspired architectures like Sparse Distributed Memory and spiking neural networks -- are also examined. Together, these findings suggest that memory efficiency, capacity, and stability emerge from the interaction of plasticity and sparsity constraints. By integrating neurobiological and computational perspectives, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for engram research and proposes a roadmap for future inquiry into the mechanisms underlying memory, with implications for the diagnosis and treatment of memory-related disorders.

                arXiv:2510.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have proven effective in exploring the vast solution spaces typical of graph-structured combinatorial problems. However, traditional encoding schemes, such as binary or numerical representations, often fail to straightforwardly capture the intricate structural properties of networks. Through employing the image-based encoding to preserve topological context, this study utilizes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as evolutionary operators to facilitate structure-aware optimization over graph data. To address the visual clutter inherent in large-scale network visualizations, we leverage graph sparsification techniques to simplify structures while maintaining essential structural features. To further improve robustness and mitigate bias from different sparsification views, we propose a cooperative evolutionary optimization framework that facilitates cross-domain knowledge transfer and unifies multiple sparsified variants of diverse structures. Additionally, recognizing the sensitivity of MLLMs to network layout, we introduce an ensemble strategy that aggregates outputs from various layout configurations through consensus voting. Finally, experiments on real-world networks through various tasks demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality and reliability of solutions in MLLM-driven evolutionary optimization.

                arXiv:2510.21908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models display in-context learning as an emergent effect of scale, but they rely on static weights during inference. In contrast, biological systems continually adapt via synaptic plasticity. We investigate whether explicit, biologically inspired plasticity can endow Transformers with faster in-sequence adaptation. To this end, we augment decoder-only Transformers with fast-weight modules updated either by (i) a neuromodulated Hebbian rule or (ii) the gradient-based plasticity mechanism of Duan et al. (2023). Across copying, regression, and few-shot classification tasks (CIFAR-FS, Omniglot), Hebbian plasticity consistently achieves lower loss and stronger few-shot generalization, while gradient-based updates perform best on long-horizon credit assignment. When associations are short and linearly separable, static weights suffice, defining a clear boundary condition for when plasticity helps. Analysis of learned modulatory signals reveals that gradient-based rules maintain large, persistent updates, whereas Hebbian plasticity is sharply gated around salient events. Together, these results show that explicit plasticity complements attention by enabling rapid, task-specific adaptation, and clarify when different plasticity mechanisms are most effective.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22800">Probing the Representational Geometry of Color Qualia: Dissociating Pure Perception from Task Demands in Brains and AI Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the computational underpinnings of subjective experience, or qualia, remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This project tackles this question by performing a rigorous comparison of the representational geometry of color qualia between state-of-the-art AI models and the human brain. Using a unique fMRI dataset with a "no-report" paradigm, we use Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare diverse vision models against neural activity under two conditions: pure perception ("no-report") and task-modulated perception ("report"). Our analysis yields three principal findings. First, nearly all models align better with neural representations of pure perception, suggesting that the cognitive processes involved in task execution are not captured by current feedforward architectures. Second, our analysis reveals a critical interaction between training paradigm and architecture, challenging the simple assumption that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training(CLIP) training universally improves neural plausibility. In our direct comparison, this multi-modal training method enhanced brain-alignment for a vision transformer(ViT), yet had the opposite effect on a ConvNet. Our work contributes a new benchmark task for color qualia to the field, packaged in a Brain-Score compatible format. This benchmark reveals a fundamental divergence in the inductive biases of artificial and biological vision systems, offering clear guidance for developing more neurally plausible models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839">Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.22839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.

                arXiv:2510.23383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention as energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), especially in resource-constrained settings. While ANN-to-SNN conversion (ANN2SNN) achieves high accuracy without end-to-end SNN training, existing methods rely on large time steps, leading to high inference latency and computational cost. In this paper, we propose a theoretical and practical framework for single-timestep ANN2SNN. We establish the Temporal-to-Spatial Equivalence Theory, proving that multi-timestep integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons can be equivalently replaced by single-timestep multi-threshold neurons (MTN). Based on this theory, we introduce the Scale-and-Fire Neuron (SFN), which enables effective single-timestep ($T=1$) spiking through adaptive scaling and firing. Furthermore, we develop the SFN-based Spiking Transformer (SFormer), a specialized instantiation of SFN within Transformer architectures, where spike patterns are aligned with attention distributions to mitigate the computational, energy, and hardware overhead of the multi-threshold design. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under single-timestep inference. Notably, we achieve 88.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K at $T=1$, surpassing existing conversion methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23407">Multi-Task Surrogate-Assisted Search with Bayesian Competitive Knowledge Transfer for Expensive Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.23407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for traditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls. Although surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for addressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to this challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability to leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately facilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making. However, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge transfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods in assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori transferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their imprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often necessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them inefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces a Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve multi-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously. Specifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian perspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence, enabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions, ultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively suppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various SAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically validated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority over peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios. The source code of our method is available at https://github.com/XmingHsueh/MSAS-BCKT.

                arXiv:2510.21969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting single-trial P300 from EEG is difficult when only a few labeled trials are available. When attempting to boost a small target set with a large source dataset through transfer learning, cross-dataset shift arises. To address this challenge, we study transfer between two public visual-oddball ERP datasets using five shared electrodes (Fz, Pz, P3, P4, Oz) under a strict small-sample regime (target: 10 trials/subject; source: 80 trials/subject). We introduce Adaptive Split Maximum Mean Discrepancy Training (AS-MMD), which combines (i) a target-weighted loss with warm-up tied to the square root of the source/target size ratio, (ii) Split Batch Normalization (Split-BN) with shared affine parameters and per-domain running statistics, and (iii) a parameter-free logit-level Radial Basis Function kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (RBF-MMD) term using the median-bandwidth heuristic. Implemented on an EEG Conformer, AS-MMD is backbone-agnostic and leaves the inference-time model unchanged. Across both transfer directions, it outperforms target-only and pooled training (Active Visual Oddball: accuracy/AUC 0.66/0.74; ERP CORE P3: 0.61/0.65), with gains over pooling significant under corrected paired t-tests. Ablations attribute improvements to all three components.

                arXiv:2510.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers face significant limitations under high-dynamic conditions, particularly in high-acceleration environments such as those experienced by launch vehicles. These performance degradations, often observed as discontinuities in the navigation solution, arise from the inability of traditional tracking loop bandwidths to cope with rapid variations in synchronization parameters. Software-Defined Radio (SDR) receivers overcome these constraints by enabling flexible reconfiguration of tracking loops; however, manual tuning involves a complex, multidimensional search and seldom ensures optimal performance. This work introduces a genetic algorithm-based optimization framework that autonomously explores the receiver configuration space to determine optimal loop parameters for phase, frequency, and delay tracking. The approach is validated within an SDR environment using realistically simulated GPS L1 signals for three representative dynamic regimes -guided rocket flight, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite, and static receiver-processed with the open-source GNSS-SDR architecture. Results demonstrate that evolutionary optimization enables SDR receivers to maintain robust and accurate Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) solutions across diverse dynamic conditions. The optimized configurations yielded maximum position and velocity errors of approximately 6 m and 0.08 m/s for the static case, 12 m and 2.5 m/s for the rocket case, and 5 m and 0.2 m/s for the LEO case.

                arXiv:2510.22503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties; and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics, energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation, memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

                arXiv:2510.22627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge-AI applications still face considerable challenges in enhancing computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments. This work presents RAMAN, a resource-efficient and approximate posit(8,2)-based Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) architecture designed to improve hardware efficiency within bandwidth limitations. The proposed REAP (Resource-Efficient Approximate Posit) MAC engine, which is at the core of RAMAN, uses approximation in the posit multiplier to achieve significant area and power reductions with an impact on accuracy. To support diverse AI workloads, this MAC unit is incorporated in a scalable Vector Execution Unit (VEU), which permits hardware reuse and parallelism among deep neural network layers. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm-hardware co-design framework incorporating approximation-aware training to evaluate the impact of hardware-level approximation on application-level performance. Empirical validation on FPGA and ASIC platforms shows that the proposed REAP MAC achieves up to 46% in LUT savings and 35.66% area, 31.28% power reduction, respectively, over the baseline Posit Dot-Product Unit (PDPU) design, while maintaining high accuracy (98.45%) for handwritten digit recognition. RAMAN demonstrates a promising trade-off between hardware efficiency and learning performance, making it suitable for next-generation edge intelligence.

                arXiv:2510.22984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries. ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs, including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances, yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data.

                arXiv:2510.23323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks (PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory. First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+ layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks. Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at scale.

                arXiv:2510.23379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and \textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order, and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for synthesis and wet-lab testing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23472">BBOPlace-Bench: Benchmarking Black-Box Optimization for Chip Placement</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.23472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip. The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO, especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23535">Sequential Multi-Agent Dynamic Algorithm Configuration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.23535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g., determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC (Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated algorithm configuration. Our code is available at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/seq-madac.

                arXiv:2507.18868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models struggle with systematic compositional generalization, a hallmark of human cognition. We propose \textsc{Mirage}, a neuro-inspired dual-process model that offers a processing account for this ability. It combines a fast, intuitive ``System~1'' (a meta-trained Transformer) with a deliberate, rule-based ``System~2'' (a Schema Engine), mirroring the brain's neocortical and hippocampal--prefrontal circuits. Trained to perform general, single-step decomposition on a stream of random grammars, Mirage achieves $>$99\% accuracy on all splits of the SCAN benchmark in a task-agnostic setting. Ablations confirm that the model's systematic behavior emerges from the architectural interplay of its two systems, particularly its use of explicit, prioritized schemas and iterative refinement. In line with recent progress on recursive/recurrent Transformer approaches, Mirage preserves an iterative neural update while externalizing declarative control into an interpretable schema module. Our work provides a concrete computational model for interpreting how compositional reasoning can arise from a modular cognitive architecture.

                In animal tissues, several cell types migrate along blood vessels, raising the possibility that blood flow influences cell migration. Here, we show that blood flow promotes the migration of new olfactory-bulb neurons in the adult mammalian brain. Neuronal migration is facilitated by blood flow, leading to accumulation of new neurons near blood vessels with abundant blood flow. Blood flow inhibition attenuates blood vessel-guided neuronal migration, suggesting that blood contains factors beneficial to neuronal migration. We found that ghrelin, which is increased in blood by hunger, directly influences neuronal migration. Ghrelin signaling promotes somal translocation by activating actin cytoskeleton contraction at the rear of the cell soma. New neurons mature in the olfactory bulb and contribute to the olfactory function for sensing odorants from food. Finally, we show that neuronal migration is increased by calorie restriction, and that ghrelin signaling is involved in the process. This study suggests that blood flow promotes neuronal migration through blood-derived ghrelin signaling in the adult brain, which could be one of the mechanisms that improves the olfactory function for food-seeking behavior during starvation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103592">Gene regulatory dynamics during craniofacial development in a carnivorous marsupial</a></h4>

              
                Marsupials and placental mammals exhibit significant differences in reproductive and life history strategies. Marsupials are born highly underdeveloped after an extremely short period of gestation, leading to prioritized development of structures critical for post-birth survival in the pouch. Critically, they must undergo accelerated development of the orofacial region compared to placentals. Previously, we described the accelerated development of the orofacial region in the carnivorous Australian marsupial, the fat-tailed dunnart <i>Sminthopsis crassicaudata</i>, that has one of the shortest gestations of any mammal. By combining genome comparisons of the mouse and dunnart with functional data for the enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, we investigated divergence of craniofacial regulatory landscapes between these species. This is the first description of genome-wide face regulatory elements in a marsupial, with 60,626 putative enhancers and 12,295 putative promoters described. We also generated craniofacial RNA-seq data for the dunnart to investigate expression dynamics of genes near predicted active regulatory elements. While genes involved in regulating facial development were largely conserved in mouse and dunnart, the regulatory landscape varied significantly. Additionally, a subset of dunnart-specific enhancers was associated with genes highly expressed only in dunnart relating to cranial neural crest proliferation, embryonic myogenesis, and epidermis development. Comparative RNA-seq analyses of facial tissue revealed dunnart-specific expression of genes involved in the development of the mechanosensory system. Accelerated development of the dunnart sensory system likely relates to the sensory cues received by the nasal–oral region during the postnatal journey to the pouch. Together, these data suggest that accelerated face development in the dunnart may be driven by dunnart-specific enhancer activity. Our study highlights the power of marsupial–placental comparative genomics for understanding the role of enhancers in driving temporal shifts in development.

">Voice Changes in Aging Birdsong: A Longitudinal Study in Adult Male Zebra Finches</a></h4>

              
                By 2030, 1.4 billion people worldwide will be 60 years or older. A significant proportion will experience changes in voice, which can indicate early signs of neurodegenerative disease. Most research and treatment studies have focused on the larynx because of its accessibility and known role in moderating pitch, loudness, and voice quality. Pre-clinical animal models offer important insight into brain mechanisms involved in aging vocalizations. Previously, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis in adult male zebra finches, discovering that song changes occur at transitional timepoints, between young adult, middle age, and older ages. Song changes are accompanied by re-organization of gene networks in a song-dedicated basal ganglia brain nucleus at middle age that degrade in old age. To more precisely examine how aging alters songs during these transitional timepoints, we followed individual male zebra finches longitudinally over adulthood. Measurements of aging human voice, including duration, intensity, smoothed cepstral peak prominence, and fundamental frequency (fo mean, median, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation), were carried out on birdsong syllables. Our results show that changes in fo mean and intensity are the measurements most sensitive to aging and consistent across multiple mornings in the finches. Notably, acoustic changes were also more pronounced in the transition from young adult to middle age, a time at which changes in aging voice also emerge. Our findings strengthen the validity of the finch model for use in aging research and motivate future investigations exploring the relative contributions of laryngeal and brain mechanisms to aging vocalizations.

">Dentate spikes comprise a continuum of relative input strength from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal dentate spikes (DS) are synchronous population events generated in the dentate gyrus thought to support memory processing. DS are classified into type 1 (DS1) and type 2 (DS2) based on current sinks in the outer or middle molecular layer, where the axons of the lateral or medial entorhinal cortex terminate, respectively. This widely used classification method constrains DS into a bimodal distribution without properly testing whether such constraint is appropriate. Here we utilized silicon probe recordings with high spatial resolution spanning all layers of the dentate gyrus and discovered that the contribution of LEC/MEC inputs to DS follows a continuous distribution. We introduce a third type (DS3) that captures a previously unreported component of the distribution: simultaneous current sinks in the outer/middle molecular layer, suggestive of synchronized activation from the LEC/MEC which could facilitate binding. We verify DS3 in several data sets from independent laboratories and characterize their brain state dependence and neural recruitment.

     alt="Endogenous Repair in Vanishing White Matter"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vanishing white matter is a leukodystrophy with remarkable regional variation in disease severity. The cerebral and cerebellar white matter chronically degenerates, while stress-induced episodes of rapid neurological deterioration coincide with the appearance of acute focal lesions in the deep gray structures and brainstem. With clinical recovery, these acute lesions spontaneously improve or completely resolve on magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting endogenous repair. Repair is not observed in cerebral and cerebellar white matter. Here, we investigated whether differences in cellular pathology might explain the regional variation in repair potential.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed the pathology of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, myelin and axons in postmortem human brain tissue of vanishing white matter patients, who died either during or long after episodes of clinical decline, and of controls. We compared the most severely affected frontal white matter with the least affected pons white matter.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the frontal white matter, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes were abnormal with evident failure of their mature functions, whereas in the pons white matter, their morphology was relatively preserved with evidence of better preserved functions, suggesting that differences in neuropathology underlie the divergent regional potential for intrinsic repair.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Loss of glial cell functions in the cerebral white matter relates to irreversible degeneration, whereas preserved glial functions and valid inflammatory response in the pons coincide with spontaneous repair in vanishing white matter. Unraveling the cellular behavior underlying the potential for repair in the pons could pave the way to novel treatment strategies for this still incurable disease. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>This study aims to examine the changes in AQP4 polarity and pericyte vascularity during temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) progression, with the goal of identifying potential drug targets or strategies to delay the onset and progression of TLE. Chronic TLE was induced in male rats using pilocarpine. AQP4 polarity and pericyte vascular coverage were assessed by immunofluorescence. The effects of modulating AQP4 polarity on PTZ-induced TLE model using male mice were studied. Molecular mechanisms of AQP4 polarity were explored using transwell coculture and transcriptomics, validated at the protein level. ELISA was used to measure PDGF-BB levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Following pilocarpine-induced chronic TLE model establishment, AQP4 polarity and pericyte vascular coverage rapidly increased but later declined, reaching the lowest levels in epileptic animals. Trifluoperazine prevented AQP4 redistribution, reduced seizure duration, and alleviated brain edema in PTZ-induced TLE mouse model. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that pericyte coculture did not alter the expression of dystrophin-associated protein components in astrocytes. Pericyte LAMA1 and LAMA2 levels were significantly higher than endothelial cells, and the levels of pericyte LAMA1 and LAMA2 were significantly increased after coculture with astrocytes. Expression of LAMA1 and LAMA2 around pericytes initially increased and then decreased during chronic TLE progression. PDGF-BB levels decreased over time, reaching the lowest levels during epilepsy. Disrupted AQP4 polarity is closely associated with TLE development. Pericyte vascular coverage appears to influence AQP4 polarity, and key molecules such as laminins and PDGF-BB may help maintain AQP4 polarity, potentially contributing to the attenuation of TLE progression and epileptogenesis.</p>

                <p>Humans rapidly update the control of an ongoing movement following changes in contextual parameters. This involves adjusting the controller to exploit redundancy in the movement goal, such as when reaching for a narrow or wide target, and adapting to dynamic changes such as velocity-dependent force fields (FFs). Although flexible control and motor adaptation are computationally distinct, the fact that both unfold within the same movement suggests that they interact functionally to support task-specific adjustments. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments combining changes in the target structure and a force field presented separately or in combination. Seventy-six human participants (both sexes) took part in this study, with each experiment involving different participants. They were asked to reach for a target that could change from a narrow square to a wide rectangle between or during trials. Step loads were used to assess whether participants exploited target redundancy. In a separate experiment, we added a force field in addition to target changes and step loads. Our results revealed a reduced ability to exploit target redundancy when sudden target changes occurred concurrently with FF adaptation. Furthermore, the magnitude of adaptation was reduced when step loads were added to the FF. Crucially, this interference emerged specifically when all perturbations impacted motor execution simultaneously. These results indicate that flexible control and motor adaptation interact in a nontrivial manner, suggesting interdependence between these behavioral mechanisms, and a clear identification of the timescale at which they are engaged&mdash;namely, during movement.</p>

                <p>by Ching-Mei Wen, Eleftherios Papoutsakis, Marianthi Ierapetritou</p>

Metabolic network modeling, especially Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), plays a critical role in systems biology by providing insights into cellular behaviors. Although FBA is the main tool for predicting flux distributions, it can face challenges capturing flux variations under different conditions. Selecting an appropriate objective function is therefore important for accurately representing system performance. To address this, we introduce a novel framework (e.g., TIObjFind) that imposes Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MPA) with Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to analyze adaptive shifts in cellular responses throughout different stages of a biological system. This framework determines Coefficients of Importance (CoIs) that quantify each reaction’s contribution to an objective function, aligning optimization results with experimental flux data. By examining Coefficients of Importance, TIObjFind enhances the interpretability of complex metabolic networks and provides insights into adaptive cellular responses.

                <p>by Yijun Mao, Yurong Weng, Jian Weng, Ming Li, Wanrong Gu, Rui Pang, Xudong Lin, Yunyan Xiong, Deyu Tang</p>

Accurately predicting the functions of multi-functional therapeutic peptides is crucial for the development of related drugs. However, existing peptide function prediction methods largely rely on either a single type of feature or a single model architecture, limiting prediction accuracy and applicability. Additionally, training better-performing models on datasets with class imbalance issues remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose the multi-functional therapeutic peptide of multi-feature fusion prediction (MFTP_MFFP) model, a novel method for predicting the functionality of multi-functional therapeutic peptides. This approach uses various encoding techniques to process peptide sequence data, generating multiple features that help the model learn hidden information within the sequences. To maximize the effectiveness of these features, we propose a gated feature fusion module that efficiently integrates them. The module assigns learnable gating weights to each feature, optimizing integration and enhancing fusion efficiency. The fused features are then passed into a neural network model for feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a marginal focal dice loss function (MFDL) to address the class imbalance and improve the model’s prediction performance. Experimental results show that the MFTP_MFFP model outperforms existing models in all evaluation metrics, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in multi-functional therapeutic peptide prediction tasks.

                <p>by Marc M. Himmelberg, Yuna Kwak, Marisa Carrasco, Jonathan Winawer</p>

Primary visual cortex (V1) has long served as a model system for understanding cortical organization. Although its structural and functional properties vary markedly across its surface, patterns of covariation suggest possible underlying constancies. Such constancies would imply that V1 is composed of multiple identical units whose visual properties differ only due to differences in their inputs. To test this, we used fMRI to investigate how V1 cortical magnification and preferred spatial frequency covary with eccentricity and polar angle, measured in 40 observers. V1 cortical magnification and preferred spatial frequency were strongly correlated across eccentricity and around polar angle, however their relation differed between these dimensions: they were proportional across eccentricity but not polar angle. The constant ratio of cortical magnification to preferred spatial frequency when measured as a function of eccentricity suggests a shared underlying cause of variation in the two properties, e.g., the gradient of retinal ganglion cell density across eccentricity. In contrast, the deviation from proportionality around polar angle implies that cortical variation differs from that in retina along this dimension. Thus, a constancy hypothesis is supported for one of the two spatial dimensions of V1, highlighting the importance of examining the full 2D-map to understand how V1 is organized.

Respiratory organoids have emerged as a powerful <i>in vitro</i> model for studying respiratory diseases and drug discovery. However, the high-throughput analysis of organoid images remains a challenge due to the lack of automated and accurate segmentation tools. This study presents a semi-automatic algorithm for image analysis of respiratory organoids (nasal and lung organoids), employing the U-Net architecture and CellProfiler for organoids segmentation. The algorithm processes bright-field images acquired through z-stack fusion and stitching. The model demonstrated a high level of accuracy, as evidenced by an intersection-over-union metric (IoU) of 0.8856, F1-score = 0.937 and an accuracy of 0.9953. Applied to forskolin-induced swelling assays of lung organoids, the algorithm successfully quantified functional differences in Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR)-channel activity between healthy donor and cystic fibrosis patient-derived organoids, without fluorescent dyes. Additionally, an open-source dataset of 827 annotated respiratory organoid images was provided to facilitate further research. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of high-throughput respiratory organoid analysis for future therapeutic screening applications.

                <p>by Li-Bo Zhang, Xin-Yi Geng, Li Hu</p>

Neural activity varies dramatically across time. While such neural variability has been associated with cognition, its relationship with pain remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically investigated the relationship between neural variability and pain, particularly individual differences in pain intensity discriminability, in six large electroencephalography (EEG) datasets (total <i>N</i> = 633), where healthy volunteers (Datasets 1–5; <i>N</i> = 606) and postherpetic neuralgia patients (Dataset 6; <i>N</i> = 27) received painful or nonpainful sensory stimuli. We found robust correlations between neural variability and interindividual pain intensity discriminability. These correlations were replicable in multiple datasets and seemed not to be caused by stimulus-general factors, as no significant correlations were observed in nonpain modalities. Importantly, variability and amplitude of EEG responses were mutually independent and had distinct temporal and oscillatory profiles in encoding pain intensity discriminability. These findings demonstrate that neural variability is a replicable and potentially preferential indicator of individual differences in pain intensity discriminability, thereby enhancing the understanding of neural encoding of pain intensity discriminability and underscoring the value of neural variability in pain studies.

                <p>by Sha Zhang, Davinder Singh, Yi-Hua Zhu, Katherine J. Zhang, Alejandro Melero, Sophie G. Martin, Jian-Qiu Wu</p>

Cytokinesis requires precise coordination of contractile-ring constriction, vesicle trafficking and fusion to the plasma membrane, and extracellular matrix assembly/remodeling at the cleavage furrow to ensure faithful cell division and maintain cell integrity. These processes and proteins involved are broadly conserved across eukaryotes, yet molecular mechanisms controlling the spatiotemporal pathways of membrane trafficking remain poorly understood. Here, using fission yeast genetics, microscopy, and in vitro binding assays, we identify a conserved module including the Munc13 protein Ync13, F-BAR protein Rga7, and coiled-coil protein Rng10 to be critical for precise and selective vesicle targeting to the plasma membrane during cytokinesis. The module specifically recruits the TRAPP-II but not the exocyst complex to tether vesicles containing the glucan synthases Bgs4 and Ags1 along the cleavage furrow. Ync13 subsequently interacts with the SM protein Sec1 for vesicle fusion. Mutations in this pathway disrupt septum integrity and lead to cell lysis. Our work provides key insights into how membrane trafficking is tightly controlled to maintain cell integrity during cytokinesis.

[version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Obesity is a major consequence of malnutrition and significantly contributes to the global burden of chronic diseases. Currently, there are more overweight and obese individuals than underweight individuals. Increased fiber intake can increase insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation. According to research studies, the average dietary fiber consumption is below the recommended value, and the WHO anticipates that the worldwide obesity prevalence has increased in the past ten years. Aim To evaluate the effect of high dietary fiber intake on insulin resistance, body composition, and weight in overweight and obese middle-aged women. Method This hospital-based study evaluated 500 people during phase 1 to identify the prevalence of insulin resistance among overweight and obese middle-aged women. An RCT with intervention and control arms for 180 individuals is being conducted in Phase 2 to determine the effect of increased dietary fiber consumption on insulin resistance, body composition, and weight in overweight or obese middle-aged women. In the intervention group, women were counselled for 15 min and given a tailored food chart including 40 g of fiber. Women in the control arm will receive a typical food care plan with 25 g of fiber, based on their health status. Each engaged woman received fiber nutritional empowerment. Discussion Increasing dietary fiber consumption can improve insulin resistance, body composition, and weight in middle-aged overweight and obese women. Trial registration The Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2022/01/039074) has registered this study as a clinical trial on January 3, 2022 http://ctri.nic.in

                Bioschemas is a community-driven initiative for enhancing the semantic description and interoperability of life science resources through standardized metadata vocabularies. While initially developed to address needs in diverse life science domains, Bioschemas offers significant untapped potential for improving data harmonization, discoverability, and reusability in fields such as biodiversity research. This white paper details the implementation of Bioschemas across the NFDI4Biodiversity consortium, a collaborative network within Germany’s National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) dedicated to improving findability, accessibility, and reusability of biodiversity data. We outline the motivations and strategic value behind adopting Bioschemas, including on the one hand increased discoverability for a diverse audience—from researchers and policymakers to the public and industry—via semantically enriched, machine-actionable metadata that meets FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. And on the other applying Bioschemas as a unifying, cross-disciplinary metadata approach aimed at improving interoperability within national and European data ecosystems such as the NFDI and EOSC and beyond. The paper outlines technical workflows, such as the automated transformation of established biodiversity metadata standards (e.g., ABCD) into Bioschemas-compliant representations, and their integration into core infrastructure components, including the consortium’s search and knowledge graph environments. Concrete implementation scenarios, challenges encountered, and harmonization efforts are presented alongside actionable recommendations for technical and non-technical audiences. The paper ultimately provides a transparent account of consortium-internal practices, strategies for community-wide adoption, and perspectives for ongoing development, positioning Bioschemas as a catalyst for open, interoperable, and future-ready biodiversity data infrastructures.

                Background Early adolescent sexual behavior has become an increasing concern in developmental psychopathology due to its complex interplay with psychosocial, familial, and individual factors. Previous studies highlight the role of peer norms, body image, and self-esteem in shaping sexual initiation, yet few have examined their combined effects alongside family functioning and emotional adjustment in preadolescent girls. The present study aimed to explore the relationships among peer pressure, body image, psychopathological symptoms, self-esteem, and family dynamics in predicting the age of sexual initiation. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted with 254 female students aged 11–16 years attending public middle schools. Participants completed standardized self-report measures assessing perceived peer pressure, body image satisfaction, psychopathological functioning, self-esteem, and family relationships. Correlational analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed to test both direct and mediated effects, with self-esteem and family functioning examined as key mediators. Results Peer pressure and psychopathological symptoms were positively associated with earlier sexual initiation, whereas higher self-esteem and positive family functioning were protective. Body image satisfaction positively influenced self-esteem and indirectly delayed sexual initiation. SEM indicated that psychopathology had both direct and indirect effects (via self-esteem and family functioning) on the timing of sexual behaviors. The model showed an acceptable fit to the data, explaining a substantial portion of the variance in age of initiation. Conclusion Early sexual behaviors among adolescent girls are shaped by a constellation of psychosocial and familial factors. Peer influence and emotional difficulties accelerate sexual onset, whereas strong self-esteem and cohesive family relationships exert protective effects. Interventions promoting self-worth, emotional regulation, and family communication may contribute to healthier developmental trajectories and delayed sexual initiation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1167/v1?src=rss">Endometrial Thickness as a Prognostic Marker in Premenopausal Abnormal Uterine Bleeding: Diagnostic Accuracy and Kaplan–Meier Survival Insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis assessed the association between ET and time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis. Results In total, 209 patients were included. Mean age was 45.7 ± 3.2 years. ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients. Incorporating ET into diagnostic algorithms may optimize triage, reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, and enhance timely cancer detection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99989">Tonotopy is not preserved in a descending stage of auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies based on layer specificity suggest that ascending signals from the thalamus to the sensory neocortex preserve spatially organized information, but it remains unknown whether sensory information descending from sensory neocortex to the thalamus also maintains such spatial organization pattern. By focusing on projection specificity, we mapped the tone response properties of two groups of cortical neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1), based on the relationship between their specific connections to other regions and their function in ascending (thalamocortical recipient [TR] neurons) or descending (corticothalamic [CT] neurons) auditory information. A clear tonotopic gradient was observed among TR neurons, but not CT neurons. Additionally, CT neurons exhibited markedly higher heterogeneity in their frequency tuning and had broader bandwidth than TR neurons. These results reveal that the information flow descending from A1 to the thalamus via CT neurons is not arranged tonotopically, suggesting that the descending information flow possibly contributes to higher-order feedback processing of diverse auditory inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94900">The holocephalan ratfish endoskeleton shares trabecular and areolar mineralization patterns, but not tesserae, with elasmobranchs little skate and catshark</a></h4>

              
                Specific character traits of mineralized endoskeletal tissues need to be clearly defined and comprehensively examined among extant chondrichthyans (elasmobranchs, such as sharks and skates, and holocephalans, such as chimaeras) to understand their evolution. For example, tiles of mineralized polygonal structures called tesserae occur at cartilage surfaces in chondrichthyans, but recent studies showing trabecular mineralization at elasmobranch cartilage surfaces suggest that tesserae are not as common as previously thought. Also, while areolar mineralized tissue in elasmobranchs is generally considered a unique, shared chondrichthyan feature, some chondrichthyan species demonstrate bone-like tissues in both a specific region of tesserae termed the cap zone and continuous (not tiled) mineralized neural arches. To clarify the distribution of specific endoskeletal features among extant chondrichthyans, adult skeletal tissues in a holocephalan chimaera (spotted ratfish) and two elasmobranchs (small-spotted catshark and little skate) were characterized using synchrotron radiation and desktop micro-CT imaging, and histological and immunofluorescent assays. Endoskeletal mineralization in the ratfish, catshark, and little skate varied both quantitively in tissue mineral density (TMD) and qualitatively in the morphology and localization of mineralized structures and tissues. For example, TMD of several skeletal elements was significantly lower in ratfish, compared to catshark and little skate. Trabecular and areolar mineralization were shared among these extant chondrichthyan species, but tesserae and bone-like tissues were not. Interestingly, three separate analyses argued that the adult chimaera endoskeleton has features of the embryonic little skate endoskeleton. Generally, this study proposes specific terminology for character states of the extant chondrichthyan endoskeleton and infers those states in ancestral chondrichthyans with reference to fossil data.

                Endotherms increase the rate of metabolism in metabolic organs as one strategy to cope with a decline in the temperature of the external environment. However, an additional major contributor to maintenance of body temperature in a cold environment is contraction-based thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. Here, we show that impairment of hind limb muscle contraction by cast immobilization induced a loss of function of skeletal muscle and activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis as a compensatory mechanism. BAT utilizes free branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) derived from skeletal muscle as an energy substrate for thermogenesis, and interleukin-6 released by skeletal muscle stimulates BCAAs production in muscle for support of BAT thermogenesis. Additionally, this thermoregulatory system between BAT and skeletal muscle may also play an important role in response to cold temperatures or acute stress. Our findings suggest that BAT and skeletal muscle cooperate to maintain body temperature in endotherms.

">INPP5D/SHIP1 is a dual regulator of endo-lysosome function and selective phagocytosis in human microglia</a></h4>

              
                INPP5D, the gene encoding SHIP1, is genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and plays a central role in regulating immune function. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which SHIP1 mediates its role in suppressing inflammatory pathways, with a focus on human microglia. Our findings illuminate an essential role for SHIP1 in endosome maturation and lysosomal function. We show that SHIP1 localizes to both the plasma membrane and to endo-lysosomal compartments and binds to the CapZ family of proteins, which are important for endosome maturation. Reduction of SHIP1 levels via genome editing impairs endosome maturation and lysosomal function, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and leakage of lysosomal cathepsin B into the cytosol, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. CITE-seq profiling of SHIP1-deficient microglia revealed a shift from an immune-responsive state toward a DAM-like, phagocytic state, accompanied by impaired response to LPS and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic material and apoptotic neurons via TREM2. While amyloid {beta} uptake was not affected, amyloid {beta} accumulated intracellularly due to defective lysosomal degradation, further driving lipid droplet formation. Together, these results identify SHIP1 as a regulator of endo-lysosomal function and selective phagocytosis of lipid-rich substrates in microglia. These findings have important implications for therapeutic hypotheses that target SHIP1 for treatment of AD, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

">The Effect of Physical Activity Level on Age-Related Differences in Responses to Optic Flow Perturbation during Human Walking</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human aging increases the reliance on vision for walking balance due to age-related declines in proprioceptive and vestibular function. Regular physical activity (PA) may reduce the reliance on visual input during walking. This study examined whether PA levels modulate age-related responses to perturbations of the optic flow that is crucial in the control of human locomotion. Methods: Sixty active and inactive younger (YA and YI: 23.3+/-3.91 y) and older adults (OA and OI: 68.3+/-3.98 y; n=15 for each group) walked on a treadmill in front of a virtual hallway. The walking protocol consisted of 3-minute walking without, and 8-minute with mediolateral optic flow perturbation. Sacrum and heel marker positions and ground reaction forces were recorded. Power spectral density (PSD) of the mediolateral sacrum position and gait parameters were analyzed. Results: The PSD increased more in OA compared to OI adults (p=0.041) while YA and YI adults did not differ. Mean (and variability of) step width and mediolateral margin of stability increased irrespective of age and PA (all p<0.001). During the 8-minute perturbation, OA adults demonstrated greater decreases in PSD than the OI adults (p=0.039). Additionally, the variability in the mediolateral margin of stability reduced more in YA and OA adults compared to YI and OI adults (p=0.048). Conclusion: Higher PA levels in OA adults were associated with stronger immediate responses in body sway to optic flow perturbations compared to older inactive and younger adults. This may support the beneficial effects of physical activity on age-related visual dependency during gait.

">Neuronal glycolytic reprogramming drives lethality via accelerated aging in a Drosophila model of tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Neurometabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tauopathies. Whether these changes drive pathology or represent compensatory, protective responses remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that human tau induces Warburg-like metabolism in Drosophila neurons, characterized by coordinated upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase that mirrors metabolic signatures in human AD. Despite intact mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, tau-expressing fly neurons preferentially utilize glycolysis for ATP production and operate with diminished metabolic reserve. Crucially, this metabolic reprogramming drives rather than protects against pathology as genetic suppression of glycolysis or lactate dehydrogenase completely rescued tau-induced lethality. Further, Gompertz mortality analysis revealed that hyperactive glycolysis in tau neurons drives premature lethality by accelerating biological aging rate without affecting baseline mortality. Collectively, these findings establish aberrant neuronal glycolysis as a cause rather than a consequence of tau pathology, and demonstrate that sustained glycolytic metabolism in mature neurons exacts a specific cost in the form of accelerated aging.

">Cognitive modes involved in emotion regulation identified using Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA)</a></h4>

              
                Meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified networks of widely distributed brain regions supporting emotion regulation. These overlap with attentional or cognitive control brain networks. The literature is short on data speaking to specific neurocognitive functions of these broad brain networks in reappraisal - a key emotion regulatory strategy involving the reframing of an event according to a goal to increase or decrease experienced emotion. We address this gap by examining both the spatial configuration and temporal profile of event-related blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses during a task requiring reappraisal. We analysed fMRI datasets obtained from 84 participants (51% female) who were instructed to increase or decrease their emotional response to unpleasant images. We extracted spatial maps and their estimated temporal event-related BOLD signal changes of four components with the highest loadings. Neurocognitive functions were derived by mapping each component onto templates of previously identified task-based cognitive modes. This analysis yielded four cognitive modes: 1) multiple demand, 2) response, 3) re-evaluation, and 4) default mode. The temporal profiles showed particularly prominent patterns for the increase and decrease conditions in multiple demand (mode 1) and re-evaluation (mode 3) respectively. These findings highlight a central role for specific neurocognitive processes linked to attentional control (multiple demand) and switching (re-evaluation), as part of the broad brain networks supporting reappraisal. Moreover, the level of neural engagement of these cognitive modes varies depending on the regulatory goal. These findings provide tangible targets for neurocognitive interventions such as neurostimulation when emotion regulation is compromised.

">Cortical neuroprostheses improve auditory coding and perception compared to cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear implants have transformed the treatment of hearing loss by enabling auditory perception through direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, their effectiveness can be limited in noisy environments, for fine frequency resolution, and in patients lacking an intact auditory nerve. The auditory cortex offers a promising alternative target for neuroprosthetic stimulation, but it remains unclear whether direct cortical input can evoke percepts with the complexity and structure of natural sounds. Here we show that surface cortical implants in mice support robust and flexible auditory behaviour, surpassing cochlear implants in tasks requiring fine spectral, temporal, and noise-resistant discrimination. We also show that animals generalize seamlessly between cortical and acoustic stimuli without additional training, indicating that cortical stimulation can generate interpretable, sound-like percepts. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that cortical stimulation drives spatially and temporally structured neural activity in auditory cortex, resembling responses to natural sound. These findings establish that the auditory cortex can interpret spatially and temporally patterned electrical input in a behavioural relevant way. By linking neuroprosthetic stimulation to naturalistic neural representations and behavioural generalization, this work provides a mechanistic and functional foundation for cortical auditory neuroprostheses and points toward new strategies for restoring hearing through direct brain stimulation.

">A non-human primate model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Approximately 97% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of the ubiquitous nuclear protein, TDP-43. Current rodent models of this disease fail to replicate the progressive motor weakness and characteristic histopathology, possibly because of fundamental neuroanatomical and genetic differences between rodents and humans. In this study, the TDP-43 protein was overexpressed in the motor neuron pool of the brachioradialis muscle unilaterally in two six-year-old female rhesus macaques, using an intersectional genetics approach involving infection with genetically modified adeno-associated virus. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated delayed signal hyperintensities limited to the injected brachioradialis that persisted for 6-7 weeks, consistent with motor neuron degeneration and denervation of the targeted muscle. At post-mortem, the virus-mediated focal protein overexpression event was found to induce widespread deposits of pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 throughout the cervical spinal cord and motor cortex bilaterally, indicating an ALS-like spread of proteinopathy from the transfection site.

">Self-esteem modulates beneficial causal attributions in the formation of novel self-beliefs</a></h4>

              
                Healthy individuals typically attribute successes to internal causes, such as their abilities, and failures to external factors, like bad luck. In contrast, individuals with depression and low self-esteem are more likely to attribute failures to internal causes and successes to external causes. At the same time, depression and low self-esteem are associated with negatively biased self-related learning and self-beliefs. Although causal attributions have been shown to influence belief formation and updating, the dynamic interaction between real-time attributions and self-related learning remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a validated self-related learning task to investigate how internal versus external attributions of performance feedback affect the formation of self-beliefs and how these processes relate to depressive symptoms and self-esteem. Drawing on a computational model that incorporates prediction error valence and causal attributions, we found that participants updated their self-beliefs less when feedback was attributed to external causes. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem showed a stronger negativity bias in learning. Lower self-esteem was also linked to a reduced self-serving bias in attributions. These findings provide insight into the cognitive mechanisms that may contribute to the development and maintenance of negative self-beliefs commonly observed in depression.

">Refinement of locomotor activity is developmentally regulated by dopaminergic signaling in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The refinement of gross motor skills, such as locomotion, during development is conserved across vertebrate species. Our previous work demonstrated, in larval zebrafish, that dopaminergic signaling through the dopamine D2-like family of receptors, specifically the dopamine 4 receptor subtype, was necessary for the developmental transformation of behaviorally relevant locomotor activity from an immature to a mature pattern between 3- and 4-days post-fertilization. In this study, we used a complement of tools, including electrophysiology, pharmacology, in vivo calcium imaging, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to characterize the functional and molecular mechanisms responsible for this dopaminergic-mediated refinement of spinal locomotor activity. The results demonstrate that the dopamine 4 receptor subtype is both present and functional in, at least, a subset of immature larvae. Further, gene expression of all D2-like receptor subtypes, levels of dopamine, and activity of diencephalic dopaminergic neurons are significantly greater in mature larvae compared to immature larvae. The integration of these results provides evidence for the developmental role of dopaminergic signaling, specifically the dopamine receptor 4 subtype, in the refinement of locomotor activity in vertebrates.

">The Intermediate CA1 and CA3 Subfields of the Hippocampus Differentially Encode Social Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Social recognition requires linking information about others to the spatial contexts in which they are encountered, a computation thought to engage the hippocampus. Although this process depends on coordinated activity across the hippocampal network, how specific subfields differentially contribute to social recognition remains unclear. Here, we performed one-photon calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to record endogenous activity from the intermediate CA1 (iCA1) and the intermediate CA3 (iCA3) during a novel behavioral paradigm that disentangles social identity from spatial position. Neurons in both subfields encoded social and spatial variables, but iCA3 neurons more robustly discriminated between novel and familiar conspecifics, suggesting that iCA3 neurons more strongly encoded social novelty than those in the iCA1. In contrast, iCA1 neurons more robustly encoded spatial position, indicating distinct roles for these subfields in processing social-context sensitive information. Longitudinal tracking further revealed that social representations remapped across days in both subfields, whereas spatial representations remained stable. These results identify the iCA3 as a key locus for social novelty encoding and suggest a functional division of labor within the hippocampus, in which stable spatial frameworks in the iCA1 anchor flexible, context-dependent social representations in the iCA3 that support adaptive social memory.

">Intracellular Regulation of a Serotonin-Gated Ion Channel Links Receptor Trafficking to Memory</a></h4>

              
                Learning and memory arise from synaptic plasticity, the ability of neurons to modify connectivity through experience-dependent changes in receptor localisation and signalling. Here, we identify a short intracellular motif within the serotonin-gated ion channel LGC-50 that links molecular receptor dynamics to behavioural plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Deletion of residues 363-379 in the intracellular M3-4 loop caused receptor clustering in intracellular compartments and abolished learning-induced redistribution without altering receptor function or immediate memory recall. Interestingly, animals expressing the truncated receptor failed to retrieve aversive memories one hour after training, revealing a role for receptor trafficking in memory stability. Combining molecular, ultrastructural and behavioural analyses in vivo, we show how intracellular receptor motifs govern experience-dependent plasticity. These findings demonstrate that precise receptor localisation and trafficking shape neural circuit adaptation and reveal a conserved mechanism by which receptor dynamics support the persistence and retrieval of memory across species.

">A neurophysiological alignment metric reveals a supportive role of unexpected stimuli in naturalistic language comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Individuals use language every day to communicate their thoughts, emotions and expectations to those around them. Communication also incorporates receiving continuous and complex streams of information, not all of which is easily predictable. The memory literature suggests that this unexpected information may be processed more effectively when an individual possesses an adequate schema of the local context. We propose that, in language comprehension, we can determine the presence of a relevant scheme via an alignment metric, which compares an individual's brain response to language (N400 amplitudes) with an expected response as determined by the probabilistic contingencies of the current context (surprisal). When alignment is higher, an individual's internal model of the world is assumed to closely mirror the environment, constituting an effective schema. The present study sought to explore how individuals process unexpected information and whether successful comprehension is related to the alignment of internal predictive models to the external environment. It was hypothesised that higher alignment would support better comprehension of unexpected information than lower alignment. 40 participants (27F; mean age: 24.6 years; SD: 5.94) listened to 12 short stories (3 genres, audio presentation) while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Comprehension was tested via 6 multiple choice questions per story. A comprehension linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was computed for two regions of interest and two predictability metrics (N400 amplitudes and surprisal). A functional role of unexpectedness was demonstrated in all four models, where greater unexpectedness was related to higher comprehension scores. In one model we observed a significant interaction between alignment and average N400 amplitudes, indicating that comprehension was better for more unexpected stories when there was lower alignment to expected contextual probabilities. Our results suggest that individuals can utilise unexpected information to support language comprehension and that there are conditions where successful integration of this information is more likely. Contrary to our expectations, lower alignment to the current probabilistic conditions led to a greater capacity to utilise unexpected information. Future research should explore whether lower alignment reflects an individual's openness to integrate new information into existing schemas and how this impacts comprehension of unexpected language.

">Neural correlates of transitions between internal and external cognitive domains</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition involves continuous transitions between processing information guided by the external world and engaging with internally-generated thoughts, yet research has predominantly investigated switching based on external rules. We therefore examined neural mechanisms underlying external and internal domain switching using independent groups of EEG (N=46) and fMRI (N=60) in a colour judgement task requiring evaluations based on either colour similarity (external domain) or colour preference (internal domain) through switching on a trial-by-trial basis. ERPs revealed amplitude differences between the two judgements as well as switching and repeated trials. EEG analysis revealed a sustained neural differentiation between switch and repeated trials, specifically during similarity judgments, with effects lasting from early time points through the entire trial duration. fMRI showed similarity judgements engaged visual and motor regions during switching, while preference judgements showed minimal subcortical activation for repeated trials. These findings demonstrate that external and internal cognitive domain switching effects are asymmetrical. These findings provide the first temporal and spatial neural characterisation of domain switching between processing information guided by the external world and internally-generated thoughts, indicating that shifting between internal and external domains involves mechanisms distinct from traditional external rule-switching paradigms.

">Brain Entropy: Linking Brain Structure to Task Activation</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain's complex and diverse functions emerge from its structure has long been a central goal of neuroscience. Entropy, a measure of system irregularity, has become a powerful tool for quantifying the dynamics of brain activity. While previous fMRI-based brain entropy (BEN) studies have established its relationships with brain morphology (e.g., gray matter volume, GMV) and task activation, the pathway from structure to function remains incompletely understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether controlling for brain morphology (GMV) significantly alters the observed BEN-task activation relationship. In this study, we first replicated key prior findings, including the effects of sex and age on BEN and GMV, their spatial and brain-wide voxel-wise correlations, and the relationship between BEN and task activation across social cognition, reward, and emotion tasks. Subsequently, we examined the correlation between GMV and task activation, as well as the correlation between BEN and task activation after controlling for GMV. Our results successfully replicated previous findings. Crucially, the relationship between BEN and task activation remained largely unchanged after controlling for GMV. This indicates that BEN captures unique variance in task activation beyond what is explained by GMV alone, establishing BEN as a functional bridge linking brain structure to task activation. Future work should employ predictive analyses to quantify the added value of BEN in predicting task activation from structural information.

">Symmetric brain-liver circuits mediate lateralized regulation of hepatic glucose output</a></h4>

              
                Hemispheric lateralization is well recognized in regulating contralateral somatic movement, yet its relevance to visceral organ regulation remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate whether cerebral hemispheres differentially regulate hepatic glucose metabolism and localize the site of sympathetic crossover to the liver. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) tracing demonstrated symmetric projections from the paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) with preferential innervation of contralateral hepatic lobes. Unilateral LPGi activation elevated systemic glucose through enhanced glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in contralateral lobes, whereas bilateral activation produced additive effects. Following unilateral hepatic denervation, contralateral LPGi activation induced metabolic compensation in the remaining innervated lobes, characterized by increased sympathetic release, glucose production, and glycogen depletion. Whole-mount clearing and dual tracing localized the sympathetic crossover to the porta hepatis, and developmental analysis showed lobar innervation along the vasculature emerging at postnatal week 2. These findings demonstrate that the brain exerts lobe-specific, lateralized control of hepatic glucose metabolism via symmetric brain-liver sympathetic pathways. Contralateral regulation arises from peripheral decussation at the porta hepatis, and compensatory activation following denervation reveals an intrinsic neuroadaptive mechanism that safeguards systemic glucose homeostasis.

                CA1 place fields support spatial maps critical for memory, yet how bilateral CA3 inputs shape these maps during learning remains unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetic inhibition in head-fixed mice navigating a virtual track, we examined left and right CA3 projections to right CA1 (CA1R) as animals familiarized to a novel environment. CA1R maps were initially inaccurate but stabilized after ~10 laps, defining an early-phase of map refinement followed by a late-phase of stability. During the early-phase, right CA3 inputs predominantly drove refinement, whereas left CA3 inputs controlled stability later. These effects arose at the single-cell level, with right CA3 inputs driving high-amplitude, reliable fields early and left inputs supporting reliable fields later. Axonal recordings revealed a matching shift: right CA3 axons showed greater place-field activity and reliability early, whereas left CA3 axons became more reliable later. Thus, CA3 input dominance transitions from right to left, coordinating CA1R map refinement and stabilization.

">Leveraging the salivary microbiome profile to stratify REM sleep behavior disorder and synucleinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Few studies have explored noninvasive biomarkers of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and rapid-eye-movement behavior disorder (RBD), a prodromal stage for these conditions. Human oral/salivary microbiomes are altered in PD, highlighting their potential role in both PD pathogenesis and diagnosis. We analyzed 249 salivary microbiomes of controls and patients with idiopathic RBD and various synucleinopathies, including two subgroups divided based on the presence of RBD symptoms, through both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The microbiome composition was strikingly similar between patients with RBD and early PD exhibiting RBD symptoms. The area under the curve range for distinguishing RBD from controls and each synucleinopathy was 0.85-0.94. We further performed pseudotime trajectory analysis of the microbiome compositional space; populations with low diversity, enriched Streptococcus, and depleted Neisseria exhibited a brief pseudotime transition from RBD to early PD. Our findings suggest that early PD-like salivary dysbiosis manifests during RBD, allowing for the stratification of synucleinopathies through the innovative use of salivary microbiome profiles.

">skiftiTools: An R package for reading, writing, analysing, and visualising, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) derived diffusion MR images</a></h4>

              
                skiftiTools processes three- and four-dimensional neuroimaging data, facilitating advanced statistical modelling with voxelwise data in any software of choice. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) is a conventionally used tool to make statistical calculations in voxel space for brain imaging data. While pre-existing software packages provide support for general linear model based statistics, there is a clear need for more sophisticated modeling. skiftiTools writes subject-per-volume NIfTI files as tab-separated value ASCII files, which are easily readable by most commonly used statistical tools such as R language (RStudio), SPSS, SAS, and GraphPad Prism. This facilitates a wide range of voxel-level statistical analyses from TBSS data, including estimation of standardised effect sizes, clustering, dimensionality reduction, non-linear and machine learning predictive modelling, which we showcase in this article using FinnBrain and developing Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI data. After statistical processing, the resulting ASCII data can then be read again for visualization. The package supports NIfTI image format, tab-separated ASCII format, and its own stand-alone format for efficient disk usage. It is open source (https://github.com/haanme/skiftiTools), built on R-language and has easy installation from CRAN package repository. In addition, we provide basic functions available in Docker containers for further platform independence.

">High frequency oscillations measured with optically pumped magnetometers from the human retina</a></h4>

              
                Measurement of human neural activity with optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) is rapidly proliferating, with sensitivity approaching that of cryogenic sensors. Most neuroscience research with OPMs to date has investigated neural responses below 70 Hz, but higher frequencies are also of interest. However, sensitivity to higher frequencies may be limited by both the inherent operating bandwidth of the current generation of zero-field OPMs as well as by their generally lower amplitude. To assess the upper bounds of OPM sensitivity we used the stereotypical retinal response to flashes of light. Retinal responses to light flashes characteristically exhibit a neural response above 70 Hz called the oscillatory potential (OP) when recorded with electroretinography (ERG). Here we adopt the term retinal high frequency oscillation (rHFO) to include measurement of similar activity with OPMs. Our comparison of magnetoretinography (MRG) and ERG shows that rHFO can be measured up to 140 Hz using rubidium-based zero-field OPMs.

">Inhibitory control and error processing in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A mega-analysis of task-based fMRI data by the ENIGMA-OCD consortium</a></h4>

              
                Objective Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition in which impaired inhibitory control and excessive error monitoring may contribute to the maintenance of obsessions and compulsions. This mega-analysis investigates neural activation during response inhibition and error processing using adult and pediatric data from the ENIGMA-OCD consortium and the ABCD study. Methods Individual participant data was uniformly processed using HALFpipe to extract statistical maps for response inhibition and error processing contrasts. Bayesian multilevel models were used to assess regional and whole-brain effects of OCD, with additional analyses examining the association between the OCD clinical profile and task-related activation. Results Across inhibitory control tasks, both individuals with OCD and control participants showed robust activation in regions implicated in response inhibition and error processing. During response inhibition, compared to controls, adults with OCD showed stronger somatomotor cortex activation, while children with OCD showed stronger occipital cortex activation. Children with likely OCD from the ABCD cohort showed reduced activity in the frontoparietal network in the anterior insula/frontal operculum region. During error processing, relative to controls, adults with OCD showed weaker activation in fronto-striatal regions, while children with OCD showed stronger activation in frontoparietal and attention networks. Greater OCD symptom severity was associated with weaker task-related activation in adults and stronger activation in children during response inhibition. Conclusion Case-control differences in brain activation during inhibitory control varied by age group and task contrast. Symptom severity emerged as the main clinical correlate of activation during inhibition, suggesting that inhibitory control deficits in OCD may be both state-dependent and developmentally specific.

">Quantifying Structure-Function Coupling in the Human Brain using Variational Graph Contrastive Learning</a></h4>

              
                This study proposes a novel method based on variational graph contrastive learning to quantify structure-function coupling at the regional level of the brain. We obtained whole-cortex scale structural connectivity matrices from publicly available studies and constructed matched functional connectivity matrices using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project (HCP). The core of the model is a dual-branch variational graph convolutional network, which aligns the latent representations of the same brain region across structural and functional modalities via contrastive learning, augmented with distance constraints and regularization. We define the Gaussian kernel output of the latent representations of a brain region in structural and functional connectivity as its structure-function coupling (SFC). The results indicate that the SFC is strongest in the Visual network and weakest in the Orbito-affective network, with its distribution pattern aligning with known cognitive hierarchy principles. Further ablation experiments and single run experiments validate the effectiveness of the model components and the robustness of the SFC metric. This study provides a new computational framework for extracting stable multimodal coupling features from complex brain network data.

">Recapitulating Parkinson's pathology in human iPSC dopaminergic neurons reveals new mechanistic insights into Lewy body formation and heterogeneity.</a></h4>

              
                The accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) into intraneuronal inclusions of heterogeneous morphology, known as Lewy bodies (LB), is one of the defining diagnostic features of Parkinson's disease (PD); yet, our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning their formation and heterogeneity remains incomplete. Here, we present a human isogenic iPSC-derived dopaminergic neuron (iDA) model that faithfully recapitulates the diverse biochemical, morphological, and ultrastructural features of LB neuropathology in PD. Unlike other iDA seeding models, our model does not rely on aSyn overexpression, mutations, or genetic engineering, making it a more physiologically relevant system for studying PD. We demonstrate that the iDA model accurately reproduces the temporal relationships between neuritic and cell-body aSyn pathology, recapitulating the full biochemical spectrum, post-translational modifications (PTM), and morphological diversity of aSyn aggregates found in human PD tissue. Moreover, our work provides critical insight into how different pathways to aSyn fibrillization and the complex interaction between aSyn fibrils and membranous organelles influence the morphological diversity of LB-like inclusions. This model represents a versatile platform for investigating the mechanisms of pathology formation, maturation, and neuronal dysfunction, as well as supporting the development of diagnostics that capture the diversity of aSyn pathology in PD and related synucleinopathies.

">Maturation of the glymphatic system confers innate resistance of the brain to Zika virus infection</a></h4>

              
                The maturation of the glymphatic system initiates fluid dynamics in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate that the initiating glymphatic function results in a steep reduction in the susceptibility of the CNS to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. In mice, ZIKV injection before glymphatic system maturation leads to widespread infection, vascular deformation, and disruption of Aqp4+ astrocytic networks. After the glymphatic system formation, the same challenge fails to cause disease or persistent infection. Pharmacological inhibition of vasopressin receptor 1a, which reduces perivascular fluid dynamics, reopens the window of susceptibility to ZIKV-related disease. These findings reveal the glymphatic system as an innate protective barrier that limits viral spread in the brain parenchyma and suggest a possible explanation for why late-gestation human fetuses and newborns are less susceptible to ZIKV. Moreover, these data indicate that children with ZIKV-caused malformations can have continuous brain inflammation due to a defective glymphatic system.

">Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials as Readouts for Abnormal GSK3β Activity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Glycogen synthase kinase 3{beta} (GSK3{beta}) is important in neuronal development and maintenance, acting as a key regulator by controlling a broad range of cellular processes. The effects of its dysregulation range from impairments in axonal transport and energy metabolism to synapse formation and neuronal plasticity. However, how such cellular defects link to neuronal dysfunction is less well studied despite the links between GSK3{beta} and various neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, mood disorders and autism. Here we used a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) assay with Drosophila to measure the effect of altering GSK3{beta} expression on neuronal function. We recorded SSVEPs from flies that expressed constitutively active or inactive (kinase-dead) variants of GSK3{beta} and showed that the visual responses of these flies differed from those of controls. This was indicated by increased response latency and reduced photoreceptor maximum response (Rmax). Importantly, multivariate pattern classification can distinguish between over- and inactive GSK3{beta} conditions. Taken together, we show that SSVEPs provide a powerful tool for future studies to link the molecular and cellular functions of GSK3{beta} with their effects on neuronal function. Furthermore, we introduce a monitoring protocol that ensures the quality of datasets to support future fly SSVEP experiments.

">The Affects of Central Vision Loss on Emotion Perception</a></h4>

              
                Central Vision Loss (CVL) is prevalent in several eye diseases, including the leading cause of vision, age-related macular degeneration. CVL impacts many aspects of everyday living including subjective reports of deficits in facial expression perception. We quantify the perception of facial affect with a paradigm in which participants created individualized representations of facial expressions using a generative face model and genetic algorithms. 8 patients with CVL ([&ge;]1.3logMAR in better eye) and 8 normally-sighted young controls selected computer-generated faces that manifest each of 13 primary affects (Amusement, Anger, Awe, Contempt, Disgust, Embarrassment, Fear, Happiness, Interest, Pride, Sadness, Shame, and Surprise). An additional group of 8 age-matched normally-sighted controls matched the first four affects. For each affect, 6 generations of 12 faces were generated from the Basel Face database, in which 199 parameters modulate the structure of each face. After the 1st generation, 6 faces were created by combinations of the parameters of faces selected in the previous generation. The remaining r 6 faces were random to introduce genetic variability. A pilot study showed that subjects were most sensitive to changes in the first 20 face parameters, so the analysis was restricted to these. A 2-way ANOVA for the 20 mean coefficients values were compared between the patients and controls. There was a significant (P<.05) main effect for Amusement, Anger, Awe, Disgust, Fear, Interest, and Surprise and a significant (P<.05) interaction for all affects. Overall, coefficient values were closer to 0 for the CVL group, indicating that less extreme face expressions were selected. However, there was no significant difference between groups in the total number of faces selected for each affect besides Fear. This suggests that the tendency towards more neutral faces in CVL patients was not simply a consequence of low sensitivity to affect expression, additionally demonstrating that neither group has a positivity or negativity bias for affective stimuli. These data suggest that CVL patients have significantly different perceptions of facial expressions than age-matched controls. CVL patients have a tendency to choose more neutral looking faces to represent a given affect, whereas the control group chose more extreme, caricatured faces. Elucidating individual differences in emotion representation and recognition has implications for populations including neurotypical, visually impaired, and neurodivergent people. This methodology may be a novel tool for quantifying visual function outcomes, and the efficacy of future patient therapies.

">Semantic Tuning of Single Neurons in the Human Medial Temporal Lobe</a></h4>

              
                The Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) is key to human cognition, supporting memory, emotional processing, navigation, and semantic coding. Rare direct human MTL recordings revealed concept cells, which were proposed as episodic memory building blocks due to their context- and modality-invariant response. However, there is a long-standing debate whether concept cells encode information in a discrete, all-or-none fashion, or as a graded, continuous function of semantic dimensions. To resolve this, we developed a closed-loop protocol that analyzes neuronal spiking in real time and adaptively presents new stimuli based on semantic similarity to response-eliciting previous ones. We found that human concept cells show graded responses, following semantic tuning curves. Furthermore, the tuning width and steepness of MTL neurons vary, with the hippocampus exhibiting the steepest tuning. Regional analysis of these tuning curves yields region-specific categorical response profiles (e.g., food responses in the amygdala). Finally, we show that at the population level, MTL activity is best captured by continuous semantic vector models, which outperform categorical and network-based metrics. Together, these findings establish that concept cells exhibit semantic tuning curves, providing new mechanistic insights into the neural organization of semantic information in the human brain.

">Songbird connectome reveals tunneling of migratory neurons in the adult striatum</a></h4>

              
                Immature neurons in the adult brain migrate and integrate into existing circuits, where they contribute to plasticity, learning, and complex behaviors. However, how these cells navigate synapse-rich regions of the adult brain remains poorly understood. While prior studies have examined the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of adult neurogenesis, few have investigated the physical interactions between migrating neurons and their surrounding environment. Here, we use electron microscopy-based connectomics to examine how migrating neurons interact with mature circuit elements in the adult zebra finch striatum. Immature neurons exhibiting migratory features were observed contacting diverse structures in their microenvironment, including the axons, dendrites, synapses, and somas of mature neurons. Surprisingly, these interactions were structurally complex, often involving pronounced deformations of mature somas and the surrounding neuropil. These deformations appeared as 'tunnels' made by the migratory neurons as they displaced mature structures along their path. Together, these findings suggest that migrating neurons may physically reshape the mature circuit to reach their targets, revealing an unexpected degree of structural and functional plasticity in the adult brain.

">The Contextual Affects of Facial Expression</a></h4>

              
                Affect recognition and communication are critical for everyday social interaction. Traditional emotion research has often assumed that facial expressions reliably reflect internal emotional states and conform to a set of universal expressions. However, emerging evidence suggests that facial expressions are highly individualized and influenced by context. To investigate these factors, we used genetic algorithms to enable participants to generate personalized facial expressions that best matched their subjective interpretation of affect within written contextual scenarios. 12 participants read standardized scenarios drawn from Howard Schatz's Actors Acting, which had been independently rated (0-4) across 13 primary emotions (Amusement, Anger, Awe, Contempt, Disgust, Embarrassment, Fear, Happiness, Interest, Pride, Sadness, Shame, Surprise). Each primary emotion was paired with all 12 secondary emotions that were either maximized (Condition 1) or minimized (Condition 2). Participants completed 26 such randomly interleaved trials, followed by the last condition (Condition 3) in which they selected faces corresponding directly to each of the 13 emotion words. Faces were generated within the 199-dimensional coefficient space of the Basel Face Database, with a genetic algorithm presenting 12 unique faces across 6 generations per scenario. Faces selected by participants as matching a given scenario were semi-randomly combined to generate 6 offspring per generation, with the remaining 6 faces created randomly to maintain genetic diversity. A 4-way ANOVA (factors: affect, context, generation, participant) on the cosine distances among faces revealed a significant main effect of affect (p = .0061) and a significant interaction between affect and context (p = .0003). These results indicate that distinct facial structures are associated with different emotions, but the representation of a given emotion is context-dependent. This work offers a novel approach to visualizing individual differences in emotion perception and has implications for advancing personalized tools in affective science, including clinical assessment and emotion recognition systems.

">The songbird basal ganglia connectome</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG) play an essential role in shaping vertebrate behavior, ranging from motor learning to emotions, but comprehensive maps of their canonical synaptic architecture are missing. In mammals, three main neuronal pathways through the BG have been described - the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways - which together orchestrate many aspects of learning and behavior. In songbirds, cell types associated with striatal and pallidal components appear intermingled in a single basal ganglia nucleus, Area X, essential for song learning. This allows for the dense reconstruction of the entire circuit within a compact volume. Here, we introduce the first vertebrate basal ganglia connectome, comprising over 8,500 automated neuron reconstructions connected by about 20 million synapses. High image quality and automated reconstruction allowed analysis with minimal manual proofreading. Based on direct anatomical measurement of synaptic connectivity, we confirm that a direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathway can be traced through Area X. However, detailed morphological and connectomic analysis revealed no clearly distinct direct and indirect medium spiny neuron subpopulations, and a dominance of the direct and hyperdirect pathway. In addition to previously identified neuron types in Area X, we could distinguish three novel GABAergic neuron types, two of which are major output targets of GPe neurons, leading to novel feedback circuitry within Area X. We further found unexpectedly strong neuronal interconnectivity and recurrency between neurons associated with all pathways. Our data thus challenge the universality of the view of the basal ganglia as an information processor organized into discrete feedforward pathways.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Slow waves are the main oscillatory activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep, playing a crucial role in synaptic homeostasis, memory consolidation, and cortical network regulation. In urethane-anesthetized rodents, frequently used in long-term potentiation experiments in vivo, brain activity alternates between a deactivated state, dominated by slow waves, and an activated state characterized by faster oscillations. However, the interplay between synaptic plasticity and slow wave dynamics within these fluctuating brain states remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether long-term potentiation in the hippocampal–medial prefrontal cortex (CA1-mPFC) circuit, critical for memory processing, modulates cortical slow wave dynamics during urethane anesthesia. Electrical stimulation of CA1 robustly evoked a transient (50 to 200 ms) event of population silence (down states) in the medial prefrontal cortex, which emerged after the typical evoked field post-synaptic potential, and was consistently associated with a slow waves. Importantly, long-term potentiation induction significantly enhanced the CA1-evoked medial prefrontal cortex down states and slowed spontaneous cortical slow wave oscillations, without altering the activated/deactivated brain state proportion. Our findings provide direct evidence of an interaction between synaptic plasticity and cortical slow wave dynamics, laying the groundwork for future studies on the underlying mechanisms of state-dependent synaptic homeostasis.</span>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is a longitudinally extended brain structure characterized by its classic trisynaptic circuit, comprising the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 subregions, evident in transverse slices and consistent throughout the hippocampal formation. Traditionally, the hippocampal circuit's intrinsic features have been studied using transverse slices. However, the trisynaptic flow extends beyond the transverse plane; Schaffer collaterals, the excitatory projections from CA3 to CA1, also extend along the longitudinal (septotemporal) axis. Despite the anatomical establishment of Schaffer collaterals' longitudinal projection, its physiological properties remain underexplored. In this study, we recorded the transverse and longitudinal transmission of Schaffer collaterals using photostimulation with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression. Our results revealed that optically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSCs) were significantly smaller in distal CA1 compared to proximal CA1, while optically evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs) remained consistent along the longitudinal axis. Additionally, CA1 interneurons mediating feedforward inhibition received smaller oEPSCs in distal planes. These findings indicate that Schaffer collaterals transmit excitatory signals more effectively than inhibitory signals along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus.</p>

                <p>Although clinical and experimental evidence highlight the role of the thalamus in voluntary movement production, the involvement of the thalamus in complex motor tasks such as speech production remains to be elucidated. The present study examined neural activity within the bilateral thalamus in 13 participants (seven females) with essential tremor undergoing awake deep brain stimulation implantation surgery, using three speech tasks of varied complexity [vowel vocalization, a diadochokinetic task (DDK), and sentence repetition]. Low-frequency neural activity (delta/theta band) activity was significantly increased during sentence and DDK compared with vowel vocalization in the bilateral motor thalamus and, to a lesser extent, increased for sentence repetition compared with DDK. Moreover, there was prominent prespeech beta band activity, with a greater decrease in the power of beta activity for sentence compared with DDK and vowel vocalization. The greater low-frequency activity in more complex speech tasks may reflect the allocation of additional cognitive resources to monitor the execution of speech motor plans through cortico&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical pathways in a temporally precise manner. The greater decrease in the power of beta activity prior to the onset of sentence repetition may imply greater involvement of the bilateral thalamus in the planning of complex speech tasks. These findings provide new insights into the role of the bilateral thalamus in speech production and may have clinical implications for neurological disorders that affect speech production.</p>

For example, burst firing requires excitatory input from the mesopontine tegmentum, while dopamine neuron population activity, defined as the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons, is thought to be dependent on inhibitory drive from the ventral pallidum (VP). Rodent models used to study psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, consistently exhibit elevated dopamine neuron population activity, due to decreased tonic inhibition from the VP. However, it remains unclear whether the VP can modulate all dopamine neurons or if only a specific subset of VTA dopamine neurons receive innervation from the VP to be recruited as required. This knowledge is critical for understanding dopamine regulation in normal and pathological conditions. Here, we used in vivo electrophysiology in male and female rats to record VTA dopamine neurons inhibited by electrical stimulation of the VP. Specifically, VP stimulation inhibited ~22% of spontaneously active dopamine neurons; however, activation of the ventral hippocampus, a modulator of VTA population activity, increased the proportion to ~48%. This increase suggests that VP selectively modulates a subset of dopamine neurons that can be recruited by afferent activation. Anterograde monosynaptic tracing revealed that approximately half of the VTA dopamine neurons receive input from the VP. Taken together, we demonstrate that a subset of VTA dopamine neurons receives monosynaptic input from the VP, providing valuable information regarding the regulation of VTA neuron activity.</p>

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing predictive accuracy in complex tasks, particularly in scenarios where data is limited or imbalanced. This study explores the use of similarity-based pre-evaluation as a methodology to identify optimal source datasets for transfer learning, addressing the dual challenge of efficient source-target dataset pairing and off-target prediction in CRISPR-Cas9, while existing transfer learning applications in the field of gene editing often lack a principled method for source dataset selection. We use cosine, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances to evaluate similarity between the source and target datasets used in our transfer learning experiments. Four deep learning network architectures, i.e. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and two traditional machine learning models, i.e. Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF), were tested and compared in our simulations. The results suggest that similarity scores are reliable indicators for pre-selecting source datasets in CRISPR-Cas9 transfer learning experiments, with cosine distance proving to be a more effective dataset comparison metric than either Euclidean or Manhattan distances. An RNN-GRU, a 5-layer FNN, and two MLP variants provided the best overall prediction results in our simulations. By integrating similarity-based source pre-selection with machine learning outcomes, we propose a dual-layered framework that not only streamlines the transfer learning process but also significantly improves off-target prediction accuracy.

                <p>by Hao Zhu, Donna K. Slonim</p>

A major challenge in working with single-cell RNA sequencing data is the prevalence of “dropout,” when some transcripts’ expression values are erroneously not captured. Addressing this issue, which produces zero-inflated count data, is crucial for many downstream data analyses including the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this paper, we introduce two novel contributions. First, we propose Dropout Augmentation (DA), a simple but effective model regularization method to improve resilience to zero inflation in single-cell data by augmenting the data with synthetic dropout events. DA offers a new perspective to solve the “dropout” problem beyond imputation. Second, we present DAZZLE, a stabilized and robust version of the autoencoder-based structure equation model for GRN inference using the DA concept. Benchmark experiments illustrate the improved performance and increased stability of the proposed DAZZLE model over existing approaches. The practical application of the DAZZLE model on a longitudinal mouse microglia dataset containing over 15,000 genes illustrates its ability to handle real-world single cell data with minimal gene filtration. The improved robustness and stability of DAZZLE make it a practical and valuable addition to the toolkit for GRN inference from single-cell data. Finally, we propose that Dropout Augmentation may have wider applications beyond the GRN-inference problem. Project website: https://bcb.cs.tufts.edu/DAZZLE.

                <p>by Fabiano Baroni, Ben D. Fulcher</p>

Neuronal activity is organized in collective patterns that are critical for information coding, generation, and communication between neural populations. These patterns are often described in terms of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships. Many methods have been proposed for the quantification of these collective states of dynamic neuronal organization. However, it is difficult to determine which method is best suited for which experimental setting and research question. This choice is further complicated by the fact that most methods are sensitive to a combination of synchrony, oscillations, and other factors; in addition, some of them display systematic biases that can complicate their interpretation. To address these challenges, we adopt a highly comparative approach, whereby spike trains are represented by a diverse library of measures. This enables unsupervised or supervised analysis in the space of measures, or in that of spike trains. We compile a battery of 122 measures of synchrony, oscillations, and phase relationships, complemented with 9 measures of spiking intensity and variability. We first apply them to sets of synthetic spike trains with known statistical properties, and show that all measures are confounded by extraneous factors such as firing rate or population frequency, but to different extents. Then, we analyze spike trains recorded in different species—rat, mouse, and monkey—and brain areas—primary sensory cortices and hippocampus—and show that our highly comparative approach provides a high-dimensional quantification of collective network activity that can be leveraged for both unsupervised and supervised characterization of firing patterns. Overall, the highly comparative approach provides a detailed description of the empirical properties of multineuron spike train analysis methods, including practical guidelines for their use in experimental settings, and advances our understanding of neuronal coordination and coding.

                <p>by Victor Hugo Mello, Jiri Wald, Thomas C Marlovits, Pablo Sartori</p>

Proteins carry out cellular functions by changing their structure among a few conformations, each characterised by a different energy level. Therefore, structural changes, energy transformations, and protein function are intimately related. Despite its central importance, this relationship remains elusive. For example, while many hexameric ATPase motors are known to function using a hand-over-hand alternation of subunits, how energy transduction throughout the assembly structure drives the hand-over-hand mechanism is not known. In this work, we unravel the energetic basis of hand-over-hand in a model AAA+ motor, RuvB. To do so, we develop a general method to compute the residue-scale elastic pseudoenergy due to structure changes and apply it to RuvB structures, recently resolved through cryo-EM. This allows us to quantify how progression through RuvB’s mechanochemical cycle translates into residue-scale energy transduction. In particular, we find that DNA binding is associated with overcoming a high energy barrier. This is possible through inter-subunit transmission of energy, and ultimately driven by nucleotide exchange. Furthermore, we show how this structure-inferred energetic quantification can be integrated into a non-equilibrium model of AAA+ assembly dynamics, consistent with single-molecule biophysics measurements. Overall, our work elucidates the energetic basis for the hand-over-hand mechanism in RuvB’s cycle. Furthermore, it presents a generally applicable methodology for studying the energetics of conformational cycles in other proteins, allowing to quantitatively bridge data from structural biology and single-molecule biophysics.

                <p>by Weifan Wang, Xueyan Niu, Liyuan Liang, Tai-Sing Lee</p>

A ubiquitous phenomenon observed along the ventral stream of the primate hierarchical visual system is the suppression of neural responses to familiar stimuli at the population level. The observation of the suppression of the neural response in the early visual cortex (V1 and V2) to familiar stimuli that are multiple times larger in size than the receptive fields of individual neurons implicates the plausible development of recurrent circuits for encoding these global stimuli. In this work, we investigated the neural mechanisms of familiarity suppression and showed that a recurrent neural circuit based on Hebbian learning, consisting of neurons with small and local receptive fields, can develop to encode specific global familiar stimuli robustly as a result of familiarity training. We proposed that the learned recurrent circuit implements a manifold transform. The recurrent circuit compresses the dimensions of nuisance variations of a familiar image in the neural response manifold relative to the dimensions for discriminating different familiar stimuli, resulting in increased robustness of the global stimulus representation against noise and other irrelevant perturbations. We demonstrate that a recurrent circuit implements the manifold transform using a mixed strategy of locally linear and globally nonlinear computations, where the local linear computation selectively redistributes recurrent gain to enhance concept discrimination. These results provide testable predictions for neurophysiological experiments.

                <p>by Huijuan Zhou, Jun Chen, Xianyang Zhang</p>

Microbiome sequencing data are inherently sparse and compositional, with excessive zeros arising from biological absence or insufficient sampling. These zeros pose significant challenges for downstream analyses, particularly those that require log-transformation. We introduce BMDD (BiModal Dirichlet Distribution), a novel probabilistic modeling framework for accurate imputation of microbiome sequencing data. Unlike existing imputation approaches that assume unimodal abundance, BMDD captures the bimodal abundance distribution of the taxa via a mixture of Dirichlet priors. It uses variational inference and a scalable expectation-maximization algorithm for efficient imputation. Through simulations and real microbiome datasets, we demonstrate that BMDD outperforms competing methods in reconstructing true abundances and improves the performance of differential abundance analysis. Through multiple posterior samples, BMDD enables robust inference by accounting for uncertainty in zero imputation. Our method offers a principled and computationally efficient solution for analyzing high-dimensional, zero-inflated microbiome sequencing data and is broadly applicable in microbial biomarker discovery and host-microbiome interaction studies.

                <p>by Etienne Gosselin, Sophie Bagur, Sara Jamali, Jean-Luc Puel, Jérôme Bourien, Brice Bathellier</p>

Early studies on orientation selectivity in the visual cortex have suggested that sensory systems generate new feature representations at specific processing stages. Many observations challenge this view, but in the absence of systematic, multistage measurements, the logic of how feature tuning emerges remains elusive. Here, using a generic approach based on representational similarity analysis with a noise-corrected population metric, we demonstrate in the mouse auditory system that feature representations evolve gradually with, in some cases, major, feature-specific improvements at particular stages. We observe that single frequency tuning is already fully developed in the cochlear nucleus, the first stage of processing, while tuning to higher-order features improves up to the auditory cortex, with major steps in the inferior colliculus for amplitude modulation frequency or noise bandwidth tuning and in the cortex for frequency modulation direction and for complex sound identity or direction. Moreover, we observe that intensity tuning is established in a feature-ependent manner, earlier for pure frequencies than for more complex sounds. This indicates that auditory feature computations are a mix of stepwise and gradual processes which together contribute to decorrelate sound representations.

Understanding how transcription factors regulate organized cellular diversity in developing tissues remains a major challenge due to their pleiotropic functions. We addressed this by monitoring and genetically modulating the activity of PAX3 and PAX7 during the specification of neural progenitor pools in the embryonic spinal cord. Using mouse models, we show that the balance between the transcriptional activating and repressing functions of these factors is modulated along the dorsoventral axis and is instructive to the patterning of spinal progenitor pools. By combining loss-of-function experiments with functional genomics in spinal organoids, we demonstrate that PAX-mediated repression and activation rely on distinct <i>cis-</i>regulatory genomic modules. This enables both the coexistence of their dual activity in dorsal cell progenitors and the specific control of two major differentiation programs. PAX promote H3K27me3 deposition at silencers to repress ventral identities, while at enhancers, they act as pioneer factors, opening and activating <i>cis-</i>regulatory modules to specify dorsal-most identities. Finally, we show that this pioneer activity is restricted to cells exposed to BMP morphogens, ensuring spatial specificity. These findings reveal how PAX proteins, modulated by morphogen gradients, orchestrate neuronal diversity in the spinal cord, providing a robust framework for neural subtype specification.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and assess whether their combination improves diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively analyzed 293 ALS patients, 85 neurodegenerative disease controls, and 29 healthy controls. A validation cohort of 501 ALS patients was analyzed to confirm reproducibility of the results. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for sNfL, cTnT, and their combination, and the area under the curve (AUC) was compared across groups. An ALS-specific cTnT cut-off of 8.35ng/L was determined using the Youden index and applied in subgroup analyses, in which “biomarker-negative” ALS patients were compared to “biomarker-positive” patients regarding disease duration and progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>sNfL showed excellent performance in discriminating ALS patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.94), but only moderate performance in discriminating neurodegenerative disease controls (AUC = 0.82). Combining sNfL and cTnT improved diagnostic accuracy for ALS over neurodegenerative controls, with an AUC of 0.90, whereas cTnT alone showed an AUC of 0.77. The validation cohort showed similar AUCs. “Biomarker-negative” ALS patients had a longer disease duration (73.0 vs 18.0 months, <i>p</i> = 0.0003) and a lower progression rate (0.19 vs 0.70 points per months, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) than “biomarker-positive” patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although sNfL alone performs well in distinguishing ALS from healthy controls, repurposing cTnT for ALS provides additional value in discriminating ALS from disease controls. The combination of sNfL and cTnT improves diagnostic accuracy and may help identify prognostically distinct ALS subgroups. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1163/v1?src=rss">Isokinetic Strength and Functional Ratio for Quadriceps and Hamstrings among Semi-Professional Athletes in UAE playing Football, Cricket, and Tennis- Biomechanical Implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aim This study aims to compare the isokinetic strength of the Hamstrings against the Quadriceps for Football, Cricket, and Tennis among semi-professional athletes. Methodology An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with the inclusion of participants between 18-40 years, both males and females having an active athlete profile playing Football, Cricket, and Tennis as semi-professional (competing in inter-collegiate, national-level tournaments in the UAE). The minimum duration for each sport was one hour per day and three to five times per week. A total of 66 participants were enrolled, with 22 participants in each group. The ISOMOVE isokinetic device was used to assess the strength of dynamically contracting Quadriceps concentrically against eccentric contraction of the Hamstring muscles to determine the functional ratio (H/Q ratio). Results Age-wise distribution of players showed predominant male participants with 77.3% of players in Football, 68.2% in Cricket, and 59.1% in Tennis. The comparison for the mean peaks of isokinetic strength for functional ratio suggested a statistically significant difference between the three sports (Football p<0.001, Cricket p=0.006, Tennis p =0.003). The findings suggested that the highest H/Q ratio was found in Football players with a mean value of 0.51±0.07, followed by Cricket and Tennis with a mean of 0.48±0.08 and 0.42±0.05, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusion The isokinetic strength testing for H/Q ratio was found to be higher in Football players, followed by Cricket and Tennis players for semi-professional athletes. The study concluded that the functional H/Q ratio varies between three similar sports as the demand on the target muscle would specifically vary. Thus, semi-professional players who play multiple games should consider enhancing FR for the Hamstring to the Quadriceps, besides the strength and training specific to sports, to avoid the risk of injuries.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1162/v1?src=rss">IMPROVING HPV VACCINE RATES FOR ABORIGINAL YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN: AN INTERRUPTED TIME SERIES [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to HPV-related cancers such as cervical cancer and other cancers such as anal, vaginal, and penile cancer. HPV rarely produces symptoms and cannot be cured or treated; therefore, vaccination is essential to protect against HPV and HPV-related diseases. However, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter, respectfully, ‘Aboriginal’) people are not receiving their HPV vaccine dose, resulting in missed opportunities to be protected from HPV-related cancers. Health promotion is a critical way to empower people to take ownership over and control their health and is a core function of public health. One way to deliver health promotion is through social media platforms. In recent COVID-19 times, we have seen the effect of social media on public health messaging, both positive and harmful. In particular, Instagram influencers have had a profound impact on pro- and anti-vaccination messages. Aboriginal adolescents aged 13-15 years old have strong engagement with social media platforms. Combining co-created health promotion messages with local ‘micro-Influencers’ is a novel way to improve HPV vaccination rates. The overall aim of this project is to improve the rates of HPV vaccination amongst young Aboriginal people. We will achieve this through: i) co-creation of health promotion messages, ii) developing and delivering a social media campaign and iii) evaluating the effectiveness of the campaign through an interrupted time-series design. We hypothesise that the co-creation of health promotion messages with young Aboriginal people and their families and utilising the skills of micro-Influencers to engage and influence their followers will result in improvements HPV vaccination rates amongst this population.

                Background The use of ensemble learning has been crucial for improving predictive accuracy in healthcare, especially with regard to critical diagnostic and classification problems. Ensemble models combine the strengths of multiple ML models and reduce the risk of misclassification, which is important in healthcare, where accurate predictions impact patient outcomes. Methods This study introduces the Gradient-Based Weight Optimized Ensemble Model (GBWOEM), an advanced ensemble technique that optimizes the weights of five base models: Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Logistic Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), through optimizing the weights. Two variants, GBWOEM-R (random weight initialization) and GBWOEM-U (uniform weight initialization), were proposed and tested on five healthcare-related datasets: breast cancer, Pima Indians Diabetes Database, diabetic retinopathy debrecen, obesity level estimation based on physical condition and eating habits, and thyroid diseases. Results The test accuracy of the proposed models increased to 0.48-8.26% over the traditional ensemble models, such as Adaboost, Catboost, GradientBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Performance metrics, including ROC-AUC analyses, confirmed the model’s efficacy in handling imbalanced data, highlighting its potential for advancing predictive consistency in healthcare applications. Conclusion The GBWOEM model improves the predictive accuracy and offers a reliable solution for healthcare applications even when dealing with the imbalance data. This strategy has the potential to ensure patient outcomes and diagnostic consistency in healthcare settings.

                Zhang et al. reveal that BST2-positive border astrocytes regulate astrocyte-microglia interactions after stroke. Genetic or antibody blockade of BST2 reduces these interactions and improves early functional outcomes, highlighting BST2 as a therapeutic target for brain repair.

                This study isolates extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Biophysical and proteomic analyses demonstrate that sEVs and exomeres are distinctive entities. GALNS and MAN2B1 are identified as potential EM markers. HCC-derived EMs promote oncogenesis via several mechanisms, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, cell cycle progression, and lipidomic dysregulation.

                Sethi et al. define a molecular role for the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler EP400, a core subunit of the NuA4 HAT complex, in preventing CENP-A mislocalization for chromosomal stability. Cells defective for EP400 function cause mislocalization of CENP-A to non-centromeric regions in a DAXX-dependent manner, leading to CIN phenotypes.

                Tan et al. reveal that Bacillus velezensis biofilms accumulate Fe on roots, serving as Fe reservoirs to make Fe more accessible to the host plant. The bacterial siderophore bacillibactin plays a dual role by promoting Fe accumulation in the biofilms and activating plant Fe-deficiency responses.
