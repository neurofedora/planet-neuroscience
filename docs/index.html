	<p>Individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) experience severe face memory deficits that are often accompanied by impairments in face perception. Images of human facial features are better discriminated between when they are presented in the locations on the visual field that they typically appear in while viewing human faces in daily life, than in locations which they do not typically appear (i.e., better performance for eyes in the upper visual field, and better performance for mouths in the lower visual field). These feature-to-location tuning effects (FLEs) can be explained by a retinotopically organised visual statistical learning mechanism. We had a large group of DP participants (N = 64), a control group (N = 74) and a group of individuals with a mild form of DP (N = 58) complete a single-feature discrimination task to determine whether face perception deficits in DP can be accounted for by an impairment in face feature-to-location tuning. The results showed that individuals with DP did not have significant FLEs, suggesting a marked impairment in the underlying visual statistical learning mechanism. In contrast, the mild DP group showed normal FLE effects which did not differ from the control group. Both DP groups had impaired single-feature processing (SFP) as compared to the control group. We also examined the effects of age on FLEs and SFP.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal CA3 region plays an important role in learning and memory. CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) receive two prominent excitatory inputs&mdash;mossy fibers (MFs) from dentate gyrus (DG) and recurrent collaterals (RCs) from CA3 PNs&mdash;that play opposing roles in pattern separation and pattern completion, respectively. Although the dorsoventral heterogeneity of the hippocampal anatomy, physiology, and behavior has been well established, nothing is known about the dorsoventral heterogeneity of synaptic connectivity in CA3 PNs. In this study, we performed Timm's sulfide silver staining, dendritic and spine morphological analyses, and ex vivo electrophysiology in mice of both sexes to investigate the heterogeneity of MF and RC pathways along the CA3 dorsoventral axis. Our morphological analyses demonstrate that ventral CA3 (vCA3) PNs possess greater dendritic lengths and more complex dendritic arborization, compared with dorsal CA3 (dCA3) PNs. Moreover, using ChannelRhodopsin2 (ChR2)-assisted patch-clamp recording, we found that the ratio of the RC-to-MF excitatory drive onto CA3 PNs increases substantially from dCA3 to vCA3, with vCA3 PNs receiving significantly weaker MFs, but stronger RCs, excitation than dCA3 PNs. Given the distinct roles of MF versus RC inputs in pattern separation versus completion, our findings of the significant dorsoventral variations of MF and RC excitation in CA3 PNs may have important functional implications for the contribution of CA3 circuit to the dorsoventral difference in hippocampal function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/33/e0382242024?rss=1">Fast Inhibition Slows and Desynchronizes Mouse Auditory Efferent Neuron Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The encoding of acoustic stimuli requires precise neuron timing. Auditory neurons in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and brainstem are&nbsp;well suited for accurate analysis of fast acoustic signals, given their physiological specializations of fast membrane time constants, fast axonal conduction, and reliable synaptic transmission. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons that provide efferent inhibition of the cochlea reside in the ventral brainstem and participate in these fast neural circuits. However, their modulation of cochlear function occurs over time scales of a slower nature. This suggests the presence of mechanisms that reduce MOC inhibition of cochlear function. To determine how monaural excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs integrate to affect the timing of MOC neuron activity, we developed a novel in vitro slice preparation ("wedge-slice"). The wedge-slice maintains the ascending auditory nerve root, the entire CN and projecting axons, while preserving the ability to perform visually guided patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings from genetically identified MOC neurons. The "in vivo-like" timing of the wedge-slice demonstrates that the inhibitory pathway accelerates relative to the excitatory pathway when the ascending circuit is intact, and the CN portion of the inhibitory circuit is precise enough to compensate for reduced precision in later synapses. When combined with machine learning PSC analysis and computational modeling, we demonstrate a larger suppression of MOC neuron activity when the inhibition occurs with in vivo-like timing. This delay of MOC activity may ensure that the MOC system is only engaged by sustained background sounds, preventing a maladaptive hypersuppression of cochlear activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/33/e0974232024?rss=1">Neural Representations of Sensory Uncertainty and Confidence Are Associated with Perceptual Curiosity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans are immensely curious and motivated to reduce uncertainty, but little is known about the neural mechanisms that generate curiosity. Curiosity is inversely associated with confidence, suggesting that it is triggered by states of low confidence (subjective uncertainty), but the neural mechanisms of this link, have been little investigated. Inspired by studies of sensory uncertainty, we hypothesized that visual areas provide multivariate representations of uncertainty, which are read out by higher-order structures to generate signals of confidence and, ultimately, curiosity. We scanned participants (17 female, 15 male) using fMRI while they performed a new task in which they rated their confidence in identifying distorted images of animals and objects and their curiosity to see the clear image. We measured the activity evoked by each image in the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) and devised a new metric of "OTC Certainty" indicating the strength of evidence this activity conveys about the animal versus object categories. We show that, perceptual curiosity peaked at low confidence and OTC Certainty negatively correlated with curiosity, establishing a link between curiosity and a multivariate representation of sensory uncertainty. Moreover, univariate (average) activity in two frontal areas&mdash;vmPFC and ACC&mdash;correlated positively with confidence and negatively with curiosity, and the vmPFC mediated the relationship between OTC Certainty and curiosity. The results reveal novel mechanisms through which uncertainty about an event generates curiosity about that event.</p>

                <p>The neocortex and striatum are topographically organized for sensory and motor functions. While sensory and motor areas are lateralized for touch and motor control, respectively, frontal areas are involved in decision-making, where lateralization of function may be less important. This study contrasted the topographic precision of cell-type&ndash;specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical projections while varying the injection site location in transgenic mice of both sexes. While sensory cortical areas had strongly topographic outputs to the ipsilateral cortex and striatum, they were weaker and not as topographically precise to contralateral targets. The motor cortex had somewhat stronger projections but still relatively weak contralateral topography. In contrast, frontal cortical areas had high degrees of topographic similarity for both ipsilateral and contralateral projections to the cortex and striatum. Corticothalamic organization is mainly ipsilateral, with weaker, more medial contralateral projections. Corticostriatal computations might integrate input outside closed basal ganglia loops using contralateral projections, enabling the two hemispheres to act as a unit to converge on one result in motor planning and decision-making.</p>

                <p>Synapses are fundamental to the function of the central nervous system and are implicated in a number of brain disorders. Despite their pivotal role, a comprehensive imaging resource detailing the distribution of synapses in the human brain has been lacking until now. Here, we employ high-resolution PET neuroimaging in healthy humans (17F/16M) to create a 3D atlas of the synaptic marker Synaptic Vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). Calibration to absolute density values (pmol/ml) was achieved by leveraging postmortem human brain autoradiography data. The atlas unveils distinctive cortical and subcortical gradients of synapse density that reflect functional topography and hierarchical order from core sensory to higher-order integrative areas&mdash;a distribution that diverges from SV2A mRNA patterns. Furthermore, we found a positive association between IQ and SV2A density in several higher-order cortical areas. This new resource will help advance our understanding of brain physiology and the pathogenesis of brain disorders, serving as a pivotal tool for future neuroscience research.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behaviors require the ability to resolve conflicting information caused by the processing of incompatible sensory inputs. Prominent theories of attention have posited that early selective attention helps mitigate cognitive interference caused by conflicting sensory information by facilitating the processing of task-relevant sensory inputs and filtering out behaviorally irrelevant information. Surprisingly, many recent studies that investigated the role of early selective attention on conflict mitigation have failed to provide positive evidence. Here, we examined changes in the selectivity of early visuospatial attention in male and female human subjects performing an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task, where they discriminated the shape of a visual target surrounded by congruent or incongruent distractors. We used the inverted encoding model to reconstruct spatial representations of visual selective attention from the topographical patterns of amplitude modulations in alpha band oscillations in scalp EEG (~8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz). We found that the fidelity of the alpha-based spatial reconstruction was significantly higher in the incongruent compared with the congruent condition. Importantly, these conflict-related modulations in the reconstruction fidelity occurred at a much earlier time window than those of the lateralized posterior event-related potentials associated with target selection and distractor suppression processes, as well as conflict-related modulations in the frontocentral negative-going wave and midline-frontal theta oscillations (~3&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz), thought to track executive control functions. Taken together, our data suggest that conflict resolution is supported by the cascade of neural processes underlying early selective visuospatial attention and frontal executive functions that unfold over time.</p>

Offer values are represented in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)&mdash;an area that participates in value comparison&mdash;but it is unknown where offer values are computed in the first place. One possibility is that this computation takes place in OFC. Alternatively, offer values might be computed upstream of OFC. For choices between edible goods, a primary candidate is the gustatory region of the anterior insula (gustatory cortex, GC). Here we recorded from the GC of male rhesus monkeys choosing between different juice types. As a population, neurons in GC represented the flavor, the quantity, and the subjective value of the juice chosen by the animal. These variables were represented by distinct groups of cells and with different time courses. Specifically, chosen value signals emerged shortly after offer presentation, while neurons encoding the chosen juice and the chosen quantity peaked after juice delivery. Surprisingly, neurons in GC did not represent individual offer values in a systematic way. In a computational sense, the variables encoded in GC follow the process of value comparison. Thus our results argue against the hypothesis that offer values are computed in GC. At the same time, signals representing the subjective value of the expected reward indicate that responses in GC are not purely sensory. Thus neuronal responses in GC appear consummatory in nature.</p>

                <p>The simple act of viewing and grasping an object involves complex sensorimotor control mechanisms that have been shown to vary as a function of multiple object and other task features such as object size, shape, weight, and wrist orientation. However, these features have been mostly studied in isolation. In contrast, given the nonlinearity of motor control, its computations require multiple features to be incorporated concurrently. Therefore, the present study tested the hypothesis that grasp computations integrate multiple task features superadditively in particular when these features are relevant for the same action phase. We asked male and female human participants to reach-to-grasp objects of different shapes and sizes with different wrist orientations. Also, we delayed the movement onset using auditory signals to specify which effector to use. Using electroencephalography and representative dissimilarity analysis to map the time course of cortical activity, we found that grasp computations formed superadditive integrated representations of grasp features during different planning phases of grasping. Shape-by-size representations and size-by-orientation representations occurred before and after effector specification, respectively, and could not be explained by single-feature models. These observations are consistent with the brain performing different preparatory, phase-specific computations; visual object analysis to identify grasp points at abstract visual levels; and downstream sensorimotor preparatory computations for reach-to-grasp trajectories. Our results suggest the brain adheres to the needs of nonlinear motor control for integration. Furthermore, they show that examining the superadditive influence of integrated representations can serve as a novel lens to map the computations underlying sensorimotor control.</p>

                <p>The ability to make accurate and timely decisions, such as judging when it is safe to cross the road, is the foundation of adaptive behavior. While the computational and neural processes supporting simple decisions on isolated stimuli have been well characterized, decision-making in the real world often requires integration of discrete sensory events over time and space. Most previous experimental work on perceptual decision-making has focused on tasks that involve only a single, task-relevant source of sensory input. It remains unclear, therefore, how such integrative decisions are regulated computationally. Here we used psychophysics, electroencephalography, and computational modeling to understand how the human brain combines visual motion signals across space in the service of a single, integrated decision. To that purpose, we presented two random-dot kinematograms in the left and the right visual hemifields. Coherent motion signals were shown briefly and concurrently in each location, and healthy adult human participants of both sexes reported the average of the two motion signals. We directly tested competing predictions arising from influential serial and parallel accounts of visual processing. Using a biologically plausible model of motion filtering, we found evidence in favor of parallel integration as the fundamental computational mechanism regulating integrated perceptual decisions.</p>

                <p>To visualize the cellular and subcellular localization of neuromodulatory G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors in <I>Drosophila</I>, we implement a molecular strategy recently used to add epitope tags to ionotropic receptors at their endogenous loci. Leveraging evolutionary conservation to identify sites more likely to permit insertion of a tag, we generated constitutive and conditional tagged alleles for <I>Drosophila</I> <I>5-HT1A</I>, <I>5-HT2A</I>, <I>5-HT2B</I>, <I>Oct</I><I>&beta;</I><I>1R</I>, <I>Oct</I><I>&beta;</I><I>2R</I>, two isoforms of <I>OAMB</I>, and <I>mGluR</I>. The conditional alleles allow for the restricted expression of tagged receptor in specific cell types, an option not available for any previous reagents to label these proteins. We show expression patterns for these receptors in female brains and that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B localize to the mushroom bodies (MBs) and central complex, respectively, as predicted by their roles in sleep. By contrast, the unexpected enrichment of Oct&beta;1R in the central complex and of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A to nerve terminals in lobular columnar cells in the visual system suggest new hypotheses about their functions at these sites. Using an additional tagged allele of the serotonin transporter, a marker of serotonergic tracts, we demonstrate diverse spatial relationships between postsynaptic 5-HT receptors and presynaptic 5-HT neurons, consistent with the importance of both synaptic and volume transmission. Finally, we use the conditional allele of <I>5-HT1A</I> to show that it localizes to distinct sites within the MBs as both a postsynaptic receptor in Kenyon cells and a presynaptic autoreceptor.</p>

                <p>The sense of smell is tightly linked to emotions, a link that is thought to rely on the direct synaptic connections between the olfactory bulb (OB) and nuclei of the amygdala. However, there are multiple pathways projecting olfactory information to the amygdala, and their unique functions are unknown. The pathway via the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT) that receives input from olfactory regions and projects to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is among them. NLOT has been very little studied, and consequentially its function is unknown. Furthermore, formulation of informed hypotheses about NLOT function is at this stage limited by the lack of knowledge about its connectivity and physiological properties. Here, we used virus-based tracing methods to systematically reveal inputs into NLOT, as well as NLOT projection targets in mice of both sexes. We found that the NLOT is interconnected with several olfactory brain regions and with the BLA. Some of these connections were reciprocal, and some showed unique interhemispheric patterns. We tested the excitable properties of NLOT neurons and the properties of each of the major synaptic inputs. We found that the NLOT receives powerful input from the piriform cortex, tenia tecta, and the BLA but only very weak input from the OB. When input crosses threshold, NLOT neurons respond with calcium-dependent bursts of action potentials. We hypothesize that this integration of olfactory and amygdalar inputs serves behaviors that combine smell and emotion.</p>

                <p>by Christoph Koch, Ondrej Zika, Rasmus Bruckner, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Surprise is a key component of many learning experiences, and yet its precise computational role, and how it changes with age, remain debated. One major challenge is that surprise often occurs jointly with other variables, such as uncertainty and outcome probability. To assess how humans learn from surprising events, and whether aging affects this process, we studied choices while participants learned from bandits with either Gaussian or bi-modal outcome distributions, which decoupled outcome probability, uncertainty, and surprise. A total of 102 participants (51 older, aged 50—73; 51 younger, 19–30 years) chose between three bandits, one of which had a bimodal outcome distribution. Behavioral analyses showed that both age-groups learned the average of the bimodal bandit less well. A trial-by-trial analysis indicated that participants performed choice reversals immediately following large absolute prediction errors, consistent with heightened sensitivity to surprise. This effect was stronger in older adults. Computational models indicated that learning rates in younger as well as older adults were influenced by surprise, rather than uncertainty, but also suggested large interindividual variability in the process underlying learning in our task. Our work bridges between behavioral economics research that has focused on how outcomes with low probability affect choice in older adults, and reinforcement learning work that has investigated age differences in the effects of uncertainty and suggests that older adults overly adapt to surprising events, even when accounting for probability and uncertainty effects.

Translocation in protein synthesis entails the efficient and accurate movement of the mRNA-[tRNA]<sub>2</sub> substrate through the ribosome after peptide bond formation. An essential conformational change during this process is the swiveling of the small subunit head domain about two rRNA ‘hinge’ elements. Using iterative selection and molecular dynamics simulations, we derive alternate hinge elements capable of translocation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and describe their effects on the conformational trajectory of the EF-G-bound, translocating ribosome. In these alternate conformational pathways, we observe a diversity of swivel kinetics, hinge motions, three-dimensional head domain trajectories and tRNA dynamics. By finding alternate conformational pathways of translocation, we identify motions and intermediates that are essential or malleable in this process. These findings highlight the plasticity of protein synthesis and provide a more thorough understanding of the available sequence and conformational landscape of a central biological process.

                <p>by Jiayi Lin, Hrayer Aprahamian, George Golovko</p>

We study the problem of mass screening of heterogeneous populations under limited testing budget. Mass screening is an essential tool that arises in various settings, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of mass screening is to classify the entire population as positive or negative for a disease as efficiently and accurately as possible. Under limited budget, testing facilities need to allocate a portion of the budget to target sub-populations (i.e., proactive screening) while reserving the remaining budget to screen for symptomatic cases (i.e., reactive screening). This paper addresses this decision problem by taking advantage of accessible population-level risk information to identify the optimal set of sub-populations for proactive/reactive screening. The framework also incorporates two widely used testing schemes: Individual and Dorfman group testing. By leveraging the special structure of the resulting bilinear optimization problem, we identify key structural properties, which in turn enable us to develop efficient solution schemes. Furthermore, we extend the model to accommodate customized testing schemes across different sub-populations and introduce a highly efficient heuristic solution algorithm for the generalized model. We conduct a comprehensive case study on COVID-19 in the US, utilizing geographically-based data. Numerical results demonstrate a significant improvement of up to 52% in total misclassifications compared to conventional screening strategies. In addition, our case study offers valuable managerial insights regarding the allocation of proactive/reactive measures and budget across diverse geographic regions.

                <p>by Catarina S. C. Martins, Manuel Delgado-Baquerizo, Ramesha H. Jayaramaiah, Dongxue Tao, Jun-Tao Wang, Tadeo Sáez-Sandino, Hongwei Liu, Fernando T. Maestre, Peter B. Reich, Brajesh K. Singh</p>

Grasslands are integral to maintaining biodiversity and key ecosystem services and are under threat from climate change. Plant and soil microbial diversity, and their interactions, support the provision of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality). However, it remains virtually unknown whether plant and soil microbial diversity explain a unique portion of total variation or shared contributions to supporting multifunctionality across global grasslands. Here, we combine results from a global survey of 101 grasslands with a novel microcosm study, controlling for both plant and soil microbial diversity to identify their individual and interactive contribution to support multifunctionality under aridity and experimental drought. We found that plant and soil microbial diversity independently predict a unique portion of total variation in above- and belowground functioning, suggesting that both types of biodiversity complement each other. Interactions between plant and soil microbial diversity positively impacted multifunctionality including primary production and nutrient storage. Our findings were also climate context dependent, since soil fungal diversity was positively associated with multifunctionality in less arid regions, while plant diversity was strongly and positively linked to multifunctionality in more arid regions. Our results highlight the need to conserve both above- and belowground diversity to sustain grassland multifunctionality in a drier world and indicate climate change may shift the relative contribution of plant and soil biodiversity to multifunctionality across global grasslands.

     alt="Morphological Characteristics of Retinal Ganglion Cells in the Retinas of Giant Pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)"/>
<p>A thorough morphological analysis demonstrates that the giant pandas’ visual system retains many typical characteristics of crepuscular carnivores, including forward-placed eyes, vertical slit pupils, cellular tapetum membranes, and an avascular retinal structure. In addition, for the first time, we observed a vertically oriented visual streak on the temporal retina. These results suggest that, to adapt to its habitat and special ecological niche, the giant panda evolved a unique way to process binocular information.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Vision plays a crucial role in the survival of animals, and the visual system has particularly selectively evolved in response to the visual environment, ecological niche, and species habitats in vertebrate species. To date, a horizontal streak of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) distribution pattern is observed across mammal species. Here, we report that the giant panda's vertically oriented visual streak, combined with current evidence of the animal's forward-placed eyes, ocular structure, and retinal neural topographic distribution patterns, presents the emergence of a well-adapted binocular visual system. Our results suggest that the giant panda may use a unique way to processing binocular visual information. Results of mathematical simulation are in favor of this hypothesis. The topographic distribution properties of RGCs reported here could be essential for understanding the visual adaptation and evolution of this living fossil.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The processing of rich synaptic information in the dentate gyrus (DG) relies on a diverse population of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons to regulate cellular and circuit activity, in a layer-specific manner. Metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) provide powerful inhibition to the DG circuit, on timescales consistent with behavior and learning, but their role in controlling the activity of interneurons is poorly understood with respect to identified cell types. We hypothesize that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs display cell type-specific heterogeneity in signaling strength, which will have direct ramifications for signal processing in DG networks. To test this, we perform <i>in vitro</i> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from identified DG principal cells and interneurons, followed by GABA<sub>B</sub>R pharmacology, photolysis of caged GABA, and extracellular stimulation of endogenous GABA release to classify the cell type-specific inhibitory potential. Based on our previous classification of DG interneurons, we show that postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated currents are present on all interneuron types albeit at different amplitudes, dependent largely on soma location and synaptic targets. GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs were coupled to inwardly-rectifying K+ channels that strongly reduced the excitability of those interneurons where large currents were observed. These data provide a systematic characterization of GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in the rat DG to provide greater insight into circuit dynamics.</p>

                The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in the dorsal pons responds to bodily threats and transmits alarm signals to the forebrain. Parabrachial neuron activity is enhanced during chronic pain, and inactivation of PBN neurons in mice prevents the establishment of neuropathic, chronic pain symptoms. Chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of all glutamatergic neurons in the PBN, or just the subpopulation that expresses the Calca gene, is sufficient to establish pain phenotypes, including long-lasting tactile allodynia, that scale with the extent of stimulation, thereby promoting nociplastic pain, defined as diffuse pain without tissue inflammation or nerve injury. This review focuses on the role(s) of molecularly defined PBN neurons and the downstream nodes in the brain that contribute to establishing nociplastic pain.

LTA4H’s location defines its function, whereby it generates leukotriene B4 intracellularly but degrades proline-glycine-proline extracellularly. Airway extracellular LTA4H concentrations are governed by changes in vascular permeability and influx of blood-borne enzyme, which is in turn secreted by liver hepatocytes.

                Antibodies are used in many areas of biomedical and clinical research, but many of these antibodies have not been adequately characterized, which casts doubt on the results reported in many scientific papers. This problem is compounded by a lack of suitable control experiments in many studies. In this article we review the history of the ‘antibody characterization crisis’, and we document efforts and initiatives to address the problem, notably for antibodies that target human proteins. We also present recommendations for a range of stakeholders – researchers, universities, journals, antibody vendors and repositories, scientific societies and funders – to increase the reproducibility of studies that rely on antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99960">Observing one-divalent-metal-ion-dependent and histidine-promoted His-Me family I-PpoI nuclease catalysis in crystallo</a></h4>

              
                Metal-ion-dependent nucleases play crucial roles in cellular defense and biotechnological applications. Time-resolved crystallography has resolved catalytic details of metal-ion-dependent DNA hydrolysis and synthesis, uncovering the essential roles of multiple metal ions during catalysis. The histidine-metal (His-Me) superfamily nucleases are renowned for binding one divalent metal ion and requiring a conserved histidine to promote catalysis. Many His-Me family nucleases, including homing endonucleases and Cas9 nuclease, have been adapted for biotechnological and biomedical applications. However, it remains unclear how the single metal ion in His-Me nucleases, together with the histidine, promotes water deprotonation, nucleophilic attack, and phosphodiester bond breakage. By observing DNA hydrolysis <i>in crystallo</i> with His-Me I-PpoI nuclease as a model system, we proved that only one divalent metal ion is required during its catalysis. Moreover, we uncovered several possible deprotonation pathways for the nucleophilic water. Interestingly, binding of the single metal ion and water deprotonation are concerted during catalysis. Our results reveal catalytic details of His-Me nucleases, which is distinct from multi-metal-ion-dependent DNA polymerases and nucleases.

">Opto-CLIP reveals dynamic FMRP regulation of mRNAs upon CA1 neuronal activation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal diversity and function are intricately linked to the dynamic regulation of RNA metabolism, including splicing, localization, and translation. Electrophysiologic studies of synaptic plasticity, models for learning and memory, are disrupted in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is characterized by the loss of FMRP, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) known to bind and suppress translation of specific neuronal RNAs. Since molecular studies have demonstrated that synaptic plasticity in CA1 excitatory hippocampal neurons is protein-synthesis dependent, together these observations have suggested a potential role for FMRP in synaptic plasticity in FXS. To explore this model, we developed a new experimental platform, Opto-CLIP, to integrate optogenetics with cell-type specific FMRP CLIP and RiboTag in CA1 hippocampal neurons, allowing investigation of FMRP- regulated dynamics after neuronal activation. We tracked changes in FMRP binding and ribosome- associated RNA profiles 30 minutes after neuronal activation. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in FMRP-RNA binding to transcripts encoding nuclear proteins, suggesting FMRP translational inhibition may be de-repressed to allow rapid translational responses required for neuronal homeostasis. In contrast, FMRP binding to transcripts encoding synaptic targets were generally stable after activation, but all categories of targets demonstrated variability in FMRP translational control. Opto-CLIP revealed differential regulation of subsets of transcripts within CA1 neurons rapidly after depolarization, and offers promise as a generally useful platform to uncover mechanisms of RBP-mediated RNA regulation in the context of synaptic plasticity.

">Spatially organized striatal neuromodulator release encodes trajectory errors</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed navigation requires animals to continuously evaluate their current direction and speed of travel relative to landmarks to discern whether they are approaching or deviating from their goal. Striatal dopamine and acetylcholine are powerful modulators of goal-directed behavior, but it is unclear whether and how neuromodulator dynamics at landmarks incorporate relative motion for effective behavioral guidance. Using optical measurements in mice, we demonstrate that cue-evoked striatal dopamine release encodes bi-directional 'trajectory errors' reflecting relationships between ongoing speed and direction of locomotion and visual flow relative to optimal goal trajectories. Striatum-wide micro-fiber array recordings resolved an anatomical gradient of trajectory error signaling across the anterior-posterior axis, distinct from trajectory error independent cue signals. Dynamic regression modeling revealed that positive and negative trajectory error encoding emerges early and late respectively during learning and over different time courses in the medial and lateral striatum, enabling region specific contributions to learning. Striatal acetylcholine release also encodes trajectory errors, but encoding is more spatially restricted, opposite polarity, and delayed relative to dopamine, supporting distinct roles in modulating striatal output and behavior. Dopamine trajectory error signaling and task performance were reproduced in a reinforcement learning model incorporating a conjunctive state space representation, suggesting a potential neural substrate for trajectory error generation. Our results establish region specific neuromodulator signals positioned to guide the speed and direction of locomotion to reach goals based on environmental landmarks during navigation.

	<p>Women veterans (WVs) are more likely than men veterans to experience traumatic brain injury (TBI) from causes unrelated to deployment. Yet, current Veterans Health Administration (VHA) TBI screening focuses on deployment. This study examines the utility of the VHA TBI screening tool for WVs. Using the Boston Assessment for TBI-Lifetime (BAT-L) as the gold standard, sensitivity and specificity of the VHA screen were identified for deployment and non-deployment injuries. Injuries missed by the screen were thematically described. Sensitivity and specificity were compared by context (research, clinical). Ninety WVs were included; fifty-three (60.9%) met TBI criteria per the BAT-L. For TBIs occurring during deployment, sensitivity was higher in research (89.1%) compared to clinics (61.7%); specificity was lower in research (60.7%) compared to clinics (93.0%). The BAT-L identified 27 non-deployment TBIs not captured by the VHA screen, most frequently from physical assault or sports. The VHA screen does not include non-deployment events; thus, non-deployment sensitivity and specificity could not be calculated. For lifetime TBIs (deployment + non-deployment etiologies), sensitivity was higher in research (73.5%) compared to clinics (48.9%). Specificity was lower in research (60.0%) compared to clinics (100.0%). Findings can inform improvements to TBI screening among WVs, including expansion for interpersonal violence.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to examine the associations between specific sleep parameters and specific aspects of cognitive functioning in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared with healthy controls (HCs) by using cognitive, subjective, and objective sleep measures. A total of 179 participants were enrolled, all aged &amp;amp;ge; 65 years (mean age = 70.23; SD = 4.74) and with a minimum of six years of education (mean = 12.35; SD = 3.22). The sample included 46 HCs (36 females), 75 individuals with amnestic MCI (aMCI) (51 females), and 58 individuals with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) (39 females). Inhibition, cognitive flexibility as a combined application of inhibitory control and set shifting or task/rule switching, and planning were examined. The following D-KEFS subtests were administered for their evaluation: Verbal Fluency Test, Color&amp;amp;ndash;Word Interference Test, and Tower Test. Self-reported sleep questionnaires (Athens Insomnia Scale, Stop-Bang questionnaire, and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index) were used for subjective sleep assessments. Actigraphy was used for objective sleep measurements. Mixed-measures ANOVA, MANOVA, and one-way ANOVA, as well as the Scheffe post hoc test, were applied to the data. The results showed that the three groups exhibited statistically significant differences in the Tower Test (total achievement score, total number of administered problems, and total rule violations). As regards objective sleep measurements, the total sleep time (TST) was measured using actigraphy, and indicated that there are significant differences, with the HC group having a significantly higher mean TST compared to the naMCI group. The relationships evaluated in the TST Tower Test were found to be statistically significant. The findings are discussed in the context of potential parameters that can support the connection between sleep duration, measured as TST, and cognitive planning, as measured using the Tower Test.</p>

                Background: The purpose of this study is to explore the trends and causes of established and emerging nations’ stock market integration with India. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) indices act as a counterweight to international market indices. This study investigates the sustained interest of foreign investors in the Indian stock market in the wake of capital market reforms, as well as whether it moves in tandem with other markets in Asia and the United States. Methods: Our study examined the possibility of cross-country cointegration between the largest economies and indices around the world using multiple financial econometric models, such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Unit Root, Correlation, and Johansen Cointegration. Results: The findings of this study significantly support the notion that Indian and international financial markets are highly integrated. Vector error correction model indicates that the Indian market (NSE) is highly cointegrated with the US market (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) and increased volatility signifies global contagion. Conclusion: A cursory examination of the data reveals distinct investment and portfolio diversification options for global investors. This could assist regulators in formulating more effective rules regarding price discovery processes.

The experimental study and transplantation of pancreatic islets requires their isolation from the surrounding tissue, and therefore, from the vasculature. Under these conditions, avascular islets rely on the diffusion of peripheral oxygen and nutrients to comply with the requirements of islet cells while responding to changes in body glucose. As a complement to the experimental work, computational models have been widely used to estimate how avascular islets would be affected by the hypoxic conditions found both in culture and transplant sites. However, previous models have been based on simplified representations of pancreatic islets which has limited the reach of the simulations performed. Aiming to contribute with a more realistic model of avascular human islets, in this work we used architectures of human islets reconstructed from experimental data to simulate the availability of oxygen for <i>α</i>, <i>β</i> and <i>δ</i>-cells, emulating culture and transplant conditions at different glucose concentrations. The modeling approach proposed allowed us to quantitatively estimate how the loss of cells due to severe hypoxia would impact interactions between islet cells, ultimately segregating the islet into disconnected subnetworks. According to the simulations performed, islet encapsulation, by reducing the oxygen available within the islets, could severely compromise cell viability. Moreover, our model suggests that even without encapsulation, only microislets composed of less than 100 cells would remain viable in oxygenation conditions found in transplant sites. Overall, in this article we delineate a novel modeling methodology to simulate detailed avascular islets in experimental and transplant conditions with potential applications in the field of islet encapsulation.

ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase 2 (Arl2) is crucial for controlling mitochondrial fusion and microtubule assembly in various organisms. Arl2 regulates the asymmetric division of neural stem cells in <i>Drosophila</i> via microtubule growth. However, the function of mammalian Arl2 during cortical development was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mouse Arl2 plays a new role in corticogenesis via regulating microtubule growth, but not mitochondria functions. Arl2 knockdown (KD) leads to impaired proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neuronal migration. Arl2 KD in mouse NPCs significantly diminishes centrosomal microtubule growth and delocalization of centrosomal proteins Cdk5rap2 and γ-tubulin. Moreover, Arl2 physically associates with Cdk5rap2 by in silico prediction using AlphaFold multimer, which was validated by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Remarkably, Cdk5rap2 overexpression significantly rescues the neurogenesis defects caused by Arl2 KD. Therefore, Arl2 plays an important role in mouse cortical development through microtubule growth via the centrosomal protein Cdk5rap2.

Rhoptries are specialized secretory organelles conserved across the Apicomplexa phylum, essential for host cell invasion and critical for subverting of host cellular and immune functions. They contain proteins and membranous materials injected directly into the host cells, participating in parasitophorous vacuole formation. <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> tachyzoites harbor 8 to 12 rhoptries, 2 of which are docked to an apical vesicle (AV), a central element associated with a rhoptry secretory apparatus prior to injection into the host cell. This parasite is also equipped with 5 to 6 microtubule-associated vesicles, presumably serving as AV replenishment for iterative rhoptry discharge. Here, we characterized a rhoptry protein, rhoptry discharge factor 3 (RDF3), crucial for rhoptry discharge and invasion. RDF3 enters the secretory pathway, localizing near the AV and associated with the rhoptry bulb. Upon invasion, RDF3 dynamically delocalizes, suggesting a critical role at the time of rhoptry discharge. Cryo-electron tomography analysis of RDF3-depleted parasites reveals irregularity in microtubule-associated vesicles morphology, presumably impacting on their preparedness to function as an AV. Our findings suggest that RDF3 is priming the microtubule-associated vesicles for rhoptry discharge by a mechanism distinct from the rhoptry secretory apparatus contribution.

Bacterial interactions are vital for adapting to changing environments, with quorum sensing (QS) systems playing a central role in coordinating behaviors through small signaling molecules. The RRNPPA family is the prevalent QS systems in <i>Bacillota</i> and mediating communication through secreted oligopeptides, which are processed into active pheromones by extracellular proteases. Notably, in several cases the propeptides show the presence of multiple putative pheromones within their sequences, which has been proposed as a mechanism to diversify peptide-receptor specificity and potentially facilitate new functions. However, neither the processes governing the maturation of propeptides containing multiple pheromones, nor their functional significance has been evaluated. Here, using 2 Rap systems from bacteriophages infecting <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> that exhibit different types of pheromone duplication in their propeptides, we investigate the maturation process and the molecular and functional activities of the produced pheromones. Our results reveal that distinct maturation processes generate multiple mature pheromones, which bind to receptors with varying affinities but produce identical structural and biological responses. These findings add additional layers in the complexity of QS communication and regulation, opening new possibilities for microbial social behaviors, highlighting the intricate nature of bacterial interactions and adaptation.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses a significant threat due to its tendency to evade early detection, frequent metastasis, and the subsequent challenges in devising effective treatments. Processes that govern epithelial—mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PDAC hold promise for advancing novel therapeutic strategies. SAMD1 (SAM domain-containing protein 1) is a CpG island-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the repression of its target genes. Here, we revealed that SAMD1 acts as a repressor of genes associated with EMT. Upon deletion of SAMD1 in PDAC cells, we observed significantly increased migration rates. SAMD1 exerts its effects by binding to specific genomic targets, including <i>CDH2</i>, encoding N-cadherin, which emerged as a driver of enhanced migration upon SAMD1 knockout. Furthermore, we discovered the FBXO11-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex as an interactor and negative regulator of SAMD1, which inhibits SAMD1 chromatin-binding genome-wide. High <i>FBXO11</i> expression in PDAC is associated with poor prognosis and increased expression of EMT-related genes, underlining an antagonistic relationship between SAMD1 and FBXO11. In summary, our findings provide insights into the regulation of EMT-related genes in PDAC, shedding light on the intricate role of SAMD1 and its interplay with FBXO11 in this cancer type.

Myers</p>

During Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction in development and disease, the atypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) SMOOTHENED (SMO) communicates with GLI transcription factors by binding the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-C) and physically blocking its enzymatic activity. Here, we show that GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2) orchestrates this process during endogenous mouse and zebrafish Hh pathway activation in the primary cilium. Upon SMO activation, GRK2 rapidly relocalizes from the ciliary base to the shaft, triggering SMO phosphorylation and PKA-C interaction. Reconstitution studies reveal that GRK2 phosphorylation enables active SMO to bind PKA-C directly. Lastly, the SMO-GRK2-PKA pathway underlies Hh signal transduction in a range of cellular and in vivo models. Thus, GRK2 phosphorylation of ciliary SMO and the ensuing PKA-C binding and inactivation are critical initiating events for the intracellular steps in Hh signaling. More broadly, our study suggests an expanded role for GRKs in enabling direct GPCR interactions with diverse intracellular effectors.

                <p>by M. Elise Bullock, Thea Hogan, Cayman Williams, Sinead Morris, Maria Nowicka, Minahil Sharjeel, Christiaan van Dorp, Andrew J. Yates, Benedict Seddon</p>

Quantifying the kinetics with which memory T cell populations are generated and maintained is essential for identifying the determinants of the duration of immunity. The quality and persistence of circulating CD4 effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>) and central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) T cells in mice appear to shift with age, but it is unclear whether these changes are driven by the aging host environment, by cell age effects, or both. Here, we address these issues by combining DNA labelling methods, established fate-mapping systems, a novel reporter mouse strain, and mathematical models. Together, these allow us to quantify the dynamics of both young and established circulating memory CD4 T cell subsets, within both young and old mice. We show that that these cells and their descendents become more persistent the longer they reside within the T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> pools. This behaviour may limit memory CD4 T cell diversity by skewing TCR repertoires towards clones generated early in life, but may also compensate for functional defects in new memory cells generated in old age.

                Huntingtin encodes a 3144 amino acid protein, with a polyglutamine repeat tract at the N-terminus. Expansion of this repeat tract above a pathogenic threshold of 36 repeats is the causative mutation of Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons. Here we have characterized twenty Huntingtin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

<p>This review article provides a historical overview of enigmatic neuronal structures originally described in the late 1800s, neuronal intranuclear rodlets, and describes recent studies demonstrating that they belong to a family of recently described mesoscale assemblies of nucleotide-synthesizing enzymes called “cytoophidia” (Greek for “cellular snakes”). The implications for understanding their functional significance and their role in neuronal metabolism, health, and survival are discussed.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Despite myriad technological advances in neuroscience, the nervous system harbors morphological phenomena that continue to defy explanation. First described by the classical microscopists, including Santiago Ramon y Cajal, at the end of the 19th century, the neuronal intranuclear rodlet (INR) has mystified neurohistologists and microscopists for centuries. In this review article, we will provide an overview of the discovery of the INR as well as the subsequent attempts to elucidate its nature and functional significance. We outline our own studies of this structure over the past three decades, focusing on its elusive nature, its interactions with other nuclear organelles, and on disease-related quantitative changes in Alzheimer's disease. We then describe our somewhat serendipitous discovery that these structures are filamentous aggregates of the nucleotide-synthesizing metabolic enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. The filamentation of metabolic enzymes to form mesoscale cellular structures called “rods and rings” or “cytoophidia” (Greek for “cellular snakes”) is a recently described phenomenon that remains to be systematically investigated in the nervous system. Thus, this review provides an intriguing historical juxtaposition in neuroscience, inculcating the neuronal INR, once a mere morphological curiosity, into one of the most rapidly evolving fields in contemporary cell biology.</p>

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscripts’ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

                Abstract* Background Increased expression of signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 3 (SCUBE3) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) has been thought to influence the fibrosis process in many tissues. However, increased expression of these two factors has never been assessed in pleural fibrosis. Pleural fibrosis is a disease that usually results from various infectious processes, such as empyema. Fibrosis formation is recently known to be prevented by Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the most potent active substance found in Gambir (Uncaria gambir Roxb) leaves. Thus, further research is needed to determine the potential of EGCG to inhibit the process of pleural fibrosis caused by empyema. Methods An in vitro experimental study with post test-only controlled group was conducted on the pleural tissue of all patients who underwent decortication surgery due to empyema at Dr. M. Djamil Hospital, Padang, Indonesia between March 1st and April 30, 2024. Case samples were obtained by consecutive sampling, and three patients who met the inclusion criteria were obtained. Pleural tissue in each patient was then divided into several groups based on the treatment, namely the control group, 50 μg EGCG administration group, and 100 μg EGCG administration group. We used to determine SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression. Data were tested using ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests. Results There were significant differences in the SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression of 50 μg and 100 μg EGCG administration groups and the control groups in the 2 × 2 cm sample preparation (p=0.002) (p=0.014, respectively). Significant differences in TGF-β1 expression were also found between the groups treated with EGCG 50 μg and 100 μg and the control group in the 1 × 1 cm preparation (p=0.019). Conclusion EGCG can potentially decrease SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 expression in patients with pleural empyema.

                <p>Many antiseizure medications cause apoptotic cell death in developing brains. The newer antiseizure medication lacosamide is increasingly used in neonates and infants. Neurotoxicity of lacosamide and its combination with levetiracetam was studied in neonatal mice. Animals received single or repeat injections of saline, phenobarbital (75mg/kg), lacosamide (20–40mg/kg), levetiracetam (100mg/kg), lacosamide (40mg/kg) + levetiracetam (100mg/kg) and euthanized at 6 to 30 hours. Cells undergoing apoptosis were increased in the brains of phenobarbital-treated animals. Densities of apoptotic profiles following lacosamide and levetiracetam treatment did not differ from saline-treated controls. Findings suggest that lacosamide, levetiracetam and their combination do not cause apoptosis in developing mouse brains. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-919/v1?src=rss">A novel low-rank reconstruction framework for precise fat-tumor discrimination in diffusion-weighted MRI [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) offers a non-invasive approach to detect tumors based on water mobility differences from surrounding tissue. However, reliably discriminating malignancies from benign adipose remains challenging, especially in anatomical regions with abundant fat. The biophysical similarities between tumors and lipid signals create signal ambiguities that limit diagnostic accuracy using conventional reconstruction techniques. Methods We propose a novel low-rank reconstruction framework that combines accelerated diffusion data acquisition, structured low-rank regularization, and deep learning-assisted radiomic analysis to enhance fat-tumor discrimination in DWI. Simultaneous multi-slice imaging and controlled aliasing enable high spatiotemporal resolution while maintaining feasible scan times. A data-driven annihilating filter kernel is then learned from the undersampled data, imposing implicit low-rank constraints to suppress confounding fat signals while retaining tumor texture details during k-space reconstruction. Subsequent radiomic analysis extracts morphological imaging biomarkers from the reconstructed volumes to identify distinctive tumor signatures. Results Comprehensive validation on clinical DWI datasets demonstrates the improved fat-tumor discrimination capability of the proposed framework compared to conventional techniques. The method achieves qualitatively improved clarity and definition of the phantom that was tested which will help in achieving a mean Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUCs) exceeding 0.80 for distinguishing malignant lesions from adipose tissue. Case studies illustrate how better signal specificity enables more confident clinical decisions. Conclusions The integrated low-rank reconstruction and radiomic analysis framework offers a promising solution to the longstanding problem of fat-tumor ambiguity in diffusion MRI. By unleashing the full diagnostic potential of DWI, this methodology can enhance non-invasive cancer screening and monitoring across diverse patient populations and anatomical regions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/10006">Prominin 1 and Tweety Homology 1 both induce extracellular vesicle formation</a></h4>

              
                Prominin-1 (Prom1) is a five-transmembrane-pass integral membrane protein that associates with curved regions of the plasma membrane. Prom1 interacts with membrane cholesterol and actively remodels the plasma membrane. Membrane bending activity is particularly evident in photoreceptors, where Prom1 loss-of-function mutations cause failure of outer segment homeostasis, leading to cone-rod retinal dystrophy (CRRD). The Tweety Homology (Ttyh) protein family has been proposed to be homologous to Prominin, but it is not known whether Ttyh proteins have an analogous membrane-bending function. Here, we characterize the membrane-bending activity of human Prom1 and Ttyh1 in native bilayer membranes. We find that Prom1 and Ttyh1 both induce formation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cultured mammalian cells and that the EVs produced are physically similar. Ttyh1 is more abundant in EV membranes than Prom1 and produces EVs with membranes that are more tubulated than Prom1 EVs. We further show that Prom1 interacts more stably with membrane cholesterol than Ttyh1 and that this may contribute to membrane bending inhibition in Prom1 EVs. Intriguingly, a loss-of-function mutation in Prom1 associated with CRRD induces particularly stable cholesterol binding. These experiments provide mechanistic insight into Prominin function in CRRD and suggest that Prom and Ttyh belong to a single family of functionally related membrane-bending, EV-generating proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93877">SPARK regulates AGC kinases central to the Toxoplasma gondii asexual cycle</a></h4>

              
                Apicomplexan parasites balance proliferation, persistence, and spread in their metazoan hosts. AGC kinases, such as PKG, PKA, and the PDK1 ortholog SPARK, integrate environmental signals to toggle parasites between replicative and motile life stages. Recent studies have cataloged pathways downstream of apicomplexan PKG and PKA; however, less is known about the global integration of AGC kinase signaling cascades. Here, conditional genetics coupled to unbiased proteomics demonstrates that SPARK complexes with an elongin-like protein to regulate the stability of PKA and PKG in the model apicomplexan <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Defects attributed to SPARK depletion develop after PKG and PKA are down-regulated. Parasites lacking SPARK differentiate into the chronic form of infection, which may arise from reduced activity of a coccidian-specific PKA ortholog. This work delineates the signaling topology of AGC kinases that together control transitions within the asexual cycle of this important family of parasites.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91684">Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri type III effector PthA4 directs the dynamical expression of a putative citrus carbohydrate-binding protein gene for canker formation</a></h4>

              
                <i>Xanthomonas citri</i> subsp. <i>citri</i> (<i>Xcc</i>), the causal agent of citrus canker, elicits canker symptoms in citrus plants because of the transcriptional activator-like (TAL) effector PthA4, which activates the expression of the citrus susceptibility gene <i>CsLOB1</i>. This study reports the regulation of the putative carbohydrate-binding protein gene <i>Cs9g12620</i> by PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 during <i>Xcc</i> infection. We found that the transcription of <i>Cs9g12620</i> was induced by infection with <i>Xcc</i> in a PthA4-dependent manner. Even though it specifically bound to a putative TAL effector-binding element in the <i>Cs9g12620</i> promoter, PthA4 exerted a suppressive effect on the promoter activity. In contrast, CsLOB1 bound to the <i>Cs9g12620</i> promoter to activate its expression. The silencing of <i>CsLOB1</i> significantly reduced the level of expression of <i>Cs9g12620</i>, which demonstrated that <i>Cs9g12620</i> was directly regulated by CsLOB1. Intriguingly, PhtA4 interacted with CsLOB1 and exerted feedback control that suppressed the induction of expression of <i>Cs9g12620</i> by CsLOB1. Transient overexpression and gene silencing revealed that <i>Cs9g12620</i> was required for the optimal development of canker symptoms. These results support the hypothesis that the expression of <i>Cs9g12620</i> is dynamically directed by PthA4 for canker formation through the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1.

                Hepatic factors secreted by the liver promote homeostasis and are pivotal for maintaining the liver-gut axis. Bile acid metabolism is one such example wherein, bile acid synthesis occurs in the liver and its biotransformation happens in the intestine. Dysfunctional interactions between the liver and the intestine stimulate varied pathological outcomes through its bidirectional portal communication. Indeed, aberrant bile acid metabolism has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these crosstalks that perpetuate intestinal permeability and inflammation remain obscure. Here, we identify a novel hepatic gene program regulated by Rela and Stat3 that accentuates the inflammation in an acute experimental colitis model. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of Rela and Stat3 reduces the levels of primary bile acids in both the liver and the gut and shows a restricted colitogenic phenotype. On supplementation of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), knock-out mice exhibit enhanced colitis-induced alterations. This study provides persuasive evidence for the development of multi-organ strategies for treating IBD and identifies a hepatocyte-specific Rela-Stat3 network as a promising therapeutic target.

">A novel functional coordination in UNC-13 regulates neurotransmitter release</a></h4>

              
                Munc13 plays a crucial role in short-term synaptic plasticity by regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis and neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminals. However, the intricate mechanisms governing these processes have remained elusive due to the presence of multiple functional domains within Munc13, each playing distinct roles in neurotransmitter release. Here we report a coordinated mechanism in the C. elegans Munc13 homolog UNC-13 that controls the functional switch of UNC-13 during synaptic transmission. Mutations disrupting the interactions of C1 and C2B with diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) on the plasma membrane induced the gain-of-function state of UNC-13L, the long UNC-13 isoform, resulting in enhanced SV release. Concurrent mutations in both domains counteracted this enhancement, highlighting the functional interdependence of C1 and C2B. Intriguingly, the individual C1 and C2B domains exhibited significantly stronger facilitation of SV release compared to the presence of both domains, supporting a mutual inhibition of C1 and C2B under basal conditions. Moreover, the N-terminal C2A and X domains exhibited opposite regulation on the functional switch of UNC-13L. Furthermore, we identified the polybasic motif in the C2B domain that facilitates SV release. Finally, we found that disruption of C1 and C2B membrane interaction in UNC-13S, the short isoform, leads to functional switch between gain-of-function and loss-of-function. Collectively, our findings provide a novel mechanism for SV exocytosis wherein UNC-13 undergoes functional switches through the coordination of its major domains, thereby regulating synaptic transmission and short-term synaptic plasticity.

">A multi-model approach defines function altering MECP2 missense variants identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                MECP2 is commonly mutated in Rett syndrome, where MECP2s function as a DNA cytosine methylation reader is believed critical. MECP2 variants are also catalogued in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including nine missense variants with no known clinical significance. To assess these nine as risk alleles for ASD, we developed MECP2 variant function assays using yeast, Drosophila and human cell lines. We calibrated these assays with known reference pathogenic and benign variants. Our data predict that four ASD variants are loss of function (LoF) and five are functional. Protein destabilization or nuclear delocalization offers insight into the altered function of a number of these variants. Notably, yeast and Drosophila lack DNA methylation, yet all Rett reference pathogenic and ASD variants in the methyl DNA binding domain that we analyzed proved to be LoF, suggesting a clinically-relevant role for non-methyl DNA-binding by MECP2.

">A cleaved cytosolic FOXG1 promotes excitatory neurogenesis by modulation of mitochondrial translation - a new therapeutic target for brain disorders.</a></h4>

              
                Modulation of mitochondrial function is at the core of cell fate decisions and tissue homeostasis, yet the mechanisms that govern their activity are not understood. Here, we provide evidence that mitochondrial activity is controlled in a tissue-specific manner through a non-canonical cytoplasmic function of the transcription factor FOXG1. Using zebrafish and human models of the neurodevelopmental disorder, FOXG1 Syndrome, we found that FOXG1 mutations inducing a premature stop codon unexpectedly lead to the production of a short C-terminal peptide. The expression of this truncated protein is responsible for an excess of excitatory neurons and a structural, functional, and translational mitochondrial phenotype in mutants. We demonstrate that this activity is a gain of function, normally carried out by a cleavage product in wildtype. Both peptides promote the translation of mitochondrially-encoded transcripts, are preferentially transported to the mitochondria, and interact with mito-ribosomal proteins. These findings unveil a mechanism that integrates cell fate decisions with metabolic output. Adjusting the dosage of the mutant peptide rescues aspects of FOXG1 Syndrome, offering a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of disorders involving mitochondrial dysfunctions.

">A bone-derived protein primes rapid visual escape via GPR37 receptor in a subpopulation of VTA GABAergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Rapid escape against visual threats is critical for survival. Whether it requires a permissive mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that osteocalcin (OCN), a protein produced by bone and persisted in the brain, primes rapid visual escape response by increasing excitability of VTA GABAergic neuron subpopulation via OCN-GPR37-cAMP-THIK-1 (K2P13.1) pathway. Knock-out of OCN or its receptor GPR37, and conditional knock-out of GPR37 in VTA GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons caused delayed escape. Reconstituting OCN-GPR37 signaling specifically in VTA was sufficient to restore normal response. Single-cell transcriptomics combined with electrophysiology showed that OCN decreases potassium currents in a subpopulation of VTA GABAergic neurons via GPR37-induced cAMP reduction and subsequent THIK-1 suppression. This elevation of excitability in VTA neuron subpopulation can be recapitulated by HM4Di, an inhibitory chemogenetic GPCR commonly used to suppress neuronal activity. Our study demonstrated that visual behavior requires a bone-derived protein that tunes electrophysiology of central nervous system neurons.

">Lower Aperiodic Activity is Associated with Reduced Verbal Fluency Performance Across Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Age-related cognitive decline associations with human electroencephalography (EEG) have previously focused on periodic activity. However, EEG is primarily made up of non-oscillatory aperiodic activity, which can be characterised with an exponent and offset value. In a secondary analysis of a cohort of 111 healthy participants aged 17 to 71 years, we examined the associations of the aperiodic exponent and offset with a battery of cognitive tests assessing processing speed and response inhibition, working memory, verbal learning and memory, psychomotor speed, and verbal fluency. Using Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering, we identified clusters of electrodes that exhibited similar aperiodic exponent and offset activity during resting-state eyes-closed EEG. Robust linear models were then used to model how aperiodic activity interacted with age and their associations with performance during each cognitive test. Exponent by age and offset by age interactions were identified for the verbal fluency model where flatter exponents and smaller offsets were associated with poorer performance in adults as early as 30 years of age. Steeper exponents and greater offsets become increasingly related to verbal fluency performance and executive functioning in adulthood.

">Population coding of predator imminence in the hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic VMHdmSF1 neurons are activated by predator cues and are necessary and sufficient for instinctive defensive responses. However, such data do not distinguish which features of a predator encounter are encoded by VMHdmSF1 neural activity. To address this issue, we imaged VMHdmSF1 neurons at single-cell resolution in freely behaving mice exposed to a natural predator in varying contexts. Our results reveal that VMHdmSF1 neurons do not represent different defensive behaviors, but rather encode predator identity and multiple predator-evoked internal states, including threat-evoked fear/anxiety; neophobia or arousal; predator imminence; and safety. Notably, threat and safety are encoded bi-directionally by anti-correlated subpopulations. Finally, individual differences in predator defensiveness are correlated with differences in VMHdmSF1 response dynamics. Thus, different threat-related internal state variables are encoded by distinct neuronal subpopulations within a genetically defined, anatomically restricted hypothalamic cell class.

">Human-specific features of cerebellar astrocytes and Purkinje cells: an anatomical comparison with mice and macaques</a></h4>

              
                Little is known about the morphological diversity and distribution of cerebellar astrocytes in the human brain and how or if these features differ from those of cerebellar astrocytes in species used to model human illnesses. To address this, we performed a comparative post-mortem examination of cerebellar astrocytes and Purkinje cells (PCs) in healthy humans, macaques, and mice using microscopy-based techniques. Visualizing with canonical astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 family member L1 (ALDH1L1), we mapped astrocytes within a complete cerebellar hemisphere. Astrocytes were observed to be differentially distributed across the cerebellar layers, displayed overall increases in area coverages with evolution, and showed features uniquely hominoid. Stereological quantifications in 3 functionally distinct cerebellar lobules demonstrated opposing trends for the canonical astrocyte markers across species with ALDH1L1+ astrocytes increasing with evolution and GFAP+ astrocytes decreasing. PC analyses revealed that while humans have the lowest PC densities, their cell body sizes were the largest with more ALDH1L1 immunoreactive (IR) astrocytes surrounding. Notably, the cognitive lobule crus I displayed the highest ratio of Bergmann glia to PC in all species. These findings align with the growing literature for astrocyte and PC heterogeneity and suggest cerebellar astrocyte and PC divergence both within and across species, possibly indicative of a role for these cells in higher-order cerebellar processing.

">Cognitive dysfunction following brain trauma results from sex-specific reactivation of the developmental pruning processes</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive losses resulting from severe brain trauma have long been associated with the focal region of tissue damage, leading to devastating functional impairment. For decades, researchers have focused on the sequelae of cellular alterations that exist within the perilesional tissues; however, few clinical trials have been successful. Here, we employed a mouse brain injury model that resulted in expansive synaptic damage to regions outside the focal injury. Our findings demonstrate that synaptic damage results from the prolonged increase in D-serine release from activated microglia and astrocytes, which leads to hyperactivation of perisynaptic NMDARs, tagging of damaged synapses by complement components, and the reactivation of developmental pruning processes. We show that this mechanistic pathway is reversible at several stages within a prolonged and progressive period of synaptic loss. Importantly, these key factors are present in acutely injured brain tissue acquired from patients with brain injury, which supports a therapeutic neuroprotective strategy.

">Inference technique for the synaptic conductances in rhythmically active networks and application to respiratory central pattern generation circuits</a></h4>

              
                Unraveling synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within rhythmic neural circuits, such as central pattern generation (CPG) circuits for rhythmic motor behaviors, is critical for deciphering circuit interactions and functional architecture, which is a major problem for understanding how neural circuits operate. Here we present a general method for extracting and separating patterns of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances at high temporal resolution from single neuronal intracellular recordings in rhythmically active networks. These post-synaptic conductances reflect the combined synaptic inputs from the key interacting neuronal populations and can reveal the functional connectome of the active circuits. To illustrate the applicability of our analytic technique, we employ our method to infer the synaptic conductance profiles in identified rhythmically active interneurons within key microcircuits of the mammalian (mature rat) brainstem respiratory CPG and provide a perspective on how our approach can resolve the functional interactions and circuit organization of these interneuron populations. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to any other rhythmic circuits where conditions allow for neuronal intracellular recordings.

	<p>For air traffic controllers, the extent of their cognitive workload can significantly impact their cognitive function and response time, consequently influencing their operational efficiency or even resulting in safety incidents. In order to enhance the accuracy and efficiency in determining the cognitive workload of air traffic controllers, a cognitive workload detection method for air traffic controllers based on mRMR and fewer EEG channels was proposed in this study. First of all, a set of features related to gamma waves was initially proposed; subsequently, an EEG feature evaluation method based on the mRMR algorithm was employed to pinpoint the most relevant indicators for the detection of the cognitive workload. Consequently, a model for the detection of the cognitive workload of controllers was developed, and it was optimized by filtering out channel combinations that exhibited higher sensitivity to the workload using the mRMR algorithm. The results demonstrate that the enhanced model achieves the accuracy and stability required for practical applications. Notably, in this study, only three EEG channels were employed to achieve the highly precise detection of the cognitive workload of controllers. This approach markedly increases the practicality of employing EEG equipment for the detection of the cognitive workload and streamlines the detection process.</p>

	<p>Brain networks based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide a crucial perspective for diagnosing brain diseases. Representation learning has recently attracted tremendous attention due to its strong representation capability, which can be naturally applied to brain disease analysis. However, traditional representation learning only considers direct and local node interactions in original brain networks, posing challenges in constructing higher-order brain networks to represent indirect and extensive node interactions. To address this problem, we propose the Continuous Dictionary of Nodes model and Bilinear-Diffusion (CDON-BD) network for brain disease analysis. The CDON model is innovatively used to learn the original brain network, with its encoder weights directly regarded as latent features. To fully integrate latent features, we further utilize Bilinear Pooling to construct higher-order brain networks. The Diffusion Module is designed to capture extensive node interactions in higher-order brain networks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CDON-BD demonstrates competitive classification performance on two real datasets. Moreover, the higher-order representations learned by our method reveal brain regions relevant to the diseases, contributing to a better understanding of the pathology of brain diseases.</p>

                <p>Older listeners often report difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments. It is important to identify where in the auditory pathway hearing-in-noise deficits arise to develop appropriate therapies. We tested how encoding of sounds is affected by masking noise at early stages of the auditory pathway by recording responses of principal cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of aging CBA/CaJ and C57BL/6J mice in vivo. Previous work indicated that masking noise shifts the dynamic range of single auditory nerve fibers (ANFs), leading to elevated tone thresholds. We hypothesized that such threshold shifts could contribute to increased hearing-in-noise deficits with age if susceptibility to masking increased in AVCN units. We tested this by recording the responses of AVCN principal neurons to tones in the presence and absence of masking noise. Surprisingly, we found that masker-induced threshold shifts decreased with age in primary-like units and did not change in choppers. In addition, spontaneous activity decreased in primary-like and chopper units of old mice, with no change in dynamic range or tuning precision. In C57 mice, which undergo early-onset hearing loss, units showed similar changes in threshold and spontaneous rate at younger ages, suggesting they were related to hearing loss and not simply aging. These findings suggest that sound information carried by AVCN principal cells remains largely unchanged with age. Therefore, hearing-in-noise deficits may result from other changes during aging, such as distorted across-channel input from the cochlea and changes in sound coding at later stages of the auditory pathway.</p>

Slow brain rhythms, for example during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing. They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms, involving synaptic interactions and delays, or from intrinsically bursting neurons. Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism generically available to all neurons with class I excitability. It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation–a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can, therefore, contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and, potentially, inform therapeutic strategies.

                <p>by William F. Dean, Tomasz J. Nawara, Rose M. Albert, Alexa L. Mattheyses</p>

Most essential cellular functions are performed by proteins assembled into larger complexes. Fluorescence Polarization Microscopy (FPM) is a powerful technique that goes beyond traditional imaging methods by allowing researchers to measure not only the localization of proteins within cells, but also their orientation or alignment within complexes or cellular structures. FPM can be easily integrated into standard widefield microscopes with the addition of a polarization modulator. However, the extensive image processing and analysis required to interpret the data have limited its widespread adoption. To overcome these challenges and enhance accessibility, we introduce OOPS (Object-Oriented Polarization Software), a MATLAB package for object-based analysis of FPM data. By combining flexible image segmentation and novel object-based analyses with a high-throughput FPM processing pipeline, OOPS empowers researchers to simultaneously study molecular order and orientation in individual biological structures; conduct population assessments based on morphological features, intensity statistics, and FPM measurements; and create publication-quality visualizations, all within a user-friendly graphical interface. Here, we demonstrate the power and versatility of our approach by applying OOPS to punctate and filamentous structures.

                <p>by Xiafang Zhang, Nianxia Xie, Guo Ding, Dongdong Ning, Wei Dai, Zijun Xiong, Wenjiang Zhong, Dashuang Zuo, Jie Zhao, Pei Zhang, Chengyuan Liu, Qiye Li, Hao Ran, Weiwei Liu, Guojie Zhang</p>

Phenotypic plasticity displayed by an animal in response to different environmental conditions is supposedly crucial for its survival and reproduction. The female adults of some ant lineages display phenotypic plasticity related to reproductive role. In pharaoh ant queens, insemination induces substantial physiological/behavioral changes and implicates remarkable gene regulatory network (GRN) shift in the brain. Here, we report a neuropeptide <i>neuroparsin A</i> (<i>NPA</i>) showing a conserved expression pattern associated with reproductive activity across ant species. Knock-down of <i>NPA</i> in unmated queen enhances ovary activity, whereas injection of NPA peptide in fertilized queen suppresses ovary activity. We found that NPA mainly affected the downstream gene <i>JHBP</i> in the ovary, which is positively regulated by NPA and suppression of which induces elevated ovary activity, and <i>shadow</i> which is negatively regulated by NPA. Furthermore, we show that NPA was also employed into the brain–ovary axis in regulating the worker reproductive changes in other distantly related species, such as <i>Harpegnathos venator</i> ants.

                <p>by Kazuma Mori, Robert Zatorre</p>

Music can evoke pleasurable and rewarding experiences. Past studies that examined task-related brain activity revealed individual differences in musical reward sensitivity traits and linked them to interactions between the auditory and reward systems. However, state-dependent fluctuations in spontaneous neural activity in relation to music-driven rewarding experiences have not been studied. Here, we used functional MRI to examine whether the coupling of auditory-reward networks during a silent period immediately before music listening can predict the degree of musical rewarding experience of human participants (<i>N</i> = 49). We used machine learning models and showed that the functional connectivity between auditory and reward networks, but not others, could robustly predict subjective, physiological, and neurobiological aspects of the strong musical reward of chills. Specifically, the right auditory cortex-striatum/orbitofrontal connections predicted the reported duration of chills and the activation level of nucleus accumbens and insula, whereas the auditory-amygdala connection was associated with psychophysiological arousal. Furthermore, the predictive model derived from the first sample of individuals was generalized in an independent dataset using different music samples. The generalization was successful only for state-like, pre-listening functional connectivity but not for stable, intrinsic functional connectivity. The current study reveals the critical role of sensory-reward connectivity in pre-task brain state in modulating subsequent rewarding experience.

                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly affects the respiratory tract, but different organs may be involved including the kidney. Data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of AKI complicating critical forms of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective descriptive case/control monocentric study conducted in a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital over a period of 18 months. Results We enrolled 144 patients, with a mean age of 58±13 years old and a male predominance (sex-ratio: 1.25). Forty-one (28%) developed AKI within a median of 4 days (Q1: 3, Q3: 8.5) after hospitalization. It was staged KDIGO class 3, in about half of the cases. Thirteen patients underwent renal replacement therapy and renal function improved in seven cases. Diabetes (OR: 6.07; 95% CI: (1,30-28,4); p: 0.022), nephrotoxic antibiotics (OR: 21; 95% CI: (3,2-146); p: 0.002), and shock (OR: 12.21; 95% CI: (2.87-51.85); p: 0.031,) were the three independent risk factors of AKI onset. Mortality was significantly higher in AKI group (OR: 3.94; 95% CI: (1.65-9.43); p<10−3) but AKI didn’t appear to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome. In fact, age (p: 0.004), shock (p: 0.045) and MV (p<10−3) were the three prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The incidence of AKI was high in this study and associated to an increased mortality. Diabetes, use of nephrotoxic antibiotics and shock contributed significantly to its occurrence. This underlines the importance of rationalizing antibiotic prescription and providing adequate management of patients with hemodynamic instability in order to prevent consequent AKI.

                Background Geopolymers are alternative materials to cement because they require less energy in their production process; hence, they contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of using industrial residues such as silica fume (SF) to improve the physical and mechanical properties of a pumice stone (PS)-based geopolymer. Methods Through an experimental methodology, the process starts with the extraction, grinding, and sieving of the raw material to carry out the physical and chemical characterization of the resulting material, followed by the dosage of the geopolymer mixture considering the factors that influence the resistance mechanical strength. Finally, the physical and mechanical properties of the geopolymer were characterized. This research was carried out in four stages: characterization of the pumice stone, design of the geopolymer through laboratory tests, application according to the dosage of the concrete, and analysis of the data through a multi-criteria analysis. Results It was determined that the optimal percentage of SF replacement is 10%, which to improves the properties of the geopolymer allowing to reach a maximum resistance to compression and flexion of 14.10 MPa and 4.78 MPa respectively, showing that there is a direct relationship between the percentage of SF and the resistance. Conclusions Geopolymer preparation involves the use of PS powder with a composition rich in silicon and aluminum. The factors influencing strength include the ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, water content, temperature, curing time, molarity of sodium hydroxide, and binder ratio. The results showed an increase in the compression and flexural strength with 10% SF replacement. The geopolymer’s maximum compressive strength indicates its non-structural use, but it can be improved by reducing the PS powder size.

                Background: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific sites on RNA molecules. Identifying these binding sites is crucial for understanding the many functions of RBPs in cellular function, development and disease. Current experimental methods for identifying RBP binding sites, such as ultra-violet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and especially the enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) protocol, were developed to identify authentic RBP binding sites experimentally. Methods: To make this data more accessible to the scientific community, we have developed RBP-Tar (https://ncbr.muni.cz/RBP-Tar), a web server and database that utilises eCLIP data for 167 RBPs mapped on the human genome. The web server allows researchers to easily search and retrieve binding site information by genomic location and RBP name. Use case: Researchers can produce lists of all known RBP binding sites on a gene of interest, or produce lists of binding sites for one RBP on different genomic loci. Conclusions: Our future goal is to continue to populate the web server with additional experimental datasets from CLIP experiments as they become available and processed, making it an increasingly valuable resource for the scientific community.

                Background COVID-19 disease has spread rapidly worldwide, causing high mortality. Accessible biomarkers capable of early identification of patients at risk of severe form are needed in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to determine the biological markers that predict a critical condition. Methods Retrospective study including patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized between September 2020 and June 2021. The primary endpoint was progression to critical status within 7 days from admission. We defined two groups: Critical group: Patients who developed a critical condition or died or transferred to the ICU before or at 7th day. Non-critical group: Patients who remained in non-critical respiratory status until 7th day or discharged before or at 7th day. Results Our study included 456 patients, with a sex ratio of 1.32 and an average age of 62 years. At the 7th day of hospitalization, 115 (25.2%) patients were in the critical group and 341 (74.8%) patients were in the non-critical group. The univariate logistic regression indicated that laboratory findings between non-critical and critical groups showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.047), D-Dimer (p=0.011), creatinine (0.026), creatine kinase (p=0.039), lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.04), and troponin (p=0.001) were all higher among patients in critical group. However, lymphocyte (p<0.001) and platelet (p<0.001) counts were significantly lower among the critical group. Multivariate logistic regression model, identified four independent risk factors: lymphopenia (OR=2.771, 95%CI=1.482-5.181, p=0.001), Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (OR=2.286, 95%CI=1.461-3.578, p<0.001), thrombocytopenia (OR=1.944, 95%CI=1.092-3.459, p=0.024), and CRP>71.5 (OR=1.598, 95% CI=1.042-2.45, p=0.032) were associated to critical group. Conclusions Our results show the predictive value of some biological markers to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. A prognostic score could be proposed for guiding clinical care and improving patient outcomes.

                Background The World Health Organization recommends that Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) should be administered to all People living with Human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) not currently suffering from tuberculosis (TB) to reduce the incidence of the same. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of PLHIV who contracted TB after receiving 6 months of IPT (followed up for ≥ 2 years), the incidence of PLHIV who developed tuberculosis when not on IPT, and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions due to IPT. Methods A Retrospective Cohort study was conducted in two ART centers in Mangalore, which included PLHIV who had completed 6 months of IPT from January 2017 to May 2018 and were followed up until May 2020; patients in the comparison group consisted of those attending ART centers during the same period who did not receive IPT. These data were retrieved from the case files of these patients from June to November 2020, entered into MS Excel, and analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25. Results The study included 1014 patients: 525 (51.8%) received IPT and 489 (48.2%) did not. Eight (1.5%) patients developed TB after IPT completion compared to 32 (6.5%) patients who developed TB from the non-IPT group. There was a 77% reduction in the incidence of developing TB in those patients who received IPT as compared to those who haven’t receive IPT (RR of 0.23, p value <0.0001). The reason for stopping IPT were due to side effects of IPT, experienced by 77 (14.6%) patients. Conclusions This study indicated that the completion of IPT significantly reduced the TB burden, showing significant protection against TB for a minimum duration of 2 years. Thus, implementation of IPT should be strengthened, and strict compliance should be ensured to reduce TB infection among PLHIV.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional design was employed, analyzing data from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires were used to assess anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

                Background: Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results: A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were increasing age (OR 1.06, p <0.001) and GCS <15 on admission (OR 7.21, p <0.001). Ps19 was the best predictor of mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions: The significant mortality predictors were age, fall from <2 metres, injury of head or limbs, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

                Evenly spaced “mosaics” of retinal neurons were discovered a century ago, but how mosaics form remains unknown. Here, Kozlowski et al. show that developing mouse starburst amacrine cells use MEGF10, a repulsive cell-surface molecule, to exclude neighboring somata from their dendritic territories. This repulsion establishes uniform spacing within the mosaic.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88733">Periaqueductal gray activates antipredatory neural responses in the amygdala of foraging rats</a></h4>

              
                Pavlovian fear conditioning research suggests that the interaction between the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) acts as a prediction error mechanism in the formation of associative fear memories. However, their roles in responding to naturalistic predatory threats, characterized by less explicit cues and the absence of reiterative trial-and-error learning events, remain unexplored. In this study, we conducted single-unit recordings in rats during an ‘approach food-avoid predator’ task, focusing on the responsiveness of dPAG and BLA neurons to a rapidly approaching robot predator. Optogenetic stimulation of the dPAG triggered fleeing behaviors and increased BLA activity in naive rats. Notably, BLA neurons activated by dPAG stimulation displayed immediate responses to the robot, demonstrating heightened synchronous activity compared to BLA neurons that did not respond to dPAG stimulation. Additionally, the use of anterograde and retrograde tracer injections into the dPAG and BLA, respectively, coupled with c-Fos activation in response to predatory threats, indicates that the midline thalamus may play an intermediary role in innate antipredatory-defensive functioning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89926">Semaphorin7A patterns neural circuitry in the lateral line of the zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                In a developing nervous system, axonal arbors often undergo complex rearrangements before neural circuits attain their final innervation topology. In the lateral line sensory system of the zebrafish, developing sensory axons reorganize their terminal arborization patterns to establish precise neural microcircuits around the mechanosensory hair cells. However, a quantitative understanding of the changes in the sensory arbor morphology and the regulators behind the microcircuit assembly remain enigmatic. Here, we report that Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) acts as an important mediator of these processes. Utilizing a semi-automated three-dimensional neurite tracing methodology and computational techniques, we have identified and quantitatively analyzed distinct topological features that shape the network in wild-type and Sema7A loss-of-function mutants. In contrast to those of wild-type animals, the sensory axons in Sema7A mutants display aberrant arborizations with disorganized network topology and diminished contacts to hair cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a secreted form of Sema7A by non-hair cells induces chemotropic guidance of sensory axons. Our findings propose that Sema7A likely functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92948">Prdm1 positively regulates liver Group 1 ILCs cancer immune surveillance and preserves functional heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) comprise conventional natural killer (cNK) cells and type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s). The main functions of liver cNK cells and ILC1s not only include directly killing target cells but also regulating local immune microenvironment of the liver through the secretion of cytokines. Uncovering the intricate mechanisms by which transcriptional factors regulate and influence the functions of liver cNK cells and ILC1s, particularly within the context of liver tumors, presents a significant opportunity to amplify the effectiveness of immunotherapies against liver malignancies. Using Ncr1-drived conditional knockout mouse model, our study reveals the regulatory role of <i>Prdm1</i> in shaping the composition and maturation of cNK cells. Although <i>Prdm1</i> did not affect the killing function of cNK cells in an in vivo cytotoxicity model, a significant increase in cancer metastasis was observed in <i>Prdm1</i> knockout mice. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granzyme B, and perforin secretion decreased significantly in <i>Prdm1</i>-deficient cNK cells and liver ILC1s. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data also provided evidences that Prdm1 maintains functional subsets of cNK cells and liver ILC1s and facilitates communications between cNK cells, liver ILC1s, and macrophages. The present study unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism of Prdm1 in cNK cells and liver ILC1s, showing promising potential for developing innovative immune therapy strategies against liver cancer.

">A novel candidate neuromarker of central motor dysfunction in childhood apraxia of speech</a></h4>

              
                Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is conceived as an impairment of the central motor systems ability to program multiple speech movements, resulting in inaccurate transitions between and relative timing across speech sounds. However, the extant neuroimaging evidence base is scant and inconclusive and the neurophysiological origins of these motor planning problems remain highly underspecified. In the first magnetoencephalography study of this disorder, we measured brain activity from typically developing children (N = 19) and children with CAS (N=7) during performance of a speech task designed to interrogate function of the speech areas of primary sensorimotor cortex. Relative to their typically developing peers, our sample of CAS children showed abnormal speech-related responses within the mu-band motor rhythm, and beamformer source reconstruction analyses specify a brain origin of this speech rhythm in the left cerebral hemisphere, within or near pre-Rolandic motor areas crucial for the planning and control of speech and oromotor movements. These results provide a new and specific candidate mechanism for the core praxic features of CAS; point to a novel and robust neurophysiological marker of typical and atypical expressive speech development; and support an emerging neuroscientific consensus which assigns a central role for programming and coordination of speech movements to the motor cortices of the precentral gyrus.

">Genetic analysis of retinal cell types reveals synaptic pathology in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Importance: As an accessible part of the central nervous system, the retina provides a unique window to study pathophysiological mechanisms of brain disorders in humans. Imaging and electrophysiological studies have revealed retinal alterations across several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. However, it remains largely unclear whether primary disease mechanisms within the retina contribute to the observed retinal alterations and which specific retinal cell types and biological mechanisms are involved. Objective: To determine whether specific retinal cell types are affected by genomic risk for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and to explore the mechanisms through which genomic risk converges in these cell types. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this study, we combined findings from genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and stroke with retinal single-cell transcriptomic data sets from humans, macaques, and mice. To identify susceptible cell types, we applied MAGMA cell type enrichment analyses and performed subsequent pathway analyses. Furthermore, we translated the cellular top hit to the structural level by using retinal optical coherence tomography and genotyping data in the large population-based UK Biobank cohort (n = 36,349). Main Outcomes and Measures: Cell type-specific enrichment of genetic risk loading for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorder traits in the gene expression profiles of retinal cells. Results: Amacrine cells (interneurons within the retina) were robustly enriched in schizophrenia genetic risk across mammalian species and in different developmental stages. This enrichment was primarily driven by genes involved in synapse biology. On the structural level, higher polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with thinning of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, which contains dendrites and synaptic connections of amacrine cells. Moreover, retinal immune cell populations were enriched in multiple sclerosis genetic risk. No consistent cell type associations were found for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, or stroke. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides novel insights into the cellular underpinnings of retinal alterations in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and highlights the retina as a potential proxy to study synaptic pathology in schizophrenia.

">Superiority of Rhythmic Auditory Signals over Electrical Stimulation to Entrain Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Neural tracking (entrainment) of auditory rhythms enhances perception. We previously demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can enhance or suppress entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli, depending on the timing between the electrical and auditory signals, although tACS effects are primarily modulatory. This study further investigated entrainment to tACS and auditory rhythms when the electrical and auditory signals were presented together (Experiment 1, N = 34) or independently (Experiment 2, N = 24; Experiment 3, N = 12). We hypothesized that tACS effects would be more pronounced when the auditory rhythm was made less perceptually salient to reduce the competition with the electrical rhythm. Participants detected silent gaps in modulated or unmodulated noise stimuli. In Experiment 1, auditory stimuli predominated in entraining behavior. While behavioral entrainment to sound rhythms was affected by the modulation depth of the auditory stimulus, entrainment to tACS was not. In Experiment 2, with no rhythmic information from the sound, 16 of 24 participants showed significant behavioral entrainment to tACS, although the most effective tACS frequency varied across participants. An oscillator model with a free parameter for the individual resonance frequency produced profiles similar to those we observed behaviorally. In Experiment 3, both neural and behavioral entrainment to rhythmic sounds were affected by the auditory stimulus frequency, but again the most effective entraining frequency varied across participants. Our findings suggest that tACS effects depend on the individuals preferred frequency when there is no competition with sensory stimuli, emphasizing the importance of targeting individual frequencies in tACS experiments. When both sensory and electrical stimuli are rhythmic and compete, sensory stimuli prevail, indicating the superiority of sensory stimulation in modulating behavior.

">Microglia are Required for Developmental Specification of AgRP Innervation in the Hypothalamus of Offspring Exposed to Maternal High Fat Diet During Lactation</a></h4>

              
                Nutritional fluctuations that occur early in life dictate metabolic adaptations that will affect susceptibility to weight gain and obesity later in life. The postnatal period in mice represents a time of dynamic changes in hypothalamic development and maternal consumption of a high fat diet during the lactation period (MHFD) changes the composition of milk and leads to enhanced susceptibility to obesity in offspring. Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) react to changes in multiple metabolic signals and distribute neuroendocrine information to other brain regions, such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), which is known to integrate a variety of signals that regulate body weight. Development of neural projections from AgRP neurons to the PVH occurs during the lactation period and these projections are reduced in MHFD offspring, but underlying developmental mechanisms remain largely unknown. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system and are involved in refinement of neural connections and modulation of synaptic transmission. Because high fat diet exposure causes activation of microglia in adults, a similar activation may occur in offspring exposed to MHFD and play a role in sculpting hypothalamic feeding circuitry. Genetically targeted axonal labeling and immunohistochemistry were used to visualize AgRP axons and microglia in postnatal mice derived from MHFD dams and morphological changes quantified. The results demonstrate regionally localized changes to microglial morphology in the PVH of MHFD offspring that suggest enhanced surveillance activity, and are temporally restricted to the period when AgRP neurons innervate the PVH. In addition, axon labeling experiments confirm a significant decrease in AgRP innervation of the PVH in MHFD offspring and provide direct evidence of synaptic pruning of AgRP inputs to the PVH. Microglial depletion with the Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622 determined that the decrease in AgRP innervation observed in MHFD offspring is dependent on microglia, and that microglia are required for weight gain that emerges as early as weaning in offspring of MHFD dams. However, these changes do not appear to be dependent on the degree of microglial mediated synaptic pruning. Together, these findings suggest that microglia are activated by exposure to MHFD and interact directly with AgRP axons during development to permanently alter their density, with implications for developmental programming of metabolic phenotype.

">EEG-based analysis of intrinsic brain network function in chronic pain: Insights from a comprehensive multi-data set study</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is associated with alterations in brain function. A better understanding of these alterations might help to develop new approaches for the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of chronic pain. Here, we analyzed associations between chronic pain and alterations of intrinsic brain network function using resting-state electroencephalography. We included data from 537 people with chronic pain obtained from various research groups worldwide. We found strong evidence for associations between pain intensity and intrinsic brain network connectivity, but the replicability of these associations in independent data was mostly low. However, a mega-analysis revealed associations of chronic pain with salience-somatomotor network connectivity at theta frequencies and with more complex patterns of intrinsic brain network connectivity. These findings provide novel insights into brain network function in chronic pain. Moreover, they highlight the need for collaborative multi-center studies, which can be guided by the present approach to promote replicability and consistency of findings.

">Modelling inflammation-induced peripheral sensitization in a dish - more complex than expected?</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral sensitization of nociceptors is believed to be a key driver of chronic pain states. Here, we sought to study the effects of a modified version of inflammatory soup on the excitability of human stem-cell derived sensory neurons. For this, we used a pre-existing and a novel stem cell line, modified to stably express the calcium sensor GCamP6f. Upon treatment with inflammatory soup, we observed no changes in neuronal transcription or functional responses upon calcium imaging, and only a very minor increase in resting membrane potential via whole cell patch clamping. Similarly small changes were observed when treating mouse primary sensory neurons with inflammatory soup. A semi-systematic re-examination of past literature further indicated that observed effects of inflammatory mediators on dissociated sensory neuron cultures are generally very small. We conclude that modelling inflammation-induced peripheral sensitization in vitro is non-trivial and will require careful selection of mediators and/or more complex, longitudinal multi-cellular setups. Especially in the latter, our novel GCamP6f induced-pluripotent stem cell line may be of value.

">The BDNF/TrkB pathway in Somatostatin-expressing neurons suppresses cocaine-seeking behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine addiction is a highly debilitating condition consisting of compulsive self-administration and seek for the substance of abuse, and its most challenging feature is the high rate of relapse. Addiction and relapse share similarities with neural plasticity which acts through the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and its receptor TrkB. Somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons are involved in neuronal plasticity and are important in modulating cocaine-seeking behaviour in mice. We tested the role of TrkB in Somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons in the extinction of cocaine-seeking behaviour, using mice in which TrkB has been knocked out specifically in SST neurons. We have observed that in these mice, once a cocaine-conditioned place preference is acquired, its extinction through seven days of extinction training is impaired, showing how this process relies on neural plasticity in SST neurons. When we promoted plasticity during extinction training using a light-activable TrkB in SST neurons in the prefrontal cortex of cocaine-conditioned mice, relapse of cocaine-seeking was prevented. Our data identify the critical role of TrkB-mediated plasticity within SST neurons in the extinction of and relapse to cocaine addiction.

">Mnemonic brain state engagement is diminished in healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                Healthy older adults typically show impaired episodic memory - memory for when and where an event oc-curred - but intact semantic memory - knowledge for general information and facts. As older adults also have difficulty inhibiting the retrieval of prior knowledge from memory, their selective decline in episodic memory may be due to a tendency to over engage the retrieval state, a brain state in which attention is focused internally in an attempt to access prior knowledge. The retrieval state trades off with the encoding state, a brain state which supports the formation of new memories. Therefore, episodic memory declines in older adults may be the result of differential engagement in mnemonic brain states. Our hypothesis is that older adults are biased toward a retrieval state. We recorded scalp electroencephalography while young, middle-aged and older adults performed a memory task in which they were explicitly directed to either encode the currently presented object stimulus or retrieve a previously presented, categorically-related object stimulus. We used multivariate pattern analysis of spectral activity to decode engagement in the retrieval vs. encoding state. We find that all three age groups can follow top-down instructions to selectively engage in encoding or retrieval and that we can decode mnemonic states for all age groups. However, we find that mnemonic brain state engagement is diminished for older adults relative to middle-aged adults. Our interpretation is that a combination of executive control deficits and a modest bias to retrieve modulates older adults mnemonic state engagement. Together, these findings suggest that dif-ferential mnemonic state engagement may underlie age-related memory changes.

">Longitudinal deformation based morphometry pipeline to study neuroanatomical differences in structural MRI based on SyN unbiased templates</a></h4>

              
                Morphometric measures in humans derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have provided important insights into brain differences and changes associated with development and disease in vivo. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) is a registration-based technique that has been shown to be useful in detecting local volume differences and longitudinal brain changes while not requiring a priori segmentation or tissue classification. Typically, DBM measures are derived from registration to common template brain space (one-level DBM). Here, we present a two-level DBM technique: first, the Jacobian determinants are calculated for each individual input MRI at the subject level to capture longitudinal individual brain changes; then, in a second step, an unbiased common group space is created, and the Jacobians co-registered to enable the comparison of individual morphological changes across subjects or groups. This two-level DBM is particularly suitable for capturing longitudinal intra-individual changes in vivo, as calculating the Jacobians within-subject space leads to superior accuracy. Using artificially induced volume differences, we demonstrate that this two-level DBM pipeline is 4.5x more sensitive in detecting longitudinal within-subject volume changes compared to a typical one-level DBM approach. It also captures the magnitude of the induced volume change much more accurately. Using 150 subjects from the OASIS-2 dataset, we demonstrate that the two-level DBM is superior in capturing cortical volume changes associated with cognitive decline across patients with dementia and cognitively healthy individuals. This pipeline provides researchers with a powerful tool to study longitudinal brain changes with superior accuracy and sensitivity. It is publicly available and has already been used successfully, proving its utility.

                Prospect theory has suggested that decisions reflect a bias toward avoidance of loss compared to equivalent gains. In our study we examine whether a similar bias is found in decisions regarding whether a loss associated stimulus or a gain associated stimulus is given priority in perception. We find that for most people, gains are given priority over loss in the decision of which of the two stimuli occurs first. We also ask whether gains are reflected in greater activity in limbic systems related to emotion. In an fMRI study, we find that most people show greater emotional response to gains, not losses. We consider how these findings might be related to risk aversion in studies of decision making.

">The role of TRPV4 in acute sleep deprivation-induced fear memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Acute sleep deprivation (ASD) negatively impacts fear memory, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a cation channel which is closely correlated with the concentration of Ca2+, and neuronal Ca2+ overloading is a crucial inducement of learning and memory impairment. This study utilized an acute sleep-deprived mouse model combined with fear conditioning to investigate these mechanisms. mRNA sequencing revealed increased expression of TRPV4 in mice with ASD-induced fear memory impairment. Notably, knockdown of TRPV4 reversed ASD-induced fear memory impairment. ASD leads to the increased concentration of Ca2+. Additionally, we observed a reduction in spine density and a significant decrease in postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), which is associated with synaptic plasticity, in sleep-deprived fear memory impairment mice. This indicates that ASD may cause overloaded Ca2+, disrupting synaptic plasticity and impairing fear memory. Moreover, TRPV4 knockdown significantly decreased Ca2+ concentration, mitigated the loss of dendritic spines and reduction of PSD95, contributing to the restoration of fear memory. These findings indicate a potential protective role of TRPV4 knockdown in counteracting ASD-induced fear memory deficits. Collectively, our results highlight that TRPV4 may be a potential therapeutic target in mediating fear memory impairment due to ASD and underscore the importance of sleep management for conditions like PTSD.

">A posture subspace in primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                To generate movements, the brain must combine information about movement goal and body posture. Motor cortex (M1) is a key node for the convergence of these information streams. How are posture and goal information organized within M1s activity to permit the flexible generation of movement commands? To answer this question, we recorded M1 activity while monkeys performed a variety of tasks with the forearm in a range of postures. We found that posture- and goal-related components of neural population activity were separable and resided in nearly orthogonal subspaces. The posture subspace was stable across tasks. Within each task, neural trajectories for each goal had similar shapes across postures. Our results reveal a simpler organization of posture information in M1 than previously recognized. The compartmentalization of posture and goal information might allow the two to be flexibly combined in the service of our broad repertoire of actions.

">Perceived multisensory common cause relations shape the ventriloquism effect but only marginally the trial-wise aftereffect</a></h4>

              
                Combining multisensory cues is fundamental for perception and action, and reflected by two frequently-studied phenomena: multisensory integration and sensory recalibration. In the context of audio-visual spatial signals, these are exemplified by the ventriloquism effect and its aftereffect. The ventriloquism effect occurs when the perceived location of a sound is biased by a concurrent visual stimulus, while the aftereffect manifests as a recalibration of sound localization after exposure to spatially discrepant stimuli. The relationship between these processes--whether recalibration is a direct consequence of integration or operates independently--remains debated. This study investigates the role of causal inference in these processes by examining whether trial-wise judgments of audio-visual stimuli as originating from a common cause influence both the ventriloquism effect and the immediate aftereffect. Using a spatial paradigm, participants made explicit judgments about the common cause of stimulus pairs, and their influence on both perceptual biases was assessed. Our results indicate that while multisensory integration is contingent on common cause judgments, the immediate recalibration effect is not. This suggests that recalibration can occur independently of the perceived commonality of the multisensory stimuli, challenging the notion that recalibration is solely a byproduct of integration.

">Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences</a></h4>

              
                The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated arenas. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as continuously varying, high-dimensional, sensory experience maps (spatially smoothed Gaussian random fields). Training our autoencoder to accurately pattern-complete and reconstruct sensory experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the networks hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.

">Brain-like border ownership signals support prediction of natural videos</a></h4>

              
                To make sense of visual scenes, the brain must segment foreground from background. This is thought to be facilitated by neurons in the primate visual system that encode border ownership (BOS), i.e. whether a local border is part of an object on one or the other side of the border. It is unclear how these signals emerge in neural networks without a teaching signal of what is foreground and background. In this study, we investigated whether BOS signals exist in PredNet, a self-supervised artificial neural network trained to predict the next image frame of natural video sequences. We found that a significant number of units in PredNet are selective for BOS. Moreover these units share several other properties with the BOS neurons in the brain, including robustness to scene variations that constitute common object transformations in natural videos, and hysteresis of BOS signals. Finally, we performed ablation experiments and found that BOS units contribute more to prediction than non-BOS units for videos with moving objects. Our findings indicate that BOS units are especially useful to predict future input in natural videos, even when networks are not required to segment foreground from background. This suggests that BOS neurons in the brain might be the result of evolutionary or developmental pressure to predict future input in natural, complex dynamic visual environments.

">Serpina1e mediates the exercise-induced enhancement of hippocampal memory</a></h4>

              
                The exercise induced enhancement of learning and memory is thought to be regulated by interactions between body and brain via secretory proteins in the blood plasma. Given the prominent role that skeletal muscle plays during exercise, the beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive functions appear to be mediated by muscle derived secretory factors including myokines. However, the specific myokines that exert beneficial effects on cognitive functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we reveal that a novel myokine, Serpina1e, acts a molecular mediator that directly supports long term memory formation in the hippocampus. Using an in vivo myokine labeling mouse model, proteomic analysis revealed that the Serpina1 family of proteins are the myokines whose levels increased the most in plasma after chronic aerobic exercise for 4 weeks. Systemic delivery of recombinant Serpina1e into sedentary mice was sufficient for reproducing the beneficial effect of exercise on hippocampus associated cognitive functions. Moreover, plasma Serpina1e can cross the blood cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) barrier and blood brain barrier to reach the brain, thereby influencing hippocampal function. Indeed, an increase in the plasma level of Serpina1e promoted hippocampal neurogenesis, increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and induced neurite growth. Our findings reveal that Serpina1e is a myokine that migrates to the brain and mediates exercise induced memory enhancement by triggering neurotrophic growth signaling in the hippocampus. This discovery elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive function and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for alleviating cognitive disorders.

">Local Synthesis of Reticulon-1C Lessens the Outgrowth of Injured Axons by Controlling Spastin Activity</a></h4>

              
                The regenerative potential of developing cortical axons following injury depends on intrinsic mechanisms, such as axon-autonomous protein synthesis, that are still not fully understood. An emerging factor in this regenerative process is the bi-directional interplay between microtubule dynamics and structural proteins of the axonal endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, we hypothesize that locally synthesized structural proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum may regulate microtubule dynamics and the outgrowth of injured cortical axons. This hypothesis is supported by RNA data-mining, which identified Reticulon-1 as the sole ER-shaping protein consistently present in axonal transcriptomes and found it to be downregulated following cortical axon injury. Using compartmentalized microfluidic chambers, we demonstrate that local knockdown of Reticulon-1 mRNA enhances outgrowth while reducing the distal tubulin levels of injured cortical axons. Additionally, live cell imaging shows injury-induced reductions in microtubule growth rate and length, which are fully restored by axonal Reticulon-1 knockdown. Interestingly, axonal inhibition of the microtubule-severing protein Spastin fully prevents the effects of local Reticulon-1 knockdown on outgrowth and tubulin levels, while not affecting microtubule dynamics. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting that the Reticulon-1C isoform is locally synthesized in injured axons and associates with Spastin to inhibit its severing activity. Our findings reveal a novel injury-dependent mechanism in which a locally synthesized ER-shaping protein lessens microtubule dynamics and the outgrowth of cortical axons.

">Efficient modular system identification provides a high-resolution assay of temporal processing and reveals the multilevel effects of attention along the human auditory pathway</a></h4>

              
                Human studies of auditory temporal processing and the effects therein of aging, hearing loss, musicianship, and other auditory processing disorders have conventionally employed brainstem evoked potentials (e.g., FFRs/EFRs targeting specific modulation frequencies). Studies of temporal processing in forebrain structures are fewer and are often restricted to the 40 Hz steady-state response. One factor contributing to the limited investigation is the lack of a fast and reliable method to characterize temporal processing non-invasively in humans over a wide range of modulation frequencies. Here, we use a system-identification approach where white noise, modulated using an extended maximum-length sequence (em-seq), is employed to target stimulus energy toward a modulation-frequency range of interest and efficiently obtain a robust auditory modulation-temporal response function or  mod-TRF. The mod-TRF can capture activity from sources in the early processing pathway (5-7 ms latency), middle-latency region (MLR), and late latency region (LLR). The mod-TRF is a high-resolution, modular assay of the temporal modulation transfer function (tMTF) in that the distinct neural components contributing to the tMTF can be separated on the basis of their latency, modulation frequency band, and scalp topography. This decomposition provides the insight that the seemingly random individual variation in the shape of the tMTF can be understood as arising from individual differences in the weighting and latency of similar underlying neural sources in the composite scalp response. We measured the mod-TRF under different states of attention and found a reduction in latency or enhancement of amplitude of the response from specific sources. Surprisingly, we found that attention effects can extend to the earliest parts of the processing pathway (5ms) in highly demanding tasks. Taken together, the mod-TRF is a promising tool for dissecting auditory temporal processing and obtain further insight into a variety of phenomenon such as aging, hearing loss, and neural pathology.

">Subsets of extraocular motoneurons produce kinematically distinct saccades during hunting and exploration.</a></h4>

              
                Animals construct diverse behavioural repertoires by moving a limited number of body parts with varied kinematics and patterns of coordination. There is evidence that distinct movements can be generated by changes in activity dynamics within a common pool of motoneurons, or by selectively engaging specific subsets of motoneurons in a task-dependent manner. However, in most cases we have an incomplete understanding of the patterns of motoneuron activity that generate distinct actions and how upstream premotor circuits select and assemble such motor programmes. In this study, we used two closely related but kinematically distinct types of saccadic eye movement in larval zebrafish as a model to examine circuit control of movement diversity. In contrast to the prevailing view of a final common pathway, we found that in oculomotor nucleus, distinct subsets of motoneurons were engaged for each saccade type. This type-specific recruitment was topographically organised and aligned with ultrastructural differ-ences in motoneuron morphology and afferent synaptic innervation. Medially located motoneu-rons were active for both saccade types and circuit tracing revealed a type-agnostic premotor pathway that appears to control their recruitment. By contrast, a laterally located subset of motoneurons was specifically active for hunting-associated saccades and received premotor in-put from pretectal hunting command neurons. Our data support a model in which generalist and action-specific premotor pathways engage distinct subsets of motoneurons to elicit varied movements of the same body part that subserve distinct behavioural functions.

	<p>Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the specific regions of abnormal cortical communication efficiency in patients with mild subcortical stroke and to investigate the relationship between these communication efficiency abnormalities and multidimensional cognition. Methods: The research involved 35 patients with mild strokes affecting the basal ganglia and 29 healthy controls (HC). Comprehensive neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments were conducted. Stroke patients were categorized into post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) (MoCA &amp;amp;le; 22) and non-cognitively impaired stroke patients (NPSCI) (MoCA &amp;amp;ge; 23) based on their cognitive performance. Additionally, 22 patients were reassessed three months later. Results: PSCI patients, compared to HC and NPSCI groups, had significantly higher communication efficiency in specific brain regions. A notable finding was the significant correlation between increased communication efficiency in the medioventral occipital cortex and multidimensional cognitive decline. However, this increased communication efficiency in PSCI patients lessened during the three-month follow-up period. Conclusions: the heightened communication efficiency in the medio-ventral occipital cortex may represent a compensatory mechanism for cognitive impairment in PSCI patients, which undergoes adjustment three months after stroke.</p>

	<p>Diet-induced obesity is a global phenomenon that affects the population worldwide with manifestations at both the phenotypic and genotypic levels. Cognitive function decline is a major global health challenge. The relation between obesity and cognitive function is a debatable issue. The main goal of the current research was to study the implications of obesity on cognitive function and gut microbiota diversity and its impact on plasma and brain metabolic parameters in rats. Obesity was induced in rats by feeding on a high-fat (HF) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. The results reveal that both the HF (0.683) and HFHS (0.688) diets were effective as obesity inducers, which was confirmed by a significant increase in the body mass index (BMI). Both diet groups showed dyslipidemia and elevation of oxidative stress, insulin resistance (IR), and inflammatory markers with alterations in liver and kidney functions. Obesity led to a reduction in cognitive function through a reduction in short-term memory by 23.8% and 30.7% in the rats fed HF and HFHS diets, respectively, and learning capacity and visuo-spatial memory reduced by 8.9 and 9.7 s in the rats fed an HF or HFHS diet, respectively. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Spirochaetes phyla were detected. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B) significantly decreased in the HF group, while it increased in the HFHS group compared to the normal control. The two species, Bacteroides acidifaciens and Bacteroides ovatus, which are associated with IR, were drastically compromised by the high-fat/high-sucrose diet. Some species that have been linked to reduced inflammation showed a sharp decrease in the HFHS group, while Prevotella copri, which is linked to carbohydrate metabolism, was highly enriched. In conclusion: Obesity led to cognitive impairment through changes in short-term and visuo-spatial memory. A metagenomic analysis revealed alterations in the abundance of some microbial taxa associated with obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance in the HF and HFHS groups.</p>

	<p>The distinct clinical and radiological characteristics of right temporal variant FTD have only been recently recognized. Methods: Eight patients with right temporal variant FTD were prospectively recruited and underwent a standardised neuropsychological assessment, clinical MRI, and quantitative neuroimaging. Results: Our voxelwise grey analyses captured bilateral anterior and mesial temporal grey matter atrophy with a clear right-sided predominance. Bilateral hippocampal involvement was also observed, as well as disease burden in the right insular and opercula regions. White matter integrity alterations were also bilateral in anterior temporal and sub-insular regions with a clear right-hemispheric predominance. Extra-temporal white matter alterations have also been observed in orbitofrontal and parietal regions. Significant bilateral but right-predominant thalamus, putamen, hippocampus, and amygdala atrophy was identified based on subcortical segmentation. The clinical profile of our patients was dominated by progressive indifference, decline in motivation, loss of interest in previously cherished activities, incremental social withdrawal, difficulty recognising people, progressive language deficits, increasingly rigid routines, and repetitive behaviours. Conclusions: Right temporal variant FTD has an insidious onset and may be mistaken for depression at symptom onset. It manifests in a combination of apathy, language, and behavioural features. Quantitative MR imaging captures a characteristic bilateral but right-predominant temporal imaging signature with extra-temporal frontal and parietal involvement.</p>

	<p>Background: Anticholinergic adverse effects pose a relevant threat to patients, in particular elderly and cognitively impaired patients. Patients with Parkinsonian syndromes are especially at risk from anticholinergic adverse effects due to the often-required complex drug therapy. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of the anticholinergic burden on motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. Methods: This cross-sectional, monocentric retrospective data analysis included 151 patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), 63 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 36 with multiple system atrophy (MSA). The anticholinergic burden of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; medications was determined using two established scores: the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS) and the German Anticholinergic Burden Scale (GABS). These scores were compared between the different diseases and correlated with several disease-specific scores. Results: Anticholinergic burden was higher in patients with PD, in particular, compared to PSP. In the PD group, anticholinergic burden showed a weak correlation with almost all analyzed clinical scores and the number of administered drugs. The UMSARS I and II showed a significant correlation with the anticholinergic burden in MSA patients. In general, the GABS-measured anticholinergic burden was significantly higher compared to the ADS-measured. Conclusions: The calculated anticholinergic burden affected motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with various Parkinsonian syndromes poorly. Since the GABS also contains basic anti-parkinsonian drugs, this score tended to overestimate the anticholinergic burden in patients with Parkinsonian syndromes and, therefore, seemed less appropriate for this application.</p>

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex condition that can resolve over time but all too often leads to persistent symptoms, and the risk of poor patient outcomes increases with aging. TBI damages neurons and long axons within white matter tracts that are critical for communication between brain regions; this causes slowed information processing and neuronal circuit dysfunction. This review focuses on white matter injury after TBI and the multifactorial processes that underlie white matter damage, potential for recovery, and progression of degeneration. A multiscale perspective across clinical and preclinical advances is presented to encourage interdisciplinary insights from whole-brain neuroimaging of white matter tracts down to cellular and molecular responses of axons, myelin, and glial cells within white matter tissue.

	<p>Suicidality in adolescents has been associated with emotional distress, stressful life events, relationship issues, and nightmares to name a few. This study explored the actual dream content and the mood at pre-sleep, during a reported dream, and in the morning in 33 adolescents admitted to the hospital on account of a suicide attempt. In all aspects, hospitalized adolescents were compared to 33 matched adolescents who had followed the same protocol. In accordance with the Continuity and the Threat Simulation theories of dream formation, it was hypothesized that the waking-life experiences of suicidal adolescents would transpire in both dream mood and content as well as in the frequency of nightmares. Dreams were analyzed by independent judges using traditional dream content scales, including for the presence of negative and destructive themes and types of interpersonal relationships. As predicted, more suicidal adolescents experienced frequent nightmares, which was significant. A higher negative mood at pre-sleep, within dreams, and at post-sleep was also observed. Furthermore, their dreams contained a higher prevalence of destructive themes and failures, as well as self-directed and death-resulting aggressions. Regression analyses indicated that morning mood was most accurately predicted by positive and negative dream mood in the normative adolescents, whereas only negative dream mood appeared to predict subsequent waking affect in suicidal participants. Our results underline the valuable potential of implementing nightmare-reducing therapies in the presence of suicidal adolescents who suffer from frequent nightmares.</p>

	<p>Mental fatigue is a variation in the psychophysiological state that subjects encounter during or after prolonged cognitive activity periods, affecting top-down attention and cognitive control. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of mental fatigue on attention in the context of the three attention networks according to the Posnerian model (alerting, orienting, and executive networks) by combining the Attentional Network Test (ANT) and event-related potentials technique. Thirty healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. A continuous arithmetic task lasting one hour induced mental fatigue, and EEG recordings were conducted before and after the task while subjects were performing the ANT. The efficiencies of three networks were comparable between groups, while RTs shortened only in the control group and the accuracy related to the alerting and conflict networks declined only after mental effort. Mental fatigue reduced N1 amplitude during alerting network engagement and p3 amplitude during orienting. It also reduced N2 and P3 amplitude during the conflict, particularly the incongruent target-locked response. These findings underscore the covert effects of mental fatigue on attention, suggesting that even in healthy young subjects, compensatory mechanisms may maintain adequate overt performances, but fatigue still has a detrimental effect on top-down attentional mechanisms.</p>

	<p>The presence of artificial light at night has emerged as an anthropogenic stressor in recent years. Various sources of light pollution have been shown to affect circadian physiology with serious consequences for metabolic pathways, possibly disrupting pineal melatonin production with multiple adverse health effects. The suppression of melatonin at night may also affect human mental health and contribute to the development or exacerbation of psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals. Due to the high burden of circadian disruption in affective disorders, it has been hypothesized that light pollution impacts mental health, mainly affecting mood regulation. Hence, the aim of this review was to critically summarize the evidence on the effects of light pollution on mood symptoms, with a particular focus on the role of circadian rhythms in mediating this relationship. We conducted a narrative review of the literature in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science datasets. After the screening process, eighteen papers were eligible for inclusion. The results clearly indicate a link between light pollution and the development of affective symptoms, with a central role of sleep disturbances in the emergence of mood alterations. Risk perception also represents a crucial topic, possibly modulating the development of affective symptoms in response to light pollution. The results of this review should encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the design of healthier environments, including lighting conditions among the key determinants of human mental health.</p>

                <p>The electrophysiological response to rewards recorded during laboratory tasks has been well documented, yet little is known about the neural response patterns in a more naturalistic setting. Here, we combined a mobile-EEG system with an augmented reality headset to record event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while participants engaged in a naturalistic operant task to find rewards. Twenty-five participants were asked to navigate toward a west or east goal location marked by floating orbs, and once participants reached the goal location, the orb would then signify a reward (5 cents) or no-reward (0 cents) outcome. Following the outcome, participants returned to a start location marked by floating purple rings, and once standing in the middle, a 3 s counter signaled the next trial, for a total of 200 trials. Consistent with previous research, reward feedback evoked the reward positivity, an ERP component believed to index the sensitivity of the anterior cingulate cortex to reward prediction error signals. The reward positivity peaked ~230 ms with a maximal at channel FCz (M = &ndash;0.695 &mu;V, &plusmn;0.23) and was significantly different than zero (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.01). Participants took ~3.38 s to reach the goal location and exhibited a general lose-shift (68.3% &plusmn;3.5) response strategy and posterror slowing. Overall, these novel findings provide support for the idea that combining mobile-EEG with augmented reality technology is a feasible solution to enhance the ecological validity of human electrophysiological studies of goal-directed behavior and a step toward a new era of human cognitive neuroscience research that blurs the line between laboratory and reality.</p>

                Background We propose the creation of a journal transparency tool (JTT), which will allow users to obtain information about a given scholarly journal’s operations and policies. We are obtaining preferences from different stakeholders to inform the development of this tool. This study aimed to identify the publishing community’s preferences for the JTT. Methods We conducted a modified three-round Delphi survey. Representatives from publishing houses and journal publishers were recruited through purposeful and snowball sampling. The first two Delphi rounds involved an online survey with items about JTT metrics and user features. During the third round, participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 within a virtual consensus meeting. We defined consensus as 80% agreement to include or exclude an item in the JTT. Results Eighty-six participants completed the round 1 survey, and 43 participants (50% of round 1) completed the round 2 survey. In both rounds, respondents voted on JTT user feature and JTT metric item preferences and answered open-ended survey questions regarding the JTT. In round 3, a total of 21 participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 during an online consensus group meeting. Fifteen out of 30 JTT metric items and none of the four JTT user feature items reached the 80% consensus threshold after all rounds of voting. Analysis of the round 3 online consensus group transcript resulted in two themes: ‘factors impacting support for JTT metrics’ and ‘suggestions for user clarity.’ Conclusions Participants suggested that the publishing community’s primary concerns for a JTT are to ensure that the tool is relevant, user-friendly, accessible, and equitable. The outcomes of this research will contribute to developing and refining the tool in accordance with publishing preferences.

                Background Anxiety has been reported to be one of the most common epidemics in recent years. The present study focused on understanding the association between early menarche and the prevalence of anxiety and anxiety symptoms among adult undergraduate students. Methods This was an observational, case-control study. The sample included 146 young female adults aged more than or equal to 18 years pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) and Bachelor of Dental Sciences (BDS). Using an online questionnaire, participants were asked to recall and enter the age at which they attained menarche. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7- Item Questionnaire (GAD-7) to measure the severity of their present anxiety symptoms. Results The results showed a significant increase in anxiety symptoms in participants who had early menarche compared to those who did not have early menarche. The mean score on the GAD-7 Questionnaire for the cases was 9.93 and the control group was 6.89. The GAD-7 scores among the cases group were significantly higher in the GAD-7 scores than in the control group. Conclusions This study concluded that early menarche is associated with higher anxiety levels in young adults.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-281/v2?src=rss">Osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties of graphene oxide nano coated dental implants: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Osseointegration stands as a pivotal concept within the realm of dental implants, signifying the intricate process through which a dental implant integrates with the adjoining bone tissue. Graphene oxide (GO) has been shown to promote osseointegration, the process by which the implant fuses with the surrounding bone. The objective of this study was to assess the osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties of GO nano coated dental implants. Methods A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) to identify relevant studies published. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that evaluated the effects of GO nano coating on osseointegrative and antimicrobial characteristics of dental implants. Studies not written in English and published before 2012 were excluded. Results The initial search yielded a total of 127 potential studies, of which six met the inclusion criteria and five were included in the review. These studies provided data on GO nano coated dental implants and their osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties. All the included studies showed moderate risk of bias. None of the studies provided information related to sample size calculation or sampling technique. Discussion The findings from the included studies demonstrated that GO nano coating had a positive impact on osseointegrative properties of dental implants. Enhanced bone-implant contact and increased bone density were observed in animals and humans receiving GO nano coated implants. Furthermore, the antimicrobial properties of GO nano coating were found to inhibit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on the implant surface, reducing the risk of implant-associated infections. Conclusion The findings indicate that GO nano coating holds promise in enhancing the success rate and longevity of dental implants. However, more studies with larger sample sizes, are needed to further strengthen the evidence and determine the long-term effects of GO nano coated dental implants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1364/v3?src=rss">Factors contributing to online child sexual abuse in Bangladesh: A qualitative inquiry [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Children globally, including in Bangladesh, are facing various forms of online sexual abuse including sextortion, exploitation, body shaming, and blackmail. They are also coerced into engaging in intimate activities, harassed through the sending of sexual content, among other forms of abuse. We aimed to explore the root cause of online child sexual abuse (OCSA) in Bangladesh. Methods This qualitative research design utilized in-depth interviews (IDIs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) between February and April 2022. The study sample comprised 21 school-going children aged 13−17 years, selected from two different geographical settings (10 from rural areas and 11 from urban areas) in Bangladesh using purposive sampling techniques. They participated in in-depth interviews (IDIs) while additional data was obtained through key informant interviews (KIIs) with 11 multidisciplinary stakeholders. Results Children from both rural and urban areas reported facing abuse in various ways, such as being asked to send naked photos, being invited to be naked in video calls, and being invited to have virtual sex, among others, over the internet. Conclusions The government should consider integrating OCSA education into secondary levels. Additionally, there should be efforts to ensure a safe online environment through content scrutiny, promotion of outdoor activities, and community campaigns. An anonymous reporting system must be implemented, and strict measures under the Children's Act must be enforced against perpetrators. Further intervention studies are needed to ensure effective child protection measures in Bangladesh.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-514/v4?src=rss">Comparative evaluation of the effect of 2% graphene oxide and 5% hydroxyapatite nanoparticles in isolation and in combination on micro tensile bond strength of 5th generation adhesive [version 4; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and stiffest imaginable material. The biocompatible property of graphene oxide can initiate and facilitate cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of periodontal ligament, osteogenic, and oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, the antibiofilm and anti-adhesion properties of graphene oxide in the prevention of dental biofilm infections, dental caries, and dental erosion as well as for implant surface modification and as an anti-quorum sensing agent. Composites are the most often utilized materials for restoration in the field of dentistry due to adhesive resins' improved mechanical and cosmetic properties. To safeguard the dentin and prevent dental cavities, dentin adhesives are utilized to affix hydrophobic resin composites to hydrophilic dentin tissue. Materials and Method Dental adhesives have a harder time adhering to dentin because it contains more water and is less mineralized than enamel. This makes the method more sensitive. Result As a result, it was chosen to assess and contrast the impact of 5% Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and 2% Graphene oxide nanoparticles, both separately and together, on the Micro tensile bond strength of 5th generation adhesive. Conclusion Graphene oxide is the most versatile form of Graphite in structural and functional configuration. Graphene oxide possesses extraordinary physical, chemical, optical, electrical and mechanical properties. Among the graphene family nanomaterials, the reduced form of Graphite adding the oxygenated functional group to the structure increases the surface area and therefore exhibits enviable excellent interaction ability with metal and ions as well as organic species. Graphene oxide in dentistry has provided outstanding results in antimicrobial action, regenerative dentistry, bone tissue engineering, drug delivery, physicochemical properties, enhancement of dental biomaterials and oral cancer treatment.

                Background Pain is a complication in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). There are several mechanisms underlying pain in people with thalassemia and low hemoglobin at the end of the transfusion cycle was the most etiology. Pain can develop into chronic pain and interfere with the quality of life. The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) can help identify pain in people with TDT. The present study aimed to compare pain before and after transfusion in adult TDT patients. Methods It was an analytical observational study using a cross-sectional design on adult TDT patients with pain who came to the Haemato-Oncology Clinic of Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung. This study was conducted from December 2020 to July 2021. All subjects were assisted in filling out the Indonesian version of the BPI-SF questionnaire hemoglobin levels were examined and before and after transfusion, then paired test analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon Test. Results This study is conducted on 60 adult TDT patients with symptoms of pain. The median value of pain intensity and pain interferes with life obtained from the Indonesian version of the BPI-SF score after transfusion decreased significantly compared to before transfusion (NRS 5 vs. 0 and 2.8 vs. 0; p=0.0001). Conclusion There is a significant difference in pain intensity and pain interfere with life in adults with TDT before and after transfusion. It is necessary to carry out pain assessments for thalassemia patients.

                Background Microbial communities are mainly composed of bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi, and are present in the gut, mouth, nose, skin, lungs, vagina, and bladder, among other places. In recent years, research has highlighted the critical role that these highly complex communities play in health and disease. Advances in sequencing technology have resulted in the development of high-dimensional data, which are challenging to effectively analyze and visualize. In this context, traditional stacked bar-plot visualizations, while widely used, fall short of conveying the fundamental phylogenic relationships between community members and are thus difficult to interpret. Methods StackbarExtended is implemented in native R, required version (≥ 4.0), and is platform independent, with its source code available on GitHub and archived on Zenodo. Results StackbarExtended allows for the plotting of relative abundance at user-defined taxonomic levels while displaying phylogenetic information using color gradients. Additionally, StackbarExtended integrates differential abundance statistics directly into the visualization process and performs clustering of low-abundance taxa. Conclusions StackbarExtended offers researchers a user-friendly tool for rapid visualization, presentation, and analysis of the microbiota composition.

                <p>by Simon Syga, Harish P. Jain, Marcus Krellner, Haralampos Hatzikirou, Andreas Deutsch</p>

Cancer is a significant global health issue, with treatment challenges arising from intratumor heterogeneity. This heterogeneity stems mainly from somatic evolution, causing genetic diversity within the tumor, and phenotypic plasticity of tumor cells leading to reversible phenotypic changes. However, the interplay of both factors has not been rigorously investigated. Here, we examine the complex relationship between somatic evolution and phenotypic plasticity, explicitly focusing on the interplay between cell migration and proliferation. This type of phenotypic plasticity is essential in glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain tumor. We propose that somatic evolution alters the regulation of phenotypic plasticity in tumor cells, specifically the reaction to changes in the microenvironment. We study this hypothesis using a novel, spatially explicit model that tracks individual cells’ phenotypic and genetic states. We assume cells change between migratory and proliferative states controlled by inherited and mutation-driven genotypes and the cells’ microenvironment. We observe that cells at the tumor edge evolve to favor migration over proliferation and vice versa in the tumor bulk. Notably, different genetic configurations can result in this pattern of phenotypic heterogeneity. We analytically predict the outcome of the evolutionary process, showing that it depends on the tumor microenvironment. Synthetic tumors display varying levels of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which we show are predictors of tumor recurrence time after treatment. Interestingly, higher phenotypic heterogeneity predicts poor treatment outcomes, unlike genetic heterogeneity. Our research offers a novel explanation for heterogeneous patterns of tumor recurrence in glioblastoma patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-913/v1?src=rss">The Nexus of Climate Change, Food Insecurity, and Conflict in Somalia: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multifaceted Challenges and Resilience Strategies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Climate change poses a significant threat to Somalia’s food security and stability. This review examines the complex interplay between climate change impacts, food insecurity, and conflict in Somalia. Recent climate data and forecasts paint a concerning picture: the rainfall probabilistic forecast for April- June 2024 indicates a high likelihood of above-normal rainfall across much of Somalia, thus increasing the flood risks. Concurrently, temperature forecasts project above-normal temperatures, potentially exacerbating drought conditions between the rainy seasons. Historical climatology data reveal Somalia’s vulnerability, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C and significant seasonal variations affecting agriculture and water resources. These climate trends, combined with ongoing political instability and weak governance, have created a storm of challenges. This perspective explores how recurrent droughts and floods disrupt agricultural production, decimate livestock, and displace vulnerable populations, particularly those affecting rural and nomadic communities. It also examines how environmental stress exacerbates poverty and conflict, thereby creating a vicious cycle of vulnerability. This analysis draws on recent data on poverty rates, food expenditure patterns, and climate-related displacement, to illustrate the multifaceted nature of the crisis. Finally, this perspective proposed recommendations for building climate resilience, enhancing food security, and promoting sustainable development in Somalia, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that combine immediate humanitarian assistance with long-term adaptation strategies.

                Marked dysregulation of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) characterises a variety of anxiety disorders, and its amelioration is a key feature of treatment success. Overall treatment response, however, is highly variable, and about a third of patients are resistant to treatment. In this review we hypothesise that a major contributor to this variation in treatment response are the multiple faces of anxiety induced by distinct forms of frontal cortex dysregulation. Comparison of findings from humans and non-human primates reveals marked similarity in the functional organisation of threat regulation across the frontal lobes. This organisation is discussed in relation to the ‘predatory imminence continuum’ model of threat and the differential engagement of executive functions at the core of both emotion generation and regulation strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87881">Revealing unexpected complex encoding but simple decoding mechanisms in motor cortex via separating behaviorally relevant neural signals</a></h4>

              
                In motor cortex, behaviorally relevant neural responses are entangled with irrelevant signals, which complicates the study of encoding and decoding mechanisms. It remains unclear whether behaviorally irrelevant signals could conceal some critical truth. One solution is to accurately separate behaviorally relevant and irrelevant signals at both single-neuron and single-trial levels, but this approach remains elusive due to the unknown ground truth of behaviorally relevant signals. Therefore, we propose a framework to define, extract, and validate behaviorally relevant signals. Analyzing separated signals in three monkeys performing different reaching tasks, we found neural responses previously considered to contain little information actually encode rich behavioral information in complex nonlinear ways. These responses are critical for neuronal redundancy and reveal movement behaviors occupy a higher-dimensional neural space than previously expected. Surprisingly, when incorporating often-ignored neural dimensions, behaviorally relevant signals can be decoded linearly with comparable performance to nonlinear decoding, suggesting linear readout may be performed in motor cortex. Our findings prompt that separating behaviorally relevant signals may help uncover more hidden cortical mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86181">Combining mutation and recombination statistics to infer clonal families in antibody repertoires</a></h4>

              
                B-cell repertoires are characterized by a diverse set of receptors of distinct specificities generated through two processes of somatic diversification: V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutations. B cell clonal families stem from the same V(D)J recombination event, but differ in their hypermutations. Clonal families identification is key to understanding B-cell repertoire function, evolution and dynamics. We present HILARy (High-precision Inference of Lineages in Antibody Repertoires), an efficient, fast and precise method to identify clonal families from single- or paired-chain repertoire sequencing datasets. HILARy combines probabilistic models that capture the receptor generation and selection statistics with adapted clustering methods to achieve consistently high inference accuracy. It automatically leverages the phylogenetic signal of shared mutations in difficult repertoire subsets. Exploiting the high sensitivity of the method, we find the statistics of evolutionary properties such as the site frequency spectrum and &#x1D451;&#x1D441;∕&#x1D451;&#x1D446; ratio do not depend on the junction length. We also identify a broad range of selection pressures spanning two orders of magnitude.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94573">The transcriptional landscape underlying larval development and metamorphosis in the Malabar grouper (Epinephelus malabaricus)</a></h4>

              
                Most teleost fishes exhibit a biphasic life history with a larval oceanic phase that is transformed into morphologically and physiologically different demersal, benthic, or pelagic juveniles. This process of transformation is characterized by a myriad of hormone-induced changes, during the often abrupt transition between larval and juvenile phases called metamorphosis. Thyroid hormones (TH) are known to be instrumental in triggering and coordinating this transformation but other hormonal systems such as corticoids, might be also involved as it is the case in amphibians. In order to investigate the potential involvement of these two hormonal pathways in marine fish post-embryonic development, we used the Malabar grouper (<i>Epinephelus malabaricus</i>) as a model system. We assembled a chromosome-scale genome sequence and conducted a transcriptomic analysis of nine larval developmental stages. We studied the expression patterns of genes involved in TH and corticoid pathways, as well as four biological processes known to be regulated by TH in other teleost species: ossification, pigmentation, visual perception, and metabolism. Surprisingly, we observed an activation of many of the same pathways involved in metamorphosis also at an early stage of the larval development, suggesting an additional implication of these pathways in the formation of early larval features. Overall, our data brings new evidence to the controversial interplay between corticoids and thyroid hormones during metamorphosis as well as, surprisingly, during the early larval development. Further experiments will be needed to investigate the precise role of both pathways during these two distinct periods and whether an early activation of both corticoid and TH pathways occurs in other teleost species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96523">Endocannabinoids and their receptors modulate endometriosis pathogenesis and immune response</a></h4>

              
                Endometriosis (EM), characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, is the leading cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility in females of reproductive age. Despite its high prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying EM pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is known to influence several cardinal features of this complex disease including pain, vascularization, and overall lesion survival, but the exact mechanisms are not known. Utilizing CNR1 knockout (k/o), CNR2 k/o, and wild-type (WT) mouse models of EM, we reveal contributions of ECS and these receptors in disease initiation, progression, and immune modulation. Particularly, we identified EM-specific T cell dysfunction in the CNR2 k/o mouse model of EM. We also demonstrate the impact of decidualization-induced changes on ECS components, and the unique disease-associated transcriptional landscape of ECS components in EM. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analysis revealed distinct features of the microenvironment between CNR1, CNR2, and WT genotypes in the presence or absence of decidualization. This study, for the first time, provides an in-depth analysis of the involvement of the ECS in EM pathogenesis and lays the foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of this debilitating condition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88675">Circulating small extracellular vesicle RNA profiling for the detection of T1a stage colorectal cancer and precancerous advanced adenoma</a></h4>

              
                It takes more than 20 years for normal colorectal mucosa to develop into metastatic carcinoma. The long time window provides a golden opportunity for early detection to terminate the malignant progression. Here, we aim to enable liquid biopsy of T1a stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous advanced adenoma (AA) by profiling circulating small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-derived RNAs. We exhibited a full RNA landscape for the circulating sEVs isolated from 60 participants. A total of 58,333 annotated RNAs were detected from plasma sEVs, among which 1,615 and 888 sEV-RNAs were found differentially expressed in plasma from T1a stage CRC and AA compared to normal controls (NC). Then we further categorized these sEV-RNAs into six modules by a weighted gene coexpression network analysis and constructed a 60-gene t-SNE model consisting of the top 10 RNAs of each module that could well distinguish T1a stage CRC/AA from NC samples. Some sEV-RNAs were also identified as indicators of specific endoscopic and morphological features of different colorectal lesions. The top-ranked biomarkers were further verified by RT-qPCR, proving that these candidate sEV-RNAs successfully identified T1a stage CRC/AA from NC in another cohort of 124 participants. Finally, we adopted different algorithms to improve the performance of RT-qPCR-based models and successfully constructed an optimized classifier with 79.3% specificity and 99.0% sensitivity. In conclusion, circulating sEVs of T1a stage CRC and AA patients have distinct RNA profiles, which successfully enable the detection of both T1a stage CRC and AA via liquid biopsy.

	<p>Although free-floating thrombus (FFT) poses a significant risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), optimal management strategies are uncertain. To determine the state-of-the-art of medical interventions for FFT, we conducted a systematic review of the efficacy of various medical interventions and factors influencing FFT resolution and recurrence. A comprehensive search of Embase, PubMed, and ScienceDirect identified 61 studies encompassing 179 patients with FFT-related stroke or TIA treated with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or their combinations. Primary outcomes assessed were stroke recurrence and thrombus resolution. Statistical analyses (Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s exact test, chi-square test, Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney test, and Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis test) utilized significance set at p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Over a median follow-up of 7 months, thrombus resolution occurred in 65% of patients, while 11.2% experienced recurrence, primarily as TIAs. Cardioembolism was significantly less common in resolved cases (p = 0.025). Combination therapy (antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and statins) significantly enhanced clot resolution (OR 11.4; 95% CI 1.436&amp;amp;ndash;91.91; p = 0.021) compared to monotherapies. Ulcerated plaque was a significant predictor of recurrence (OR 8.2; 95% CI 1.02&amp;amp;ndash;66.07; p = 0.048). These findings underscore the superiority of combination therapy in FFT management and highlight the need for targeted interventions in patients with ulcerated plaques to mitigate recurrence risk.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1% of people aged over 60. Currently, there is only symptomatic relief for PD patients, with levodopa being the gold standard of PD treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical option to treat PD patients. DBS improves motor functions and may also allow a significant reduction in dopaminergic medication. Important parameters for DBS outcomes are the disease duration, the age of disease onset, responsiveness to levodopa and cognitive or psychiatric comorbidities. Emerging data also highlight the need to carefully consider the genetic background in the preoperative assessment of PD patients who are candidates for DBS, as genetic factors may affect the effectiveness of DBS in these patients. This review article discusses the role of genetics in DBS for PD patients, in an attempt to better understand inter-individual variability in DBS response, control of motor PD symptoms and appearance of non-motor symptoms, especially cognitive decline.</p>

	<p>Cerebral vascular angiography, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), is essential for diagnosing neurological conditions but poses radiation risks. This study aims to analyze the impact of examination parameters and patient characteristics on the radiation dose received during DSA to optimize safety and minimize exposure. A retrospective analysis of 251 DSA procedures using the GE Innova IGS 630 dual-plane instrument was conducted. Data on dose area product (DAP) and air kerma (KERMA), along with patient and examination details, were collected. Statistical analyses, including Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney, Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis, and Spearman rank correlation tests, assessed the relationships between variables and radiation dose outcomes. Significant correlations were found between the sides examined (left, right, or both) and DAP (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and KERMA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) values, with bilateral studies showing the highest values. The post hoc Dunn tests showed that the &amp;amp;lsquo;L + P&amp;amp;rsquo; group significantly differs from both the right group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and the left group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). There is no significant difference between the &amp;amp;lsquo;P&amp;amp;rsquo; group and the &amp;amp;lsquo;L&amp;amp;rsquo; group (p-value = 0.53). These results suggest that the right and left (both) group have unique KERMA mGy values compared to the other two groups. A strong correlation (rS = 0.87) existed between DAP and KERMA. The number of projections significantly impacted radiation dose (rS = 0.61). Tube parameters (kV and mA) and skull size had low correlations with DAP and KERMA. Optimizing imaging protocols and individualizing parameters can significantly enhance patient safety and diagnostic efficacy while also reducing occupational exposure for medical staff.</p>

	<p>Background: Augmenting auditory feedback through an error-augmentation paradigm could facilitate the perception and correction of gait asymmetry in stroke survivors, but how such a paradigm should be tailored to individual asymmetry profiles remains unclear. Before implementing the paradigm in rehabilitation, we need to investigate the instantaneous effects of distorted footstep sound feedback on gait symmetry in healthy young adults. Methods: Participants (n = 12) walked on a self-paced treadmill while listening to their footstep sounds, which were distorted unilaterally according to five conditions presented randomly: small delay; small advance; large delay; large advance; or unmodified (control). The primary outcomes were swing time ratio (SWR) and step length ratio (SLR). Secondary outcomes included walking speed, bilateral swing time, step length, and maximum toe height, as well as hip, knee, and ankle angle excursions. Results: SWR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but not SLR (p &amp;amp;ge; 0.05) was increased in all distorted feedback conditions compared to the control condition. Increased swing time on the perturbed side ipsilateral to feedback distortion was observed in the advanced conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while swing time increased bilaterally in the delayed conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but to a larger extent on the unperturbed side contralateral to feedback distortion. Increases in swing time were accompanied by larger maximum toe height as well as larger hip and knee joint excursions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 to p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). No differences in any outcomes were observed between small and large feedback distortion magnitudes. Conclusions: Distorted footstep sound feedback successfully elicits adaptation in temporal gait symmetry (SWR), with distinct modulation patterns for advanced vs. delayed footstep sounds. Spatial symmetry (SLR) remains unaltered, likely because auditory feedback primarily conveys temporal information. This research lays the groundwork to implement personalized augmented auditory feedback in neurorehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Hyperacusis is a condition that is characterized by hypersensitivity to normal everyday sounds or reduced sound tolerance and can affect patients in distressing ways. Sound therapy is a treatment intervention that is used to desensitize patients. However, as yet, there is a lack of understanding on how it is used in clinical practice, the different types of devices, or how to use them. The aim of this scoping review was to establish the current use of sound therapy in adults with hyperacusis and identify any factors that may influence treatment. Methodology: An established methodological framework was used to formulate the research question and guide the search strategy and reporting. The inclusion criteria were studies reporting adult (&amp;amp;gt;18 years) populations with hyperacusis and sound therapy treatments which were published in any language. Searches of electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Medline (EBSCO), Scopus, PsycINFO) identified 31 studies that met the inclusion criteria (completed in April 2024). Data from included records were collated and summarized descriptively.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to analyze the cross-linguistic influence of previously learned languages and working memory capacities on the vocabulary performance of two different typological languages. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the working memory capacities of bilingual adults in relation to the vocabulary performance of two different languages never learned by the participants, and (2) to analyze to what extent the typology of previously learned languages influences working memory capacities in relation to the vocabulary performance of French and Nahuatl. A group of 43 Mexican Spanish college students participated in this experimental study. The participants completed a series of working memory tasks in Nahuatl and French. The results showed that working memory capacities were lower in Nahuatl than in French. Thus, a correlation was found between their first and second language and vocabulary performance in French. We can consider the influence of previously learned languages as a significant factor in vocabulary acquisition in accordance with the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; working memory capacities.</p>

                <p>Recent neurophysiological studies provide inconsistent results of frontoparietal network (FPN) stimulation for altering working memory (WM) capacity. This study aimed to boost WM capacity by manipulating the activity of the FPN via dual-site high&ndash;definition transcranial direct current stimulation. Forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to three stimulation groups, receiving either simultaneous anodal stimulation of the frontal and parietal areas (double stimulation), or stimulation of the frontal area only (single stimulation), or the placebo stimulation (sham) to frontal and parietal areas. After the stimulation, we used an operation span task to test memory accuracy, mathematical accuracy, time of calculation and memorizing, and recall response time across the three groups. The results revealed an enhancement of memory accuracy and a reduction of time of calculation in the double stimulation group compared with that in others. In addition, recall response time was significantly decreased in the double and single stimulation groups compared with that in sham. No differences in mathematical accuracy were observed. Our results confirm the pivotal role of the FPN in WM and suggest its functional dissociation, with the frontal component more implicated in the retrieval stage and the parietal component in the processing and retention stages.</p>
