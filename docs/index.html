              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10757">Habit learning is associated with efficiently controlled network dynamics in naive macaque monkeys</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primates utilize distributed neural circuits to learn habits in uncertain environments, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We propose a formal theory of network energetics explaining how brain states influence sequential behavior. We test our theory on multi-unit recordings from the caudate nucleus and cortical regions of macaques performing a motor habit task. The theory predicts the energy required to transition between brain states represented by trial-specific firing rates across channels, assuming activity spreads through effective connections. We hypothesized that habit formation would correlate with lower control energy. Consistent with this, we observed smaller energy requirements for transitions between similar saccade patterns and those of intermediate complexity, and sessions exploiting fewer patterns. Simulations ruled out confounds from neurons' directional tuning. Finally, virtual lesioning demonstrated robustness of observed relationships between control energy and behavior. This work paves the way for examining how behavior arises from changing activity in distributed circuitry.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11463">A universal theorem of sensory information</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal theorem of sensory information, analogous to the second law of thermodynamics, is derived. Beginning from a minimal description of a sensory neuron, a state-space representation of firing rate emerges naturally from Shannon's measure of information. A special case of this formulation predicts a previously unknown inequality governing sensory adaptation, which was confirmed across different modalities, species, and experimental conditions. Further analysis shows that the firing rate behaves like a state function in thermodynamics, leading to an entropy production equation from which a general law follows: any closed cycle of stimulation yields a non-negative net gain of sensory information.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11480">Inferring response times of perceptual decisions with Poisson variational autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.11480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10835">What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10935">CAT-Net: A Cross-Attention Tone Network for Cross-Subject EEG-EMG Fusion Tone Decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) speech decoding has emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals with speech impairments. In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications.

                arXiv:2509.04454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: My findings show what causes loss of awareness, anesthesia, memory replay, opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD), and slow-wave sleep (SWS). Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and anesthetics by activating medial habenula (MHb) and/or interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) induce unawareness and slowdown respiration. MHb projects to IPN and both increase their glucose intake during anesthesia (Herkenham, 1981). The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? I found that it promotes SWS, memory replay, sharp-wave ripples, spindles, hippocampo-cortical replay, synaptogenesis, rest and recovery, by activating median raphe (MRN) serotonin, and by inhibiting the theta state circuit, new memories encoding, awareness, arousal, alert wakefulness, and REM sleep. It causes also natural slowdown of respiration and heart rate, while it inhibits locomotion and arousal. This extended model adds role of the dentate gyrus>posterior septum>MHb>IPN>MRN>hippocampus + BF + claustrum>cortical slow-waves in memory replay, ripples, loss of awareness, SWS, and anesthesia. It proposes new neural mechanism for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN>MRN>claustrum>cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. My model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence, and wanting. This model claims that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, endocannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-protein production, spines growth, and anti-inflammatory state.

                arXiv:2511.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking is essential for developing and evaluating black-box optimization algorithms, providing a structured means to analyze their search behavior. Its effectiveness relies on carefully selected problem sets used for evaluation. To date, most established benchmark suites for black-box optimization consist of abstract or synthetic problems that only partially capture the complexities of real-world engineering applications, thereby severely limiting the insights that can be gained for application-oriented optimization scenarios and reducing their practical impact. To close this gap, we propose a new benchmarking suite that addresses it by presenting a curated set of optimization benchmarks rooted in structural mechanics. The current implemented benchmarks are derived from vehicle crashworthiness scenarios, which inherently require the use of gradient-free algorithms due to the non-smooth, highly non-linear nature of the underlying models. Within this paper, the reader will find descriptions of the physical context of each case, the corresponding optimization problem formulations, and clear guidelines on how to employ the suite.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10655">Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning II: Semantic Node Merging, Entailment Filtering, and Knowledge Graph Alignment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11116">Toward Generalized Detection of Synthetic Media: Limitations, Challenges, and the Path to Multimodal Solutions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.11116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: In contrast to biological neural circuits, conventional artificial neural networks are commonly organized as strictly hierarchical architectures that exclude direct connections among neurons within the same layer. Consequently, information flow is primarily confined to feedforward and feedback pathways across layers, which limits lateral interactions and constrains the potential for intra-layer information integration. We introduce an artificial neural network featuring intra-layer connections among hidden neurons to overcome this limitation. Owing to the proposed method for facilitating intra-layer connections, the model is theoretically anticipated to achieve faster convergence compared to conventional feedforward neural networks. The experimental findings provide further validation of the theoretical analysis.

                arXiv:2404.14228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are living in an era of "big literature", where scientific literature is expanding exponentially. While this growth presents new opportunities, it complicates mapping global scientific research landscapes, as manual review methods become infeasible. Recent advancements in machine learning, complex networks, and natural language processing have enabled numerous data-driven discovery methods. Building upon these tools, we introduce an end-to-end workflow for analyzing large-scale literature landscapes, LitLA. This workflow first integrates diverse publication metadata into a bibliographic knowledge graph (KG) representing the research landscape. It then offers tools for exploratory analysis of various landscape aspects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LitLA via a case study on follow-up works of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). In doing so, we constructed the MOEA/D research landscape as a KG comprising over 5,400 papers, 10,000 authors, 1,600 institutions, and 78,000 keywords. With this landscape, we start with descriptive statistics and investigate prominent topics pertaining to MOEA/D and interrogate their spatial-temporal and bilateral relationships. We then map the collaboration and citation networks to reveal the community's growth over time. We further experiment whether learning on latent patterns of this landscape can hint on future research directions.

                arXiv:2305.06315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For deep learning problems on graph-structured data, pooling layers are important for down sampling, reducing computational cost, and to minimize overfitting. We define a pooling layer, nervePool, for data structured as simplicial complexes, which are generalizations of graphs that include higher-dimensional simplices beyond vertices and edges; this structure allows for greater flexibility in modeling higher-order relationships. The proposed simplicial coarsening scheme is built upon partitions of vertices, which allow us to generate hierarchical representations of simplicial complexes, collapsing information in a learned fashion. NervePool builds on the learned vertex cluster assignments and extends to coarsening of higher dimensional simplices in a deterministic fashion. While in practice the pooling operations are computed via a series of matrix operations, the topological motivation is a set-theoretic construction based on unions of stars of simplices and the nerve complex.

                arXiv:2410.11330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AfterLearnER (After Learning Evolutionary Retrofitting) consists in applying evolutionary optimization to refine fully trained machine learning models by optimizing a set of carefully chosen parameters or hyperparameters of the model, with respect to some actual, exact, and hence possibly non-differentiable error signal, performed on a subset of the standard validation set. The efficiency of AfterLearnER is demonstrated by tackling non-differentiable signals such as threshold-based criteria in depth sensing, the word error rate in speech re-synthesis, the number of kills per life at Doom, computational accuracy or BLEU in code translation, image quality in 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs), and user feedback in image generation via Latent Diffusion Models (LDM). This retrofitting can be done after training, or dynamically at inference time by taking into account the user feedback. The advantages of AfterLearnER are its versatility, the possibility to use non-differentiable feedback, including human evaluations (i.e., no gradient is needed), the limited overfitting supported by a theoretical study, and its anytime behavior. Last but not least, AfterLearnER requires only a small amount of feedback, i.e., a few dozen to a few hundred scalars, compared to the tens of thousands needed in most related published works.

                arXiv:2412.18890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of symbolic solutions -- mathematical expressions, logical rules, and algorithmic structures -- is fundamental to advancing scientific and engineering progress.
  However, traditional methods often struggle with search efficiency and fail to integrate knowledge effectively.
  While recent large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches have demonstrated improvements in search efficiency, they lack the ability to continually refine and expand upon discovered solutions and their underlying knowledge, limiting their potential for open-ended innovation.
  To address these limitations, we introduce CoEvo, a novel framework that leverages large language models within an evolutionary search methodology to continually generate and refine symbolic solutions. CoEvo integrates a dynamic knowledge library, enabling open-ended innovation of solutions through effective knowledge management. Additionally, CoEvo leverages multiple representations of solutions -- including natural language, mathematical expressions, and code -- to further enhance search efficiency.
  By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the exploratory power of evolutionary algorithms, CoEvo significantly improves the efficiency and scope of symbolic discovery.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for symbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to human scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in conceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative
  process, marking a significant step towards harnessing LLMs in the perpetual pursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. With the introduction of two novel metrics, qubit utilization efficiency and quantum model training strategy, we present a thorough analysis of the current status of the QFL research. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of QC on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.

                Advances in single-cell genomics technologies enable the routine acquisition of atlases with millions of cells. These datasets often include multiple sources of variation, such as donors, sequencing platforms, developmental timepoints, and species. Although these covariates provide new opportunities for discovery, they also present challenges for downstream analyses. To mitigate unwanted sources of variation, dataset integration is the starting point for most analyses. However, existing methods struggle with integrating large and complex datasets. To address these limitations, we developed PIANO, a variational autoencoder framework that uses a negative binomial generalized linear model for stronger batch correction, and code compilation for up to ten times faster training than existing tools. We first demonstrate performant integration compared to commonly used integration methods on single-species datasets. We then show PIANO enables superior analyses of multiple atlases, solving challenging integration tasks across sequencing platforms, developmental timepoints, and species, while simultaneously preserving desired biological signals. Our contributions include a novel, high-performance integration method and recommendations for integration applications.

">Ephaptic coupling and power fluctuations in depression</a></h4>

              
                The initial therapeutic exposure to DBS during implantation surgery has reproducible acute behavioral effects that carry over without further stimulation. We analyzed LFP data from the first month following brief therapeutic intraoperative DBS. Data were recorded from the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC). During this month no further stimulation was applied. Recent studies have identified beta power fluctuations in LFP data as an acute putative depression biomarker of this exposure. However, a detailed description of neural dynamics underlying brain power fluctuations is missing. Here, we provide a proof of principle study that these dynamics can be described using two new dynamical systems measures: instability frequency and relative wandering time. These capture interactions between neural activity and the mesoscale oscillatory electric fields generated by it. The two measures seem to split low vs. high HDRS scores within a small patient cohort. They are motivated by the cytoelectric coupling hypothesis, that suggests that efficient information processing results from mesoscale electric fields; and that the re-emergence of depression symptoms might result from altered electric fields. Whether the new measures reflect general mechanisms of rapid antidepressant action remains to be tested.

">Transcranial Static Magnetic Stimulation Dissociates the Causal Roles of the Parietal Cortex in Spatial and Temporal Processing</a></h4>

              
                Accurate time estimation is essential for optimizing our perception and actions. Previous neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have suggested that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and supplementary motor area (SMA) are involved in time perception. However, it remains inconclusive whether the activity in these regions is crucial for time perception, partly due to the possible spread of TMS effects across anatomically connected brain regions. Such a remote effect is less likely to happen with transcranial static magnet stimulation (tSMS), as the static magnetic field is expected to modulate the firing threshold of neurons rather than directly triggering an action potential. In this study, we aimed to determine the causal relevance of local activities in the right IPL and the SMA for temporal processing using tSMS. We measured duration discrimination thresholds, along with orientation discrimination thresholds as a control, using staircase methods before and during the administration of tSMS over the IPL/SMA. Our results indicated no significant changes in duration discrimination thresholds in either the IPL or SMA conditions. In contrast, we observed an improvement in orientation discrimination thresholds in the IPL condition. This improvement correlated with individual differences in the distance between the scalp and the IPL. Overall, our findings demonstrate a causal involvement of the IPL in orientation processing. The correlation between the effects of tSMS and the scalp-to-target distance suggests that the efficacy of tSMS may be sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field.

">Inhibition governs stimulus preference encoding in mPFC pyramidal neurons during a social choice</a></h4>

              
                Social decision-making requires the brain to continuously evaluate competing options and select appropriate actions. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in social cognition and value-based decision-making, yet the neural mechanisms by which it encodes the relative value of competing social choices remain poorly understood. Here, we employed fiber photometry, optogenetics, and projection-specific recordings in mice performing four distinct binary social discrimination tasks to reveal how mPFC pyramidal neurons encode social choice. We found that mPFC pyramidal neurons exhibit profound inhibition during bouts toward the preferred stimulus. This inhibitory response was specific to transitional bouts, when animals switched between stimuli, and was absent during non-transitional bouts, which occurred during continued engagement with the same stimulus. Notably, this differential activity encoded relative rather than absolute stimulus value, such that the same stimulus evoked opposite neural responses depending on its contextual preference. Accordingly, manipulating the subject's preference between food and social stimuli via food deprivation inverted its inhibition-excitation pattern. Furthermore, negative calcium transients in the mPFC predicted subsequent investigation of the preferred stimulus, suggesting a functional role in guiding behavioral choice. Optogenetic activation of mPFC pyramidal neurons during stimulus investigation produced immediate aversion yet paradoxically biased the stimulated animal to persistently re-engage with the stimulus-associated option through repetitive non-transitional bouts. Finally, projection-specific recordings revealed that mPFC neurons targeting the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala were differentially recruited across tasks, reflecting functional specialization of output pathways. Together, these findings identify inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons as a key neural signature for encoding relative stimulus preference, thereby establishing a neural principle by which the mPFC dynamically guides social choice.

">Live longitudinal imaging of meningeal cerebrovascular injury and its sequelae in adult zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Nearly 1.4 million people in the United States sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year, with almost half of those hospitalized for TBI developing long-term disability. For many patients, prolonged bleeding and inflammation from damaged vessels in the meninges result in long-lasting sequelae. Although their injured blood vessels regrow, the site of injury is full of inflammatory immune cells that may influence vascular function. Adult zebrafish have a thin, translucent skull and a mammalian-like meninges that is easily imaged in living animals. We have established a novel adult zebrafish model to investigate vessel-immune cell interactions after meningeal cerebrovascular injury (mCVI). We use carefully calibrated sonication to rupture meningeal blood vessels without breaching the skull or causing damage to the underlying brain. By performing longitudinal live imaging of intubated adult fish we observe vascular regrowth and immune responses to mCVI over time in the same animal with unprecedented resolution allowing measurement of blood flow, dynamics of vessel regrowth, and interactions between individual immune and vascular cells. This newly developed zebrafish model provides a powerful tool for longitudinal live imaging of meningeal immune cell-vascular interactions after cerebrovascular injury, opening the door to new insights into chronic neuroinflammatory disease.

">Cortical response to balance perturbation is more sensitive in modern dancers than nondancers during biomechanically similar balance recovery</a></h4>

              
                Motor skill expertise can facilitate more automatic movement, engaging less cortical activity while producing appropriate motor output. Accordingly, cortical-evoked N1 responses to balance perturbation, assessed using electroencephalography (EEG), are smaller in young and older adults with better balance. These responses may thus reflect individual balance challenge versus functional, or objective, task difficulty. However, the effect of balance expertise on cortical responses to balance perturbation has not been studied. We hypothesized that balance ability gained though long-term training facilitates more automatic balance control. Using professional modern dancers as balance experts, we compared cortical-evoked responses and biomechanics of the balance-correcting response between modern dancers and nondancers. We predicted that modern dancers would have smaller cortical-evoked responses and better balance recovery at equivalent levels of balance challenge. Support-surface perturbations were normalized to individual challenge levels by delivering perturbations scaled to 60% and 140% of each individual's step threshold. In contrast to our prediction, dancers exhibited larger N1 responses compared to nondancers while demonstrating similar biomechanical responses. Our results suggest dancers have greater cortical sensitivity to balance perturbations than nondancers. Further, dancer N1 responses modulated across perturbation magnitudes according to differences in objective task difficulty. In contrast, nondancer N1 responses modulated as a function of individual challenge level. Our findings suggest dance training increases sensitivity of the initial, cortical N1 response to balance perturbation, supporting postural alignment to an objective reference. The N1 response may reflect differences in balance-error processing that are altered with specific long-term training and may have implications for rehabilitation.

">Locus Coeruleus alpha-Synuclein Overexpression Induces Prodromal Parkinsonian Features in Mice</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus is one of the first brain regions to develop alpha-synuclein pathology during the prodromal phase of Parkinson Disease, contributing significantly to non-motor symptoms such as cognitive decline, mood alterations or sleep disturbances. However, the precise role of the locus coeruleus in the early stages of the disease remains unclear. To address this, we developed and characterized a novel mouse model based on the PRSx8-driven overexpression of human alpha-synuclein in noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus using an adeno-associated viral vector. Animals were assessed at 1 and 3 months post-injection using an integrated battery of histological, behavioural, neurochemical, and electrophysiological analyses. We observed robust accumulation of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the locus coeruleus, along with widespread propagation to projection areas, including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and dorsal raphe. Despite the absence of neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus, we identified reduced noradrenergic axonal integrity and marked decreases in both noradrenaline and serotonin levels, highlighting a disruption of neurochemical balance at an early stage. The electrophysiological data revealed transient alterations in the excitability and intrinsic properties of locus coeruleus neurons in a sex-dependent manner, suggesting that alpha-synuclein pathology induces early functional disruption prior to overt neurodegeneration. Behavioural outcomes demonstrated selective cognitive deficits and mild anxiety-like behaviours, while other non-motor functions remained preserved. Importantly, although several pathological and functional alterations were evident in the initial phases, behavioural impairments were also maintained at later time points, indicating that locus coeruleus-driven pathology exerts long-lasting consequences. Interestingly, female mice exhibited colon shortening, providing evidence of a sex-specific pathological process at the level of the gut-brain axis. We believe that this model accurately replicates key prodromal features of Parkinson disease, demonstrating that alpha-synuclein-induced pathology in the locus coeruleus leads to functional circuit impairment and cognitive decline. Our findings emphasize the locus coeruleus as a critical site of early vulnerability in Parkinson Disease and underscore the importance of sex as a biological variable influencing disease progression and therapeutic response.

">Spontaneous otocoherence of the active ear</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous otoacoustic emission (SOAE) provides compelling evidence of active force generation inside the inner ear, although there is significant debate about the underlying generation mechanism(s). SOAE is commonly characterized by peaks in a spectral domain representation (as derived from a discrete Fourier transform), occurring at idiosyncratic frequencies unique to a given ear. Such is typically computed as an averaged magnitude spectrum that discards phase information. Here, we explore the hypothesis that SOAE phase, readily extracted from pre-existing recordings, contains complementary information. We propose several measures to use this information to quantify otocoherence (a form of autocoherence referring to a phenomenon of the ear), primarily by measuring the consistency in SOAE phase accumulation over a particular timescale. We present results based on recordings from different species with disparate inner ear morphologies (humans, barn owls, lizards). For regions of SOAE activity we extract time constants representing the timescale over which otocoherence is maintained. We demonstrate that these vary significantly across species and (for the barn owl and Tokay gecko where this data is available) appear to correlate with measures of auditory nerve fiber tuning. Additionally, we adapted the method to identify regions of weak SOAE activity among fluctuations in the noise floor. These methods can readily be employed to re-analyze SOAE waveforms previously collected from a variety of species, making them of broader comparative utility to reveal information about SOAE generation and thereby active cochlear mechanics.

">No Evidence for Stronger Brain-Behavior Associations in the Bimanual Motor Network of Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Bimanual motor performance declines with age, is accompanied by cortical thinning and alterations in white matter microstructure within motor control networks. Aging is also associated with increased interindividual variability in behavioural and structural markers, and some studies report stronger brain-behaviour associations in older compared to younger adults. However, evidence for this remains mixed, and it is unclear whether young adults express similar relationships under comparable task demands. We tested whether bimanual performance is related differently to structural brain properties in younger and older adults. Twenty-three younger (22-27 years) and twenty-three older adults (65-70 years) performed a visually guided bimanual pinch-force task and underwent whole-brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and cortical thickness (CTh) were extracted from a pre-defined bilateral visuo-motor network and compared between groups. In regions showing significant age-related differences, we tested whether and how FA and CTh values correlates with bimanual performance within each age group. Older adults showed lower FA in the anterior portions of the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) III and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and lower CTh across most visuomotor regions, along with lower bimanual performance compared to young adults. Structure-function analyses in these areas revealed that bimanual performance correlated positively with FA in the anterior segment of the right SLF III in younger but not older adults. Furthermore, larger hemispheric asymmetries in cortical thickness between the dominant and non-dominant SMA correlated positively with larger intermanual performance differences between the dominant and non-dominant hand in younger but not older adults. These findings suggest that intrahemispheric white-matter integrity and interhemispheric cortical balance support efficient bimanual control in early adulthood, but they provide no evidence that structure-function relationships increase with age.

">Deciphering the role of brainstem vestibular-related inhibitory networks in shaping postural reflexes in the Xenopus tadpole</a></h4>

              
                Brainstem vestibulospinal (VS) nuclei generate excitatory commands in response to multi-modality sensory integration, to activate specific spinal networks in order to generate adapted postural reflexes. Comparably organized in bilateral nuclei with both ipsi- and contralateral pathways in all species, excitatory VS projections alone fail to explain the mostly unilateral reflex responses typically observed. In the Xenopus laevis tadpole, we describe secondary vestibular neurons of inhibitory nature, and the synaptic contacts they make on VS neurons. Then, using a brainstem/spinal cord in vitro preparation we show that the spinal responses evoked by galvanic vestibular stimulation are shaped by both commissural and local inhibitory brainstem networks. We further show that a complex interaction between GABAergic and glycinergic inhibitory networks regulate VS neuron excitability and, consequently, the expression of the spinal response. Our data reveal that while excitatory VS neurons execute the neural score, inhibitory neurons in the central vestibular system coordinate and modulate the overall performance.

">Cochlear histopathology in macaques after noise-induced temporary threshold shifts</a></h4>

              
                Noise exposures causing transient hearing loss were previously considered benign. However, recent work has revealed that temporary noise-induced threshold shifts may be associated with long-lasting cochlear histopathology. One such effect is cochlear synaptopathy, i.e. changes to the afferent synapse between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. Noise-induced synaptopathy has been extensively characterized in several rodent models, and temporal bone studies suggest similar age-related changes in humans. However, it remains unclear how noise-induced temporary threshold shifts affect cochlear structures in humans and nonhuman primates, which show greater resistance to noise exposure than other animals. Additionally, the long-term sequelae of temporary threshold shifts are largely unknown. Here, we characterized the effects of a noise exposure causing temporary hearing loss on cochlear histopathology in macaque monkeys at long post-exposure survival times. Overall, cochlear histopathology was variable across subjects, similar to the variable susceptibility observed in humans. At 2 and 10 months post-exposure, macaques had no significant loss of hair cells, inner hair cell synapses, or cholinergic efferent innervation. However, enlargement of ribbons in both inner and outer hair cells was observed. Together, these findings provide insight into the cochlear effects of single-exposure temporary threshold shifts in nonhuman primates.

">Short trains of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation increase online corticospinal excitability and pupil size in humans</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has emerged as a method for interrogating the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine system in human behavior. Tuning of excitability in the corticospinal tract is central to many cognitive and motor processes, but little is known about how the LC contributes to this tuning. In particular, no existing studies have examined the effect of tVNS on corticospinal excitability 'online' during active stimulation, where the largest effects on pupil size are observed. Method: To address this question, we delivered repeated 4-second trains of tVNS and sham stimulation and elicited MEPs during stimulation trains (online) and shortly after train offset (offline). Pupil size was concurrently recorded throughout each train. Results: We discovered that tVNS significantly increases corticospinal excitability compared to sham stimulation, but only when measured online and not offline. The excitatory effects on corticospinal excitability were greater in the latter half of tVNS trains. Pupil size was also significantly increased by tVNS compared to sham; however, the effect on pupil size peaked earlier during the tVNS trains compared to corticospinal excitability. In line with these distinct temporal profiles, changes in corticospinal excitability and pupil size were not significantly correlated, likely reflecting differences in the anatomical circuits underpinning each effect. Conclusions: This work demonstrates for the first time that tVNS increases corticospinal excitability at rest, but the effect only emerges when corticospinal excitability is measured online during active tVNS. Implications for basic and clinical neuroscientific research are discussed.

">UCM-A86 is a selective positive allosteric modulator of GluN1/GluN3 NMDA receptors</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS) where they play critical roles in normal and pathological brain functions and neurodevelopment. While the glutamate/glycine-activated GluN2-containing NMDA receptors (GluN1/GluN2) have been extensively studied, the physiological roles and pharmacology of glycine-activated GluN3-containing receptors (GluN1/GluN3) remain less understood. Although GluN1/GluN3 receptors exhibit unique functional properties and play distinct roles in neuronal development and synapse maturation, studies of their precise roles in neurophysiology and circuit function are impeded by limited availability of GluN3-selective pharmacological tools. This study describes UCM-A86, a novel GluN3-selective positive allosteric modulator, with EC50 values of 21 M and 19 M at GluN1/GluN3A and GluN1/GluN3B receptors, respectively. UCM-A86 selectively potentiates recombinant GluN1/GluN3A and GluN1/GluN3B receptors by 436% and 174%, respectively, relative to activation by glycine, with no activity at recombinant GluN1/GluN2A-D receptors. Furthermore, UCM-A86 selectively potentiates responses from native GluN1/GluN3A receptors expressed in somatostatin-expressing interneurons of the somatosensory cortex with no modulation of hippocampal AMPA receptor- and GluN1/2 NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Mechanistic studies suggest that UCM-A86 modulation is facilitated by agonist binding (or channel gating) and that UCM-A86 primarily potentiates GluN1/GluN3A by increasing open probability with no effects on mean channel conductance. These findings advance the synthetic pharmacology of GluN1/GluN3 receptors and provide a novel tool for modulation of native GluN3-containing NMDA receptors.

">Numerosity Is Directly Sensed and Dynamically Transformed in the Human Brain: Evidence from MEG-MRI Fusion</a></h4>

              
                Humans can estimate the number of objects in a scene within a fraction of a second, suggesting that numerosity is encoded rapidly and directly by the visual system. Yet how this encoding unfolds over time and interacts with other visual features remains unclear. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) with time-resolved representational similarity analysis (RSA) and MEG-fMRI fusion to track how numerosity is represented in the brain over time. We also used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to visualize the evolving patterns of neural activity. Two main findings emerged. First, numerosity exhibited the hallmarks of a primary perceptual attribute: its neural signature appeared rapidly after stimulus onset, preceding the encoding of non-numeric features that could otherwise define number. Second, Visualization of the neural patterns using MDS suggested a temporal transformation in representational geometry, reflecting the engagement of two distinct coding schemes- an early, linear number line, consistent with a "summation code", dominating activity in occipital regions, and a later, curved number line, consistent with "numerosity-tuned code", emerging more strongly in associative areas along the dorsal stream. Together, these findings demonstrate that numerosity processing is encoded directly from the visual image and unfolds through a rapid hierarchical transformation, from a broad quantity signal to a finely tuned, number-specific code, linking perceptual encoding to higher-level numerical abstraction.

">Deep Learning for Cognitive Task Presence Prediction from Dynamic Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) studies the time-varying coordination between brain regions measured with fMRI and is a potential biomarker for understanding cognitive dynamics and tracking the development of neurological disorders. However, a critical methodological challenge lies in the variability of dFC estimates across different dFC assessment methods, raising concerns about the reliability and interpretation of downstream findings. While deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated the ability to capture traditionally inaccessible data patterns in many disciplines, they encounter challenges when applied to neuroimaging data. For instance, the high dimensionality, noise, and temporal complexity inherent in dFC makes it challenging for DL models to extract meaningful and interpretable insights. In this study, we investigated how DL architectures can be developed and adapted to predict task presence over time from task-based dFC data, and additionally, how the choice of dFC assessment method influences the predictive performance of DL models. We developed and compared a convolutional neural network (CNN), a node-level classification graph convolutional network (GCN), and a graph-level classification GCN based on their ability to predict time points at which subjects were performing a cognitive task or at rest. In our study, the results indicate that both DL model architecture and dFC estimation methodology significantly impact task presence prediction capacity, while the specific task paradigm had minimal influence out of the limited types that were explored. This work offers a powerful benchmark for understanding the dynamics of underlying task-driven cognitive state transitions and the analytical flexibility limitations of dFC estimation methods and DL architectures.

">Gene network inference and master regulator analysis identifies the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) as a therapeutic target for alcohol use disorder (AUD).</a></h4>

              
                Differential gene expression is often inadequate to predict the activity of transcription factors and their contribution to the phenotypes associated with specific gene expression states. Here we used a systems biology approach based on gene network inference and master regulator analysis (MRA) to identify candidate drivers of the gene network dysregulations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of human subjects with a history of alcohol dependence. The estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR{gamma}) gene ESRRG, an orphan nuclear receptor protein that acts as a transcription activator, emerged as a high-ranking Master Regulator (MR) based on the expression of its targets and was selected for functional validation due to its translational and druggability potential. The ERR{gamma} agonist, GSK4716, reduced alcohol drinking in the mouse binge drinking paradigm of drinking in the dark (DID) and in both non-dependent mice as well as in mice made dependent by chronic intermittent vapor exposure (CIE). GSK4716 also prevented alcohol-conditioned place preference without affecting saccharin intake or mouse locomotion. Similarly, in rats, GSK4716 reduced operant oral alcohol self-administration in non-dependent and dependent (by CIE) rats under fixed and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement. Overall, these results support the efficacy of transcriptome-wide gene regulatory network approaches for the identification of key druggable regulators of long-term transcriptional adaptations that sustain the molecular and behavioral pathology of alcohol dependence and identify ERR{gamma} as a regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and seeking, and a therapeutic target for AUD.

">Delta Opioid Receptors on Parvalbumin Neurons are Necessary for the Convulsant and Anxiolytic Effects of the Delta Agonist SNC80</a></h4>

              
                The delta opioid receptor (DOR) is expressed broadly throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Activation of DOR by exogenous and endogenous ligands regulates pain, motivation, emotion and memory, but the cells and neural circuits mediating these behavioral effects remain poorly characterized. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons express high levels of DOR transcript (OPRD1) and protein (Birdsong et al 2019). Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons also play a role in pain and emotional processing, suggesting that DOR signaling on PV interneurons may modulate these behaviors. To address this question we used a conditional knockout mouse line (Floxed DOR; PV-cre) to delete DOR from PV-expressing cells. First, we validated the functional loss of DOR through whole-cell electrophysiology experiments. Next, we characterized baseline behavioral phenotypes and the convulsant, pro-locomotive and anxiolytic-like behavioral responses induced by the DOR agonist SNC80 in Floxed DOR; PV-Cre mice and their littermate controls. Interestingly, we found that the convulsant and anxiolytic effects of the DOR agonist SNC80 were diminished in Floxed DOR;PV Cre animals. However, baseline behavioral phenotypes, SNC80-induced spontaneous hyperlocomotion and respiratory stimulation were conserved. These novel findings indicate that the pro-convulsant and anxiolytic effects of DOR agonists are anatomically separable from the locomotor stimulating effects and are dependent on DOR expression on PV interneurons.

">Microstructural functional coupling as a multimodal biomarker of emotional state transitions in bipolar disorder</a></h4>

              
                Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by dynamic transitions between depressive and manic states, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these state shifts remain unclear. Here, we developed an integrative framework to quantify the microstructural functional coupling (MFC) of the brain, which captures the distributional similarity between voxel wise diffusion and functional features within each cortical region. Using multimodal MRI data from 72 BD patients and 65 matched healthy controls, we observed a global increase of MFC of BD, which indicates a desimilarity of brain microstructure and function. Partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis revealed that the principal latent component linking MFC to behavioral scores explained 67.2% of the variance, with the strongest contributions from the control and somatosensory networks. Mediation analysis demonstrated that regional MFC influenced anxiety indirectly through depressive symptoms, supporting a sequential affective transition from depression to anxiety. Moreover, macroscale gradient analysis showed that the principal MFC gradient was significantly correlated with neurotransmitter receptor distributions, including A4B2, 5 HT1B, and H3. Together, these findings highlight MFC as a multimodal biomarker sensitive to emotional state transitions in BD and suggest its potential as a bridge between microstructural alterations, functional dynamics, and neurotransmitter systems.

">Population Morphology Implies a Common Developmental Blueprint for Drosophila Motion Detectors</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative analysis of neuron morphology is essential in order to develop our understanding of circuit organisation and development. The recent acquisition of whole-brain electron microscopy-based (EM) reconstructions of the Drosophila melanogaster nervous system now provide the resolution needed to examine morphology at scale. Utilising these data, together with new computational tools, we extract and analyse the dendrites of all T4 and T5 neurons within one hemisphere (n [~] 6000). T4 and T5 neurons are the first uniquely direction-selective neurons in the visual pathway, and are classified into four subtypes (a,b,c, and d). Each subtype encodes one of four cardinal motion directions (up, down, forwards, backwards). The dendrites of these neurons form in two distinct neuropils, the Medulla (T4) and the Lobula (T5), and are asymmetrically oriented in a direction inverse to the direction of motion which they encode. However, their densely overlapping and compact arbours has made rigorous morphological quantification challenging. The presence of differences beyond their characteristic orientation, both between T4 and T5, as well as within subtypes, has remained poorly understood. Our analysis reveals a high degree of structural similarity across both types and subtypes. Particularly, measures of geometry and graph topology show only minor variation, with no consistent separation between T4 and T5, or their subtypes. These results indicate that, despite forming in different neuropils, and serving distinct motion directions, T4 and T5 dendrites follow closely aligned morphological patterns. This suggests that their arborization may be governed by shared developmental constraints and mechanisms.

">The Turbulent Brain: a toolbox to compute the turbulent dynamical behaviour of whole-brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Brain disorders remain one of the greatest challenges in neuroscience. Computational precision medicine offers a promising framework to reveal the mechanistic principles governing both healthy and pathological brain dynamics. In this context, we present The Turbulent Brain (TTB) toolbox, an open-source MATLAB platform that implements and disseminates the turbulence framework for immediate and widespread application in neuroscience research. The toolbox combines model-free and model-based analyses through an intuitive graphical interface, enabling customizable workflows across different parcellations and preprocessing pipelines. Our toolbox builds on recent advances demonstrating that turbulence physics can effectively capture the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity as a high-dimensional system operating far from equilibrium. This framework allows researchers to explore how fundamental mechanisms are modulated across distinct brain states and neurological and psychiatric disorders, including disorders of consciousness and major depressive disorder. As an illustrative application case, we used TTB to analyse fMRI data from 176 individuals from the Human Connectome Project during resting state and movie watching, showing that movie watching, as compared to resting state, significantly reduces information transmission in terms of turbulence measures, with stronger reductions observed during Creative Commons movie watching compared to Hollywood movies. In summary, the TTB toolbox establishes an accessible framework providing a methodological bridge between nonlinear physics and computational neuroscience, offering new tools for investigating psychiatric conditions and altered states of consciousness.

">Repeat Opioid Use Modulates Microglia Activity and Amyloid Beta Clearance in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                In addition to driving dependency and overdose, illicit use of opioids, such as fentanyl, is linked to the risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Growing evidence also indicates that opioid use is associated with pathological features, paralleled early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which raises the possibility of the involvement of mechanistic interactions between opioid use and AD progression. Here, we investigate how chronic fentanyl use (i.e., 20 days) influences the neuroimmune state, microglial activity, and amyloid burden in wildtype and APPPS1-21 mice, a transgenic model of AD. In wild-type mice, fentanyl use promoted a pro-inflammatory state without increasing the incidence of disease-associated microglia. In APPPS1-21 mice, chronic fentanyl use led to a shift favoring an anti-inflammatory state, which was associated with increased microglia clustering and activation at A{beta} plaques, increased A{beta} internalization in plaque-associated activated microglia, decreased soluble A{beta}, and decreased plaque burden. Our findings indicate that chronic fentanyl use fundamentally changes the trajectory of neuroimmune activity and features characteristic of early AD by enabling microglia to enhance A{beta} clearance. The interactions demonstrate how substance use can reshape the neuroimmune landscape in neurodegenerative disease, emphasizing the importance of tailored treatment strategies.

">Deep cerebellar tFUS engages cortical circuits via convergent local and sensory-driven mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) enables non-invasive access to deep brain structures with high spatial precision, but its mechanisms of action remain elusive and under active investigation. The leading hypothesis posits that tFUS exerts its neuromodulatory effects through direct activation of neurons, while others attribute effects to indirect activation of auditory pathways. Here, we investigated the neuromodulatory effects of tFUS on the dentato-thalamo-cortical (DTC) pathway by targeting either the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) or auditory cortex (AUD) in anesthetized rats. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from bilateral motor cortices and the contralateral auditory cortex revealed that tFUS reliably evoked cortical potentials, whereas sham stimulation produced no responses. Both LCN and AUD stimulation activated the auditory cortex, suggesting auditory pathway involvements. However, only LCN stimulation elicited early and significant event-related potentials and gamma-band activity in the contralateral motor cortex, consistent with DTC pathway engagement. We propose that LCN-targeted stimulation engages the DTC pathway through modulation of neuronal excitability, while concurrent auditory inputs account for global cortical activation. These results are consistent with a hybrid mechanism in which tFUS modulates neuronal dynamics, converging both direct and indirect components depending on the stimulation site. Proposed framework reconciles competing views of tFUS as either a direct or indirect modulator and clarifies how ultrasound can differentially influence cortical circuits depending on the stimulation target.

">Predicting stress response trajectories: Differential contributions of limbic and prefrontal regions to cortisol and affective responses</a></h4>

              
                Why do individuals respond differently to stress? Since rodent studies indicated that stress regulation relies on limbic and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) outputs, we aimed to investigate whether data from these regions could also predict cortisol and affect trajectories following psychosocial stress in humans. In this pre-registered study, 281 healthy adults (145 female) were exposed to ScanSTRESS. Repeated assessments of salivary cortisol and negative affect were used to identify response trajectories (i.e. groups of participants) using latent class mixture modelling (LCMM). LCMMs without brain predictors were compared to LCMMs including structural (volume, thickness) and functional (activation, exposure-time effect) predictors from the amygdala, hippocampus, or mPFC regions. Results showed that cortisol LCMMs without brain predictors exhibited a single mean trajectory. Adding brain predictors resulted in three to four response trajectories, depending on region and outcome. Within identified models, cortisol hyper-response trajectories were predicted by larger amygdala and hippocampus volumes. Cortisol non-responses were predicted by greater amygdala activation and volume. Elevated baseline cortisol was predicted by higher hippocampal activation. mPFC markers did not predict cortisol trajectories, however, medial orbitofrontal cortex parameters identified affect response profiles mirroring trait-like affect. Together, our findings suggest dissociated roles of limbic and mPFC regions in stress regulation: While limbic structures predicted cortisol responses, the mPFC shaped affective experience.

">Four phases and temporal threshold of population calcium response during locomotion in cortical astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Calcium activity is a major form of astrocyte excitability essential to their function and plasticity. Astrocytic calcium events arise both spontaneously and in response to behaviour. In this study, we examined how these unitary events shape population-level calcium activity during quiescence and locomotion. Using two-photon imaging of astrocytic calcium in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice running on a freely rotating disk, we found that spontaneous fluctuations during quiescence were driven mainly by the co-occurrence of new calcium events rather than by their enlargement. During locomotion, population responses progressed through four phases: the emergence of new events, their merging into a superevent, fragmentation of this superevent, and an afterburst. New events appeared immediately at locomotion onset, indicating a rapid astrocytic response. The response also exhibited a temporal threshold of ~5 seconds: when locomotion was shorter than this, the superevent phase failed to develop, and the population response was markedly reduced. In suprathreshold responses, the superevent displayed a {Delta}F/F intensity pattern that reproduced reliably across locomotion episodes. Hotspots within this pattern had shorter latencies and were also more active during quiescence, suggesting that the response is at least partly deterministic. Consistent with this, we were able to reproduce both the response phases and the superevent pattern using a dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model driven by synthetic or real locomotion inputs. Together, these findings dissect the population calcium response into quantifiable properties of unitary calcium events and reveal the formation and reproducibility of the superevent pattern, offering a potential framework for the astrocytic component of the engram.

                Defective cortical development with aberrant neuronal distribution is linked to diverse human pathologies. We show that downregulation of protocadherin-8, a cell-adhesion protein associated with autism and schizophrenia, disrupts neuronal migration and morphology, and increases proliferation in the developing mouse cortex. These findings identify protocadherin-8 as a critical determinant of cortical organization and implicate it in the potential molecular mechanisms underlying human brain pathology.

                Background Head and neck cancer (HNCs) is a major health issue worldwide, and India has contributed to approximately 2.4 lakh new cases in 2022. Definitive chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced disease but carries a risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) that add to morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and possible delay in treatment. The increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has also contributed to management burden. This study aimed to assess the microbiological profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiation. Methods Patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and who developed LRTIs were included in the study. Sputum and tracheostomy suction tip cultures were obtained and processed using standard microbiological techniques such as Gram staining, biochemical tests, and VITEK-2 automated systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and EUCAST recommendations. Clinical and treatment-related factors were documented and compared using SPSS version 23.0, with descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression models. Results Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen (35.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%). The pathogens were strongly resistant to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins but were susceptible to carbapenems and aminoglycosides in the majority of isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups and chemotherapy regimens (p<0.001). Conclusion LRTIs in patients with HNC treated with chemoradiation were mainly caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance patterns are crucial for directing empirical antibiotic therapy, minimizing treatment delays, and enhancing clinical outcomes.

">Learning in nonstationary environments with minimal neuralcircuitry</a></h4>

              
                Animals inhabit continually changing environments where it is not always possible to infer causes of relevant changes, such as the appearance of a new threat. In such nonstationary settings, learning a predictive model is challenging because a surprising observation could be due to chance, or due to systematic but uninferrable causes. This issue magnifies for short-lived animals with small nervous systems and limited opportunity to explore. To understand how the nervous system negotiates these challenges, we derived a new learning principle, Hetlearn (Heterologous Learners), based on the physiology and multi-compartmental architecture of the Drosophila mushroom body, a key associative learning circuit. Hetlearn circumvents learning full causal models of the environment, making it less fragile to nonstationarity. In stationary settings, Hetlearn is efficient and outperforms Bayesian inference when data are limited. Hetlearn predicts observed learning behaviour in Drosophila across multiple tasks and provides new, testable predictions about circuit interactions during learning.

">Fixel-Based Analysis reveals microstructural visual pathway changes associated with retinal remodeling in retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy, traditionally considered a photoreceptor degenerative disorder. However, the relationship between retinal degeneration and structural alterations along central visual pathways remains poorly understood. We investigated possible structural links across the retinocortical pathway in 15 genetically characterized RP patients (RHO, PDE6A, PDE6B mutations) compared with 22 healthy controls, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) combined with diffusion-weighted MRI and fixel-based analysis (FBA). Retinal segmentation revealed marked outer layer thinning (outer nuclear layer: -55% foveal, -77% parafoveal) with significant inner layer thickening at the fovea (inner plexiform layer +29%, inner nuclear layer +40%). Parafoveal regions showed near-complete photoreceptor loss but inner retinal thickness approaching normal values. FBA demonstrated significant fiber density reductions in optic tracts and optic radiations, without corresponding macrostructural changes in tract cross-section, suggesting early microstructural disruption preceding atrophy. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between parafoveal inner plexiform layer thickness and fiber density in both optic tracts (r=0.856) and radiations (r=0.768), with no correlations observed at the foveal level. These findings demonstrate complex, region-specific retinal remodeling in RP, likely reflecting Muller cell gliosis rather than mechanical compensation. The fiber density reduction without tract atrophy suggests trans-synaptic degeneration along visual pathways. This multimodal framework provides insights into structural propagation in inherited retinal dystrophies and may serve as a biomarker for evaluating therapeutic interventions aimed at photoreceptor restoration.

">Trial-Level Sequence Modeling Reveals Hidden Dynamics of Dual-Task Interference</a></h4>

              
                Theories of dual-task interference assume that the same cognitive operations underlie multitasking regardless of stimulus timing, yet this core assumption has remained untested due to methodological limitations of behavioral averaging. Here, we combine hidden multivariate pattern (HMP) analysis with deep spatiotemporal sequence modeling of single-trial EEG to uncover the neural dynamics of multitasking in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. Using a deep spatiotemporal sequence model trained on Long stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) trials, we identify Encoding, Central, and Response operations and show that these same operations occur in the Short SOA condition, demonstrating shared cognitive processes across interference conditions. Additionally, trial-level decoding reveals multiple distinct sequences of cognitive operations across both tasks during interference, varying both within and across individuals. These sequences predict behavioral differences in reaction time and accuracy, revealing how interference timing within the cognitive operation sequence influences performance. In other words, we found trial-by-trial variability related to individual strategies directly affecting accuracy and reaction time (RT). Our findings challenge static bottleneck accounts and establish trial-level sequence modeling as a powerful tool to investigate the hidden dynamics of multitasking.

                The increasing prevalence of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus (WNV) highlights the critical need for predictive modeling tools that can guide public health decision-making, particularly given the absence of effective vaccines. We developed a modular computational framework that simulates and analyzes WNV transmission dynamics through compartmental models capturing the intricate ecological interactions among avian hosts, mosquito vectors, and human populations. Our system integrates epidemiological parameters with customizable intervention mechanisms, facilitating the assessment of scenario-specific mitigation approaches. Distinguishing itself from conventional static models, this framework enables users to model dynamic, time-sensitive interventions including targeted mosquito control and strategic bird population management—the two principal containment strategies currently employed against WNV. Using simulations that reflect realistic outbreak scenarios, we evaluated how varying intervention intensities and implementation timings affect epi- demic progression. Our findings reveal that early implemented, dual-target strategies addressing both vector populations and avian reservoirs can substantially reduce transmission dynamics and minimize human exposure risk. This framework serves as a comprehensive decision-support platform for policymakers and vector control agencies, delivering mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions against zoonotic pathogens within complex ecological systems. The tool’s modular design and scenario-testing capabilities make it particularly valuable for proactive outbreak preparedness and evidence-based intervention planning.

                Background Antibiotic resistance in oral pathogens such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococcus faecalis necessitates alternative antimicrobial strategies. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising approach that utilizes a photosensitizer (PS), light, and oxygen to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. This study evaluated the efficacy of two natural photosensitizers, curcumin and chlorophyll (from Medicago sativa L.), for the photodynamic inactivation of these bacteria. Methods Planktonic cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis were subjected to PDI using a 405 nm diode laser at various energy densities. The bacteria were treated with either curcumin (1.6 mg/mL) or chlorophyll (1.6 mg/mL) prior to laser irradiation. Bacterial viability was assessed using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Groups without PS and without light served as controls. Results At an energy density of 1.59 J/cm2, laser irradiation resulted in a reduction of 35.8% and 36.7% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis, respectively. The addition of chlorophyll significantly enhanced bacterial reduction to 64.4% and 69.3%. Curcumin demonstrated superior efficacy, achieving bacterial reduction of 89.8% and 89.4% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis, respectively. The differences between the PS groups and the control groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions Curcumin is a significantly more effective natural photosensitizer than chlorophyll from Medicago sativa L. for the photodynamic inactivation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis. These findings point to the prospect of curcumin-based PDI as a potent therapeutic alternative for combating resistant oral infections.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1257/v1?src=rss">Effect of Eccentric Control Exercises on Patients with Frozen Shoulder and Mild to Moderate Disability: A Single-Group Pre-Post Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Frozen shoulder (FS) is a common musculoskeletal condition characterized by inflammatory contracture of the glenohumeral joint capsule, leading to restricted active and passive range of motion, particularly in external rotation. Eccentric control exercises have demonstrated effectiveness in managing various upper limb disorders, including subacromial impingement, tennis elbow, and rotator cuff tendinopathy. However, there is limited evidence on their efficacy in individuals with frozen shoulder. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of eccentric control exercises on pain, functional disability, range of motion, psychosocial outcomes, and patient satisfaction in individuals with FS and mild to moderate disability. Methods A single-group pre-post design was used. Twenty patients with clinically diagnosed FS and mild to moderate disability participated. All underwent 20 sessions of supervised eccentric control exercises over four weeks. Outcome measures included the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), shoulder range of motion (flexion, abduction, hand-behind-back, and external rotation), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks), and follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. A 6-point Likert scale was used to measure patient satisfaction post-intervention. Data were analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA. Results All outcome measures showed statistically significant improvement post-intervention (p < 0.05), with the benefits maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Effect size indices at 4 weeks demonstrated a large treatment effect across all variables, suggesting strong clinical relevance. Conclusions Eccentric control exercises significantly improved pain, functional disability, range of motion, kinesiophobia, pain self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction in individuals with frozen shoulder and mild to moderate disability. These findings support the incorporation of eccentric training in rehabilitation programs for frozen shoulder.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-278/v2?src=rss">Understanding networking behaviors among Indian startups: A qualitative study [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Networking plays a pivotal role in achieving business success and mitigating startup failures. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the networking experience of startup entrepreneurs for the growth of their businesses. Methods A qualitative semi-structured interview was conducted mainly in Bangalore and the Delhi regions of India. Using a cluster sampling method, interviews were held with 36 startup entrepreneurs. These startup owners were mainly from Bangalore and Delhi. The age group, gender, demographic profile, and popular startup sector of these startup owners have also been analyzed in this study. The data were analyzed using Atlas. Ti software. Results The qualitative findings revealed four overall themes related to networking, namely, the “role of networking for the success of the startups”, “supportive environment for networking”, “crucial stages of networking” and “role of past working experience of entrepreneurs”. It was found that most entrepreneurs leverage prior work experience to interact effectively in business, utilizing skills such as communication, leadership, and market intelligence. Conclusion Entrepreneurs mainly prefer networking with colleagues and their ex-bosses in building and creating formal networking. During crises, network members provide expert advice, moral support, and connections to specialists, which helps them solve problems and access new opportunities. Networking is crucial mainly in the early stage of a startup, where connections and relationship structures are needed for navigating upcoming challenges.

                This study employs a meta-analytic approach to synthesize empirical evidence on the psychological and behavioral determinants of fast fashion consumption. Integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with brand-related constructs—perceived scarcity, perceived quality, and self-congruity—this research examines how these factors shape consumer attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, consumption intentions, brand loyalty, and word-of-mouth. Using studies published between 2004 and 2024, a random-effects meta-analysis reveals that brand attitude is the strongest predictor of purchase intention, while self-congruity with fashion brands significantly enhances all TPB components. Perceived quality exerts a cross-cutting influence on both cognitive and social evaluations, reinforcing the multidimensional nature of consumer judgments. The findings extend the TPB framework by embedding symbolic and perceptual brand dimensions, offering a more comprehensive explanatory model of fashion consumption. From a managerial perspective, the results suggest that marketing strategies emphasizing authentic scarcity cues and alignment with consumers’ self-identity can strengthen emotional attachment, perceived control, and loyalty. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for designing culturally sensitive and identity-driven branding strategies in the fast fashion sector.

                A diffuse and heavily calcified coronary lesion represents a complex clinical scenario, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. The optimal management, whether percutaneous coronary intervention, surgery, or medical treatment, remains debatable. A 64-year-old male was referred to our outpatient clinic with persistent typical chest pain. Coronary angiography revealed diffuse and heavily calcified lesions with 75% stenosis at the proximal to middle LAD. A physiological assessment was performed using a hybrid approach of resting full-cycle ratio (RFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR). Initial RFR was inconclusive (0.91). Follow-up FFR measurement supported the indication for stenting. Lesion characterization using intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a thick, long, and heavily calcified lesion with an OCT Calcium score of 4. The minimal lumen area (MLA) was only 1.78 cm2 and indicative of stent deployment since the MLA was less than 3 mm2. Three runs of rotational atherectomy were performed, followed by non-compliant balloon dilatation and two DES implantations. The procedure was successful with TIMI flow grade 3 and optimal OCT evaluation. The combination of hybrid physiological assessment and intravascular imaging is an effective and efficient strategy for managing complex diffuse-calcified coronary lesions.

                Background Adrenal pseudocysts are rare and usually asymptomatic lesions of the adrenal gland, often discovered incidentally during imaging or post-mortem examination. When large, they may cause compressive symptoms. We report a case of a giant adrenal pseudocyst presenting with flank pain and dysuria. Case presentation A 70-year-old man presented with left flank pain, upper abdominal pressure, and dysuria for three months. Imaging revealed a large left retroperitoneal cystic mass displacing adjacent organs. The patient underwent surgical excision with left adrenalectomy. Histopathology confirmed a giant adrenal pseudocyst. Discussion Adrenal pseudocysts are uncommon and often misdiagnosed preoperatively. Symptoms are typically related to mass effect when lesions are large. CT imaging helps localize the lesion, but definitive diagnosis relies on histopathology. Surgical excision is recommended for symptomatic or large lesions. Conclusion Giant adrenal pseudocysts are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic masses. Surgery is indicated in symptomatic or uncertain cases to relieve symptoms and confirm the diagnosis.

                Background Women’s financial empowerment remains a critical component of inclusive development in sub-Saharan Africa, yet its realization is often constrained by socio-cultural factors. In Uganda, Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) play a pivotal role in improving women’s access to credit, savings, and financial literacy. However, the influence of cultural norms on the effectiveness of SACCO strategies has not been adequately explored. This study therefore examined the mediating role of cultural factors in the relationship between SACCO strategies financial training, savings, credit access, and government policy and women’s financial empowerment in Masaka District, Uganda. Methods The study adopted a mixed-methods descriptive cross-sectional design under the pragmatic paradigm. Data were collected from 340 women SACCO members and 10 managers using structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and hierarchical multiple regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed. Instrument reliability (Cronbach’s α ≥ 0.70) and validity were confirmed, and ethical approval was obtained from the Kampala International University Research Ethics Committee. Findings Results indicated that SACCO strategies significantly enhance women’s financial empowerment (R2 = 0.304, F(4,335) = 36.526, p < 0.001). Financial training exerted the strongest positive influence, while access to credit showed mixed outcomes due to high interest rates and repayment pressures. Cultural factors partially mediated these effects, strengthening the impact of financial training but constraining credit and savings outcomes through patriarchal norms and spousal control. Conclusions SACCO strategies are instrumental in promoting women’s empowerment when implemented within supportive cultural environments. Policymakers and SACCO managers should adopt gender-sensitive training, flexible credit terms, and culturally responsive community engagement to ensure equitable and sustainable empowerment outcomes.

                Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving differential equations, yet their efficiency is often hindered by the need for intricate and computationally costly loss-balancing techniques to address residual term imbalance. This paper introduces a direct differential equation term scaling framework that removes the loss-balancing bottleneck entirely. By scaling each term in the governing equations using characteristic physical dimensions, the proposed method ensures numerical consistency across all contributions, eliminating the need for adaptive weighting during training. This not only simplifies the PINN formulation but also improves stability and convergence. The approach is validated on challenging nonlinear one-dimensional elasticity problems, demonstrating that high-accuracy solutions can be obtained with compact neural network architectures and reducing floating-point operations by at least two orders of magnitude. A reverse scaling step restores the solution to the original physical domain, preserving physical interpretability. The results demonstrate that direct term scaling transforms PINN training into an efficient, and easily deployable process, paving the way for broader adoption in computational mechanics and other physics-driven domains.

<p>The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in zebrafish plays a pivotal role in directional decision-making, social conflict, and fear responses. The anterograde and retrograde connections of the dorsal and intermediate IPN are revealed through the use of monosynaptic and trans-synaptic viral tracers.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is an evolutionarily conserved brain nucleus that receives direct input from the habenula (Hb). In zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>), it is involved in decision-making dependent on the idiothetic perception of the status of the body, such as head direction and posture. It is also known that the potentiation of the Hb–IPN–griseum centrale (GC) circuit makes fish resilient to stress in coping with fear and social conflict. To address why the same neural circuit controls these two distinctive physiological aspects, we performed anterograde and retrograde trans-synaptic viral tracing, retrograde mono-synaptic viral tracing, and lipophilic dye tracing to map the connectivity from the dorsal and intermediate IPN. We revealed reciprocal connections of d/iIPN and GC neurons with multiple brain regions for sensory inputs, including interoceptive systems that receive proprioception and the perception of balance and water flow, autonomic nervous systems for visceral control, and exteroceptive systems that receive vision and olfaction through the Hb. The positively labeled signals also cover the emotional regulatory system (i.e., serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine neurons) and the motor control system that administers the presentation of behaviors. Our anatomical results imply that multimodal sensorimotor information may converge in the Hb–IPN–GC circuit, hinting at its possible involvement in integrating inner states for responses to upcoming external challenges and in regulating allostasis through anticipatory biological reactions.</p>

                Background The regulation of receptor expression is crucial for fine-tuned signal transduction. Notch signaling is a key signaling pathway involved in retinal development. Compared to the knowledge on this signaling pathway in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells, less is known about its involvement in earlier stages of retinal progenitor cell differentiation and its regulation, although NOTCH1, and probably NOTCH3, are involved in earlier stage differentiation. We aimed to clarify the timing of Notch receptor expression in undifferentiated retinal progenitor cells and elucidate the possible involvement of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of Notch receptor expressions. Methods We re-analyzed publicly available human fetal retina single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (GSE183684) using Seurat/Signac pipelines. Results On days 59, 74 and 78, we observed NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 mRNA expressions in early retinal progenitor cells, which diminished at later stages of differentiation. Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin remodeling in part of the NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 loci were accompanied by transitions in their mRNA expressions. Importantly, the NOTCH1 locus, which showed chromatin remodeling, contained multiple binding motifs for transcription factors important in early retinal progenitor cell differentiation. Since genome-wide investigation of transcription factor binding motifs showed enrichment of such motifs for the early retinal progenitor cell-associated transcription factors (LHX2, RAX and VSX2), the motifs in the NOTCH1 locus might be of biological significance rather than observed by chance. Indeed, footprinting analysis suggested actual binding of those transcription factors (LHX2, RAX and VSX2) and their motifs in the whole genome, strengthening potential involvement of these transcription factor activities in early retinal progenitor cell differentiation. Conclusions These results suggest that chromatin remodeling may be involved in the differential expression of NOTCH1, although another type of Notch mRNA expression regulations may also exist.

                <p>by W. Zane Billings, Yang Ge, Amanda L. Skarlupka, Savannah L. Miller, Hayley Hemme, Murphy John, Natalie E. Dean, Sarah Cobey, Benjamin J. Cowling, Ye Shen, Ted M. Ross, Andreas Handel</p>
Introduction <p>Influenza continuously evolves to escape population immunity, which makes formulating a vaccine challenging. Antigenic differences between vaccine strains and circulating strains can affect vaccine effectiveness (VE). Quantifying the antigenic difference between vaccine strains and circulating strains can aid interpretation of VE, and several antigenic distance metrics have been discussed in the literature. Here, we compare how the predicted breadth of vaccine-induced antibody response varies when different metrics are used to calculate antigenic distance.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed data from a seasonal influenza vaccine cohort that collected serum samples from 2013/14 – 2017/18 at three study sites. The data include pre- and post-vaccination HAI titers to the vaccine strains and a panel of heterologous strains. We used that data to calculate four different antigenic distance measures between assay strains and vaccine strains: difference in year of isolation (temporal), <i>p</i>-Epitope (sequence), Grantham’s distance (biophysical), and antigenic cartography distance (serological). We analyzed agreement between the four metrics using Spearman’s correlation and intraclass correlation. We then fit Bayesian generalized additive mixed-effects models to predict the effect of antigenic distance on post-vaccination titer after controlling for confounders and analyzed the pairwise difference in predictions between metrics.</p> Results <p>The four antigenic distance metrics had low or moderate correlation for influenza subtypes A(H1N1), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. A(H3N2) distances were highly correlated. We found that after accounting for pre-vaccination titer, study site, and repeated measurements across individuals, the predicted post-vaccination titers conditional on antigenic distance and subtype were nearly identical across antigenic distance metrics, with A(H1N1) showing the only notable deviation between metrics.</p> Discussion <p>Despite moderate correlation among metrics, we found that different antigenic distance metrics generated similar predictions about breadth of vaccine response. Costly titer assays for antigenic cartography may not be needed when simpler sequence-based metrics suffice for quantifying vaccine breadth.</p>

Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters for several aquatic and terrestrial species. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and genetic biocontrol strategies. Close-kin methods have advantages over traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with movement behavior. Here, we extend CKMR methods to accommodate spatial structure alongside life history for mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for parent-offspring and full-sibling pairs in a spatial context, where an individual in each pair may be a larva or adult. Using the dengue vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> as a case study, we use an individual-based model of mosquito life history to test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating parameters such as mean dispersal distance, daily staying probability, and the strength of a barrier to movement. Considering a simulated population of 9,025 adult mosquitoes arranged on a 19-by-19 grid, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased and precise estimates of mean dispersal distance given a total of 2,500 adult females sampled over a three-month period using 25 traps evenly spread throughout the landscape. The CKMR approach is also able to estimate parameters of more complex dispersal kernels, such as the daily staying probability of a zero-inflated exponential kernel, or the strength of a barrier to movement, provided the magnitude of these parameters is greater than 0.5. These results suggest that CKMR provides an insightful characterization of mosquito dispersal that is complementary to conventional MRR methods.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in cancer progression, invasion, and response to treatment, particularly in regulating anticancer drug resistance and sensitivity. Identifying potential human miRNA-drug associations (MDAs) that manifest as resistance or sensitivity relationships offers valuable insights for cancer treatment and drug development. With the growing availability of biological data, computational methods have emerged as powerful tools to complement experimental approaches. However, limited attention has been paid to computational prediction of MDAs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically rely on known MDA information, overlooking the valuable insights available from multi-source data related to miRNAs and drugs. In this study, we present a multi-view fusion-based graph convolutional network with attention mechanism (MGCNA) to predict miRNA-associated drug resistance/sensitivity. Specifically, MGCNA integrates macro- and micro- level information of miRNAs and drugs to construct multi-view node features from different perspectives. The proposed multi-view graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder obtains miRNA and disease features from different views and learns adaptive importance weights of the embedding using an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on manually curated benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGCNA outperforms existing baseline methods. Case studies of two common drugs further establish MGCNA’s effectiveness in discovering novel MDAs.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Intense electrical activity modifies the cellular properties of neurons to enable the nervous system to store information. The dentate gyrus (DG) plays a role in learning and memory and its principal cell type, the granule cell (GC), can fire vigorously during behavior. To explore how experience modifies GC electrophysiology, we harnessed the immediate early gene, Fos, to target a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor to neurons that are activated by experience and are hypothesized to encode information. Voltage imaging from these engram GCs in mouse hippocampal slices revealed distinct patterns of stimulation-evoked spiking that depended on prior experience. Compared to unchallenged mice, engram GCs from mice exposed to novelty burst more often, and have longer inter-spike intervals following the blockade of inhibition. Voltage imaging from randomly targeted non-engram GCs revealed distinct firing patterns that did not depend on novelty. Thus, experience modifies the firing of both engram and non-engram GCs in distinctly different ways. The altered bursting will tune the facilitation of transmission from engram GCs to their various postsynaptic targets, and thus redirect the flow of information through the hippocampus. The pattern of GC firing constitutes a substrate for the encoding of information and will alter how the DG processes sensory inputs.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Growing evidence underscores the importance of host-response/secondary-injury—likely influenced by genetics—in outcome variability post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intracranial hypertension and hemorrhage progression are critical secondary injuries in severe TBI; these are mediated by the SUR1-TRPM4 channel (a target in clinical trials). We aimed to deconstruct the complex network surrounding SUR1-TRPM4 and define the cumulative impact of key genetic variants on mechanistically connected secondary injuries/outcomes after severe TBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This exploratory study analyzed 492 prospectively enrolled patients with severe TBI. A network of regulators, mediators, and effectors upstream/downstream of SUR1-TRPM4 was bioinformatically constructed. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were evaluated for multivariable model association with intracranial pressure, intraparenchymal hemorrhage progression, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. Weighted/unweighted polygenic-risk scores (PRS) were constructed and interrogated. Spatial modeling and functional predictions were determined. Single-cell cortical transcriptomic differences were assessed in a parallel murine TBI model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ninety-seven genes (625 SNVs) were analyzed. Nineteen genes contained variants associated with all outcomes (intracranial pressure, hemorrhage progression, and GOS score; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twenty-two genes (42 SNVs) retained significance for ≥ 1 outcome, with overlap across outcomes. Functions included Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport/signaling, glutamate-clearance, neuroinflammation, and cell death. Single-cell analyses revealed cell-specific gene-expression differences. SNVs were brain-specific cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTLs)/missense/frameshift mutations suggesting high likelihood of biological impact. PRSs were associated with all outcomes with large effects, and markedly improved model explanatory power/performance (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>, receiver operating characteristic [ROC]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Polygenic variability in key nodes linked to SUR1-TRPM4 were associated with mechanistically related secondary injuries and outcome after severe TBI; findings suggest a major role of heritability. Functional implications indicate biological plausibility and identify novel targets. The data, whereas requiring validation, support a shift toward incorporating biologically relevant genetics in advancing precision medicine. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for financial stability, and sector-specific Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI-ML) models have proven superior in performance. However, a significant gap exists, as most models are designed for advanced economies, leaving their efficacy in emerging markets like India unexplored. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the applicability of these advanced models to predict bankruptcy within India’s dynamic trade services sector. Methods The research utilized a substantial sample of 5,527 Indian companies. To counter the challenge of having far fewer bankrupt firms than solvent ones, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed. The study then leveraged a comprehensive suite of eight popular AI-ML models, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. To add practical context, business rules based on key financial metrics—liquidity, profitability, and asset size—were integrated. Results The findings robustly demonstrate that AI-ML models can accurately predict bankruptcy in Indian trade services firms. A critical discovery was the variation in early warning signals between an analysis of the entire dataset (aggregate) and segmented groups of companies. This indicates that a one-size-fits-all approach obscures important, segment-specific risk factors. The segmented analysis successfully uncovered hidden risks that were not apparent at the aggregate level. Conclusions The study concludes that AI-ML models are highly effective for bankruptcy prediction in India’s trade services sector. For stakeholders like investors and creditors, the key takeaway is the superior value of a segmented analytical approach. This strategy maintains high predictive accuracy while revealing nuanced, specific risks. Ultimately, it provides a powerful, tailored tool for safeguarding financial interests in an emerging market context.

                Background In an increasingly competitive healthcare sector, delivering exceptional services is crucial for enhancing patient satisfaction and fostering long-term loyalty. However, the direct impact of leadership and governance on patient experience and retention remains underexplored. This study examines the relationships between corporate governance, service quality, patient satisfaction, and loyalty, with a particular focus on entrepreneurial leadership in healthcare organizations in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 384 executive patients across hospitals in Indonesia. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), with p-values reported to indicate statistical significance. Results The findings reveal that entrepreneurial leadership significantly enhances both corporate governance and service quality. Corporate governance positively influences patient satisfaction and loyalty. Service quality was found to moderately influence patient satisfaction, but had a stronger, direct effect on patient loyalty. Additionally, patient satisfaction emerged as a critical mediator in the development of patient loyalty. Conclusions This study provides valuable insights for healthcare managers and policymakers seeking to improve organizational performance and patient retention. Theoretically, it advances the understanding of how leadership and governance frameworks impact patient retention and service quality in the Indonesian context. Practically, the study offers actionable recommendations for hospital administrators to enhance patient satisfaction and loyalty by implementing entrepreneurial leadership, robust governance practices, and continuous service improvement.

                Introduction Hospitals are intended to serve as healing environments; however, they are frequently characterized by high levels of environmental noise pollution that can contradict their therapeutic purpose. This study aimed to investigate the complex relationships among hospital noise pollution, individual noise sensitivity, and significant patient-centered outcomes, including acoustic comfort, noise annoyance, and intention to leave the hospital. Methods This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 2024 at a public hospital in Saveh, Iran. A stratified random sampling method with proportional allocation was used to select a sample of 226 hospitalized adult patients. Objective day-evening-night noise levels (Lden) were measured over 24 hours, while subjective data on noise sensitivity, acoustic comfort, noise annoyance, and intention to leave the hospital were collected using standardized questionnaires. Bayesian Network modeling combined with delta-p sensitivity analysis was applied to examine the relationships among the variables. Results The mean Lden in the studied hospital was found to be 57.95 dB (±6.61). The Bayesian Network analysis revealed that under conditions of high Level Lden, the probability of high annoyance, low acoustic comfort and high intention to leave increased by 12.4%, 6.3% and 5%, respectively. Under conditions of high-Level Sensitivity, the probability of these variables increased by 9.1%, 6.2 and 4.7 %, respectively. While these two variables are at high level, the most substantial positive variations occurred in high annoyance, low acoustic comfort and high intention to leave, with increases of 26.1%, 13.1% and 10.6%. Conclusion Noise levels in the hospital exceed international standards, negatively affecting acoustic comfort, increasing annoyance, and influencing individuals’ intent to leave. Personal noise sensitivity further intensifies these effects.

                Apathy is a common symptom across a wide range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, characterised by a loss of goal-directed action. It is associated with faster rates of cognitive and functional decline, poor prognosis, and high caregiver burden. Effective treatments remain elusive. In this article, we propose that apathy is not merely the result of actions becoming undesirable due to insufficient reward or an inflated sense of cost. Instead, actions become unnecessary due to a loss of prior precision on action outcomes in the context of the ‘Bayesian brain’.

                Hypertension is a major cause of cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Using scRNA-seq in an angiotensin II mouse model, Schaeffer and Pacholko identify early endothelial, interneuron, and oligodendrocyte vulnerability linked to angiotensin II signaling, revealing molecular pathways that drive later neurovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment in hypertension.

                This study positions intermediate filaments (IFs) as functional drivers and molecular markers of glioblastoma invasion. van Bodegraven et al. reveal that vimentin expression correlates with pro-invasive markers in patients. They show that while IFs reduce glioblastoma cell deformability, they promote matrix degradation via MMP14 expression, which facilitates 3D invasion.

                Kannan et al. use computational modeling to show how passive administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) when some virus is present can induce a polyclonal host antibody response that targets many HIV envelope epitopes. The proposed mechanism could inform therapeutic strategies for inducing undetectable levels of HIV without antiretroviral therapy.

                Deprivation amblyopia can be reversed by the temporary inactivation of one eye after the critical period. Here, Echevarri-Leet et al. show that this is caused by increased burst firing in the neurons that relay information from the retina to the visual cortex. Even inactivation of the amblyopic eye can drive recovery.

                Gastruloids derived from ES cells mimic embryonic patterning through robust self-organization. Mayran et al. uncover that this competence depends on a cadherin switch regulated by Snai1-driven E-cadherin repression and pluripotency exit. Unexpectedly, N-cadherin inactivation enhances morphogenesis, enabling proper rostro-caudal somite patterning without exogenous extracellular matrix, linking differentiation dynamics to self-organization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101613">Membrane potential modulates ERK activity and cell proliferation in human cells</a></h4>

              
                Plasma membrane potential has been linked to cell proliferation for over 40 years in vertebrate cells. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that membrane depolarization promotes mitosis and that this process depends on the voltage-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in human cells. Notably, ERK activity showed a clear dependence on the membrane potential, independent of growth factor stimulation. This voltage dependence was observed even near the resting membrane potential, indicating that small shifts in the resting potential can influence proliferative activity. Voltage-dependent ERK activity is derived from the altered dynamics of phosphatidylserine and is not mediated by calcium influx from the extracellular space. These findings suggest that fundamental biological processes such as cell proliferation are regulated by the physicochemical properties of membrane lipids. This study highlights the broader physiological roles of membrane potentials beyond action potentials, which are well-established in neural systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105537">Relationship between cognitive abilities and mental health as represented by cognitive abilities at the neural and genetic levels of analysis</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive abilities are closely tied to mental health from early childhood. This study explores how neurobiological units of analysis of cognitive abilities—multimodal neuroimaging and polygenic scores (PGS)—represent this connection. Using data from over 11,000 children (ages 9–10) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we applied multivariate models to predict cognitive abilities from mental health, neuroimaging, PGS, and environmental factors. Neuroimaging included 45 MRI-derived features (e.g. task/resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, diffusion imaging). Environmental factors encompassed socio-demographics (e.g. parental income/education), lifestyle (e.g. sleep, extracurricular activities), and developmental adverse events (e.g. parental use of alcohol/tobacco, pregnancy complications). Cognitive abilities were predicted by mental health (r = 0.36), neuroimaging (r = 0.54), PGS (r = 0.25), and environmental factors (r = 0.49). Commonality analyses showed that neuroimaging (66%) and PGS (21%) explained most of the cognitive–mental health link. Environmental factors accounted for 63% of the cognitive–mental health link, with neuroimaging and PGS explaining 58% and 21% of this environmental contribution, respectively. These patterns remained consistent over two years. Findings highlight the importance of neurobiological units of analysis for cognitive abilities in understanding the cognitive–mental health connection and its overlap with environmental factors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99191">Elevated DNA damage without signs of aging in the short-sleeping Mexican cavefish</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulated sleep has widespread health consequences, including the accumulation of DNA damage. The Mexican tetra, <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i>, provides a powerful model to study the evolution and consequences of sleep loss. Multiple cave-adapted populations of this species have independently evolved reduced sleep compared to surface populations, yet show no obvious decline in healthspan or longevity. To examine whether evolved sleep loss is associated with DNA damage, we compared DNA damage response (DDR) and oxidative stress across populations. Cavefish exhibited elevated γH2AX in the brain and increased gut oxidative stress, consistent with chronic sleep deprivation. Following acute UV exposure, surface fish, but not cavefish, increased sleep and activated the photoreactivation repair pathway. Fibroblast cell lines derived from both populations confirmed diminished DDR and repair in cavefish, supporting an attenuated acute DNA damage response. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many genes differentially expressed with aging in surface fish remain unchanged in cavefish, suggesting altered regulation of aging-related pathways. Together, these findings indicate that cavefish experience elevated cellular hallmarks of sleep deprivation yet exhibit resilience to its long-term consequences, highlighting an evolutionary model to investigate the mechanisms underlying sleep, DNA repair, and healthy aging.

                Cysteine-bound sulfane sulfur atoms in proteins have received much attention as key factors in cellular redox homeostasis. However, the role of sulfane sulfur in zinc regulation has been underinvestigated. In this study, we identified growth inhibitory factor (GIF)/metallothionein-3 (MT-3) as a sulfane sulfur-binding protein from mouse brain. We also report here that cysteine-bound sulfane sulfur atoms serve as ligands to hold and release zinc ions in GIF/MT-3 with an unexpected C–S–S–Zn structure. Oxidation of such a zinc/persulfide cluster in Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3 results in the release of zinc ions, and intramolecular tetrasulfide bridges in apo-GIF/MT-3 efficiently undergo S–S bond cleavage by thioredoxin to regenerate Zn<sub>7</sub>GIF/MT-3. Three-dimensional molecular modeling confirmed the critical role of the persulfide group in the thermostability and Zn-binding affinity of GIF/MT-3. The present discovery raises the fascinating possibility that the function of other Zn-binding proteins is controlled by sulfane sulfur.

                Trained immunity is reshaping our understanding of host defense by demonstrating that innate immune cells once thought to lack memory can be reprogrammed to mount heightened responses to subsequent challenges. Unlike tolerance, differentiation, or priming, trained immunity relies on epigenetic and metabolic rewiring of resident myeloid cells, particularly in mucosal barriers such as the skin, gut, and lungs, where these cells provide continuous protection against toxins and pathogens. Here, we review recent advances showing how an initial stimulus endows monocytes and macrophages with long-lasting functional changes that can be either protective or maladaptive upon re-exposure. We highlight therapeutic opportunities that harness trained immunity to boost vaccine efficacy and discuss strategies to modulate this program in cancer and hyper-inflammatory disorders. Finally, we propose new directions for enhancing or dampening trained immunity to promote human health.

">Context-specific configuration of orthogonal integrator dynamics for flexible foraging decisions</a></h4>

              
                The capacity to adapt behavior across different contexts is a fundamental feature of intelligence and is crucial for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which neural circuits are contextually reconfigured to alter their function are poorly understood. As a universal, ecological behavior, foraging provides a natural window into the neural basis of decision making and cognitive flexibility. We developed complementary free-moving and virtual tasks in which mice make foraging decisions and switch between context-specific decision strategies by toggling distinct configurations of integrator dynamics for evidence accumulation. Neural recordings reveal brain-wide activity states recruited by foraging environments which organize divergent dynamics subspaces and orthogonal coding of context-specific decision variables in separate neural subpopulations. In the dorsal frontal cortex, this coding structure is preserved across experimental settings, supports rapid dynamics reconfiguration for volitional mode switching, and is functionally necessary for decision flexibility.

                <p>The progressive ratio (PR) schedule is a popular test of motivation. Despite its popularity, the PR task hinges on a low-dimensional behavioral readout&mdash;breakpoint or the maximum work requirement subjects are willing to complete before abandoning the task. Here, we show that with a simple modification, the PR task can be transformed into an optimization problem reminiscent of the patch-leaving foraging scenario, which has been analyzed extensively by behavioral ecologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. In the PR with reset (PRR) task, male and female rats performed the PR task on one lever but could press a second lever to reset the current ratio requirement back to its lowest value at the cost of enduring a reset delay, during which both levers were retracted. Rats used the reset lever adaptively on the PRR task, and their ratio reset decisions were sensitive to the cost of the reset delay. We derived an approach for computing the optimal bout length&mdash;the number of rewards to earn before pressing the reset lever that produces the greatest long-term rate of reward&mdash;and found that rats flexibly changed their behavior to approximate the optimal strategy. However, rats showed a systematic bias for bout lengths that exceeded the optimal length, an effect reminiscent of "overharvesting" in patch-leaving tasks. The PRR task thus represents a novel means of testing how rats adapt to the cost&ndash;benefit structure of the environment in a way that connects deeply to the broader literature on associative learning and optimal foraging theory.</p>

This question was investigated using an oculomotor task where the delay between a warning and an imperative visual stimuli was predictable. The spatial uncertainty of the "go" signal was also varied. On average, 10% of experimental trials were associated with a response before the "go" signal ("early saccade"). After the offset of the warning stimulus, the latency distribution of early saccades was bimodal, with a first mode peaking after 200&nbsp;ms (1st mode saccades) and a second one starting to build-up after 375&nbsp;ms (2nd mode saccades). With increasing delay duration: the number of 1st mode responses decreased whereas the number of 2nd mode responses remained approximately constant; the latency and variance of 2nd mode saccades increased; the maximum velocity of 2nd mode responses decreased. In general, the amplitude of 2nd mode responses was larger. These results show that there are probably two independent processes taking place before an expected event: an unintentional release of inhibition evoking an impulsive 1st mode saccade and an anticipatory process leading to a 2nd mode saccade.</p>

                Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves summarising trends within a dataset to help uncover data quality issues and generate hypotheses. However, identifying relationships between multiple features often requires extensive coding, manual inspection and statistical modelling. Here, we introduce the ggEDA R package, which streamlines multidimensional data exploration by providing two turnkey and complementary visualisation strategies. ggEDA generates interactive parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) well suited for examining large datasets with mostly quantitative features, and introduces tiled one-dimensional plots that more effectively show missingness and reveal categorical relationships in smaller datasets. ggEDA reduces the amount of code and time required to detect multi-feature relationships that may otherwise require statistical modelling or thorough manual review to identify. To make ggEDA visualisations accessible to a wider audience we also developed interactiveEDA, a web app that enables non-programmers to explore and interpret data patterns interactively. ggEDA and interactiveEDA are available at https://github.com/CCICB/ggEDA and https://github.com/CCICB/interactiveEDA respectively.

                Background Antimicrobial drug resistance is of great concern today. Infections by the antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli, including enteropathogenic as well as enterotoxigenic strains have been reported as a major cause of deaths, especially among young children in low- and middle-income countries. This has been augmented by antimicrobial misuse, over the counter availability and poor sanitation especially in low income areas. This study aimed at characterizing antimicrobial resistant strains of Escherichia coli isolated from sanitation environments of the Majengo slum in Meru County, Kenya Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 61 samples from soil, water and drains swabs. These were tested against five antimicrobial drugs by the Kirby disk diffusion method. Results A total of 42 (69%) of the samples had Escherichia coli.These recorded antimicrobial drug susceptibility as follows: Out of the five antimicrobial agents used, ceftazidime 28 (66.67%) showed the highest sensitivity followed by ciprofloxacin 26 (61.90%) and imepenem 25 (59.52%) respectively. cefotaxime and cefoxitin showed least sensitivity at 14 (33.33%) and 13 (30.95%) respectively. In intermediate imepenem and ciprofloxacin were the highest with 12 (28.57%) followed by cefotaxime 10 (23.81%). The least intermediate was observed in ceftazidime and cefoxitin both at 7 (16.67%). The highest resistance was observed in cefoxitin 22 (52.38%), followed by cefotaxime at 18 (42.86%). Ciprofloxacin, imepenem and ceftazidime had the lowest resistance 4 (9.52%), 5 (11.91%) and 7 (16.67%) respectively. The p-value <0.05 was considered significant to the study. Conclusions This study showed that Escherichia coli isolated from Majengo is pathogenic and resistant to antibiotics. Detection of Escherichia coli poses a great risk in the spread of resistant strains in human. Proper sanitation and hygiene awareness practices should be provided through education to the residents of this area.

                Background Access to justice, enshrined as a fundamental human right in international conventions, includes the right to a fair trial and to just compensation. This dimension of justice is particularly crucial in contexts of armed conflict, where victims of military aggression require effective reparation mechanisms. Historically, both judicial and quasi-judicial bodies have been created to address mass claims, from restitution in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Kuwait to processes in post-authoritarian or post-communist states. Such mechanisms highlight the need for specialised institutions, as ordinary courts are often unable to manage the volume and complexity of conflict-related claims. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, reparations have become central to legal and political debate. Methods This study employed an empirical approach, combining systematic data collection with comparative legal analysis. Sources included UN and Council of Europe acts, reports by international organisations (CoE, OSCE), NGO publications, and scholarly works. Three compensation models were examined in depth: the UN Compensation Commission, Kosovo property claims mechanisms, and Bosnia’s Commission for Real Property Claims. These were selected for their effectiveness, European relevance, and addressed harms. Comparative analysis evaluated their procedures, accessibility, and recognition of harm, contrasted with Ukraine’s emerging compensation mechanism. Results The study highlights lessons from the UNCC, Kosovo, and Bosnia, focusing on mandates, procedures, accessibility, and types of harm recognised. It identifies best practices and challenges, offering comparative insights for designing Ukraine’s future compensation system. Conclusions International commissions share key features: defined jurisdiction, politically sensitive and lengthy processes, and reliance on transparent procedures to ensure legitimacy. For Ukraine, enabling direct individual claims is essential to uphold the right to reparation. Yet enforcement challenges and risks of duplicative proceedings remain. Adapting global experience to Ukraine’s context is crucial for developing an effective and trusted compensation mechanism.

                Background HER2-positive breast carcinomas are a heterogeneous group with various clinicopathological characteristics depending on hormone receptor (HR) status. This study aimed to analyze and compare the clinical and histopathological features of HER2-positive breast carcinomas across three subgroups: Group 1: Triple-positive (ER+/PR+/HER2+), Group 2:ER-positive only (ER+/PR-/HER2+), and Group 3: HER2-enriched (ER-/PR-/HER2+). Methods This was a single-institution, retrospective, cross-sectional study conducted over 42 months (January 2021–June 2024) at a tertiary care center comprising of 117 HER2-positive breast carcinoma cases. The demographic, clinical, and histopathological parameters were studied retrospectively. Statistical analysis was performed via SPSS Version 29.0, employing ANOVA and chi-square tests, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results Among 117 HER2-positive breast cancer patients, left and right breast involvement was nearly equal. Most were diagnosed via core biopsy (83.8%), with the upper outer quadrant most commonly affected (42.9%). Invasive breast carcinoma of no special type was the predominant subtype. The HER2-enriched group (Group 3) had the highest mean age (57.28 years; p = 0.001) and the most Grade 3 tumors (36.1%; p = 0.005). Although Group 2 (ER-positive) had the largest mean tumor size (4.31 cm), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.143). Lymphovascular invasion, necrosis, Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and skin involvement showed no significant differences across groups. ANOVA showed significant variation in age and grade, and post-hoc analysis confirmed that Group 1 vs Group 3 differed significantly in both age (p = 0.001) and grade (p = 0.004). Conclusion HER2-positive breast carcinomas show variability by HR status. The HER2-enriched subtype is associated with older age, higher histological grade, and advanced nodal stage, suggesting a more aggressive phenotype. Recognizing these patterns aids in accurate prognostication and guiding individualized therapy.

                <p>by Sankarasubramanian Jagadesan, Chittibabu Guda</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized biological research by enabling a through exploration of cellular heterogeneity. However, the complexity of data processing pipelines and the need for programming expertise create barriers for many biologists to explore scRNA-seq data. To address this, we developed Single-cell RNA Data Analysis and Visualization (ScRDAVis), an interactive, browser-based R Shiny application tailored for biologists with no programming expertise. ScRDAVis integrates widely used analysis packages, such as <i>Seurat</i>, <i>CellChat</i>, <i>Monocle3</i>, <i>clusterProfiler</i> and <i>hdWGCNA</i> to provide a user-friendly interface for single-cell data analysis. The application supports single-sample, multiple-sample and group-based analyses, along with features such as marker discovery, cell type annotation, subclustering analysis, and advanced functional studies. Key functionalities include cell-cell communication analysis, trajectory and pseudotime inference, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and transcription factor (TF) regulatory network analysis. ScRDAVis stands out as the first GUI-based platform offering hdWGCNA for co-expression network and TF regulatory network analysis using scRNA-seq data. ScRDAVis provides publication-ready visualizations with data download options in different formats empowering researchers to extract meaningful biological insights and democratizing the analytical capabilities required to comprehensively analyze scRNA-seq studies. ScRDAVis can be freely downloaded from GitHub at https://github.com/GudaLab/ScRDAVis or accessed from any browser at https://www.gudalab-rtools.net/ScRDAVis.

                <p>by Tianjiao Zhang, Haibin Zhu</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deciphers cell type-specific co-expression networks to resolve biological functions but remains constrained by data sparsity and compositional biases. Conventional metacells construction strategies mitigate sparsity by aggregating transcriptionally similar cells but often neglect systematic biases introduced by compositional data. This problem leads to spurious co-expression correlations and obscuring biologically meaningful interactions. Through mathematical modeling and simulations, we demonstrate that uncontrolled library size variance in traditional metacells inflates false-positive correlations and distorts co-expression networks. Here, we present LSMetacell (Library Size-stabilized Metacells), a computational framework that explicitly stabilizes library sizes across metacells to reduce compositional noise while preserving cellular heterogeneity. LSMetacell addresses this by stabilizing library sizes during metacells aggregation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of downstream analyses such as Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Applied to a postmortem Alzheimer’s disease brain scRNA-seq dataset, LSMetacell revealed robust, cell type-specific co-expression modules enriched for disease-relevant pathways, outperforming the conventional metacells approach. Our work establishes a principled strategy for resolving compositional biases in scRNA-seq data, advancing the reliability of co-expression network inference in studying complex biological systems. This framework provides a generalizable solution for improving transcriptional analyses in single-cell studies.

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have enabled multi-modal systems to model and translate diverse information spaces. Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal Deep Learning model for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, text, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of protein modality encoders in a lightweight fine-tuning scheme that focuses on pairwise alignment with sequence data, rather than requiring full matches. This novel approach comprises a mix of Graph Neural Networks and transformer architectures. It demonstrates good performance in retrieval tasks and showcases the efficacy of multi-modal systems in Protein Machine Learning through a broad spectrum of downstream baselines, including enzyme function prediction and binding site analysis. Furthermore, OneProt enables the transfer of representational information from specialized encoders to the sequence encoder, enhancing capabilities for distinguishing evolutionarily related and unrelated sequences and exhibiting representational properties where evolutionarily related proteins align in similar directions within the latent space. In addition, we extensively investigate modality ablations to identify the encoders that contribute the most to predictive performance, highlighting the significance of the binding site encoder, which has not been used in similar models previously. This work expands the horizons of multi-modal protein models, paving the way for transformative applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.

                <p>by Pantelis Vafidis, Antonio Rangel</p>

Animals learn to predict external contingencies from experience through a process of conditioning. A natural mechanism for conditioning is stimulus substitution, whereby the neuronal response to the CS becomes increasingly identical to that of the US. We propose a recurrent neural network model of stimulus substitution which leverages two forms of inductive bias pervasive in the cortex: representational inductive bias in the form of mixed stimulus representations, and architectural inductive bias in the form of two-compartment pyramidal neurons that have been shown to serve as a fundamental unit of cortical associative learning. The properties of these neurons allow for a biologically plausible learning rule that implements stimulus substitution, utilizing only information available locally at the synapses. We show that the model generates a wide array of conditioning phenomena, and can learn large numbers of associations with an amount of training commensurate with animal experiments, without relying on parameter fine-tuning for each individual experimental task. In contrast, we show that commonly used Hebbian rules fail to learn generic stimulus-stimulus associations with mixed selectivity, and require task-specific parameter fine-tuning. Our framework highlights the importance of multi-compartment neuronal processing in the cortex, and showcases how it might confer cortical animals the evolutionary edge.

Benchmarking, which involves collecting reference datasets and demonstrating method performance, is a requirement for the development of new computational tools, but also becomes a domain of its own to achieve neutral comparisons of methods. Although a lot has been written about how to design and conduct benchmark studies, this Perspective sheds light on a wish list for a computational platform to orchestrate benchmark studies. We discuss various ideas for organizing reproducible software environments, formally defining benchmarks, orchestrating standardized workflows, and how they interface with computing infrastructure.

                <p>by Thomas F. Varley, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Alice Patania, Josh Bongard</p>

The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems, as they provide a formal scaffold around which to build a quantitative understanding of emergence and emergent properties. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel - with limited interdisciplinary cross-talk between them. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the goal of assessing the similarities, and differences, between how the frameworks define “higher-order structures.” We begin with toy examples with known topologies (spheres, toroids, planes, and knots), before turning to more complex, naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in an embedded point cloud: shapes such as spheres and hollow toroids are synergy-dominated, regardless of how the data is rotated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013642">Incorporating human mobility to enhance epidemic response and estimate real-time reproduction numbers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mousumi Roy, Hannah E. Clapham, Swapnil Mishra</p>

Human mobility plays a critical role in the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, influencing both their spread and the effectiveness of control measures. In the process of quantifying the real-time situation of an epidemic, the instantaneous reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> appears to be one of the useful metrics widely used by public health researchers, officials, and policy makers. Since individuals can contract infections both within their region of origin and in other regions they visit, ignoring human mobility in the estimation process overlooks its impact on transmission dynamics and can lead to biased estimates of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, potentially misrepresenting the true epidemic situation. Our study explicitly integrates human mobility into a renewal-equation based disease transmission model to capture the mobility-driven effect on transmission. By incorporating pathogen-specific generation-time distribution, observational delay, the framework is epidemiologically informed and flexible to a wide range of diseases. We primarily validate the approach using simulated data, and demonstrate the limitations of estimating <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> without considering mobility. We then apply it to two real-world mobility settings using SARS-CoV-2 mortality data: the regions of England and the LTLAs of North East region of England, and uncover the mobility driven effect on transmission at different spatial resolutions. This framework uses non-identifiable and widely accessible publicly available datasets, demonstrating its practical applicability and supporting better-informed and more targeted public health measures.

                <p>by Young-Hwan Jo</p>

The liver communicates with the brain by transmitting interoceptive signals, including nutrients, hormones, and cytokines, potentially via the liver-innervating vagal sensory neurons. This communication is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and emotional stability.

Interoceptive signals from visceral organs, such as heart, lungs and gut, are known to influence many aspects of organismal physiology and behavior. This Perspective argues that liver signaling via the vagal nerve is another avenue of body-brain communication that shapes metabolism and mood.

Interoception may be a key mechanism in “Whole Person Health.” More and better technologies, tools, and mechanistic research are needed to fully understand its role, as well as new interventions to promote healthy physiological self-regulation through interoceptive signals.

Decoding the body’s internal signals could revolutionize Whole Person Health. This Perspective suggests a research framework linking brain, body and behavior to foster resilience, self-regulation and holistic well-being.

                <p>by Guanhua Sun, Tomoyuki Mano, Shoi Shi, Alvin Li, Koji L Ode, Alex Rosi-Andersen, Erica Pedron, Steven A. Brown, Hiroki R Ueda, Konstantinos Kompotis, Daniel B. Forger</p>

The mouse brain’s activity changes drastically over a day despite being generated from the same neurons and physical connectivity. To better understand this, we develop an experimental-computational pipeline to determine which neurons and networks are most active at different times of the day. We genetically mark active neurons of freely behaving mice at four times of the day with a c-Fos activity-dependent TRAP2 system. Neurons are imaged and digitized in 3D, and their molecular properties are inferred from the latest brain spatial transcriptomic dataset. We then develop a new computational method to analyze the network formed by the identified active neurons. Applying this pipeline, we observe region and layer-specific activation of neurons in the cortex, especially activation of layer five neurons at the end of the dark (wake) period. We also observe a shift in the balance of excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons versus inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons across the whole brain, especially in the thalamus. Moreover, as the dark (wake) period progresses, the network formed by the active neurons becomes less modular, and the hubs switch from subcortical regions, such as the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, to cortical regions in the default mode network. Taken together, we present a pipeline to understand which neurons and networks may be most activated in the mouse brain during an experimental protocol, and use this pipeline to understand how brain activity changes over the course of a day.

                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy can be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, has increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

                Background Recently, the dynamics of gender and entrepreneurship have received more attention; however, the subtleties of how gender affects entrepreneurial intentions remain a challenge, despite empowerment through skills and formal training. This study seeks to establish gender differences in entrepreneurial intentions in educational settings as well as the broader context of gender equity in achieving financial independence among finalist undergraduate students. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of gender-related factors that influence entrepreneurial intentions among undergraduate students. Methodology This was a cross-sectional and quantitative study. The study site was the town campus of Mbarara University of Science and Technology. The study population consisted of finalist businesses and students. The data were managed and analyzed using STATA version 17. T-tests of independent samples and means were used for data analysis. Results Of the 404 respondents, the majority were males (56.2%). Entrepreneurial Intentions were higher among females with a history of business ownership (M = 22.7, SD = 5.1) than among those without a history of business ownership (M = 19.5, SD = 6.9), at t = 2.25, p <0.05. Further, entrepreneurial intentions were lower among male students whose male caretakers or parents had business as an occupation (M = 19.5, SD = 6.9) than their counterparts whose male parents were not in business (M = 21.5, SD = 5.6) at t = 2.31, p <0.05. No other gender differences were found across other socio-demographic variables (p <0.05). Conclusion Entrepreneurial Intentions differed among females with a history of business ownership. We argue that the complex interplay of gender demographic gaps in shaping undergraduate students’ entrepreneurial aspirations cannot be significantly improved based on family background without conclusive equal opportunity training approaches. Designing a hands-on and role-modeling entrepreneurship curriculum can shape gender-mainstream intentions.

                Background Mexico’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda requires reliable forecasts of sustainability performance. Anticipating trends can help target interventions and allocate resources effectively. Methods An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained on historical national time-series data to forecast three composite indicators through 2030: the Sustainable Development Index (SDI), the UN Sustainable Development Goals Index (ISDG), and the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). The model jointly learned patterns across indices to capture interdependencies relevant to sustainability outcomes. Results The ANN indicates interconnected dynamics among sustainability dimensions and suggests that measurable progress toward the SDGs by 2030 will depend on targeted policy effort in three domains: (1) education outcomes, (2) economic diversification that moves production toward higher-complexity activities, and (3) environmental strategies that mitigate ecological pressures. Forecasts underscore that gains in one area can reinforce others, but also that uneven advances may constrain aggregate progress. Conclusions Despite constraints—including a relatively short training series and omission of potentially important exogenous variables—the ANN provides a useful decision-support tool for refining sustainability policy. Future research should incorporate additional drivers (e.g., socio-economic, environmental, and governance covariates) and optimize ANN parameters to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability, helping ensure Mexico remains on track to meet its SDG commitments by 2030.

                Background Globally, 10–20% of adolescents face mental health disorders, with 14% affected in South Africa. Despite existing policies and school-based frameworks, significant gaps remain in implementation, particularly in awareness and early intervention. Schools offer a platform for mental health promotion, yet few well-documented, adolescent-focused awareness programs exist. This scoping review aimed to map available scientific evidence on mental health awareness promotion programs targeting adolescents in South Africa. Methodology The scoping review followed Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, and a systematic search was conducted in Sabinet, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Wiley Online Library, covering English-language studies published between January 2020 and January 2025. A total of 4881 records were identified, including 20 from manual searches, with 39 articles meeting the inclusion criteria for final synthesis. The study was registered on prospero: CRD420251174673 Results Study findings discovered several programs in South Africa to enhance mental health awareness among adolescents. The Integrated School Health Policy was implemented across all nine provinces which provides comprehensive school health and psychosocial support through collaboration among various stakeholders. The Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions program which targets 10-15 with internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression was implemented in 4 Cape Town schools. In Khayelitsha, the Health Action in Schools for Thriving Adolescent Generation program was implemented to support learners aged 11-15 by fostering thriving school environments and peer support. Despite these efforts, challenges including inconsistent attendance, logistical barriers, insufficient resources, concerns about sustainability, and inadequate school capacity addressing critical learner vulnerabilities were identified. Resulting in the high prevalence of anxiety and depression. Conclusion The review highlights a clear gap in the implementation and evaluation of structured mental health awareness programs for adolescents in South Africa. Strengthening school-based mental health initiatives, training educators, and addressing systemic barriers are essential steps toward improving adolescent mental health outcomes and closing the existing treatment gap.

                In this narrative review, we examine the role of organisational culture in shaping employee performance within local governments, addressing a critical gap in synthesised evidence connecting cultural elements to practical performance outcomes across diverse contexts. We focus on how leadership practices, change management, performance management, communication patterns, and employee engagement, within an organisational culture framework, collectively influence institutional capacity and foster inclusive, transparent, and accountable governance aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 16. Anchored in Schein’s Organisational Culture Theory, we conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed articles, government reports, and case studies published between 2015 and 2025. We searched multidisciplinary databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select high-quality studies relevant to organisational culture and performance in local government contexts. Data were analysed thematically to identify patterns and relationships among the key variables influencing performance outcomes. Our findings show that ethical and participatory leadership cultivates trust and alignment with institutional objectives, adaptive change management promotes responsiveness to technological and policy reforms, and data-driven performance management strengthens goal attainment and continuous improvement. We also found that inclusive communication patterns foster transparency and collaboration, while meaningful employee engagement drives motivation, equity, and professional growth. By integrating these elements, we establish a clear link between cultural practices and tangible governance outcomes, offering actionable insights for policymakers, institutional leaders, and stakeholders seeking to enhance local government performance. We contribute to the body of knowledge by providing a consolidated evidence base that informs strategies to strengthen institutional culture, advance accountability, and promote inclusive, effective, and sustainable public service delivery, supporting both theoretical understanding and practical interventions in local government contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-83/v2?src=rss">Is rationality a cognitive faculty? [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Rationality in the standard (economics) sense cannot be a form of intelligence or any other cognitive faculty, such as memory, language, or mathematical skills. To establish this thesis, this paper uses a distinction from set theory, namely, the distinction between “binary relators” and “binary operators”. Rationality, in the standard sense, acts as a binary relator in the sense that it is an optimization method, whereas cognitive ability acts as a binary operator in the sense that it is a transformational function. Rationality as an optimization method (binary relator) does not differ from the neo-Darwinian notion of natural selection: either method seeks to find the best choice or fit trait given the constraints. A cognitive faculty as a transformational function (binary operator) simply translates inputs into outputs. The distinction between standard rationality and cognitive functions has wide-ranging implications for the theory of evolution.
