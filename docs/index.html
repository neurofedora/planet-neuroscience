                <p>The cerebellum is a conserved structure of the vertebrate brain involved in the timing and calibration of movements. Its function is supported by the convergence of fibers from granule cells (GCs) and inferior olive neurons (IONs) onto Purkinje cells (PCs). Theories of cerebellar function postulate that IONs convey error signals to PCs that, paired with the contextual information provided by GCs, can instruct motor learning. Here, we use the larval zebrafish to investigate (1) how sensory representations of the same stimulus vary across GCs and IONs and (2) how PC activity reflects these two different input streams. We use population calcium imaging to measure ION and GC responses to flashes of diverse luminance and duration. First, we observe that GCs show tonic and graded responses, as opposed to IONs, whose activity peaks mostly at luminance transitions, consistently with the notion that GCs and IONs encode context and error information, respectively. Second, we show that GC activity is patterned over time: some neurons exhibit sustained responses for the entire duration of the stimulus, while in others activity ramps up with slow time constants. This activity could provide a substrate for time representation in the cerebellum. Together, our observations give support to the notion of an error signal coming from IONs and provide the first experimental evidence for a temporal patterning of GC activity over many seconds.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0043-24.2024?rss=1">Neural Filtering of Physiological Tremor Oscillations to Spinal Motor Neurons Mediates Short-Term Acquisition of a Skill Learning Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>The acquisition of a motor skill involves adaptations of spinal and supraspinal pathways to alpha motoneurons. In this study, we estimated the shared synaptic contributions of these pathways to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the short-term acquisition of a new force-matching task. High-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was acquired from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI; 7 males and 6 females) and tibialis anterior (TA; 7 males and 4 females) during 15 trials of an isometric force-matching task. For two selected trials (pre- and post-skill acquisition), we decomposed the HDsEMG into motor unit spike trains, tracked motor units between trials, and calculated the mean discharge rate and the coefficient of variation of interspike interval (COV<SUB>ISI</SUB>). We also quantified the post/pre ratio of motor units&rsquo; coherence within delta, alpha, and beta bands. Force-matching improvements were accompanied by increased mean discharge rate and decreased COV<SUB>ISI</SUB> for both muscles. Moreover, the area under the curve within alpha band decreased by ~22% (TA) and ~13% (FDI), with no delta or beta bands changes. These reductions correlated significantly with increased coupling between force/neural drive and target oscillations. These results suggest that short-term force-matching skill acquisition is mediated by attenuation of physiological tremor oscillations in the shared synaptic inputs. Supported by simulations, a plausible mechanism for alpha band reductions may involve spinal interneuron phase-cancelling descending oscillations. Therefore, during skill learning, the central nervous system acts as a matched filter, adjusting synaptic weights of shared inputs to suppress neural components unrelated to the specific task.</p>

                <p>Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons, classified by their expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, play crucial roles in the function and plasticity of the lateral habenular nucleus (LHb). This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the LHb by collecting information about the heterogeneity of LHb PV neurons in mice. To achieve this, we investigated the proportions of the transmitter machinery in LHb PV neurons, including GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter markers, using transcriptome analysis, mRNA in situ hybridization chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. LHb PV neurons comprise three subsets: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and double-positive for glutamatergic and GABAergic machinery. By comparing the percentages of the subsets, we found that the LHb was topographically organized anteroposteriorly; the GABAergic and glutamatergic PV neurons were preferentially distributed in the anterior and posterior LHb, respectively, uncovering the anteroposterior topography of the LHb. In addition, we confirmed the mediolateral topography of lateral GABAergic PV neurons. These findings suggest that PV neurons play distinct roles in different parts of the LHb along the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes, facilitating the topographic function of the LHb. It would be interesting to determine whether their topography is differentially involved in various cognitive and motivational processes associated with the LHb, particularly the involvement of posterior glutamatergic PV neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/29/e0020242024?rss=1">Distinct Action Signals by Subregions in the Nucleus Accumbens during STOP-Change Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to contribute to motivated behavior by signaling the value of reward-predicting cues and the delivery of anticipated reward. The NAc is subdivided into core and shell, with each region containing different populations of neurons that increase or decrease firing to rewarding events. While there are numerous theories of functions pertaining to these subregions and cell types, most are in the context of reward processing, with fewer considering that the NAc might serve functions related to action selection more generally. We recorded from single neurons in the NAc as rats of both sexes performed a STOP&ndash;change task that is commonly used to study motor control and impulsivity. In this task, rats respond quickly to a spatial cue on 80% of trials (GO) and must stop and redirect planned movement on 20% of trials (STOP). We found that the activity of reward-excited neurons signaled accurate response direction on GO, but not STOP, trials and that these neurons exhibited higher precue firing after correct trials. In contrast, reward-inhibited neurons significantly represented response direction on STOP trials at the time of the instrumental response. Finally, the proportion of reward-excited to reward-inhibited neurons and the strength of precue firing decreased as the electrode traversed the NAc. We conclude that reward-excited cells (more common in core) promote proactive action selection, while reward-inhibited cells (more common in shell) contribute to accurate responding on STOP trials that require reactive suppression and redirection of behavior.</p>

                <p>Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus (FK506), are commonly used immunosuppressants for preserving transplanted organs and tissues. However, these drugs can cause severe and persistent pain. GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) are implicated in various neurological disorders, including neuropathic pain. It is unclear whether and how constitutive calcineurin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin protein phosphatase, controls synaptic CP-AMPARs. In this study, we found that blocking CP-AMPARs with IEM-1460 markedly reduced the amplitude of AMPAR-EPSCs in excitatory neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGluT2), but not in inhibitory neurons expressing vesicular GABA transporter, in the spinal cord of FK506-treated male and female mice. FK506 treatment also caused an inward rectification in the current&ndash;voltage relationship of AMPAR-EPSCs specifically in VGluT2 neurons. Intrathecal injection of IEM-1460 rapidly alleviated pain hypersensitivity in FK506-treated mice. Furthermore, FK506 treatment substantially increased physical interaction of &alpha;2-1 with GluA1 and GluA2 in the spinal cord and reduced GluA1/GluA2 heteromers in endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions of spinal cords. Correspondingly, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with pregabalin, <I>Cacna2d1</I> genetic knock-out, or disrupting &alpha;2-1&ndash;AMPAR interactions with an &alpha;2-1 C terminus peptide reversed inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in spinal VGluT2 neurons caused by FK506 treatment. In addition, CK2 inhibition reversed FK506 treatment&ndash;induced pain hypersensitivity, &alpha;2-1 interactions with GluA1 and GluA2, and inward rectification of AMPAR-EPSCs in spinal VGluT2 neurons. Thus, the increased prevalence of synaptic CP-AMPARs in spinal excitatory neurons plays a major role in calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain hypersensitivity. Calcineurin and CK2 antagonistically regulate postsynaptic CP-AMPARs through &alpha;2-1&mdash;mediated GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric assembly in the spinal dorsal horn.</p>

                <p>Sleep disorders affect millions of people around the world and have a high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. While current hypnotics mostly increase non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), drugs acting selectively on enhancing rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) are lacking. This polysomnographic study in male rats showed that the first-in-class selective melatonin MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptor partial agonist UCM871 increases the duration of REMS without affecting that of NREMS. The REMS-promoting effects of UCM871 occurred by inhibiting, in a dose&ndash;response manner, the firing activity of the locus ceruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neurons, which express MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. The increase of REMS duration and the inhibition of LC-NE neuronal activity by UCM871 were abolished by MT<SUB>1</SUB> pharmacological antagonism and by an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, which selectively knocked down MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors in the LC-NE neurons. In conclusion, MT<SUB>1</SUB> receptor agonism inhibits LC-NE neurons and triggers REMS, thus representing a novel mechanism and target for REMS disorders and/or psychiatric disorders associated with REMS impairments.</p>

                <p>We investigated sex differences in dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) using a chronic 16-channel carbon fiber electrode and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). Electrical stimulation-induced (ES; 60&nbsp;Hz) DA release was recorded in the NAc of single- or pair-housed male and female rats. When core (NAcC) and shell (NAcS) were recorded simultaneously, there was greater ES DA release in NAcC of pair-housed females compared with single females and males. Housing did not affect ES NAc DA release in males. In contrast, there was significantly more ES DA release from the DLS of female rats than male rats. This was true prior to and after treatment with methamphetamine. Furthermore, in castrated (CAST) males and ovariectomized (OVX) females, there were no sex differences in ES DA release from the DLS, demonstrating the hormone dependence of this sex difference. However, in the DLS of both intact and gonadectomized rats, DA reuptake was slower in females than that in males. Finally, DA release following ES of the medial forebrain bundle at 60&nbsp;Hz was studied over 4&nbsp;weeks. ES DA release increased over time for both CAST males and OVX females, demonstrating sensitization. Using this novel 16-channel chronic FSCV electrode, we found sex differences in the effects of social housing in the NAcS, sex differences in DA release from intact rats in DLS, and sex differences in DA reuptake in DLS of intake and gonadectomized rats, and we report sensitization of ES-induced DA release in DLS in vivo.</p>

                <p>During the second-to-third trimester, the neuronal pathways of the fetal brain experience rapid development, resulting in the complex architecture of the interwired network at birth. While diffusion MRI-based tractography has been employed to study the prenatal development of structural connectivity network (SCN) in preterm neonatal and postmortem fetal brains, the in utero development of SCN in the normal fetal brain remains largely unknown. In this study, we utilized in utero dMRI data from human fetuses of both sexes between 26 and 38 gestational weeks to investigate the developmental trajectories of the fetal brain SCN, focusing on intrahemispheric connections. Our analysis revealed significant increases in global efficiency, mean local efficiency, and clustering coefficient, along with significant decrease in shortest path length, while small-worldness persisted during the studied period, revealing balanced network integration and segregation. Widespread short-ranged connectivity strengthened significantly. The nodal strength developed in a posterior-to-anterior and medial-to-lateral order, reflecting a spatiotemporal gradient in cortical network connectivity development. Moreover, we observed distinct lateralization patterns in the fetal brain SCN. Globally, there was a leftward lateralization in network efficiency, clustering coefficient, and small-worldness. The regional lateralization patterns in most language, motor, and visual-related areas were consistent with prior knowledge, except for Wernicke's area, indicating lateralized brain wiring is an innate property of the human brain starting from the fetal period. Our findings provided a comprehensive view of the development of the fetal brain SCN and its lateralization, as a normative template that may be used to characterize atypical development.</p>

                <p>The small G-protein Ras&ndash;related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) promotes the formation of filamentous actin (F-actin). Actin is a major component of dendritic spines, and we previously found that alcohol alters actin composition and dendritic spine structure in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). To examine if Rac1 contributes to these alcohol-mediated adaptations, we measured the level of GTP-bound active Rac1 in the striatum of mice following 7&nbsp;weeks of intermittent access to 20% alcohol. We found that chronic alcohol intake activates Rac1 in the DMS of male mice. In contrast, Rac1 is not activated by alcohol in the NAc and DLS of male mice or in the DMS of female mice. Similarly, closely related small G-proteins are not activated by alcohol in the DMS, and Rac1 activity is not increased in the DMS by moderate alcohol or natural reward. To determine the consequences of alcohol-dependent Rac1 activation in the DMS of male mice, we inhibited endogenous Rac1 by infecting the DMS of mice with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a dominant negative form of the small G-protein (Rac1-DN). We found that overexpression of AAV-Rac1-DN in the DMS inhibits alcohol-mediated Rac1 signaling and attenuates alcohol-mediated F-actin polymerization, which corresponded with a decrease in dendritic arborization and spine maturation. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays a role in alcohol-associated goal&ndash;directed learning. Together, our data suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays an important role in alcohol-dependent structural plasticity and aberrant learning.</p>

                <p>The intention to act influences the computations of various task-relevant features. However, little is known about the time course of these computations. Furthermore, it is commonly held that these computations are governed by conjunctive neural representations of the features. But, support for this view comes from paradigms arbitrarily combining task features and affordances, thus requiring representations in working memory. Therefore, the present study used electroencephalography and a well-rehearsed task with features that afford minimal working memory representations to investigate the temporal evolution of feature representations and their potential integration in the brain. Female and male human participants grasped objects or touched them with a knuckle. Objects had different shapes and were made of heavy or light materials with shape and weight being relevant for grasping, not for "knuckling." Using multivariate analysis showed that representations of object shape were similar for grasping and knuckling. However, only for grasping did early shape representations reactivate at later phases of grasp planning, suggesting that sensorimotor control signals feed back to the early visual cortex. Grasp-specific representations of material/weight only arose during grasp execution after object contact during the load phase. A trend for integrated representations of shape and material also became grasp-specific but only briefly during the movement onset. These results suggest that the brain generates action-specific representations of relevant features as required for the different subcomponents of its action computations. Our results argue against the view that goal-directed actions inevitably join all features of a task into a sustained and unified neural representation.</p>

                <p>Anxiety-related disorders respond to cognitive behavioral therapies, which involved the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Previous studies have suggested that subregions of the mPFC have different and even opposite roles in regulating innate anxiety. However, the specific causal targets of their descending projections in modulating innate anxiety and stress-induced anxiety have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that among the various downstream pathways of the prelimbic cortex (PL), a subregion of the mPFC, PL-mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) projection, and PL-ventral tegmental area (VTA) projection exhibited antagonistic effects on anxiety-like behavior, while the PL-MD projection but not PL-VTA projection was necessary for the animal to guide anxiety-related behavior. In addition, MD-projecting PL neurons bidirectionally regulated remote but not recent fear memory retrieval. Notably, restraint stress induced high-anxiety state accompanied by strengthening the excitatory inputs onto MD-projecting PL neurons, and inhibiting PL-MD pathway rescued the stress-induced anxiety. Our findings reveal that the activity of PL-MD pathway may be an essential factor to maintain certain level of anxiety, and stress increased the excitability of this pathway, leading to inappropriate emotional expression, and suggests that targeting specific PL circuits may aid the development of therapies for the treatment of stress-related disorders.</p>

                <p>Preclinical assessments of pain have often relied upon behavioral measurements and anesthetized neurophysiological recordings. Current technologies enabling large-scale neural recordings, however, have the potential to unveil quantifiable pain signals in conscious animals for preclinical studies. Although pain processing is distributed across many brain regions, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is of particular interest in isolating these signals given its suggested role in the affective ("unpleasant") component of pain. Here, we explored the utility of the ACC toward preclinical pain research using head-mounted miniaturized microscopes to record calcium transients in freely moving male mice expressing genetically encoded calcium indicator 6f (GCaMP6f) under the Thy1 promoter. We verified the expression of GCaMP6f in excitatory neurons and found no intrinsic behavioral differences in this model. Using a multimodal stimulation paradigm across naive, pain, and analgesic conditions, we found that while ACC population activity roughly scaled with stimulus intensity, single-cell representations were highly flexible. We found only low-magnitude increases in population activity after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and insufficient evidence for the existence of a robust nociceptive ensemble in the ACC. However, we found a temporal sharpening of response durations and generalized increases in pairwise neural correlations in the presence of the mechanistically distinct analgesics gabapentin or ibuprofen after (but not before) CFA-induced inflammatory pain. This increase was not explainable by changes in locomotion alone. Taken together, these results highlight challenges in isolating distinct pain signals among flexible representations in the ACC but suggest a neurophysiological hallmark of analgesia after pain that generalizes to at least two analgesics.</p>

                <p>Human genetics and preclinical studies have identified key contributions of TREM2 to several neurodegenerative conditions, inspiring efforts to modulate TREM2 therapeutically. Here, we characterize the activities of three TREM2 agonist antibodies in multiple mixed-sex mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and remyelination. Receptor activation and downstream signaling are explored in vitro, and active dose ranges are determined in vivo based on pharmacodynamic responses from microglia. For mice bearing amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) pathology (PS2APP) or combined A&beta; and tau pathology (TauPS2APP), chronic TREM2 agonist antibody treatment had limited impact on microglia engagement with pathology, overall pathology burden, or downstream neuronal damage. For mice with demyelinating injuries triggered acutely with lysolecithin, TREM2 agonist antibodies unexpectedly disrupted injury resolution. Likewise, TREM2 agonist antibodies limited myelin recovery for mice experiencing chronic demyelination from cuprizone. We highlight the contributions of dose timing and frequency across models. These results introduce important considerations for future TREM2-targeting approaches.</p>

                <p>The resurgent sodium current (I<SUB>NaR</SUB>) activates on membrane repolarization, such as during the downstroke of neuronal action potentials. Due to its unique activation properties, I<SUB>NaR</SUB> is thought to drive high rates of repetitive neuronal firing. However, I<SUB>NaR</SUB> is often studied in combination with the persistent or noninactivating portion of sodium currents (I<SUB>NaP</SUB>). We used dynamic clamp to test how I<SUB>NaR</SUB> and I<SUB>NaP</SUB> individually affect repetitive firing in adult cerebellar Purkinje neurons from male and female mice. We learned I<SUB>NaR</SUB> does not scale repetitive firing rates due to its rapid decay at subthreshold voltages and that subthreshold I<SUB>NaP</SUB> is critical in regulating neuronal firing rate. Adjustments to the voltage-gated sodium conductance model used in these studies revealed I<SUB>NaP</SUB> and I<SUB>NaR</SUB> can be inversely scaled by adjusting occupancy in the slow-inactivated kinetic state. Together with additional dynamic clamp experiments, these data suggest the regulation of sodium channel slow inactivation can fine-tune I<SUB>NaP</SUB> and Purkinje neuron repetitive firing rates.</p>

                Background Natural forest resources in northwestern Ethiopia are currently under threat, requiring immediate conservation measures and a management strategy. Thus, an understanding of the present floristic diversity status is required. There is lack of such type of studies specific to fragmented forest patches and across environmental factors. Consequently, this study aimed to examine the existing state of these resources to apply sustainable forest management practices. Methods To achieve this, transects with 200 square plots measuring 400 m2 were set up at nine forest patches with 200m spacing between plots and transects. Vegetation and environmental data were collected and analyzed using R version 4.1. Results Significant variations (p 0.008) were found in vegetation features along the slope, forest patches, and agroclimatic zone. When compared to other forest patches, highland, and mid-altitude forest patches had the highest species diversity (2.48) and stocking (2578 trees/ha). The gentle slope has the most species diversity (2.83). The species similarity between highland and mid-altitude forest habitats was found significant (69%). The vegetation cover in the mid-altitude forest patches was also high (abundance: 5-12%). In all the forest patches examined, tree life forms exceeded shrubs, climbers, and herbs. Conclusions According to the study’s findings, the state of forest resources varies considerably across different environmental variations. Despite the impression of entire forest patches from the outside, the interiors are open, with only huge and mature trees covering the canopy. This state has been triggered by deforestation, degradation, and inappropriate human and grazing operations.

                Aims To study the association between AIM2 gene polymorphisms and the tendency for periodontal infection and coronary heart disease, and to determine whether males or females are more susceptible to these diseases. Additionally, we examined its association with the features of periodontal disease. Methods 140 patients were enrolled in this study, and those who took part were divided into four groups as follows: healthy (c), periodontal disease (P), coronary heart disease with intact periodontium (AS-C), and coronary heart disease with periodontal disease (AS-P). Information on entrants, including age, sex, body mass index, and indicators of periodontal disease severity, was documented. Blood samples were collected, and AIM2 gene polymorphisms were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction test, gel phase, and sequences. Results Genetic analysis of AIM2 G/T (rs2793845) revealed a high frequency of the (T) allele and (GT and TT) genotypes that were detected in the periodontal disease and coronary heart disease groups in males. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of alleles and genotypes did not differ significantly between the study groups. Gene polymorphisms were also significantly correlated with indicators of periodontal disease severity. Conclusion High frequenting of (T) alleles and (GT, TT) genotypes in AIM2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were associated with an increased tendency to develop periodontal disease and coronary heart disease. It can be supposed that it has a causative function in the pathophysiology of both disorders, and the validity of SNP as a potential genomic factor for the risk of both disorders in Iraqi males.

                <p>by Harry Saxton, Xu Xu, Torsten Schenkel, Richard H. Clayton, Ian Halliday</p>

Dynamical system models typically involve numerous input parameters whose “effects” and orthogonality need to be quantified through sensitivity analysis, to identify inputs contributing the greatest uncertainty. Whilst prior art has compared total-order estimators’ role in recovering “true” effects, assessing their ability to recover robust parameter orthogonality for use in identifiability metrics has not been investigated. In this paper, we perform: (i) an assessment using a different class of numerical models representing the cardiovascular system, (ii) a wider evaluation of sampling methodologies and their interactions with estimators, (iii) an investigation of the consequences of permuting estimators and sampling methodologies on input parameter orthogonality, (iv) a study of sample convergence through resampling, and (v) an assessment of whether positive outcomes are sustained when model input dimensionality increases. Our results indicate that Jansen or Janon estimators display efficient convergence with minimum uncertainty when coupled with Sobol and the lattice rule sampling methods, making them prime choices for calculating parameter orthogonality and influence. This study reveals that global sensitivity analysis is convergence driven. Unconverged indices are subject to error and therefore the true influence or orthogonality of the input parameters are not recovered. This investigation importantly clarifies the interactions of the estimator and the sampling methodology by reducing the associated ambiguities, defining novel practices for modelling in the life sciences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1030/v3?src=rss">Uptake of core outcome sets by clinical trialists in China: a protocol [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The concept of core outcome sets (COS) has been introduced in China for about 10 years. In recent years, some Chinese researchers also committed to developing COS, though the majority of COS are ongoing. However, there were more than 500 published COS for research in the COMET database by 2020. The extent of availability of COS for the top 25 diseases with the highest burden in China is unknown. In addition, the uptake of COS in clinical trials for these diseases is unknown, along with the knowledge, perceptions, and views of the clinical trialist community in China on the use of COS in relation to choosing outcomes for their research. Methods The main burden of disease in China will be identified. Then we will search the COMET database to identify if there are ongoing or completed relevant COS research A COS published since 2012 would be preferred to one published before 2012 for the analysis of COS uptake if one meets the eligibility criteria. We will extract scopes of published eligible COS, including condition, population, interventions, and core outcomes. Then we will search the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry using disease names for each disease that has a published COS. We will assess the overlap in scope between clinical trials and COS. Then we will conduct an online survey and semi-structured interviews to identify the knowledge and perceptions of COS among primary investigators of included clinical trials. Discussion This research will fill in gaps between COS and the burden of disease in China. Understanding clinical trialists’knowledge and perceptions of COS may help dissemination and application of COS in the future. Trial registration This research is registered in Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/2563.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The consolidation of memory is thought to ultimately depend on the synthesis of new proteins, since translational inhibitors such as anisomycin and cycloheximide adversely affect the permanence of long-term memory. However, when applied directly in brain, these agents also profoundly suppress neural activity to an extent that is directly correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition caused. Given that neural activity itself is likely to help mediate consolidation, this finding is a serious criticism of the strict de novo protein hypothesis of memory. Here, we test the neurophysiological effects of another translational inhibitor, emetine. Unilateral intra-hippocampal infusion of emetine suppressed ongoing local field and multiunit activity at ipsilateral sites as compared to the contralateral hippocampus in a fashion that was positively correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition as confirmed by autoradiography. This suppression of activity was also specific to the circumscribed brain region in which protein synthesis inhibition took place. These experiments provide further evidence that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary and fundamental for neural function and suggest that the disruption of memory observed in behavioral experiments using translational inhibitors may be due, in large part, to neural suppression.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptic excitation and inhibition are essential for neuronal communication. However, the variables that regulate synaptic excitation and inhibition in the intact brain remain largely unknown. Here, we examined how spike transmission and suppression between principal cells (PCs) and interneurons (INTs) are modulated by activity history, brain state, cell type, and somatic distance between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons by applying cross-correlogram analyses to datasets recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of 11 male behaving and sleeping Long Evans rats. The strength, temporal delay, and brain-state dependency of the spike transmission and suppression depended on the subregions/layers. The spike transmission probability of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression versus short-term facilitation was higher in CA1 and lower in CA3. Likewise, the intersomatic distance affected the proportion of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression and facilitation in the opposite manner in CA1 compared with CA3. The time constant of depression was longer, while that of facilitation was shorter in MEC than in CA1 and CA3. During sharp-wave ripples, spike transmission showed a larger gain in the MEC than in CA1 and CA3. The intersomatic distance affected the spike transmission gain during sharp-wave ripples differently in CA1 versus CA3. A subgroup of MEC layer 3 (EC3) INTs preferentially received excitatory inputs from and inhibited MEC layer 2 (EC2) PCs. The EC2 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs, most of which showed short-term depression, exhibited higher spike transmission probabilities than the EC2 PC–EC2 INT and EC3 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs. EC2 putative stellate cells exhibited stronger spike transmission to and received weaker spike suppression from EC3 INTs than EC2 putative pyramidal cells. This study provides detailed comparisons of monosynaptic interaction dynamics in the hippocampal–entorhinal loop, which may help to elucidate circuit operations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Remembering what just happened is a crucial prerequisite to form long-term memories but also for establishing and maintaining working memory. So far there is no general agreement about cortical mechanisms that support short-term memory. Using a classifier-based decoding approach, we report that hippocampal activity during few sparsely distributed brief time intervals contains information about the previous sensory motor experience of rodents. These intervals are characterized by only a small increase of firing rate of only a few neurons. These low-rate predictive patterns are present in both working memory and non-working memory tasks, in two rodent species, rats and Mongolian gerbils, are strongly reduced for rats with medial entorhinal cortex lesions, and depend on the familiarity of the sensory-motor context.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23620?af=R">Temporal organization of narrative recall is present but attenuated in adults with hippocampal amnesia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Studies of the impact of brain injury on memory processes often focus on the quantity and episodic richness of those recollections. Here, we argue that the organization of one's recollections offers critical insights into the impact of brain injury on functional memory. It is well-established in studies of word list memory that free recall of unrelated words exhibits a clear temporal organization. This <i>temporal contiguity effect</i> refers to the fact that the order in which word lists are recalled reflects the original presentation order. Little is known, however, about the organization of recall for semantically rich materials, nor how recall organization is impacted by hippocampal damage and memory impairment. The present research is the first study, to our knowledge, of temporal organization in semantically rich narratives in three groups: (1) Adults with bilateral hippocampal damage and severe declarative memory impairment, (2) adults with bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) damage and no memory impairment, and (3) demographically matched non-brain-injured comparison participants. We find that although the narrative recall of adults with bilateral hippocampal damage reflected the temporal order in which those narratives were experienced above chance levels, their temporal contiguity effect was significantly attenuated relative to comparison groups. In contrast, individuals with vmPFC damage did not differ from non-brain-injured comparison participants in temporal contiguity. This pattern of group differences yields insights into the cognitive and neural systems that support the use of temporal organization in recall. These data provide evidence that the retrieval of temporal context in narrative recall is hippocampal-dependent, whereas damage to the vmPFC does not impair the temporal organization of narrative recall. This evidence of limited but demonstrable organization of memory in participants with hippocampal damage and amnesia speaks to the power of narrative structures in supporting meaningfully organized recall despite memory impairment.</p>

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials. Narcissism refers to the personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behaviour, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of the influence of selfie-taking behavior and narcissism on oral health. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                The U.S. government has invested in distressed communities in the 21st century but with minimal effect. Regarding income, poverty, joblessness, and vacancy rates, the average distressed zip code in 2018 showed no improvement compared to its standing relative to the average prosperous zip code in 2000. We have discovered the formation of unique business clusters funded by public-private partnerships have the potential to make a difference in lifting distressed communities. Our research of literature and artifacts (photographs, videos, documents, digital media - websites or social media posts) suggests the discovery of a Clean Innovation Ecosystem (CIE). CIE refers to the network of social entrepreneurs, organizations, institutions, and individuals that work together to promote sustainable technologies and practices. As of the 4th quarter of 2023, manufacturing annual run rate construction spending has skyrocketed to over $200 billion. There are another $600 billion of Voltage Valley projects announced that have not yet been built. Over the past two decades, private investment has been between $20 billion and $100 billion annually in U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. Governments are making unprecedented investments in clean energy - which include approximately $400 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), $8 billion to establish 6–10 regional Hydrogen Hubs in the U.S., investments in carbon capture, renewable energy technologies, and other investments in clean energy sectors and technologies. All these investments come with the condition that the investment lifts distressed communities. This article explains why investing in Appalachia and geographic regions with similar characteristics will maximize the social benefit of public investment in a Clean Innovation Ecosystem. Our case study covers the Greater Central Appalachian Voltage Valley (GCAVV) – the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Upstate New York, and Michigan, as well as the Central Appalachian region as defined by 56 of the 85 distressed communities of Appalachia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-807/v1?src=rss">A study of association between early menarche and anxiety in undergraduate  students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Anxiety has been reported to be one of the most common epidemics in recent years. The present study focused on understanding the association between early menarche and the prevalence of anxiety and anxiety symptoms among adult undergraduate students. Methods This was an observational, case-control study. The sample included 146 young female adults aged more than or equal to 18 years pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) and Bachelor of Dental Sciences (BDS). Using an online questionnaire, participants were asked to recall and enter the age at which they attained menarche. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7- Item Questionnaire (GAD-7) to measure the severity of their present anxiety symptoms. Results The results showed a significant increase in anxiety symptoms in participants who had early menarche compared to those who did not have early menarche. The mean score on the GAD-7 Questionnaire for the cases was 9.93 and the control group was 6.89. The GAD-7 scores among the cases group were significantly higher in the GAD-7 scores than in the control group. Conclusions This study concluded that early menarche is associated with higher anxiety levels in young adults.

                <p>Despite the use of ‘high efficacy’ disease-modifying therapies, disease activity and clinical progression of different immune-mediated neurological diseases continue for some patients, resulting in accumulating disability, deteriorating social and mental health, and high economic cost to patients and society. Although autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective treatment modality, it is an intensive chemotherapy-based therapy with a range of short- and long-term side-effects. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell and other hematological malignancies, conferring long-term remission for otherwise refractory diseases. However, the toxicity of this treatment, particularly cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and the complexity of production necessitate the need for a high level of specialization at treating centers. Early-phase trials of CAR-T therapies in immune-mediated B cell driven conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myasthenia gravis, have shown dramatic clinical response with few adverse events. Based on the common physiopathology, CAR-T therapy in other immune-mediated neurological disease, including multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory polyradiculopathy, autoimmune encephalitis, and stiff person syndrome, might be an effective option for patients, avoiding the need for long-term immunosuppressant medications. It may prove to be a more selective immunoablative approach than autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with potentially increased efficacy and lower adverse events. In this review, we present the state of the art and future directions of the use of CAR-T in such conditions. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                The dispanins are a family of 15 transmembrane proteins that have diverse and often unclear physiological functions. Many dispanins, including synapse differentiation induced gene 1 (SynDIG1), proline-rich transmembrane protein 1 (PRRT1)/SynDIG4, and PRRT2, are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), where they are involved in the development of synapses, regulation of neurotransmitter release, and interactions with ion channels, including AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Others, including transmembrane protein 233 (TMEM233) and trafficking regulator of GLUT4-1 (TRARG1), are expressed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS); however, the function of these dispanins is less clear. Recently, a family of neurotoxins isolated from the giant Australian stinging tree was shown to target TMEM233 to modulate the function of voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels, suggesting that the dispanins are inherently druggable. Here, we review current knowledge about the structure and function of the dispanins, in particular TMEM233 and its two most closely related homologs PRRT2 and TRARG1, which may be drug targets involved in neurological disease.

                In this issue of Neuron, Wang et al. demonstrate that parvalbumin interneurons in the sensory thalamic reticular nucleus are necessary and sufficient for regulating social memory in mice, identify a novel cortico-reticular thalamic-parafascicular pathway for social cognition, and highlight an essential role of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in social memory engrams.

                The pupil is the eye’s adjustable aperture. Fitzpatrick et al. find that visual contrast constricts the pupil, increasing contrast. This process improves behavioral performance. Its retinal origin has unorthodox elements, like interneurons that make connections in unusual locales and photoreceptive ganglion cells.

                Kim et al. demonstrate that native mitochondrial precursors can stall inside TOM and block the mitochondrial entry gate when protein import is impaired. The ATPase ATAD1 alleviates this damage by recognizing and extracting stalled precursors. ATAD1-mediated TOM unclogging contributes to proteostasis and fitness of cells with inefficient mitochondrial protein import.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94276">Mapping responses to focal injections of bicuculline in the lateral parafacial region identifies core regions for maximal generation of active expiration</a></h4>

              
                The lateral parafacial area (pFL) is a crucial region involved in respiratory control, particularly in generating active expiration through an expiratory oscillatory network. Active expiration involves rhythmic abdominal (ABD) muscle contractions during late-expiration, increasing ventilation during elevated respiratory demands. The precise anatomical location of the expiratory oscillator within the ventral medulla’s rostro-caudal axis is debated. While some studies point to the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (VIIc) as the oscillator’s core, others suggest more rostral areas. Our study employed bicuculline (a γ-aminobutyric acid type A [GABA-A] receptor antagonist) injections at various pFL sites (–0.2 mm to +0.8 mm from VIIc) to investigate the impact of GABAergic disinhibition on respiration. These injections consistently elicited ABD recruitment, but the response strength varied along the rostro-caudal zone. Remarkably, the most robust and enduring changes in tidal volume, minute ventilation, and combined respiratory responses occurred at more rostral pFL locations (+0.6/+0.8 mm from VIIc). Multivariate analysis of the respiratory cycle further differentiated between locations, revealing the core site for active expiration generation with this experimental approach. Our study advances our understanding of neural mechanisms governing active expiration and emphasizes the significance of investigating the rostral pFL region.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91650">Modulation of alpha oscillations by attention is predicted by hemispheric asymmetry of subcortical regions</a></h4>

              
                Evidence suggests that subcortical structures play a role in high-level cognitive functions such as the allocation of spatial attention. While there is abundant evidence in humans for posterior alpha band oscillations being modulated by spatial attention, little is known about how subcortical regions contribute to these oscillatory modulations, particularly under varying conditions of cognitive challenge. In this study, we combined MEG and structural MRI data to investigate the role of subcortical structures in controlling the allocation of attentional resources by employing a cued spatial attention paradigm with varying levels of perceptual load. We asked whether hemispheric lateralization of volumetric measures of the thalamus and basal ganglia predicted the hemispheric modulation of alpha-band power. Lateral asymmetry of the globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and thalamus predicted attention-related modulations of posterior alpha oscillations. When the perceptual load was applied to the target and the distractor was salient caudate nucleus asymmetry predicted alpha-band modulations. Globus pallidus was predictive of alpha-band modulations when either the target had a high load, or the distractor was salient, but not both. Finally, the asymmetry of the thalamus predicted alpha band modulation when neither component of the task was perceptually demanding. In addition to delivering new insight into the subcortical circuity controlling alpha oscillations with spatial attention, our finding might also have clinical applications. We provide a framework that could be followed for detecting how structural changes in subcortical regions that are associated with neurological disorders can be reflected in the modulation of oscillatory brain activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89781">Stimulation-induced cytokine polyfunctionality as a dynamic concept</a></h4>

              
                Cytokine polyfunctionality is a well-established concept in immune cells, especially T cells, and their ability to concurrently produce multiple cytokines has been associated with better immunological disease control and subsequent effectiveness during infection and disease. To date, only little is known about the secretion dynamics of those cells, masked by the widespread deployment of mainly time-integrated endpoint measurement techniques that do not easily differentiate between concurrent and sequential secretion. Here, we employed a single-cell microfluidic platform capable of resolving the secretion dynamics of individual PBMCs. To study the dynamics of poly-cytokine secretion, as well as the dynamics of concurrent and sequential polyfunctionality, we analyzed the response at different time points after ex vivo activation. First, we observed the simultaneous secretion of cytokines over the measurement time for most stimulants in a subpopulation of cells only. Second, polyfunctionality generally decreased with prolonged stimulation times and revealed no correlation with the concentration of secreted cytokines in response to stimulation. However, we observed a general trend towards higher cytokine secretion in polyfunctional cells, with their secretion dynamics being distinctly different from mono-cytokine-secreting cells. This study provided insights into the distinct secretion behavior of heterogenous cell populations after stimulation with well-described agents and such a system could provide a better understanding of various immune dynamics in therapy and disease.

">HINT1 Inhibitors as Selective Modulators of MOR-NMDAR Cross Regulation and Non-Opioid Analgesia</a></h4>

              
                The Human Histidine Triad Nucleotide Binding Protein 1 (HINT1) has recently become a protein of interest due to its involvement in several CNS processes, including neuroplasticity and the development of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Crucially, HINT1 behaves as a mediator for the cross-regulation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Active site inhibition of HINT1 using small molecule inhibitors has been demonstrated to have a significant impact on this cross-regulatory relationship in vivo. Herein, we describe the development of a series of ethenoadenosine HINT1 inhibitors to further evaluate the effect of HINT1 inhibition on morphine blockade of NMDA-evoked behaviors, the development of acute endomorphin-2 tolerance and analgesia. X-ray crystallographic analysis and HINT1 binding experiments demonstrate that modifications to the inhibitor nucleobase greatly impact the inhibitor binding interactions with HINT1. Our results reveal a complex structural-activity relationship for HINT1 inhibitors in which minor modifications to the ethenoadenosine scaffold resulted in dramatic changes to their activity in these assays modeling MOR-NMDAR interaction. Specifically, we observed the ability of HINT1 inhibitors to selectively affect individual pathways of MOR-NMDAR crosstalk. Furthermore, we observed that a carbamate ethenoadenosine inhibitor of HINT1 can induce analgesia, while not affecting opioid tolerance. Additionally, although past studies have indicated that that loss of HINT1 expression can result in the downregulation of p53, we have shown that inhibition of HINT1 has no effect on either the expression of HINT1 or p53. These studies highlight the critical role of HINT1 in MOR-NMDAR crosstalk and demonstrate the intriguing potential of using HINT1 active-site inhibitors as tools to probe its role in these biochemical pathways and its potential as a novel pain target.

                Dynamic CpG methylation barcodes were read from 15,000 to 21,000 single cells from three human male brains. To overcome sparse sequencing coverage, the barcode had ~31,000 rapidly fluctuating X-chromosome CpG sites (fCpGs), with at least 500 covered sites per cell and at least 30 common sites between cell pairs (average of ~48). Barcodes appear to start methylated and record mitotic ages because excitatory neurons and glial cells that emerge later in development were less methylated. Barcodes are different between most cells, with average pairwise differences (PWDs) of ~0.5 between cells. About 10 cell pairs per million were more closely related with PWDs < 0.05. Barcodes appear to record ancestry and reconstruct trees where more related cells had similar phenotypes, albeit some pairs had phenotypic differences. Inhibitory and excitatory neurons both showed evidence of tangential migration with related cells in different cortical regions. fCpG barcodes become polymorphic during development and can distinguish between thousands of human cells.

">Mistargeted retinal axons form synaptically segregated subcircuits in the visual thalamus of albino mice</a></h4>

              
                A Hebbian model of circuit remodeling predicts that two sets of inputs with very different activity patterns will synaptically capture separate sets of target cells. Support for this prediction appears to come from studies of albino mice where a set of mistargeted retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) forms a cluster of axon terminals that is distinct from the surrounding dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei (dLGN) neuropil. The formation of these islands depends on retinal activity. However, the synaptic connectivity of these islands was unknown. Here, we combine light and electron microscopy to determine if these activity-dependent islands of axon terminals represent synaptically segregated subcircuits. We reconstructed the microcircuitry of the boundary between the island and non-island RGCs and found a remarkably strong segregation within retinogeniculate connectivity. We conclude that, when sets of retinal input are established in the wrong part of the dLGN, the developing circuitry responds by forming a synaptically isolated subcircuit within the otherwise fully connected network. The fact that there is a developmental starting condition that can induce a synaptically segregated microcircuit has important implications for our understanding of the organization of visual circuits and for our understanding of the implementation of activity dependent development.

">Actions obey Weber's law when precision is evaluated at goal attainment</a></h4>

              
                Weber's law, the psychophysical principle stating that the just noticeable difference (JND), which is inversely related to sensory precision, increases proportionally with the magnitude of a stimulus, impacts all domains of human perception, but it is violated in visually guided grasping actions. The underlying reasons for this dissociation between perception and action are still debated, and various hypotheses have been put forward, including a different coding of visual size information for perception and action, the use of positional information to guide grasping, biomechanical factors, or sensorimotor calibration. To contrast these hypotheses, we investigated Weber's law in a new action task, the two-finger pointing task. Participants reached and touched two targets positioned at different distances apart by using their index finger and thumb. Consistent with Weber's law, we found that the standard deviation (SD) of the final inter-finger separation, serving as a measure analogous to the JND, increased with larger inter-target distances. These findings suggest that, when considering measures strongly related with the attainment of the action goal, Weber's law is regularly at play.

">Grape extract and resveratrol mitigate sleep fragmentation, Aβ accumulation, and abnormal neuronal excitability in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Consumption of red wine and grape extracts may offer a range of health benefits, largely attributable to the grapes' rich content of vitamins, fiber, and antioxidant compounds, such as polyphenols. To determine if resveratrol (RES) present in grape extracts is responsible for these benefits, we conducted a study on the effects of red grape skin extract (GSKE), seed extract (GSEE), and RES on sleep patterns, amyloid-beta (A{beta}) deposition, neuronal excitability, and lifespan in a Drosophila model expressing A{beta}42. A{beta}42 flies experienced significant sleep fragmentation at night, yet their overall sleep duration was unaffected. Dietary GSKE significantly enhanced sleep duration and mitigated sleep fragmentation in these flies, whereas GSEE only increased the duration of sleep bouts during the day. RES demonstrated a similar effect, albeit to a lesser extent compared to GSKE. All three dietary interventions led to a reduction in A{beta}42 levels and an extension of the lifespan in A{beta}42 flies, with GSEE showing the least pronounced effects. Furthermore, GSEE and RES were able to reverse the hyperexcitability of mushroom body neurons (MBNs) caused by A{beta}42 expression. These results suggest that GSKE and RES are potent promoters of sleep and have the potential to ameliorate sleep disturbances. Additionally, the study highlights that other bioactive component in GSKE, beyond RES, may contribute to its diverse pharmacological activities, which could differ from those of GSEE or RES alone. This underscores the multifaceted nature of grape extracts and their potential therapeutic applications in addressing sleep disorders and neurodegenerative conditions associated with A{beta} deposition.

">Loss of MEF2C function by enhancer mutation leads to neuronal mitochondria dysfunction and motor deficits in mice</a></h4>

              
                Genetic changes and epigenetic modifications are associated with neuronal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanism behind genetic mutations in the non-coding region of genes that affect epigenetic modifications remains unclear. Here, we identified an ALS-associated SNP located in the intronic region of MEF2C (rs304152), residing in a putative enhancer element, using convolutional neural network. The enhancer mutation of MEF2C reduces own gene expression and consequently impairs mitochondrial function in motor neurons. MEF2C localizes and binds to the mitochondria DNA, and directly modulates mitochondria-encoded gene expression. CRISPR/Cas-9-induced mutation of MEF2C enhancer decreases expression of mitochondria-encoded genes. Moreover, MEF2C mutant cells show reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP level but elevation of oxidative stress. MEF2C deficiency in the upper and lower motor neurons of mice impairs mitochondria-encoded genes, and leads to mitochondrial metabolic disruption and progressive motor behavioral deficits. Together, MEF2C dysregulation by the enhancer mutation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which are prevalent features in motor neuronal damage and ALS pathogenesis. This genetic and epigenetic crosstalk mechanism provides insights for advancing our understanding of motor neuron disease and developing effective treatments.

">A focal traumatic injury to the spinal cord causes an immediate and massive spreading depolarization sustained by chloride ions, with transient network dysfunction and remote cortical glia changes.</a></h4>

              
                In clinics, physical injuries to the spinal cord cause a temporary motor areflexia below lesion, known as spinal shock. This topic is still underexplored due to the lack of preclinical SCI models that do not use anesthesia, which would affect spinal excitability. Our innovative design considered a custom-made micro impactor that provides localized and calibrated strikes to the ventral surface of the thoracic spinal cord of the entire CNS isolated from neonatal rats. Before and after injury, multiple ventral root (VR) recordings continuously traced respiratory rhythm, baseline spontaneous activities, and electrically-induced reflex responses. As early as 200 ms after impact, an immediate transient depolarization spread from the injury site to the whole spinal cord with distinct segmental velocities. Stronger strikes induced higher potentials causing, at the site of injury, a transient drop in tissue oxygen levels and a massive cell death with complete disconnection of longitudinal tracts. Below the impact site, expiratory rhythm and spontaneous lumbar activity were suppressed. On lumbar VRs, reflex responses transiently halted but later recovered to control values, while electrically-induced fictive locomotion remained perturbed. Moreover, low-ion modified Krebs solutions differently influenced impact-induced depolarizations, the magnitude of which amplified in low-Cl-. Moreover, remote changes in cortical glia occurred soon after spinal damage. Overall, our novel in vitro platform traces the immediate functional consequences of impacts to the spinal cord during development. This basic study provides insights on the SCI pathophysiology, unveiling an immediate chloride dysregulation and transient remote glial changes in the cortex.

">Neurophysiological correlates of cortical hierarchy across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                The brain processes information along a hierarchical structure, forming a gradient of cortical hierarchy from sensorimotor areas to transmodal areas. Here, we aim to understand which aspects of neural dynamics characterize this gradient and whether the respective spatial distribution varies across the lifespan. Therefore, we extracted neurophysiological features from magnetoencephalography recordings in 350 participants between 18 and 88 years during rest. Among traditional features related to the power spectrum, delta power (1-4 Hz) showed the most robust association with cortical hierarchy, increasing along this axis. Beyond traditional features, we employed comprehensive time-series characterization and identified a novel hierarchy-sensitive feature capturing the variability of the signal's mean over time. This feature increases along the cortical hierarchy, suggesting that higher-level brain areas exhibit more dynamic and context-dependent activity patterns. Furthermore, we highlight changes in the gradient of brain dynamics across the lifespan. Alpha power distribution, for instance, exhibits a posterior-anterior gradient in young adults that becomes less pronounced with increasing age. Further, the change of the autocorrelation and auto mutual information function along the cortical hierarchy is heavily modulated by age. These findings reveal simple but robust neurophysiological markers of cortical hierarchy and highlight the dynamic nature of the brain's organization throughout life.

">Complementary Organization of Driver and Modulator Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Circuits</a></h4>

              
                Corticocortical (CC) projections in the visual system facilitate the hierarchical processing of sensory information. In addition to direct CC connections, indirect cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathways through the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus can relay sensory signals and mediate interactions between areas according to behavioral demands. While the pulvinar is extensively connected to the entire visual cortex, it is unknown whether transthalamic pathways link all cortical areas or whether they follow systematic organizational rules. Because pulvinar neurons projecting to different cortical areas are spatially intermingled, their input/output relationships have been difficult to characterize using traditional anatomical methods. To determine the organization of CTC circuits, we mapped the higher visual areas (HVAs) of mice with intrinsic signal imaging and targeted five pulvinar[-&gt;]HVA pathways for projection-specific rabies tracing. We aligned post-mortem cortical tissue to in vivo maps for precise quantification of the areas and cell types projecting to each pulvinar[-&gt;]HVA population. Layer 5 corticothalamic (L5CT) ''driver'' inputs to the pulvinar originate predominantly from primary visual cortex (V1), consistent with the CC hierarchy. L5CT inputs from lateral HVAs specifically avoid driving reciprocal connections, consistent with the ''no-strong-loops'' hypothesis. Conversely, layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) ''modulator'' inputs are distributed across areas and are biased toward reciprocal connections. Unlike previous studies in primates, we find that every HVA receives disynaptic input from the superior colliculus. CTC circuits in the pulvinar thus depend on both target HVA and input cell type, such that driving and modulating higher-order pathways follow complementary connection rules similar to those governing first-order CT circuits.

">Criticality explains structure-function relationships in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Healthy brain exhibits a rich dynamical repertoire, with flexible spatiotemporal patterns replays on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. How do fixed structural connections yield a diverse range of dynamic patterns in spontaneous brain activity? We hypothesize that the observed relationship between empirical structure and functional patterns is best explained when the microscopic neuronal dynamics is close to a critical regime. Using a modular Spiking Neuronal Network model based on empirical connectomes, we posit that multiple stored functional patterns can transiently reoccur when the system operates near a critical regime, generating realistic brain dynamics and structural-functional relationships. The connections in the model are chosen as to force the network to learn and propagate suited modular spatiotemporal patterns. To test our hypothesis, we employ magnetoencephalography and tractography data from five healthy individuals. We show that the critical regime of the model is able to generate realistic features, and demonstrate the relevance of near-critical regimes for physiological brain activity.

">Insights into the foraging Gene's Influence on Mating Investments of Male Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The foraging gene is a key genetic factor that modulates social behavior in insects, primarily by governing the trade-off between individual foraging and group-related activities. It has been associated with various behaviors associated with food search and resource exploitation, thereby playing a crucial role in determining the efficiency of foraging and the overall success of the collective. In this study, we investigate the critical role of the foraging gene in mediating complex interval timing behaviors, particularly mating duration, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. By examining two distinct variant phenotypes, rover and sitter, we observe specific deficiencies in longer (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD) behaviors, respectively, suggesting the gene's crucial influence on these interval timing mechanisms. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and knockdown experiments, we identify the gene's significant expression in key neurons involved in learning and memory. However, its impact on mating duration is not observed in these brain regions. Instead, our data reveal the gene's crucial role in specific neurons expressing Pdfr, a critical regulator of circadian rhythms. Furthermore, the study uncovers sexually dimorphic expression patterns in the brain and highlights the necessity of the gene's dosage in specific cell populations within the ellipsoid body for normal mating duration. These findings underscore the foraging gene's pivotal role in mediating complex interval timing behaviors in Drosophila, providing valuable insights into the intricate interplay between genetics, environment, and behavior. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying complex interval timing behaviors, with broader implications for unraveling the function of foraging gene.

">Canonical time-series features for characterizing biologically informative dynamical patterns in fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The interdisciplinary time-series analysis literature encompasses thousands of statistical features for quantifying interpretable properties of dynamical data. But for any given application, it is likely that just a small subset of informative time-series features is required to capture the dynamical quantities of interest. So, while comprehensive libraries of time-series features have been developed, it is useful to construct reduced and computationally efficient subsets for specific applications. In this work, we demonstrate a systematic process to deduce such a reduced set, focused on the problem of distinguishing changes to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series caused by a range of experimental manipulations of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity in mouse cortical circuits. We reduce a comprehensive library of over 7000 candidate time-series features down to a subset of 16 features, which we call catchaMouse16, that aims to both: (i) accurately characterize biologically relevant properties of fMRI time series; and (ii) minimize inter-feature redundancy. The catchaMouse16 feature set accurately classifies experimental perturbations of neuronal activity from fMRI recordings, and also shows strong generalization performance on an unseen mouse and human resting-state fMRI data where it tracks spatial variations in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cell densities, often with greater statistical power than the full hctsa feature set. We provide an efficient, open-source implementation of the catchaMouse16 feature set in C (achieving an approximately 60 times speed-up relative to the native Matlab code of the same features), with wrappers for Python and Matlab. This work demonstrates a procedure to reduce a large candidate time-series feature set down to the key statistical properties of mouse fMRI dynamics that can be used to efficiently quantify and interpret informative dynamical patterns in neural time series.

">Enhancing sleep via rocking ameliorates motor behavior and reduces beta-amyloid levels in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive decline and characterized by beta-amyloid plaque and tau tangle pathology. Recent research indicates a bidirectional relationship between AD pathology and sleep disturbances, with disrupted sleep exacerbating AD progression through increased beta-amyloid and tau accumulation. This strongly indicates that improving sleep may exert a direct protective effect on preventing the accumulation and spreading of AD pathology, and possibly slow the cognitive decline. Here we investigated the effects of enhancing sleep via vestibular stimulation (rocking) on AD progression in a 3xTg mouse model. Over a four-month period starting in early adulthood (p60), we monitored sleep patterns, motor function, memory, and AD pathology. Twelve-hour rocking during the light period significantly increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep duration in mice, although this effect diminished over time due to habituation. Despite this, rocking attenuated motor function decline and reduced beta-amyloid levels in the cerebral cortex of treated mice. No noticeable changes in tau levels were observed following sleep enhancement. In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of non-pharmacological methods to enhance NREM sleep and modify disease trajectory in AD models, emphasizing the critical role of sleep in neuroprotection.

">Large-scale Dynamical Fingerprints of Distributed Synaptic Alterations in Early-Stage Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, present a major challenge for research and clinical practice: its pathogenesis is complex and only partially understood, the individual symptomatology is heterogenous, and there is a lack of biomarkers for the early detection, diagnosis, and individualized treatment. The underlying synaptic and microcircuitry alterations are widely distributed across the cerebral cortex. Here, we developed a magnetoencephalography approach to map the resulting cortex-wide alterations of local cortical population dynamics. We identified large-scale patterns of changes in cortical dynamics that were remarkably similar between first-episode psychosis patients and individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis. These spatial patterns also resembled those induced by pharmacological manipulations of excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors and inhibitory GABA-A receptors in healthy participants. Differences in those spatial patterns of cortical dynamics between first-episode psychosis patients related to individual symptomatology. Our approach and results open a window on the distributed pathophysiology of psychosis.

">A peptide-neurotensin conjugate that crosses the blood-brain barrier induces pharmacological hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties following status epilepticus in mice</a></h4>

              
                Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury and seizures. Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically-induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino-acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate vectorized forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection and reduced hippocampal inflammation. VH-N412 also reduced sprouting of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and preserved learning and memory skills in the treated mice. In cultured hippocampal neurons, VH-N412 displayed temperature-independent neuroprotective properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of SE with PIH. In all, our results show that vectorized NT may elicit different neuroprotection mechanisms mediated either by hypothermia and/or by intrinsic neuroprotective properties.

">Unaware Processing of Words Activates Experience-Derived Information in Conceptual-Semantic Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                The recognition of manipulable objects results from the encoding of sensory input in combination with predictive decoding of experience-derived visuomotor information stored in conceptual-semantic representations. This grounded interpretive processing was previously found to subsist even under unaware perception of manipulable object pictures. In this fMRI study, we first aimed to extend this finding by testing whether experientially grounded visuomotor representations are unawarely recruited when manipulable objects are not visually depicted, but only referred to by words presented subliminally through continuous flash suppression. Second, we assessed the generalizability of decoding experience-derived conceptual information to other semantic categories, by extending our investigation to subliminally presented emotion words and testing for unaware recruitment of grounded emotion representations in the limbic system. Univariate analysis of data sampled from 21 human participants (14 females) showed that manipulable object words selectively activated a left-lateralized visuomotor network, both when words were presented below perceptual threshold and when participants subjectively reported lack of stimulus awareness. Emotion words selectively engaged the bilateral limbic network, although univariate analysis did not provide evidence for its recruitment under subliminal perceptual conditions. In turn, multivariate pattern analysis showed that neural codes associated with both manipulable object and emotion words could be decoded even in the absence of perceptual awareness. These findings suggest that the brain automatically engages in conceptual-semantic decoding of experience-derived information not only when circumstances require to interact with manipulable objects and emotions, but also when these referents are dislocated in time and space and only referred to by words.

">Excitability modulations of somatosensory perception do not depend on feedforward neuronal population spikes</a></h4>

              
                Neural states shape perception at earliest cortical processing levels. Previously we showed a relationship between the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), pre-stimulus alpha oscillations, and the perceived intensity in a somatosensory discrimination paradigm (Stephani et al., 2021, eLife). Here we address the follow-up question whether these excitability dynamics reflect changes in feedforward or feedback signals. Re-examining the previous EEG data, we leveraged high-frequency oscillations (HFO) as a metric for neuronal population spiking activity of the first excitatory feedforward volley in the cortex. Using Bayesian statistics, we found evidence against the involvement of HFO in moment-to-moment variability of perceived stimulus intensity, in contrast to previously observed pre-stimulus alpha and N20 effects. Given that the N20 component presumably reflects backpropagating membrane potentials towards the apical dendrites, we argue that top-down feedback processes (e.g., related to alpha oscillations) may thus rely on modulations at distal sites of involved pyramidal cells rather than on output firing changes at basal compartments.

">Oxytocin facilitates social behavior of female rats via selective modulation of interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin is best known for its prosocial behavioral effects. However, the precise anatomical and cellular targets for oxytocin in the cortex during social behavior remain elusive. Here we show that oxytocin neurons project directly to the medial prefrontal cortex where evoked axonal oxytocin release facilitates social behaviors in adult female rats. In conjunction, we report that local oxytocin receptor (OTR+) expressing cells are predominantly interneurons whose activation promotes social interaction. In particular, in a state of food deprivation, this inhibitory neuronal subpopulation shifts the preference from appetitive food stimuli towards a social stimulus. We further demonstrate that activation of these OTR+ interneurons inhibits principal cells specifically projecting to the basolateral amygdala, thus providing a putative mechanism of selective oxytocin action in this sociability promoting cortical network.

">Optimal sigmoid function models for analysis of transspinal evoked potential recruitment curves recorded from different muscles</a></h4>

              
                Recruitment input-output curves of transspinal evoked potentials that represent the net spinal motor output of alpha motor neurons, and those of cortically, spinally or peripherally induced responses are used extensively in research as neurophysiological biomarkers to establish physiological or pathological behavior of neuronal networks as well as post-treatment recovery. A comparison between different sigmoidal models to fit the transspinal evoked potentials recruitment curve and estimate the parameters of physiological importance has not been performed. This study sought to address this gap by fitting eight sigmoidal models (Boltzmann, Hill, Log-Logistic, Log-Normal, Weibull-1, Weibull-2, Gompertz, Extreme Value Function) to the transspinal evoked potentials recruitment curves of soleus and tibialis anterior recorded under four different cathodal stimulation settings. The sigmoidal models were ranked based on the Akaike information criterion, and their performance was assessed in terms of Akaike differences and weights values. Additionally, an interclass correlation coefficient between the predicted parameters derived from the best models fitted to the recruitment curves was also established. A Bland-Altman analysis was conducted to evaluate the agreement between the predicted parameters from the best models. The findings revealed a muscle dependency, with the Boltzmann and Hill models identified as the best fits for the soleus, while the Extreme Value Function and Boltzmann models were optimal for the tibialis anterior transspinal evoked potentials recruitment curves. Excellent agreement for the upper asymptote, slope, and inflection point parameters was found between Boltzmann and Hill models for the soleus, and for slope and inflection point parameters between Extreme Value Function and Boltzmann models for the tibialis anterior. Notably, the Boltzmann model for soleus and the Extreme Value Function model for tibialis anterior exhibited less susceptibility to inaccuracies in estimated parameters. Based on these findings, we suggest the Boltzmann and the Extreme Value Function models for fitting the soleus and the tibialis anterior transspinal evoked potentials recruitment curve, respectively.

">Dendritically localized RNAs are packaged as diversely composed Ribonucleoprotein particles with heterogeneous copy number states</a></h4>

              
                Localization of mRNAs to dendrites is a fundamental mechanism by which neurons achieve spatiotemporal control of gene expression. Translationally repressed neuronal mRNA transport granules, also referred to as ribonuclear proteins (RNPs), have been shown to be trafficked as single or low copy number RNPs and as larger complexes with multiple copies and/or species of mRNAs. However, there is little evidence of either population in intact neuronal circuits. Using single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization studies in the dendrites of adult rat and mouse hippocampus, we provide evidence that supports the existence of multi-transcript RNPs with the constituents varying in amounts for each RNA species. By competing-off fluorescently labeled probe with serial increases of unlabeled probe, we detected stepwise decreases in Arc RNP number and fluorescence intensity, suggesting Arc RNAs localize to dendrites in both low- and multiple-copy number RNPs. When probing for multiple mRNAs, we find that localized RNPs are heterogeneous in size and colocalization patterns that vary per RNA. Further, localized RNAs that are targeted by the same trans-acting element (FMRP) display greater levels of colocalization compared to an RNA not targeted by FMRP. Simultaneous visualization and assessment of colocalization using highly multiplexed imaging of a dozen mRNA species targeted by FMRP demonstrates that dendritic RNAs are mostly trafficked as heteromeric cargoes of multiple types of RNAs (at least one or more RNAs). Moreover, the composition of these RNA cargoes correlates with the abundance of the transcripts even after accounting for expression. Collectively, these results suggest that dendritic RNPs are packaged as heterogeneous co-assemblies of different mRNAs and that RNP contents may be driven, at least partially, by highly abundant dendritic RNAs; a model that favors efficiency over fine-tuned control for sustaining long-distance trafficking of thousands of messenger molecules.

">Taming the chaos gently: a Predictive Alignment learning rule in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent neural circuits often face inherent complexities in learning and generating their desired outputs, especially when they initially exhibit chaotic spontaneous activity. While the celebrated FORCE learning rule can train chaotic recurrent networks to produce coherent patterns by suppressing chaos, it requires non-local plasticity rules and extremely quick plasticity, raising the question of how synapses adapt on local, biologically plausible timescales to handle potential chaotic dynamics. We propose a novel framework called "Predictive Alignment", which tames the chaotic recurrent dynamics to generate a variety of patterned activities via a biologically plausible plasticity rule. Unlike most recurrent learning rules, predictive alignment does not aim to directly minimize output error to train recurrent connections, but rather it tries to efficiently suppress chaos by aligning recurrent prediction with chaotic activity. We show that the proposed learning rule can perform supervised learning of multiple target signals, including complex low-dimensional attractors, delay matching tasks that require short-term temporal memory, and finally even dynamic movie clips with high-dimensional pixels. Our findings shed light on how predictions in recurrent circuits can support learning.

">Geometrical determinant of nonlinear synaptic integration in human cortical pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons integrate synaptic inputs and convert them to action potential output at electrically distant locations. The computational power of a neuron is hence enhanced by subcellular compartmentalization and nonlinear synaptic integration, but the biophysical determinants of these features in human neurons are not completely understood. By examining the synaptic input-output function of human neocortical pyramidal neurons, we found that the nonlinearity threshold at the soma was linearly determined by the shortest path distance from the synapse to the apical trunk, and the slope of this relationship was consistent throughout the dendritic arbor. Analogous rules were found from both supragranular and infragranular layers of the rodent cortex, suggesting that these represent a fundamental property of pyramidal neurons. Additionally, we found that neurons associated with tumor or epilepsy had distinct membrane properties, but the nonlinearity threshold was shifted in amplitude such that the slope of its relationship with synaptic distance remained consistent.

">Emergence and long-term maintenance of modularity in plastic networks of spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                In the last three decades it has become clear that cortical regions, interconnected via white-matter fibers, form a modular and hierarchical network. This type of organization, which has also been recognized at the microscopic level in the form of interconnected neural assemblies, is typically believed to support the coexistence of segregation (specialization) and integration (binding) of information. A fundamental open question is to understand how this complex structure can emerge in the brain. Here, we made a first step to address this question and propose that adaptation to various inputs could be the key driving mechanism for the formation of structural assemblies. To test this idea, we develop a model of quadratic integrate-and-fire spiking neurons, trained to stimuli targetting distinct sub-populations. The model is designed to satisfy several biologically plausible constraints: (i) the network contains excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP); and (ii) neither the neuronal activity nor the synaptic weights are frozen after the learning phase. Instead, the network is allowed to continue firing spontaneously while synaptic plasticity remains active. We find that only the combination of the two inhibitory STDP sub-populations allows for the formation of stable modular organization in the network, with each sub-population playing a distinct role. The Hebbian sub-population controls for the firing rate, while the anti-Hebbian mediates pattern selectivity. After the learning phase, the network activity settles into an asynchronous irregular resting-state-resembling the behaviour typically observed in-vivo in the cortex. This post-learning activity also displays spontaneous memory recalls, which are fundamental for the long-term consolidation of the learned memory items. The model here introduced can represent a starting point for the joint investigation of neural dynamics, connectivity and plasticity.

">Peripheral CaV2.2 channels in skin regulate prolonged heat hypersensitivity during neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation can lead to chronic maladaptive pain affecting millions of people worldwide. Neurotransmitters, cytokines, and ion channels are implicated in neuro-immune cell signaling but their roles in specific behavioral responses are not fully elucidated. Voltage-gated CaV2.2 channel activity in skin controls rapid and transient heat hypersensitivity induced by intradermal capsaicin via IL-1 cytokine signaling. CaV2.2 channels are not, however, involved in mechanical hypersensitivity that developed in the same animal model. Here, we show that CaV2.2 channels are also critical for heat hypersensitivity induced by the intradermal (id) Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) model of chronic neuroinflammation that involves ongoing cytokine signaling for days. Ongoing CFA-induced cytokine signaling cascades in skin lead to pronounced edema, and hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli. Peripheral CaV2.2 channel activity in skin is required for the full development and week-long time course of heat hypersensitivity induced by id CFA. CaV2.2 channels, by contrast, are not involved in paw edema and mechanical hypersensitivity. CFA induced increases in cytokines in hind paws including IL-6 which was dependent on CaV2.2 channel activity. Using IL-6 specific neutralizing antibodies, we show that IL-6 contributes to heat hypersensitivity and, neutralizing both IL-1 and IL-6 was even more effective at reducing the magnitude and duration of CFA-induced heat hypersensitivity. Our findings demonstrate a functional link between CaV2.2 channel activity and the release of IL-6 in skin and show that CaV2.2 channels have a privileged role in the induction and maintenance of heat hypersensitivity during chronic forms of neuroinflammation in skin.

">Induction of long-term hyperexcitability by memory-related cAMP signaling in isolated nociceptor cell bodies</a></h4>

              
                Persistent hyperactivity of nociceptors is known to contribute significantly to long-lasting sensitization and ongoing pain in many clinical conditions. It is often assumed that nociceptor hyperactivity is mainly driven by continuing stimulation from inflammatory mediators. We have tested an additional possibility: that persistent increases in excitability promoting hyperactivity can be induced by a prototypical cellular signaling pathway long known to induce late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses in brain regions involved in memory formation. This cAMP-PKA-CREB-gene transcription-protein synthesis pathway was tested using whole-cell current clamp methods on small dissociated sensory neurons (primarily nociceptors) from dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) excised from previously uninjured (naive) rats. Six-hour treatment with the specific Galphas-coupled 5-HT4 receptor agonist, prucalopride, or with the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, induced long-term hyperexcitability (LTH) in DRG neurons that manifested 12-24 hours later as action potential (AP) discharge (ongoing activity, OA) during artificial depolarization to -45 mV, a membrane potential that is normally subthreshold for AP generation. Prucalopride treatment also induced significant long-lasting depolarization of resting membrane potential (from -69 to -66 mV), enhanced depolarizing spontaneous fluctuations (DSFs) of membrane potential, and indications of reduced AP threshold and rheobase. LTH was prevented by co-treatment of prucalopride with inhibitors of PKA, CREB, gene transcription, and protein synthesis. As in the induction of synaptic memory, many other cellular signals are likely to be involved. However, the discovery that this prototypical memory induction pathway can induce nociceptor LTH, along with reports that cAMP signaling and CREB activity in DRGs can induce hyperalgesic priming, suggest that early, temporary, cAMP-induced transcriptional and translational mechanisms can induce nociceptor LTH that might last for long periods. An interesting possibility is that these mechanisms can also be reactivated by re-exposure to inflammatory mediators such as serotonin during subsequent challenges to bodily integrity, reconsolidating the cellular memory and thereby extending the duration of persistent nociceptor hyperexcitability.

                An abundance of evidence shows sleep homeostatically regulates synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation but the underlying molecular regulators of this important function of sleep have been difficult to directly elucidate. Arc is an immediate early gene that has a fundamental role in several aspects of synaptic plasticity including regulation and maintenance. Using a physiological brain slice model of slow-wave sleep, here we show that Arc protein has a characteristic spatial and cell-type specific distribution during persistent sleep-related delta oscillations in neocortical slices, which may correlate with aspects of sleep-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity in cortical regions. In delta oscillating slices, Arc is highly expressed in layer 2/3 dendrites of the primary and secondary association cortex and this dendritic localisation is specific to intrinsically bursting cells (IB) whose cell bodies are in layer 5. Moreover, Arc immunopositive dendrites are clustered together arranged in a quasi hexagonal arrangement with a spacing of ~ 50 m between clusters. The cytoarchitectural distribution of Arc across the association cortex has implications for the mechanisms of sleep and for the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis regarding the function of sleep.

	<p>Hormone changes across women&amp;amp;rsquo;s menstrual cycles may lead to changes in their perceptions of chemical signals and their hormonal responses to these cues. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of menstrual cycle phase in the response to extracts of male axillary secretions (EMAS) in women. We tested healthy reproductive age and premenopausal women (n = 29). An EMAS/control solution was applied once every two hours during either the follicular or luteal phase, at which point saliva samples for luteinizing hormone (LH) and cortisol monitoring were collected. LH and cortisol concentrations were analyzed using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technique. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) scores were used to assess the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; moods. For the first time, we showed that EMAS may produce opposite effects on LH secretion depending on the menstrual cycle phase of the recipient. We observed a significant increase in the number of LH peaks (p = 0.0447) and their amplitudes (p = 0.0469) when EMAS was applied during the follicular phase, while the same application in the luteal phase lowered the amplitudes of LH peaks (p = 0.0382). For the first time, we showed that EMAS application increased salivary cortisol levels in reproductive age women relative to premenopausal women (p = 0.0032). PANAS scores revealed changes in positive and negative affect after EMAS application. Our data indicate the significance of the menstrual cycle phase for EMAS&amp;amp;rsquo; effects on LH secretion and mood, but not on cortisol secretion in women.</p>

	<p> In the previous literature, specific attention has been paid to investigate autism spectrum symptoms and traits in university students. In this framework, we aimed to evaluate the presence and correlates of autistic traits, hikikomori tendencies, altered eating behaviors, and pathological videogaming in a sample of Italian university students enrolled in bachelor&amp;amp;rsquo;s degree courses. A total of 1192 students were recruited via an online survey and assessed with the Hikikomori Questionnaire&amp;amp;mdash;25, the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum Questionnaire, the Eating Attitude test&amp;amp;mdash;26, and the Assessment of Internet and Computer Game Addiction. Our results highlighted significant differences in the prevalence of autistic traits, social withdrawal tendencies, altered eating habits, and pathological videogame use in university students based on gender, age, parents&amp;amp;rsquo; level of instruction, and field of study. A significant effect of the presence of autistic traits and gender on the scores obtained with the other questionnaires was reported. Our results not only support the role of autistic traits as a vulnerability factor for the development of a set of psychopathological conditions but also suggest that gender could modulate this vulnerability, supporting the hypothesis of gender-specific phenotypes in the autism spectrum.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Hyperactivity may play a functional role in upregulating prefrontal cortical hypoarousal and executive functioning in ADHD. This study investigated the neurocognitive impact of movement during executive functioning on children with ADHD. (2) Methods: Twenty-four children with and without ADHD completed a Stroop task and self-efficacy ratings while remaining stationary (Stationary condition) and while desk cycling (Movement condition). Simultaneous functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recorded oxygenated and deoxygenated changes in hemoglobin within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). (3) Results: Among children with ADHD, the Movement condition produced superior Stroop reaction time compared to the Stationary condition (p = 0.046, d = 1.00). Self-efficacy improved in the Movement condition (p = 0.033, d = 0.41), whereas it did not in the Stationary condition (p = 0.323). Seventy-eight percent of participants showed greater oxygenation in the left DLPFC during the Movement condition vs. the Stationary condition. Among children without ADHD, there were no differences in Stroop or self-efficacy outcomes between Stationary and Movement conditions (ps &amp;amp;gt; 0.085, ts &amp;amp;lt; 1.45); 60% of participants showed greater oxygenation in the left DLPFC during the Movement vs. the Stationary condition. (4) Conclusions: This work provides supportive evidence that hyperactivity in ADHD may be a compensatory mechanism to upregulate PFC hypoarousal to support executive functioning and self-efficacy.</p>

	<p>Brain health is a complex concept, shaped by a plethora of determinants related to physical health, healthy environments, safety and security, learning and social connection, as well as access to quality healthcare services. Decision-making in this complex field is characterized by diverse values, potentially conflicting interests, and asymmetrically influential stakeholders. Values-based practice (VBP) is a toolkit for balancing values in a democratic and inclusive way, so that every stakeholder feels a sense of ownership over the decision made. In VBP, the emphasis is on good process rather than on pre-determined &amp;amp;lsquo;correct&amp;amp;rsquo; outcomes. Based on two case vignettes, we highlight the relevance of the ten principles of VBP for balancing different values to the satisfaction of those directly concerned, in a given decision-making process. In addition, we argue that the successful implementation of VBP in the complex area of brain health, as well as in other fields, is premised on higher order values (meta-values), beyond mutual respect and the legal, regulatory, and bioethical framework. These include mutual regard, reciprocity, autonomy, and an egalitarian attitude towards VBP procedures and involved stakeholders.</p>

	<p>Background: Misophonia is a chronic condition in which the exposure to specific sounds increases the arousal and recurrence of specific intense negative emotions. We hypothesized that misophonia may be strongly related to maladaptive interpersonal schemas that create difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Subjects with maladaptive interpersonal schemas think that other people try to subjugate, criticize, dominate, exploit, deceive, disregard, and humiliate them. Furthermore, these patients typically endorse a representation of self as mistreated, constricted, harmed, damaged, humiliated, impotent, inadequate, or fragile. Methods: We describe the course of a treatment of Metacognitive Interpersonal Therapy (MIT) in a young man presenting misophonia and co-occurrent obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), with narcissistic traits and normal hearing. We collected qualitative and quantitative data at the beginning of the intervention and at 2 years follow-up. Results: The therapy aimed at increasing awareness of maladaptive interpersonal schemas and promoting a healthy self. The results reported a significant decrease in misophonia; behavioural experiments were used to increase the quality of social relationships and tolerance to the trigger sounds. Conclusions: MIT can be an effective therapy for the treatment of misophonia.</p>

	<p>This select overview examines the important intersection of adult domestic violence, including intimate partner violence and elder abuse, with brain injury. Despite the high prevalence of domestic violence amongst brain injury patients, there is a notable gap in screening and management training for providers. To provide optimal patient care, brain injury medicine clinicians must screen, recognize, and treat patients who have experienced domestic violence. This select overview highlights barriers to screening, validated screening tools from other medical disciplines, and management considerations for the brain injury clinician. A suggested protocol for domestic violence screening and management, as well as recommended resources for providers and patients, is summarized.</p>

	<p>Our goal was to evaluate persisting deficits in gait and executive functioning in asymptomatic athletes with a history of concussion using a novel approach combining a dual-task paradigm and post-exercise exertion. Thirty-eight athletes aged 17 to 25 years old participated in the study, including 18 with a history of concussion. The dual-task paradigm required walking continuously at a predetermined self-paced target speed of 6.5 km/h while executing a complex switch task. Athletes completed two conditions, each on separate days: (1) dual task alone and (2) dual task following 20 min of running on a non-motorized treadmill. The statistical analyses revealed a significant reduction in gait speed exclusively for athletes with a history of concussion and only following the post-exercise condition (p = 0.008). These findings suggest that although asymptomatic concussed athletes maintain a cognitive performance comparable to non-concussed athletes, this appears to be achieved at the expense of gait speed. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating gait assessments and post-exercise exertion into concussion evaluation protocols in both research and clinical settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0093-24.2024?rss=1">Chronic Social Defeat Stress Increases Brain Permeability to Ghrelin in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ghrelin is a stomach-derived hormone that increases feeding and is elevated in response to chronic psychosocial stressors. The effects of ghrelin on feeding are mediated by the binding of ghrelin to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), a receptor located in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic regions important for regulating food intake and metabolic rate. The ability of ghrelin to enter the brain, however, seems to be restricted to circumventricular organs like the median eminence and the brainstem area postrema, whereas ghrelin does not readily enter other GHSR-expressing regions like the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Interestingly, social stressors result in increased blood&ndash;brain barrier permeability, and this could therefore facilitate the entry of ghrelin into the brain. To investigate this, we exposed mice to social defeat stress for 21&nbsp;d and then peripherally injected a Cy5-labelled biologically active ghrelin analog. The results demonstrate that chronically stressed mice exhibit higher Cy5-ghrelin fluorescence in several hypothalamic regions in addition to the ARC, including the hippocampus and midbrain. Furthermore, Cy5-ghrelin injections resulted in increased FOS expression in regions associated with the reward system in chronically stressed mice. Further histologic analyses identified a reduction in the branching of hypothalamic astrocytes in the ARC-median eminence junction, suggesting increased blood&ndash;brain barrier permeability. These data support the hypothesis that during metabolically challenging conditions like chronic stress, ghrelin may be more able to cross the blood&ndash;brain barrier and diffuse throughout the brain to target GHSR-expressing brain regions away from circumventricular organs.</p>

                <p>Acetylcholine (ACh) neurons in the central nervous system are required for the coordination of neural network activity during higher brain functions, such as attention, learning, and memory, as well as locomotion. Disturbed cholinergic signaling has been described in many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, cotransmission of other signaling molecules, such as glutamate and GABA, with ACh has been associated with essential roles in brain function or disease. However, it is unknown when ACh neurons become cholinergic during development. Thus, understanding the timeline of how the cholinergic system develops and becomes active in the healthy brain is a crucial part of understanding brain development. To study this, we used transgenic mice to selectively label ACh neurons with tdTomato. We imaged serial sectioned brains and generated whole-brain reconstructions at different time points during pre- and postnatal development. We found three crucial time windows&mdash;two in the prenatal and one in the postnatal brain&mdash;during which most ACh neuron populations become cholinergic in the brain. We also found that cholinergic gene expression is initiated in cortical ACh interneurons, while the cerebral cortex is innervated by cholinergic projection neurons from the basal forebrain. Taken together, we show that ACh neuron populations are present and become cholinergic before postnatal day 12, which is the onset of major sensory processes, such as hearing and vision. We conclude that the birth of ACh neurons and initiation of cholinergic gene expression are temporally separated during development but highly coordinated by brain anatomical structure.</p>

                The finite-volume theory has shown to be numerically efficient and stable for topology optimization of continuum elastic structures. The significant features of this numerical technique are the local satisfaction of equilibrium equations and the employment of compatibility conditions along edges in a surface-averaged sense. These are essential properties to adequately mitigate some numerical instabilities in the gradient version of topology optimization algorithms, such as checkerboard, mesh dependence, and local minima issues. Several computational tools have been proposed for topology optimization employing analysis domains discretized with essential features for finite-element approaches. However, this is the first contribution to offer a platform to generate optimized topologies by employing a Matlab code based on the finite-volume theory for compliance minimization problems. The Top2DFVT provides a platform to perform 2D topology optimization of structures in Matlab, from domain initialization for structured meshes to data post-processing. This contribution represents a significant advancement over earlier publications on topology optimization based on the finite-volume theory, which needed more efficient computational tools. Moreover, the Top2DFVT algorithm incorporates SIMP and RAMP material interpolation schemes alongside sensitivity and density filtering techniques, culminating in a notably enhanced optimization tool. The application of this algorithm to various illustrative cases confirms its efficacy and underscores its potential for advancing the field of structural optimization.

                Background: Contributing factors for improved survival of human adipocytes mesenchymal stem cells (h-AMSCs) cultured through hypoxia preconditioning, in example apoptosis inhibition involving BCL2 and HSP27 expression, trigger signal expression (VEGF), SCF expression, OCT-4 expression, and CD44+ expression. The objective if this study was to explain the mechanism and role of hypoxic preconditioning and the optimal duration of hypoxic preconditioning exposure to improve survival of h-AMSCs. Methods: An experimental laboratory explorative study (in vitro) with hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs cultures. This research was conducted through four stages. First, isolation of h-AMSCs culture from adipose tissue of patients. Second, the characterization of h-AMSCs from adipose tissue by phenotype (flowcytometry) through CD44+, CD90+ and CD45-expression before being pre-conditioned for hypoxic treatment. Third, the hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs culture (in vitro) was performed with an oxygen concentration of 1% for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Fourth, observation of survival from h-AMSCs culture was tested on the role of CD44+, VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, HSP27 with Flowcytometry and apoptotic inhibition by Tunnel Assay method. Results: The result of regression test showed that time difference had an effect on VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=-0.482) and hypoxia condition also influenced VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=0.774). The result of path analysis showed that SCF had effect on OCT-4 expression (p<0.001; β=0.985). The regression test results showed that time effects on HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.398) and hypoxia precondition also affects HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.847). Pathway analysis showed that BCL2 expression inhibited apoptosis (p=0.030; β=-0.442) and HSP27 expression also inhibited apoptosis (p<0,001;β=-0.487). Conclusion: Hypoxic preconditioning of h-AMSC culture has proven to increase the expression of VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, and BCL2 and HSP27. This study demonstrated and explained the existence of a new mechanism of increased h-AMSC survival in cultures with hypoxic preconditioning (O2 1%) via VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, and HSP 27.

                <p>by Beatriz Álvarez-Rodríguez, Sebastian Velandia-Álvarez, Christina Toft, Ron Geller</p>

RNA viruses have notoriously high mutation rates due to error-prone replication by their RNA polymerase. However, natural selection concentrates variability in a few key viral proteins. To test whether this stems from different mutation tolerance profiles among viral proteins, we measured the effect of >40,000 non-synonymous mutations across the full proteome of coxsackievirus B3 as well as >97% of all possible codon deletions in the nonstructural proteins. We find significant variation in mutational tolerance within and between individual viral proteins, which correlated with both general and protein-specific structural and functional attributes. Furthermore, mutational fitness effects remained stable across cell lines, suggesting selection pressures are mostly conserved across environments. In addition to providing a rich dataset for understanding virus biology and evolution, our results illustrate that incorporation of mutational tolerance data into druggable pocket discovery can aid in selecting targets with high barriers to drug resistance.

The ecology of forest ecosystems depends on the composition of trees. Capturing fine-grained information on individual trees at broad scales provides a unique perspective on forest ecosystems, forest restoration, and responses to disturbance. Individual tree data at wide extents promises to increase the scale of forest analysis, biogeographic research, and ecosystem monitoring without losing details on individual species composition and abundance. Computer vision using deep neural networks can convert raw sensor data into predictions of individual canopy tree species through labeled data collected by field researchers. Using over 40,000 individual tree stems as training data, we create landscape-level species predictions for over 100 million individual trees across 24 sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Using hierarchical multi-temporal models fine-tuned for each geographic area, we produce open-source data available as 1 km<sup>2</sup> shapefiles with individual tree species prediction, as well as crown location, crown area, and height of 81 canopy tree species. Site-specific models had an average performance of 79% accuracy covering an average of 6 species per site, ranging from 3 to 15 species per site. All predictions are openly archived and have been uploaded to Google Earth Engine to benefit the ecology community and overlay with other remote sensing assets. We outline the potential utility and limitations of these data in ecology and computer vision research, as well as strategies for improving predictions using targeted data sampling.

                <p>by Tsan-Ting Hsu, Tzyy-Nan Huang, Chien-Yao Wang, Yi-Ping Hsueh</p>

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are considered neural dysconnectivity syndromes. To better understand ASD and uncover potential treatments, it is imperative to know and dissect the connectivity deficits under conditions of autism. Here, we apply a whole-brain immunostaining and quantification platform to demonstrate impaired structural and functional connectivity and aberrant whole-brain synchronization in a <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>autism mouse model. We express a channelrhodopsin variant oChIEF fused with Citrine at the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to outline the axonal projections of BLA neurons. By activating the BLA under blue light theta-burst stimulation (TBS), we then evaluate the effect of BLA activation on C-FOS expression at a whole brain level to represent neural activity. We show that <i>Tbr1</i> haploinsufficiency almost completely disrupts contralateral BLA axonal projections and results in mistargeting in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, thereby globally altering BLA functional connectivity. Based on correlated C-FOS expression among brain regions, we further show that <i>Tbr1</i> deficiency severely disrupts whole-brain synchronization in the absence of salient stimulation. <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>and wild-type (WT) mice exhibit opposing responses to TBS-induced amygdalar activation, reducing synchronization in WT mice but enhancing it in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice. Whole-brain modular organization and intermodule connectivity are also affected by Tbr1 deficiency and amygdalar activation. Following BLA activation by TBS, the synchronizations of the whole brain and the default mode network, a specific subnetwork highly relevant to ASD, are enhanced in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice, implying a potential ameliorating effect of amygdalar stimulation on brain function. Indeed, TBS-mediated BLA activation increases nose-to-nose social interactions of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/–</sup>mice, strengthening evidence for the role of amygdalar connectivity in social behaviors. Our high-resolution analytical platform reveals the inter- and intrahemispheric connectopathies arising from ASD. Our study emphasizes the defective synchronization at a whole-brain scale caused by <i>Tbr1</i> deficiency and implies a potential beneficial effect of deep brain stimulation at the amygdala for TBR1-linked autism.

                Background The Rorschach test is one of the most popular tests used in clinical settings for psychopathology and personality assessment; however, there is still little evidence regarding the functional correlates of test responses. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for the investigation of biological correlates associated with different psychological functions. Among other applications, fMRI has been used to identify different networks that reflect brain activity in the resting state (rs-fMRI), that is, when an individual is not engaged in any specific task. Among these resting-state networks (RSN), the best-known and most studied are the Default Mode Network (DMN), along with other networks such as salience, frontoparietal, sensorimotor, temporo-parietal, visual, and cerebellar networks. Methods We used this type of analysis to obtain new evidence regarding Rorschach. This study aimed to analyze the functional brain architecture underlying Rorschach’s personality variables, administered according to Exner’s Comprehensive System (CS). In particular, the aims are: 1) to ascertain the existence of correlations between CS variables and activity of the RSN, and 2) to use these profiles of activity to develop a new data-driven clustering of the CS variables. Archival data from twenty-four non-clinical subjects were analyzed. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and partial least squares regression (PLS) were used to analyze the fMRI data. Results The results showed specific associations with the given Rorschach variables (several of which could be grouped into higher-order latent factors) and activity of the main RSN. Moreover, the cluster analysis outlined important groupings of Rorschach variables, particularly regarding their clinical implications. Conclusions Our study could be comprised in the existing literature providing strong evidence about the neurobiological validity of the Rorschach test.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-802/v1?src=rss">Unraveling the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus: Focus on mecA and PVL Genes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Staphylococcus aureus infections, including Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin-Sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), present significant challenges in healthcare due to rising antimicrobial resistance. This study evaluates the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus, focusing on key resistance-associated genes mecA and PVL. Methods A total of 568 clinical specimens were analyzed for the presence of S. aureus. Demographic data were collected to assess age-dependent prevalence. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted to evaluate resistance patterns. The prevalence of the mecA and PVL genes was determined using molecular techniques. Results S. aureus was identified in 37.9% of cases, with the highest prevalence (60-79 age group). All S. aureus isolates showed 100% resistance to penicillin. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains accounted for 84.19% of isolates, with a significant presence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. The mecA gene was prevalent in 82.79% of MRSA isolates, indicating its strong association with methicillin resistance. Additionally, 41.86% of all S. aureus isolates were positive for the PVL gene, highlighting its widespread distribution. Conclusions The high prevalence of mecA and PVL genes in S. aureus strains underscores the challenges in managing these infections. These findings emphasize the necessity for judicious antibiotic use and enhanced collaborative efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance. Understanding the genetic basis of resistance can inform more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in S. aureus infections.

                Background Studies have this reported the presence of death anxiety, ranging from near-death experiences to physically ill people, to a simple thought about death, as well as when it is associated with states of loneliness. The Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), based on Eysenk’s incubation theory, has been adapted and validated in different contexts and is still insufficient in countries such as Peru. This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the DAS, its internal structure, and factorial invariance. Methods An online scale was used in 1248 Peruvians aged between 18 and 70 years (M= 27.37, SD= 11.29) from all regions. DAS was validated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), convergent validity, measurement invariance, and internal consistency (reliability). Results Psychometric properties were found with adequate values in its structure and validity based on the internal structure through exploratory factor analysis, where it was found that the components of the scale are interrelated and the data matrix is factorizable. model of three specific factors and a general factor is presented, which is consistent with the theory and has practical utility, revealing adequate statistical values that reflect acceptable levels of reliability. Finally, there was fairness according to sex and age group of the scale by means of factorial invariance analysis. Conclusions Our results indicate adequate psychometric properties and facilitate a better data collection process for future research.

                Background The tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., is one of the most important horticultural crops that can be consumed fresh or after being processed worldwide. The tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta) is one of the most devastating pest to tomato plants due to its mine-feeding nature in the mesophyll tissue of the plant. Fungal entomopathogens can exist naturally in plants as an asymptote. This study aimed to detect the endophytic colonization of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii within tomato plants via artificial inoculation and their virulence effects on Tuta absoluta. Methods Isolates with the highest percent germination and virulence against T. absoluta were selected for endophytic evaluation within tomato plants by different artificial inoculation techniques. Results This study revealed that, isolates with the highest percent germination and virulent to Tuta absoluta had the potential to colonize tomato plants. The result showed that, the maximum mortality rate (97.5%) of Tuta absoluta larvae was achieved by Metarhizium robertsii isolate K-61 at a concentration of 1x108conidial/ml at 7 days post inoculated. However, the highest cumulative mortality (100%) was recorded by Beauveria bassiana isolate APPRC-27 at 10 days post inoculated through the direct contact method. The highest endophytic colonization was registered by isolate APPRC-27 (76.67%) at 7 days post-inoculated using the leaf spray technique, but it declined to 11.67% after 28 days of inoculated. In the case of the seedling inoculation technique, the highest endophytic colonization was obtained in the root tissues of tomatoes at 28 days of inoculated by isolate K-61. Conclusions This study revealed that the leaf spray inoculation technique was the most effective method, followed by seedling inoculation, for the deployment of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii endophytes in tomato plant tissues. Therefore, virulent Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii, are promising bioagents for the control of Tuta absoluta if deployed as endophytes.

                Background: Optimum productivity of beef cattle is achieved with adequate feed supply, both in quality and quantity. Consumption of local feedstuff Neptunia plena L. Benth and Leersia hexandra Swartz as a ration by the animal subject is expected to promote cost efficiency and production, as well as provide essential nutrition needs. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), N-NH3 production, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in beef cattle. Methods: Feed and rumen inoculum samples were prepared and analyzed for their proximate contents. There were five treatment groups based on the diet received by beef cattle. In vitro approaches were used to determine the DMD, OMD, N-NH3 production, and VFA in beef cattle. The research was conducted in the Laboratory of Feed Nutrient Science, Faculty of Animal Husbandry and Agriculture, Diponegoro University, Semarang. The data were analyzed using ANOVA at a significance level of 95%, and a Duncan Multiple Range Test. Results: The results showed that the highest DMD (P<0.05) was derived from T5 (56.47%), followed by T4 (56.45%) and T3 (55.90%). T5=62.40% significantly (P<0.05) generated the highest OMD followed by T4=61.95% and T3=60.82%. This treatment had the highest N-NH3 value, namely 5.02 mM, compared with T3=4.55 mM, T4=4.50 mM, T2=4.22 mM, and T1=3.99 mM. Furthermore, T5 had the highest VFA (P<0.05) compared with T4, T3, T2, and T1 with the value of 150.5, 133.0, 130.5, 130.0, and 123.5 mM, respectively. Conclusions: The local feedstuff-based ration contributed to beef cattle production.

                Background The consensus in scientific literature is that each child undergoes a unique linguistic development path, albeit with shared developmental stages. Some children excel or lag behind their peers in language skills. Consequently, a key challenge in language acquisition research is pinpointing factors influencing individual differences in language development. Methods We observed children longitudinally from 3 to 24 months of life to explore early predictors of vocabulary size. Based on the productive vocabulary size of children at 24 months, 30 children met our sample selection criteria: 10 late talkers and 10 early talkers, and we compared them with 10 typical talkers. We evaluated interactive behaviors at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, considering vocal production, gaze at mother’s face, and gestural production during mother-child interactions, and we considered mothers’ report of children’s actions and gestures and receptive-vocabulary size at 15 and 18 months. Results Results indicated early precursors of language outcome at 24 months identifiable as early as 3 months in vocal productions, 6 months for gaze at mother’s face and 12 months for gestural productions. Conclusions Our research highlights both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, identifying the early indicators of belonging to the group of late or early talkers underscores the significant role of this developmental period for future studies. On a practical note, our findings emphasize the crucial need for early investigations to identify predictors of vocabulary development before the typical age at which lexical delay is identified.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93481">Specific and comprehensive genetic targeting reveals brain-wide distribution and synaptic input patterns of GABAergic axo-axonic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Axo-axonic cells (AACs), also called chandelier cells (ChCs) in the cerebral cortex, are the most distinctive type of GABAergic interneurons described in the neocortex, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). AACs selectively innervate glutamatergic projection neurons (PNs) at their axon initial segment (AIS), thus may exert decisive control over PN spiking and regulate PN functional ensembles. However, the brain-wide distribution, synaptic connectivity, and circuit function of AACs remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of specific and reliable experimental tools. Here, we have established an intersectional genetic strategy that achieves specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs throughout the mouse brain based on their lineage (<i>Nkx2.1</i>) and molecular (<i>Unc5b</i>, <i>Pthlh</i>) markers. We discovered that AACs are deployed across essentially all the pallium-derived brain structures, including not only the dorsal pallium-derived neocortex and medial pallium-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lateral pallium-derived claustrum–insular complex, and the ventral pallium-derived extended amygdaloid complex and olfactory centers. AACs are also abundant in anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, and lateral septum. AACs show characteristic variations in density across neocortical areas and layers and across subregions of the hippocampal formation. Neocortical AACs comprise multiple laminar subtypes with distinct dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing from AACs across neocortical, hippocampal, and BLA regions reveal shared as well as distinct patterns of synaptic input. Specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs facilitates the study of their developmental genetic program and circuit function across brain structures, providing a ground truth platform for understanding the conservation and variation of a bona fide cell type across brain regions and species.

                Multicellular organisms are composed of specialized cell types with distinct proteomes. While recent advances in single-cell transcriptome analyses have revealed differential expression of mRNAs, cellular diversity in translational profiles remains underinvestigated. By performing RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in genetically defined cells in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain, we here revealed substantial post-transcriptional regulations that augment the cell-type distinctions at the level of protein expression. Specifically, we found that translational efficiency of proteins fundamental to neuronal functions, such as ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, was maintained low in glia, leading to their preferential translation in neurons. Notably, distribution of ribosome footprints on these mRNAs exhibited a remarkable bias toward the 5′ leaders in glia. Using transgenic reporter strains, we provide evidence that the small upstream open-reading frames in the 5’ leader confer selective translational suppression in glia. Overall, these findings underscore the profound impact of translational regulation in shaping the proteomics for cell-type distinction and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving cell-type diversity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92700">How adverse childhood experiences get under the skin: A systematic review, integration and methodological discussion on threat and reward learning mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are a major risk factor for the development of multiple psychopathological conditions, but the mechanisms underlying this link are poorly understood. Associative learning encompasses key mechanisms through which individuals learn to link important environmental inputs to emotional and behavioral responses. ACEs may impact the normative maturation of associative learning processes, resulting in their enduring maladaptive expression manifesting in psychopathology. In this review, we lay out a systematic and methodological overview and integration of the available evidence of the proposed association between ACEs and threat and reward learning processes. We summarize results from a systematic literature search (following PRISMA guidelines) which yielded a total of 81 articles (threat: n=38, reward: n=43). Across the threat and reward learning fields, behaviorally, we observed a converging pattern of aberrant learning in individuals with a history of ACEs, independent of other sample characteristics, specific ACE types, and outcome measures. Specifically, blunted threat learning was reflected in reduced discrimination between threat and safety cues, primarily driven by diminished responding to conditioned threat cues. Furthermore, attenuated reward learning manifested in reduced accuracy and learning rate in tasks involving acquisition of reward contingencies. Importantly, this pattern emerged despite substantial heterogeneity in ACE assessment and operationalization across both fields. We conclude that blunted threat and reward learning may represent a mechanistic route by which ACEs may become physiologically and neurobiologically embedded and ultimately confer greater risk for psychopathology. In closing, we discuss potentially fruitful future directions for the research field, including methodological and ACE assessment considerations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97114">Differential functions of the dorsal and intermediate regions of the hippocampus for optimal goal-directed navigation in VR space</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed navigation requires the hippocampus to process spatial information in a value-dependent manner, but its underlying mechanism needs to be better understood. Here, we investigated whether the dorsal (dHP) and intermediate (iHP) regions of the hippocampus differentially function in processing place and its associated value information. Rats were trained in a place-preference task involving reward zones with different values in a visually rich virtual reality environment where two-dimensional navigation was possible. Rats learned to use distal visual scenes effectively to navigate to the reward zone associated with a higher reward. Inactivation of both dHP and iHP with muscimol altered the efficiency and precision of wayfinding behavior, but iHP inactivation induced more severe damage, including impaired place preference. Our findings suggest that the iHP is more critical for value-dependent navigation toward higher-value goal locations.

">Redundancy protects processing speed in healthy individuals with accelerated brain aging</a></h4>

              
                Recent advancements in computational learning techniques have enabled the estimation of brain age (BA) from neuroimaging data. The difference between chronological age (CA) and BA, known as the BA gap, can potentially serve as a biomarker of brain health. Studies, however, have documented low correlations between BA gap and cognition in healthy aging. This suggests that protective mechanisms in the brain may help counter the effect of accelerated brain aging. Here, we investigated whether redundancy in brain networks may protect cognitive function in individuals with accelerated brain aging. First, we employed deep learning to estimate individual brain ages from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Next, we associated CA, BA, and BA gap, with cognitive measures and network topology derived from diffusion MRI and tractography. We found that CA and BA were both similarly related to cognitive measures and network topology, while BA gap did not show strong relationships in either domain. Despite observing no strong relationships between brain-age gap (BA gap) and demographic variables, cognitive measures, or topological features in healthy aging, individuals with accelerated aging (BA gap+) exhibited lower average degree and redundancy within the dorsal attention network compared to those with delayed aging (BA gap-). Furthermore, redundancy in the dorsal attention network was positively associated with processing speed in BA gap+ individuals. These results indicate a potential neuroprotective role of redundancy in structural brain networks for mitigating the impact of accelerated brain atrophy on cognitive performance in healthy aging.

">High fat diet induces differential age- and gender-dependent changes in neuronal function linked to redox stress.</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, is steadily increasing, posing significant challenges to global healthcare systems. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary habits, particularly consumption of high-fat diets specify which fats, may play a pivotal role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, several studies have shed light on the intricate communication between the gut and the brain, known as the gut-brain axis and its involvement in neurodegenerative processes. This study aims to assess the effects of a high-fat dietary intake on various aspects of neuronal function during aging and following gender separation to help understand the potential contributions of diet to neuronal function. To investigate the effects of a high-fat diet, Drosophila melanogaster was used and exposed to standard normal food diet (NF) and high-fat diet (HF). Adults were grouped at 10 and 45 days of age in male and female flies reared under the same conditions. Multiple assays were conducted, showing differential gender- and HF diet-induced oxidative stress levels as determined by malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements, enhanced caspase-3 expression and reduced climbing activity. Adult lifespan under both dietary conditions was unchanged but odour-associated learning ability was reduced in larvae reared in a HF diet. This is the first study to characterise effects of diet on neuronal phenotypes in an age- and gender-specific manner in a Drosophila model. Our findings suggest a HF diet induces differential forms of neuronal dysfunction with age and sex-specific outcomes, characterised by enhanced oxidative stress and cell death which impacts on neuronal and behavioural functions.

">ROLE OF FORELIMB MORPHOLOGY IN MUSCLE SENSORIMOTOR FUNCTIONS DURING LOCOMOTION IN THE CAT</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies established strong links between morphological characteristics of mammalian hindlimb muscles and their sensorimotor functions during locomotion. Less is known about the role of forelimb morphology in motor outputs and generation of sensory signals. Here, we measured morphological characteristics of 46 forelimb muscles from 6 cats. These characteristics included muscle attachments, physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), fascicle length, etc. We also recorded full-body mechanics and EMG activity of forelimb muscles during level overground and treadmill locomotion in 7 and 16 adult cats of either sex, respectively. We computed forelimb muscle forces along with force- and length-dependent sensory signals mapped onto corresponding cervical spinal segments. We found that patterns of computed muscle forces and afferent activities were strongly affected by the muscles moment arm, PCSA, and fascicle length. Morphology of the shoulder muscles suggests distinct roles of the forelimbs in lateral force production and movements. Patterns of length-dependent sensory activity of muscles with long fibers (brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis) closely matched patterns of overall forelimb length, whereas the activity pattern of biceps brachii matched forelimb orientation. We conclude that cat forelimb muscle morphology contributes substantially to locomotor function, particularly to control lateral stability and turning, rather than propulsion.

">Extracellular Vesicles from hiPSC-derived NSCs Protect Human Neurons against Abeta-42 Oligomers Induced Neurodegeneration, Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Tau Phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the buildup of amyloid-beta 42 (A-beta 42) in the brain, which leads to various adverse effects. Therefore, therapeutic interventions proficient in reducing A-beta 42-induced toxicity in AD are of great interest. One promising approach is to use extracellular vesicles from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hiPSC-NSC-EVs) because they carry multiple therapeutic miRNAs and proteins capable of protecting neurons against A-beta 42-induced pathological changes. Therefore, this in vitro study investigated the proficiency of hiPSC-NSC-EVs to protect human neurons derived from two distinct hiPSC lines from A-beta 42 oligomers (A-beta 42o)-induced neurodegeneration. Methods: We isolated hiPSC-NSC-EVs using chromatographic methods and characterized their size, ultrastructure, expression of EV-specific markers and proficiency in getting incorporated into mature human neurons. Next, mature human neurons differentiated from two different hiPSC lines were exposed to 1 micromolar A-beta 42o alone or with varying concentrations of hiPSC-NSC-EVs. The protective effects of hiPSC-NSC-EVs against A-beta 42o-induced neurodegeneration, increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and tau phosphorylation were ascertained using multiple measures and one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons post hoc tests. Results: Significant neurodegeneration was observed when human neurons were exposed to A-beta 42o alone. Notably, neurodegeneration was associated with elevated levels of oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs), increased expression of proapoptotic Bax and Bad genes and proteins, reduced expression of the antiapoptotic gene and protein Bcl-2, increased expression of genes encoding mitochondrial complex proteins, decreased expression of autophagy-related proteins Beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B, and increased phosphorylation of tau. However, the addition of an optimal dose of hiPSC-NSC-EVs (6 billion EVs) to human neuronal cultures exposed to A-beta 42o significantly reduced the extent of neurodegeneration, along with diminished levels of MDA and PCs, normalized expressions of Bax, Bad, and Bcl-2, and genes linked to mitochondrial complex proteins, and reduced tau phosphorylation. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that an optimal dose of hiPSC-NSC-EVs could significantly decrease the degeneration of human neurons induced by A-beta 42o. The results also support further research into the effectiveness of hiPSC-NSC-EVs in AD, particularly their proficiency in preserving neurons and slowing disease progression.

	<p>Speech-language therapy (SLT) is the most effective technique to improve language performance in persons with aphasia. However, residual language impairments remain even after intensive SLT. Recent studies suggest that combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with SLT may improve language performance in persons with aphasia. However, our understanding of how tDCS and SLT impact brain and behavioral relation in aphasia is poorly understood. We investigated the impact of tDCS and SLT on a behavioral measure of scripted conversation and on functional connectivity assessed with multiple methods, both resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs&amp;amp;ndash;fMRI) and resting-state electroencephalography (rs&amp;amp;ndash;EEG). An individual with aphasia received 15 sessions of 20-min cathodal tDCS to the right angular gyrus concurrent with 40 min of SLT. Performance during scripted conversation was measured three times at baseline, twice immediately post-treatment, and at 4- and 8-weeks post-treatment. rs&amp;amp;ndash;fMRI was measured pre-and post-3-weeks of treatment. rs&amp;amp;ndash;EEG was measured on treatment days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Results show that both communication performance and left hemisphere functional connectivity may improve after concurrent tDCS and SLT. Results are in line with aphasia models of language recovery that posit a beneficial role of left hemisphere perilesional areas in language recovery.</p>

	<p>The Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) hypothesis states that the visual percept is available to conscious awareness only if recurrent long-distance interactions among distributed brain regions activate neural circuitry extending from the posterior areas to prefrontal regions above a certain excitation threshold. To directly test this hypothesis, we trained 14 human participants to increase blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals with real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI)-based neurofeedback simultaneously in four specific regions of the occipital, temporal, insular and prefrontal parts of the brain. Specifically, we hypothesized that the up-regulation of the mean BOLD activity in the posterior&amp;amp;ndash;frontal brain regions lowers the perceptual threshold for visual stimuli, while down-regulation raises the threshold. Our results showed that participants could perform up-regulation (Wilcoxon test, session 1: p = 0.022; session 4: p = 0.041) of the posterior&amp;amp;ndash;frontal brain activity, but not down-regulation. Furthermore, the up-regulation training led to a significant reduction in the visual perceptual threshold, but no substantial change in perceptual threshold was observed after the down-regulation training. These findings show that the up-regulation of the posterior&amp;amp;ndash;frontal regions improves the perceptual discrimination of the stimuli. However, further questions as to whether the posterior&amp;amp;ndash;frontal regions can be down-regulated at all, and whether down-regulation raises the perceptual threshold, remain unanswered.</p>

                Introduction: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) encompasses several clinical manifestations, which are characterized by temporomandibular joint and masticatory muscle discomfort and dysfunction (TMJ). The best imaging technique for evaluating TMJ is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which makes it possible to see the anatomical and pathological characteristics of every joint component. In recent years, convolutional neural networks -based deep learning algorithms have been favoured because of their outstanding capability in recognizing objects in medical images. The objective of this study is to assess, compare and co-rrelate articular disc morphology by automated segmentation using deep learning on MRI images in skeletal Class II (vertical growth pattern) TMD cases as compared to skeletal Class II (horizontal growth pattern) TMD cases and Class I non-TMD cases Methods: Grading of skeletal Class II (vertical growth pattern) cases and skeletal Class II (horizontal growth pattern) cases based on severity of TMD will be carried out using diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders. Bilateral sagittal as well as coronal MRI images will be obtained. A convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder-decoder named U-Net will be used to segment the articular disc on MRI. Understanding the nature of variations between Class I and both types of Class IIs will help orthodontists to better predict the potential risk for the development of TMDs and accordingly take precautions while doing treatment in such cases. Moreover, it can be used to automate TMD diagnosis and other smart applications. Conclusions: This study will aid in identifying articular disc morphology on MRI. The deep learning algorithms with effective data augmentation may perform better in MRI readings than human clinicians when using the same data, which will be advantageous for TMD diagnosis.

                Background: The intensive care unit (ICU) is a busy and complex workplace, and several work-related and personal factors are known to make ICU nurses more vulnerable to moral distress than other healthcare professionals. It is crucial to identify these factors to guide future studies and preventive strategies. This scoping review explores such factors to present current knowledge on the factors that trigger moral distress and to guide future research by reviewing studies to explore and summarize factors that trigger moral distress in ICU nurses. Methods: The PubMed, EBSCO, and CINAHL Plus databases were searched to identify potentially relevant studies published between 2011 to 2022. Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed studies published in English that provided results regarding factors causes or correlated to moral distress in ICU nurses. After removing 618 duplicates, 316 papers were excluded after title and abstract screening, leaving 71 articles for full-text screening. A further 54 articles were excluded as their outcomes did not include factors that caused moral distress, or were not specific to ICU nurses, so 17 studies were eventually analysed using qualitative content analysis through an inductive approach. The findings of the articles were extracted and coded independently by two authors, and data were grouped and categorized. Results: The content categories of factors contributing to ICU nurses' moral distress were organized into themes and subthemes. Four major themes were identified: Powerlessness, end-of-life care, ineffective teamwork, and personal characteristics of ICU nurses. Conclusions: This review highlights the factors that contribute to moral distress in critical care nurses, which are mainly attributable to the organizational climate and the nature of the ICU clinical environment. Descriptive and intervention studies (experimental or action research) must investigate causality between identified variables to inform management strategies to improve support for ICU nurses’ coping relative to moral distress.

                Background: First line (1L) TP-Ex-like regimen followed by 2nd-line (2L) immunotherapy represents one of the standards of care in platinum-sensitive recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (R/M SCCHN). We report our experience from 2 tertiary care institutions of India. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients of platinum-sensitive R/M SCCHN treated with 1L weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab (PCC) regimen followed by cetuximab maintenance (if non-progressive) or 2L nivolumab or oral metronomic chemotherapy (OMCT) on progression. Overall response rates (ORR), progression-free survival after 1L and 2L (PFS-1 & PFS-2), overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated. Results: The study included 54 patients; median age 56.5 years; 89% men; 11% had cardiac dysfunction; 13% had renal dysfunction. After 1L PCC, ORR was 59.3%; median PFS-1 was 7.031 months; 61% had progression; 35% were treated with nivolumab and 18% with OMCT. The ORR was 26.3% (nivolumab) and 10% (OMCT). Median PFS-2 was 6.5 months (nivolumab) and 2 months (OMCT). The median OS was 15.01 months (entire cohort), 20.6 months (nivolumab), and 7 months (OMCT). Grade III/IV adverse events on PCC included neutropenia (31.4%), anaemia (35.1%), thrombocytopenia (7.4%), febrile neutropenia (11.1%), and skin reaction (16.6%); no Grade-III/IV treatment-related toxicities on 2L. Conclusions: 1L weekly PCC is an effective regimen for palliative therapy of platinum- sensitive R/MSCCHN with an acceptable toxicity profile. The addition of 2L nivolumab on progression further improves the outcomes.

                Abstract* Background Gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, have grim prognoses, necessitating early diagnostic and prognostic indicators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), influential in cancer research, show potential as glioma biomarkers. This systematic review aimed to examine the efficacy of miRNAs in the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies published from 2013 to 2023. The eligibility criteria included high-grade glioma, histopathological confirmation, miRNA samples from cerebrospinal fluid or plasma, and relevant outcome data. Studies were excluded if they were experimental or reviews and not in English. Results Of the 1120 initial results, 8 studies involving 660 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Several studies have assessed miRNA expression and its association with diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade gliomas. Overexpression of miR-221, miR-222, miR-210, miR-21, miR-125b, and miR-223 and under-expression of miR-15b and miR-124-3p showed significant potential in differentiating high-grade glioma patients from controls. Additionally, miRNAs are associated with distinct tumorigenic pathways. Conclusion Elevated or depressed expression levels of specific circulating miRNAs hold significant promise as noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. These miRNAs offer valuable insights into disease progression and patient outcome. Further validation through extensive clinical trials and in-depth mechanistic studies is essential to realize their full clinical utility.

Chromatin is a polymer complex of DNA and proteins that regulates gene expression. The three-dimensional (3D) structure and organization of chromatin controls DNA transcription and replication. High-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques generate Hi-C maps that can provide insight into the 3D structure of chromatin. Hi-C maps can be represented as a symmetric matrix A i j, where each element represents the average contact probability or number of contacts between chromatin loci <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. Previous studies have detected topologically associating domains (TADs), or self-interacting regions in A i j within which the contact probability is greater than that outside the region. Many algorithms have been developed to identify TADs within Hi-C maps. However, most TAD identification algorithms are unable to identify nested or overlapping TADs and for a given Hi-C map there is significant variation in the location and number of TADs identified by different methods. We develop a novel method to identify TADs, KerTAD, using a kernel-based technique from computer vision and image processing that is able to accurately identify nested and overlapping TADs. We benchmark this method against state-of-the-art TAD identification methods on both synthetic and experimental data sets. We find that the new method consistently has higher true positive rates (TPR) and lower false discovery rates (FDR) than all tested methods for both synthetic and manually annotated experimental Hi-C maps. The TPR for KerTAD is also largely insensitive to increasing noise and sparsity, in contrast to the other methods. We also find that KerTAD is consistent in the number and size of TADs identified across replicate experimental Hi-C maps for several organisms. Thus, KerTAD will improve automated TAD identification and enable researchers to better correlate changes in TADs to biological phenomena, such as enhancer-promoter interactions and disease states.

                <p>by Samuel E. Hoff, F. Emil Thomasen, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Massimiliano Bonomi</p>

Converting cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data into high-quality structural models is a challenging problem of outstanding importance. Current refinement methods often generate unbalanced models in which physico-chemical quality is sacrificed for excellent fit to the data. Furthermore, these techniques struggle to represent the conformational heterogeneity averaged out in low-resolution regions of density maps. Here we introduce EMMIVox, a Bayesian inference approach to determine single-structure models as well as structural ensembles from cryo-EM maps. EMMIVox automatically balances experimental information with accurate physico-chemical models of the system and the surrounding environment, including waters, lipids, and ions. Explicit treatment of data correlation and noise as well as inference of accurate B-factors enable determination of structural models and ensembles with both excellent fit to the data and high stereochemical quality, thus outperforming state-of-the-art refinement techniques. EMMIVox represents a flexible approach to determine high-quality structural models that will contribute to advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions.

The abundance of distractors in the world poses a major challenge to our brain’s limited processing capacity, but little is known about how selective attention modulates stimulus representations in the brain to reduce interference and support durable target memory. Here, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a selective attention task in which target and distractor pictures of different visual categories were simultaneously presented. Participants were asked to selectively process the target according to the effective cue, either before the encoding period (i.e., perceptual attention) or the maintenance period (i.e., reflective attention). On the next day, participants were asked to perform a memory recognition task in the scanner in which the targets, distractors, and novel items were presented in a pseudorandom order. Behavioral results showed that perceptual attention was better at enhancing target memory and reducing distractor memory than reflective attention, although the overall memory capacity (memory for both target and distractor) was comparable. Using multiple-voxel pattern analysis of the neural data, we found more robust target representation and weaker distractor representation in working memory for perceptual attention than for reflective attention. Interestingly, perceptual attention partially shifted the regions involved in maintaining the target representation from the visual cortex to the parietal cortex. Furthermore, the targets and distractors simultaneously presented in the perceptual attention condition showed reduced pattern similarity in the parietal cortex during retrieval compared to items not presented together. This neural pattern repulsion positively correlated with individuals’ recognition of both targets and distractors. These results emphasize the critical role of selective attention in transforming memory representations to reduce interference and improve long-term memory performance.

                <p>by Aude Bernheim, Jean Cury, Enzo Z. Poirier</p>

Immune defence mechanisms exist across the tree of life in such diversity that prokaryotic antiviral responses have historically been considered unrelated to eukaryotic immunity. Mechanisms of defence in divergent eukaryotes were similarly believed to be largely clade specific. However, recent data indicate that a subset of modules (domains and proteins) from prokaryote defence systems are conserved in eukaryotes and populate many stages of innate immune pathways. In this Essay, we propose the notion of ancestral immunity, which corresponds to the set of immune modules conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. After offering a typology of ancestral immunity, we speculate on the selective pressures that could have led to the differential conservation of specific immune modules across domains of life. The exploration of ancestral immunity is in its infancy and appears full of promises to illuminate immune evolution, and also to identify and decipher immune mechanisms of economic, ecological, and therapeutic importance.

                <p>by Zhong Ding, Chunsheng Zhang, Huicui Yang, Jiaojiao Chen, Zhiruo Sun, Xuechu Zhen</p>

Heterologous sensitization of adenylyl cyclase (AC) results in elevated cAMP signaling transduction that contributes to drug dependence. Inhibiting cullin3-RING ligases by blocking the neddylation of cullin3 abolishes heterologous sensitization, however, the modulating mechanism remains uncharted. Here, we report an essential role of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) protein 2, 5, and 17, especially the dominant isoform KCTD5 in regulating heterologous sensitization of AC1 and morphine dependence via working with cullin3 and the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. In cellular models, we observed enhanced association of KCTD5 with Gβ and cullin3, along with elevated dissociation of Gβ from AC1 as well as of CAND1 from cullin3 in heterologous sensitization of AC1. Given binding of CAND1 inhibits the neddylation of cullin3, we further elucidated that the enhanced interaction of KCTD5 with both Gβ and cullin3 promoted the dissociation of CAND1 from cullin3, attenuated the inhibitory effect of CAND1 on cullin3 neddylation, ultimately resulted in heterologous sensitization of AC1. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays an important role in mediating morphine dependence. Through pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we then demonstrated that KCTD5/cullin3 regulates morphine dependence via modulating heterologous sensitization of AC, likely AC1 in PVT in mice. In summary, the present study revealed the underlying mechanism of heterologous sensitization of AC1 mediated by cullin3 and discovered the role of KCTD proteins in regulating morphine dependence in mice.

Mutagenesis is responsive to many environmental factors. Evolution therefore depends on the environment not only for selection but also in determining the variation available in a population. One such environmental dependency is the inverse relationship between mutation rates and population density in many microbial species. Here, we determine the mechanism responsible for this mutation rate plasticity. Using dynamical computational modelling and in culture mutation rate estimation, we show that the negative relationship between mutation rate and population density arises from the collective ability of microbial populations to control concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. We demonstrate a loss of this density-associated mutation rate plasticity (DAMP) when <i>Escherichia coli</i> populations are deficient in the degradation of hydrogen peroxide. We further show that the reduction in mutation rate in denser populations is restored in peroxide degradation-deficient cells by the presence of wild-type cells in a mixed population. Together, these model-guided experiments provide a mechanistic explanation for DAMP, applicable across all domains of life, and frames mutation rate as a dynamic trait shaped by microbial community composition.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated entorhinal cortex (EC) tau in low beta-amyloid individuals can predict accumulation of pathology and cognitive decline. We compared the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived locus coeruleus integrity, neocortical beta-amyloid burden by positron emission tomography (PET), and hippocampal volume in identifying elevated entorhinal tau signal in asymptomatic individuals who are considered beta-amyloid PET-negative.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 188 asymptomatic individuals (70.78 ± 11.51 years, 58% female) who underwent 3T-MRI of the locus coeruleus, Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), and Flortaucipir (FTP) PET. Associations between elevated EC tau and neocortical PiB, hippocampal volume, or locus coeruleus integrity were evaluated and compared using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses in the PiB− sample with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. Associations with clinical progression (CDR-sum-of-boxes) over a time span of 6 years were evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 26 (21%) individuals with high EC FTP in the CDR = 0/PiB− sample. Locus coeruleus integrity was a significantly more sensitive and specific predictor of elevated EC FTP (area under the curve [AUC] = 85%) compared with PiB (AUC = 77%) or hippocampal volume (AUC = 76%). Based on the Youden-index, locus coeruleus integrity obtained a sensitivity of 77% and 85% specificity. Using the resulting locus coeruleus Youden cut-off, lower locus coeruleus integrity was associated with a two-fold increase in clinical progression, including mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Locus coeruleus integrity has promise as a low-cost, non-invasive screening instrument to detect early cortical tau deposition and associated clinical progression in asymptomatic, low beta-amyloid individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25368?af=R">A systematic review of MRI studies on the effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain structure and function</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Maternal obesity before or during pregnancy has been associated previously in offspring with a wide range of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and mental health problems. The effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain structure and function that may be responsible for these poor outcomes are not well understood. We, therefore, undertook a systematic review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that have assessed the associations of maternal obesity with brain measures in offspring. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycINFO on August 20, 2023. Of 15 eligible studies, seven employed functional MRI (fMRI), five diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and four anatomical MRI (one used both DTI and anatomical MRI) in the offspring. The ages of offspring varied widely: one was a study of fetuses in utero, five of neonates, one of infants, five of school-aged children, two of both neonates and infants, and one of both children and adults. Collectively, 12 studies reported significant associations of maternal obesity with structural or functional alterations of the offspring's brain, most frequently in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. In conclusion, maternal obesity appears to have a profound influence on offspring brain development, particularly within the prefrontal and limbic networks that regulate emotion and behavior. Further studies are needed to identify how changes in brain structure and function mediate the effects of maternal obesity on long-term emotional and behavioral outcomes, as well as the molecular pathways through which maternal obesity alters offspring brain development.</p>

                Logistic classification describes human and animal choices based on factors such as expected value, sensory inputs of multiple modalities, prior probabilities, overall motivation, recent actions, and brain manipulations. It bridges two established models: signal detection theory and drift diffusion. The brain uses it widely, even when it is not optimal.

                Eisen and Kozachkov et al. develop a method to measure changes in neural stability. They find evidence that an anesthetic causes unconsciousness by destabilizing neural activity. It makes activity more susceptible to perturbation. This is due to excess inhibition in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95191">Emerging role of oncogenic ß-catenin in exosome biogenesis as a driver of immune escape in hepatocellular carcinoma</a></h4>

              
                Immune checkpoint inhibitors have produced encouraging results in cancer patients. However, the majority of ß-catenin-mutated tumors have been described as lacking immune infiltrates and resistant to immunotherapy. The mechanisms by which oncogenic ß-catenin affects immune surveillance remain unclear. Herein, we highlighted the involvement of ß-catenin in the regulation of the exosomal pathway and, by extension, in immune/cancer cell communication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We showed that mutated ß-catenin represses expression of <i>SDC4</i> and <i>RAB27A</i>, two main actors in exosome biogenesis, in both liver cancer cell lines and HCC patient samples. Using nanoparticle tracking analysis and live-cell imaging, we further demonstrated that activated ß-catenin represses exosome release. Then, we demonstrated in 3D spheroid models that activation of β-catenin promotes a decrease in immune cell infiltration through a defect in exosome secretion. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that oncogenic ß-catenin plays a key role in exosome biogenesis. Our study gives new insight into the impact of ß-catenin mutations on tumor microenvironment remodeling, which could lead to the development of new strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88838">Emotional vocalizations alter behaviors and neurochemical release into the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain center of emotional expression, contributes to acoustic communication by first interpreting the meaning of social sounds in the context of the listener’s internal state, then organizing the appropriate behavioral responses. We propose that modulatory neurochemicals such as acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations. We tested this in a vocal playback experiment utilizing highly affective vocal sequences associated with either mating or restraint, then sampled and analyzed fluids within the BLA for a broad range of neurochemicals and observed behavioral responses of adult male and female mice. In male mice, playback of restraint vocalizations increased ACh release and usually decreased DA release, while playback of mating sequences evoked the opposite neurochemical release patterns. In non-estrus female mice, patterns of ACh and DA release with mating playback were similar to males. Estrus females, however, showed increased ACh, associated with vigilance, as well as increased DA, associated with reward-seeking. Experimental groups that showed increased ACh release also showed the largest increases in an aversive behavior. These neurochemical release patterns and several behavioral responses depended on a single prior experience with the mating and restraint behaviors. Our results support a model in which ACh and DA provide contextual information to sound analyzing BLA neurons that modulate their output to downstream brain regions controlling behavioral responses to social vocalizations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89656">Enrichment of rare codons at 5' ends of genes is a spandrel caused by evolutionary sequence turnover and does not improve translation</a></h4>

              
                Previously, Tuller et al. found that the first 30–50 codons of the genes of yeast and other eukaryotes are slightly enriched for rare codons. They argued that this slowed translation, and was adaptive because it queued ribosomes to prevent collisions. Today, the translational speeds of different codons are known, and indeed rare codons are translated slowly. We re-examined this 5’ slow translation ‘ramp.’ We confirm that 5’ regions are slightly enriched for rare codons; in addition, they are depleted for downstream Start codons (which are fast), with both effects contributing to slow 5’ translation. However, we also find that the 5’ (and 3’) ends of yeast genes are poorly conserved in evolution, suggesting that they are unstable and turnover relatively rapidly. When a new 5’ end forms de novo, it is likely to include codons that would otherwise be rare. Because evolution has had a relatively short time to select against these codons, 5’ ends are typically slightly enriched for rare, slow codons. Opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al., we show by direct experiment that genes with slowly translated codons at the 5’ end are expressed relatively poorly, and that substituting faster synonymous codons improves expression. Direct experiment shows that slow codons do not prevent downstream ribosome collisions. Further informatic studies suggest that for natural genes, slow 5’ ends are correlated with poor gene expression, opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al. Thus, we conclude that slow 5’ translation is a ‘spandrel’--a non-adaptive consequence of something else, in this case, the turnover of 5’ ends in evolution, and it does not improve translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93204">Glutamate neurotransmission from leptin receptor cells is required for typical puberty and reproductive function in female mice</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamic ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) is a glutamatergic nucleus essential for the metabolic control of reproduction. However, conditional deletion of leptin receptor long form (LepRb) in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) expressing neurons results in virtually no reproductive deficits. In this study, we determined the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission from leptin responsive PMv neurons on puberty and fertility. We first assessed if stimulation of PMv neurons induces luteinizing hormone (LH) release in fed adult females. We used the stimulatory form of designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in <i>Lepr<sup>Cre</sup></i> (LepRb-Cre) mice. We collected blood sequentially before and for 1 hr after intravenous clozapine-<i>N</i>-oxide injection. LH level increased in animals correctly targeted to the PMv, and LH level was correlated to the number of Fos immunoreactive neurons in the PMv. Next, females with deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2) in LepRb neurons (<i>Lepr</i><sup>ΔVGlut2</sup>) showed delayed age of puberty, disrupted estrous cycles, increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) concentration in the axon terminals, and disrupted LH secretion, suggesting impaired GnRH release. To assess if glutamate is required for PMv actions in pubertal development, we generated a Cre-induced reexpression of endogenous LepRb (<i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i>) with concomitant deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2<i><sup>flox</sup></i>) mice. Rescue of <i>Lepr</i> and deletion of <i>Slc17a6</i> in the PMv was obtained by stereotaxic injection of an adeno-associated virus vector expressing Cre recombinase. Control <i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i> mice with PMv LepRb rescue showed vaginal opening, follicle maturation, and became pregnant, while <i>Lepr<sup>loxTB</sup></i>;Vglut2<i><sup>flox</sup></i> mice showed no pubertal development. Our results indicate that glutamatergic neurotransmission from leptin sensitive neurons regulates the reproductive axis, and that leptin action on pubertal development via PMv neurons requires Vglut2.

	<p>The issue of literacy challenges among dyslexic adults remains a significant concern. This study investigates spelling deficits among highly educated adults with dyslexia learning a transparent orthography. Thirty-eight Italian dyslexic university students were examined and compared to a group of age- and education-matched typical readers. Firstly, we analyzed spelling performance using a Passage Dictation Test. Additionally, lists of words varying in length and word frequency were dictated under two experimental conditions: a normal condition (NC) and an articulatory suppression condition (ASC). The ASC assessed the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to spell with interference to the phonological (sublexical) spelling procedure, i.e., the most likely compensated spelling strategy of Italian dyslexic spellers. The results clearly indicated that, in spelling the meaningful passage, dyslexic participants underperformed compared to the controls, with a prevalence of lexical errors, despite the comparison with the normative reference data showing only mild spelling difficulties. In spelling isolated words in normal conditions, dyslexic participants performed within the reference norms and as accurately as control participants across all stimuli (short words, high- and low-frequency words), except for long words, where their spelling difficulties were evident. Articulatory suppression significantly impaired dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; performance on short stimuli, reducing the usual sublexical advantage associated with them, and exacerbated misspellings on long words. Additionally, articulatory suppression disproportionately affected dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; performance on high-frequency words, diminishing the typical lexical advantage associated with these words. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical, clinical, and educational implications.</p>

According to transactional theory, individuals have undergone an adaptation process influenced by cognitive control abilities. Emotional responses to COVID-19-related stimuli may interfere with top-down attentional processes, thereby hindering adaptation. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related stimuli on attentional processing and to determine whether psychological factors could modulate these effects. A sample of 96 healthy undergraduate students participated in an emotional Stroop task in which they were presented with a series of stimuli, including both neutral and negative COVID-19-related as well as non-COVID-19 stimuli. COVID-19-related PTSD, as an index of distress (PTSS), and trait anxiety were evaluated. Results showed that participants were more accurate in identifying COVID-19-related stimuli compared to non-COVID-19 stimuli. Being female and having higher retrospective PTSS scores related to COVID-19 were predictive of faster reaction times for both neutral and negative COVID-19-related stimuli. This heightened attentional bias toward COVID-19-related stimuli suggests that individuals may be more sensitive to stimuli associated with the pandemic. The results suggest that the association between COVID-19 stimuli and attentional biases extends beyond emotional valence, being retrospectively influenced by mental health, suggesting potential pathways to future mental health challenges.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is associated with changes in white matter (WM) integrity and with reduced life expectancy, in part because of the cardiometabolic side effects of antipsychotics. Physical activity (PA) has emerged as a candidate lifestyle intervention that is safe and effective. The study aimed to assess how an adapted PA program delivered remotely by web (e-APA) improved WM integrity in patients with schizophrenia (SZPs) and healthy controls (HCs) and to evaluate associations among WM integrity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and symptom severity. This longitudinal study was conducted over 16 weeks with 31 participants (18 SZPs and 13 HCs). Diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics were employed to assess WM integrity. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), and assessments for clinical symptoms included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Self-evaluation of Negative Symptoms and the Brief Negative Syndrome Scale (BNSS). Only the SZPs had significantly increased WM integrity after the e-APA program, with increased fractional anisotropy and decreased radial diffusivity in fasciculi involved in motor functions and language process. Furthermore, decreased negative symptoms assessed with BNSS were associated with greater WM integrity following the program. These findings suggest that e-APA may improve WM integrity abnormalities and support e-APA as a promising therapeutic strategy.</p>

	<p>Background: Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) improved communicative skills in adults with post-stroke aphasia demonstrating the effectiveness in speech disorders and consequent improvement of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; communication skills. This study aimed to report the efficacy of AAC in the rehabilitation of cognitive disorders and to estimate how the changes in cognitive and communicative functions could enhance the quality of life in patients affected by severe acquired brain injury. Methods: Three patients with pontine cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and meningioma expressed in the posterior cranial fossa, respectively, were submitted to rehabilitative training with AAC for 6 months. Patients underwent to neuropsychological and mood evaluations at the beginning of AAC treatment (T0) and after rehabilitative training (T1). Results: The results support the efficacy of AAC in the improvement of cognitive functions, particularly in memory, attention, and language domains. In addition, we described also an improvement in the quality of life and a decrease in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The AAC seems to be an important rehabilitative technique for the recovery of cognitive functions with a consequent effect in improvement of psychological aspects and quality of life in patients with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).</p>

	<p>Sexual dimorphism in temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and their comorbidity with migraine are important phenomena observed in clinics. TMDs are the most prevalent orofacial pain conditions with jaw joint and masseter muscle dysfunction. Migraine is the predominant headache commonly associated with TMDs. Women much more often suffer from this orofacial pain than men. However, currently, there is no gender-specific therapy for such pain conditions. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms behind sex differences in TMDs as well as their comorbidity with migraines is essential for developing novel approaches for gender-specific treatment of TMDs and related orofacial pain comorbidity. In this review, we summarize recent research progress regarding sex differences in TMDs, focusing on the underlying mechanisms including craniofacial anatomy, hormonal regulation, and roles of opioids, transient receptor potential channels, and endocannabinoid systems. We also discuss the mechanisms of comorbid TMDs and migraine. The information covered in this review will provide mechanistic insights into sex differences in TMDs and their comorbidity with migraine, which could aid in developing effective treatment strategies for the overlapping orofacial pain condition.</p>

	<p>Lack of sleep has been found to be associated with cognitive impairment in children, yet the neural mechanism underlying this relationship remains poorly understood. To address this issue, this study utilized the data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n = 4930, aged 9&amp;amp;ndash;10), involving their sleep assessments, cognitive measures, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional n-back task. Using partial correlations analysis, we found that the out-of-scanner cognitive performance was positively correlated with sleep duration. Additionally, the activation of regions of interest (ROIs) in frontal and parietal cortices for the 2-back versus 0-back contrast was positively correlated with both sleep duration and cognitive performance. Mediation analysis revealed that this activation significantly mediated the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive function at both individual ROI level and network level. After performing analyses separately for different sexes, it was revealed that the mediation effect of the task-related activation was present in girls (n = 2546). These findings suggest that short sleep duration may lead to deficit in cognitive function of children, particularly in girls, through the modulation of frontoparietal activation during working memory load.</p>

	<p>This study determines the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test to detect perceptual abnormalities and whether there are differences between gender. Vision is a complex process involving visual perception. Any alterations can affect learning, so having a screening test in Spanish that is easy to use and reliable for timely diagnosis will reduce the percentage of visuo-perceptual interference during learning process. A total of 200 subjects participated, aged between 8 and 15 years old, with good visual acuity, and no strabismus, amblyopia, ocular pathology, or neurological damage. The Petrosyan questionnaire (screening test) was employed to identify symptoms associated with perceptual impairment, and a subsequent assessment was conducted to evaluate perceptual abilities. The mean age was 11.5 years (57% male; 44% female). The screening test indicated that 30% of the subjects were suspected of having perceptual alteration, while 24% were diagnosed with a real alteration in perceptual abilities. The sensitivity was 1 and the specificity was 0.92. The Spanish version of the Petrosyan questionnaire has high sensitivity and specificity values and is therefore considered very accurate for identifying the need for a perceptual assessment. There are statistically significant differences in perceptual abilities according to gender. The female group shows more symptomatology and a higher percentage of alteration in perceptual skills.</p>

	<p>This study aims to assess oculomotor and vestibular endurance by utilizing the Oculomotor and Vestibular Endurance Screening (MoVES) assessment in athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; pre-season and post-season and after a suspected head injury to detect impairment. Athletes (N = 311, 19.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years) were recruited to perform the following seven tasks: (1) horizontal saccades, (2) vertical saccades, (3) vergence jumps, (4) horizontal vestibular-oculomotor reflex (VOR), (5) vertical VOR, (6) amplitude of accommodation (AoA), and (7) near point of convergence (NPC). At pre-season, the observed number of eye movements in 60 s are horizontal saccades (74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13 initial 30 s; 67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 latter 30 s), vertical saccades (70 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13; 66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10), vergence jumps (48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12; 45 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13), horizontal VOR (38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11; 38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11), and vertical VOR (8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11; 38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11). These results establish a normative database for eye movements within the MoVES assessment and show consistency in the number of movements from pre-season to post-season. The initial results show a trending decrease in the number of eye movements in the initial days post-head injury, which improves to pre-season measures 14&amp;amp;ndash;21 days post-injury. This foundation can be used by future studies to explore the extent of binocular and vestibular endurance dysfunctions caused by head injuries that subside within two weeks.</p>

<p>Ventral subiculum is shown to be involved in learning and memory and mediate affective behaviors. The present study demonstrated the critical role of ventral subiculum in maintaining arousal and sleep, as its lesion caused a profound disturbance of sleep–wake behaviors. Exposure to SPR reversed the VSL-induced alterations in sleep–wakefulness behavior.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ventral subiculum regulates emotion, stress responses, and spatial and social cognition. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated anxiety- and depression-like symptoms, deficits in spatial and social cognition in ventral subicular lesioned (VSL) rats, and restoration of affective and cognitive behaviors following photoperiod manipulation (short photoperiod regime, SPR; 6:18 LD cycle). In the present study, we have studied the impact of VSL on sleep–wake behavioral patterns and the effect of SPR on sleep–wakefulness behavior. Adult male Wistar rats subjected to VSL demonstrated decreased wake duration and enhanced total sleep time due to increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Power spectral analysis indicated increased delta activity during NREMS and decreased sigma band power during all vigilance states. Light is one of the strongest entrainers of the circadian rhythm, and its manipulation may have various physiological and functional consequences. We investigated the effect of 21-day exposure to SPR on sleep–wakefulness (S–W) behavior in VSL rats. We observed that SPR exposure restored S–W behavior in VSL rats, resulting in an increase in wake duration and a significant increase in theta power during wake and REMS. This study highlights the crucial role of the ventral subiculum in maintaining normal sleep–wakefulness patterns and highlights the effectiveness of photoperiod manipulation as a non-pharmacological treatment for reversing sleep disturbances reported in mood and neuropsychiatric disorders like Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, which also involve alterations in circadian rhythm.</p>

	<p>Several therapies have been developed to reduce cognitive decline associated with aging. Aquatic exercises, which are widely used to enhance functional capacity, may play a role in stimulating cognitive functions. This study investigated the effects of a 3-month aquatic exercise program on cognitive functions in community-dwelling older adults. In this prospective, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, 31 participants were allocated to either the experimental (aquatic exercises) or control (no-exercise) group. The intervention program consisted of exercises conducted twice a week in a 1.2 m deep indoor pool. The main outcome measures were cognitive functions, assessed using Raven&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progressive Matrices test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess the impact of the exercise program. The effect sizes (&amp;amp;eta;2p) were reported when a level of significance was achieved (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, the participants who underwent aquatic exercises showed positive outcomes in Raven&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progressive Matrices test (p = 0.046; &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.131) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.589). Complementary analyses of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test indicated that the benefits of the aquatic exercise were observed in terms of the number of trials (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.478), number of errors (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.458), and number of non-perseverative errors (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.302). The results indicate that a period of three months of aquatic exercise was beneficial for stimulating specific aspects of the cognitive function of community-dwelling older individuals. Aquatic exercise should be prescribed to this population.</p>

	<p>In the pediatric population, epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that often results in cognitive dysfunction. It affects patients&amp;amp;rsquo; life quality by limiting academic performance and self-esteem and increasing social rejection. There are several interventions for the neurohabilitation of cognitive impairment, including LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy (LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T), which promotes neuronal connectivity and cortical plasticity through the use of assembly sets and robotic programming. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T on cognitive processes in pediatric patients with epilepsy. Eligible patients were identified; in the treatment group, an initial evaluation was performed with the NEUROPSI and BANFE-2 neuropsychological tests. Then, the interventions were performed once a week, and a final test was performed. In the control group, after the initial evaluation, the final evaluation was performed. An overall improvement was observed in the LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T patients, with a significant increase in BANFE-2 scores in the orbitomedial, anterior prefrontal, and dorsolateral areas. In addition, in the gain score analysis, the orbitomedial and memory scores were significantly different from the control group. LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T neurohabilitation is a remarkable option for epilepsy patients, who are motivated when they observe improvements.</p>

	<p>Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) display many cognitive and physiological alterations resulting from renal failure and physical inactivity. Caffeine intake has been reported to improve cognitive/physical performance in several studies. However, whether the benefits of caffeine intake apply to patients with ESRD remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of caffeine intake on postural balance, cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD. In a randomized order, 12 patients with ESRD (age: 33.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.57 years; Female: 45.5%) performed a battery of tests after either caffeine (CF) (400 mg) or placebo (PLA) ingestion. Postural balance was evaluated using a stabilometric platform. Functional capacity was assessed with the sit-to-stand and up-and-go tests, and for cognitive performances, reaction time test and a vigilance test were used. Results showed a significant improvement in up-and-go test (p = 0.01) and sit-to-stand test performances with CF compared to PLA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Time of reaction test and vigilance test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) performances were significantly higher with CF. No significant difference was observed in postural balance between CF and PLA. The results of this study suggest that acute caffeine ingestion positively enhances cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD.</p>

                Abstract* Background The level of liver fibrosis is the basis for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and it is necessary to adapt non-invasive liver fibrosis modalities. We aimed to investigate the use of M2BPGi as a single or combined diagnostic modality for liver fibrosis in CHB patients through a stepwise diagnostic analysis. Methods Cross-sectional data were taken from patients between October 2021 and August 2022. Demographic data, blood profile, liver function, and liver stiffness were measured in CHB patients over 18 years old, willing to take part in the research, and had complete data. APRI, FIB-4, and AAR were calculated using the well-known formulas. Serum M2BPGi-levels were converted into a cut-off index (COI). The patients were divided into low-risk (LR) and high-risk fibrosis (HR) groups. A cut-off for each predictor variable to differentiate between the LR and HR groups was determined. The obtained cut-off was assessed for its association with the grouping of liver elastography results. Models to diagnose the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥8 kPa were created and compared through multivariate and ROC analyses. Results The number of patients that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria was 143 (HR = 65, LR = 78). The cut-off for diagnosing LSM ≥8kPa was 0.311, 0.742, 0.635, and 1.434 for APRI, FIB-4, AAR, and M2BPGi, respectively. This cut-off was significantly associated with the results of the HR and LR groupings. A multivariate analysis found that FIB4, AAR, and M2BPGi added significantly to the model. Statistically, the most optimal use of M2BPGi was combined with FIB-4, with an AUC of 0.835. Conclusions The optimal cut-off of M2BPGi for diagnosing high-risk liver fibrosis in this study was 1.434. M2BPGi should be used with FIB-4 as a diagnostic tool for diagnosing liver fibrosis, especially in the absence of a liver biopsy or elastography.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health threat. Understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions within TB granulomas will assist in identifying what leads to the successful elimination of infection. <i>In vitro</i> TB models provide a controllable environment to study these granuloma dynamics. Previously we developed a biomimetic 3D spheroid granuloma model that controls bacteria better than a traditional monolayer culture counterpart. We used agent-based simulations to predict the mechanistic reason for this difference. Our calibrated simulations were able to predict heterogeneous bacterial dynamics that are consistent with experimental data. In one group of simulations, spheroids are found to have higher macrophage activation than their traditional counterparts, leading to better bacterial control. This higher macrophage activation in the spheroids was not due to higher counts of activated T cells, instead fewer activated T cells were able to activate more macrophages due to the proximity of these cells to each other within the spheroid. In a second group of simulations, spheroids again have more macrophage activation but also more T cell activation, specifically CD8+ T cells. This higher level of CD8+ T cell activation is predicted to be due to the proximity of these cells to the cells that activate them. Multiple mechanisms of control were predicted. Simulations removing individual mechanisms show that one group of simulations has a CD4+ T cell dominant response, while the other has a mixed/CD8+ T cell dominant response. Lastly, we demonstrated that in spheroids the initial structure and movement rules work synergistically to reduce bacterial load. These findings provide valuable insights into how the structural complexity of <i>in vitro</i> models impacts immune responses. Moreover, our study has implications for engineering more physiologically relevant <i>in vitro</i> models and advancing our understanding of TB pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.

                <p>by Elias Rosenblatt, Jonathan D. Cook, Graziella V. DiRenzo, Evan H. Campbell Grant, Fernando Arce, Kim M. Pepin, F. Javiera Rudolph, Michael C. Runge, Susan Shriner, Daniel P. Walsh, Brittany A. Mosher</p>

Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.
