     alt="Emotional recognition across the adult lifespan: Effects of age, sex, cognitive empathy, alexithymia traits, and amygdala subnuclei volumes"/>
<p>This multidimensional assessment of emotion recognition in healthy adults suggested that age could affect emotion recognition differently in men and women, and these age-related differences were not mediated by amygdala volume. Our results also indicated that emotion-processing factors are not independent of personality traits and general cognition.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to recognize others' emotions is vital to everyday life. The goal of this study was to assess which emotions show age-related decline in recognition accuracy of facial emotional expressions across the entire adult lifespan and how this process is related to cognitive empathy (Theory of Mind [ToM]), alexithymia traits, and amygdala subnuclei volumes in a large cohort of healthy individuals. We recruited 140 healthy participants 18–85 years old. Facial affect processing was assessed with the Penn Emotion Recognition task (ER40) that contains images of the five basic emotions: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, and Fearful. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets were acquired on a 4.7T MRI system. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationship between studied variables. We found that while both sexes demonstrated age-related reduction in recognition of happy emotions and preserved recognition of sadness, male participants showed age-related reduction in recognition of fear, while in female participants, age-related decline was linked to recognition of neutral and angry facial expressions. In both sexes, accurate recognition of sadness negatively correlated with alexithymia traits. On the other hand, better ToM capabilities in male participants were associated with improvement in recognition of positive and neutral emotions. Finally, none of the observed age-related reductions in emotional recognition were related to amygdala and its subnuclei volumes. In contrast, both global volume of amygdala and its cortical and centromedial subnuclei had significant direct effects on recognition of sad images.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Juvenile Shank3 KO Mice Adopt Distinct Hunting Strategies during Prey Capture Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mice are opportunistic omnivores that readily learn to hunt and eat insects such as crickets. The details of how mice learn these behaviors and how these behaviors may differ in strains with altered neuroplasticity are unclear. We quantified the behavior of juvenile wild-type (WT) and Shank3 knock-out (KO) mice as they learned to hunt crickets during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. This stage involves heightened cortical plasticity including homeostatic synaptic scaling, which requires Shank3, a glutamatergic synaptic protein that, when mutated, produces Phelan-McDermid syndrome and is often comorbid with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both strains showed interest in examining live and dead crickets and learned to hunt. Shank3 knock-out mice took longer to become proficient, and, after 5 d, did not achieve the efficiency of wild-type mice in either time-to-capture or distance-to-capture. Shank3 knock-out mice also exhibited different characteristics when pursuing crickets that could not be explained by a simple motor deficit. Although both genotypes moved at the same average speed when approaching a cricket, Shank3 KO mice paused more often, did not begin final accelerations toward crickets as early, and did not close the distance gap to the cricket as quickly as wild-type mice. These differences in Shank3 KO mice are reminiscent of some behavioral characteristics of individuals with ASD as they perform complex tasks, such as slower action initiation and completion. This paradigm will be useful for exploring the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie these learning and performance differences in monogenic ASD rodent models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">GnRH Neuron Excitability and Action Potential Properties Change with Development But Are Not Affected by Prenatal Androgen Exposure</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons produce the final output from the brain to control pituitary gonadotropin secretion and thus regulate reproduction. Disruptions to gonadotropin secretion contribute to infertility, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in women and symptoms resembling PCOS are observed in girls at or near the time of pubertal onset, suggesting that alterations to the system likely occurred by that developmental period. Prenatally androgenized (PNA) female mice recapitulate many of the neuroendocrine phenotypes observed in PCOS, including altered time of puberty, disrupted reproductive cycles, increased circulating levels of testosterone, and altered gonadotropin secretion patterns. We tested the hypotheses that the intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons change with puberty and with PNA treatment. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were made from GnRH neurons in brain slices from control and PNA females before puberty at three weeks of age and in adulthood to measure GnRH neuron excitability and action potential (AP) properties. GnRH neurons from adult females were more excitable and required less current to initiate action potential firing compared with three-week-old females. Further, the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) potential of the first spike was larger and its peak was delayed in adulthood. These results indicate development, not PNA, is a primary driver of changes to GnRH neuron intrinsic properties and suggest there may be developmentally-induced changes to voltage-gated ion channels in GnRH neurons that alter how these cells respond to synaptic input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Amygdala Intercalated Cells: Gate Keepers and Conveyors of Internal State to the Circuits of Emotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Generating adaptive behavioral responses to emotionally salient stimuli requires evaluation of complex associations between multiple sensations, the surrounding context, and current internal state. Neural circuits within the amygdala parse this emotional information, undergo synaptic plasticity to reflect learned associations, and evoke appropriate responses through their projections to the brain regions orchestrating these behaviors. Information flow within the amygdala is regulated by the intercalated cells (ITCs), which are densely packed clusters of GABAergic neurons that encircle the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and provide contextually relevant feedforward inhibition of amygdala nuclei, including the central and BLA. Emerging studies have begun to delineate the unique contribution of each ITC cluster and establish ITCs as key loci of plasticity in emotional learning. In this review, we summarize the known connectivity and function of individual ITC clusters and explore how different neuromodulators conveying internal state act via ITC gates to shape emotionally motivated behavior. We propose that the behavioral state-dependent function of ITCs, their unique genetic profile, and rich expression of neuromodulator receptors make them potential therapeutic targets for disorders, such as anxiety, schizophrenia spectrum, and addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Regulation of the BDNF Gene in Cortical and Hippocampal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a widely expressed neurotrophin that supports the survival, differentiation, and signaling of various neuronal populations. Although it has been well described that expression of BDNF is strongly regulated by neuronal activity, little is known whether regulation of BDNF expression is similar in different brain regions. Here, we focused on this fundamental question using neuronal populations obtained from rat cerebral cortices and hippocampi of both sexes. First, we thoroughly characterized the role of the best-described regulators of BDNF gene - cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors, and show that activity-dependent BDNF expression depends more on CREB and the coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in cortical than in hippocampal neurons. Our data also reveal an important role of CREB in the early induction of BDNF mRNA expression after neuronal activity and only modest contribution after prolonged neuronal activity. We further corroborated our findings at BDNF protein level. To determine the transcription factors regulating BDNF expression in these rat brain regions in addition to CREB family, we used <I>in vitro</I> DNA pulldown assay coupled with mass spectrometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and bioinformatics, and propose a number of neurodevelopmentally important transcription factors, such as FOXP1, SATB2, RAI1, BCL11A, and TCF4 as brain region-specific regulators of BDNF expression. Together, our data reveal complicated brain region-specific fine-tuning of BDNF expression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To date, majority of the research has focused on the regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain but much less is known whether the regulation of BDNF expression is universal in different brain regions and neuronal populations. Here, we report that the best described regulators of BDNF gene from the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor family have a more profound role in the activity-dependent regulation of BDNF in cortex than in hippocampus. Our results indicate a brain region-specific fine tuning of BDNF expression. Moreover, we have used unbiased determination of novel regulators of the BDNF gene and report a number of neurodevelopmentally important transcription factors as novel potential regulators of the BDNF expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The RNA-Binding Protein HuR Is Integral to the Function of Nociceptors in Mice and Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>HuR is an RNA-binding protein implicated in RNA processing, stability, and translation. Previously, we examined protein synthesis in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons treated with inflammatory mediators using ribosome profiling. We found that the HuR consensus binding element was enriched in transcripts with elevated translation. HuR is expressed in the soma of nociceptors and their axons. Pharmacologic inhibition of HuR with the small molecule CMLD-2 reduced the activity of mouse and human sensory neurons. Peripheral administration of CMLD-2 in the paw or genetic elimination of HuR from sensory neurons diminished behavioral responses associated with NGF- and IL-6-induced allodynia in male and female mice. Genetic disruption of HuR altered the proximity of mRNA decay factors near a key neurotrophic factor (TrkA). Collectively, the data suggest that HuR is required for local control of mRNA stability and reveals a new biological function for a broadly conserved post-transcriptional regulatory factor.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nociceptors undergo long-lived changes in excitability, which may contribute to chronic pain. Noxious cues that promote pain lead to rapid induction of protein synthesis. The underlying mechanisms that confer specificity to mRNA control in nociceptors are unclear. Here, we identify a conserved RNA-binding protein called HuR as a key regulatory factor in sensory neurons. Using a combination of genetics and pharmacology, we demonstrate that HuR is required for signaling in nociceptors. In doing so, we report an important mechanism of mRNA control in sensory neurons that ensures appropriate nociceptive responses to inflammatory mediators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emergence of Distinct Neural Subspaces in Motor Cortical Dynamics during Volitional Adjustments of Ongoing Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to modulate ongoing walking gait with precise, voluntary adjustments is what allows animals to navigate complex terrains. However, how the nervous system generates the signals to precisely control the limbs while simultaneously maintaining locomotion is poorly understood. One potential strategy is to distribute the neural activity related to these two functions into distinct cortical activity coactivation subspaces so that both may be conducted simultaneously without disruptive interference. To investigate this hypothesis, we recorded the activity of primary motor cortex in male nonhuman primates during obstacle avoidance on a treadmill. We found that the same neural population was active during both basic unobstructed locomotion and volitional obstacle avoidance movements. We identified the neural modes spanning the subspace of the low-dimensional dynamics in primary motor cortex and found a subspace that consistently maintains the same cyclic activity throughout obstacle stepping, despite large changes in the movement itself. All of the variance corresponding to this large change in movement during the obstacle avoidance was confined to its own distinct subspace. Furthermore, neural decoders built for ongoing locomotion did not generalize to decoding obstacle avoidance during locomotion. Our findings suggest that separate underlying subspaces emerge during complex locomotion that coordinates ongoing locomotor-related neural dynamics with volitional gait adjustments. These findings may have important implications for the development of brain&ndash;machine interfaces.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Locomotion and precise, goal-directed movements are two distinct movement modalities with known differing requirements of motor cortical input. Previous studies have characterized the cortical activity during obstacle avoidance while walking in rodents and felines, but, to date, no such studies have been completed in primates. Additionally, in any animal model, it is unknown how these two movements are represented in primary motor cortex (M1) low-dimensional dynamics when both activities are performed at the same time, such as during obstacle avoidance. We developed a novel obstacle avoidance paradigm in freely moving nonhuman primates and discovered that the rhythmic locomotion-related dynamics and the voluntary, gait-adjustment movement separate into distinct subspaces in M1 cortical activity. Our analysis of decoding generalization may also have important implications for the development of brain&ndash;machine interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Role for Thalamic Projection GABAergic Neurons in Circadian Responses to Light</a></h4>

              
                <p>The thalamus is an important hub for sensory information and participates in sensory perception, regulation of attention, arousal and sleep. These functions are executed primarily by glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons that extend axons to the cortex and initiate cortico-thalamocortical connectional loops. However, the thalamus also contains projection GABAergic neurons that do not extend axons toward the cortex. Here, we have harnessed recent insight into the development of the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv) to specifically target and manipulate thalamic projection GABAergic neurons in female and male mice. Our results show that thalamic GABAergic neurons of the IGL and LGv receive retinal input from diverse classes of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) but not from the M1 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) type. We describe the synergistic role of the photoreceptor melanopsin and the thalamic neurons of the IGL/LGv in circadian entrainment to dim light. We identify a requirement for the thalamic IGL/LGv neurons in the rapid changes in vigilance states associated with circadian light transitions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv) are part of the extended circadian system and mediate some nonimage-forming visual functions. Here, we show that each of these structures has a thalamic (dorsal) as well as prethalamic (ventral) developmental origin. We map the retinal input to thalamus-derived cells in the IGL/LGv complex and discover that while RGC input is dominant, this is not likely to originate from M1ipRGCs. We implicate thalamic cells in the IGL/LGv in vigilance state transitions at circadian light changes and in overt behavioral entrainment to dim light, the latter exacerbated by concomitant loss of melanopsin expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Nociceptive Stimuli Activate the Hypothalamus-Habenula Circuit to Inhibit the Mesolimbic Reward System and Cocaine-Seeking Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nociceptive signals interact with various regions of the brain, including those involved in physical sensation, reward, cognition, and emotion. Emerging evidence points to a role of nociception in the modulation of the mesolimbic reward system. The mechanism by which nociception affects dopamine (DA) signaling and reward is unclear. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the lateral habenula (LHb) receive somatosensory inputs and are structurally connected with the mesolimbic DA system. Here, we show that the LH&ndash;LHb pathway is necessary for nociceptive modulation of this system using male Sprague Dawley rats. Our extracellular single-unit recordings and head-mounted microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed that nociceptive stimulation by tail pinch excited LHb and LH neurons, which was inhibited by chemical lesion of the LH. Tail pinch increased activity of GABA neurons in ventral tegmental area, decreased the extracellular DA level in the nucleus accumbens ventrolateral shell in intact rats, and reduced cocaine-increased DA concentration, which was blocked by disruption of the LH. Furthermore, tail pinch attenuated cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 22 and 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, which was inhibited by chemogenetic silencing of the LH&ndash;LHb pathway. Our findings suggest that nociceptive stimulation recruits the LH&ndash;LHb pathway to inhibit mesolimbic DA system and drug reinstatement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The LHb and the LH have been implicated in processing nociceptive signals and modulating DA release in the mesolimbic DA system. Here, we show that the LH&ndash;LHb pathway is critical for nociception-induced modulation of mesolimbic DA release and cocaine reinstatement. Nociceptive stimulation alleviates extracellular DA release in the mesolimbic DA system, cocaine-induced psychomotor activities, and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviors through the LH&ndash;LHb pathway. These findings provide novel evidence for sensory modulation of the mesolimbic DA system and drug addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pathological Slow-Wave Activity and Impaired Working Memory Binding in Post-Traumatic Amnesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Associative binding is key to normal memory function and is transiently disrupted during periods of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Electrophysiological abnormalities, including low-frequency activity, are common following TBI. Here, we investigate associative memory binding during PTA and test the hypothesis that misbinding is caused by pathological slowing of brain activity disrupting cortical communication. Thirty acute moderate to severe TBI patients (25 males; 5 females) and 26 healthy controls (20 males; 6 females) were tested with a precision working memory paradigm requiring the association of object and location information. Electrophysiological effects of TBI were assessed using resting-state EEG in a subsample of 17 patients and 21 controls. PTA patients showed abnormalities in working memory function and made significantly more misbinding errors than patients who were not in PTA and controls. The distribution of localization responses was abnormally biased by the locations of nontarget items for patients in PTA, suggesting a specific impairment of object and location binding. Slow-wave activity was increased following TBI. Increases in the -&alpha; ratio indicative of an increase in low-frequency power specifically correlated with binding impairment in working memory. Connectivity changes in TBI did not correlate with binding impairment. Working memory and electrophysiological abnormalities normalized at 6 month follow-up. These results show that patients in PTA show high rates of misbinding that are associated with a pathological shift toward lower-frequency oscillations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How do we remember what was where? The mechanism by which information (e.g., object and location) is integrated in working memory is a central question for cognitive neuroscience. Following significant head injury, many patients will experience a period of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) during which this associative binding is disrupted. This may be because of electrophysiological changes in the brain. Using a precision working memory test and resting-state EEG, we show that PTA patients demonstrate impaired binding ability, and this is associated with a shift toward slower-frequency activity on EEG. Abnormal EEG connectivity was observed but was not specific to PTA or binding ability. These findings contribute to both our mechanistic understanding of working memory binding and PTA pathophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Seeing Social: A Neural Signature for Conscious Perception of Social Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Social information is some of the most ambiguous content we encounter in our daily lives, yet in experimental contexts, percepts of social interactions&mdash;that is, whether an interaction is present and if so, the nature of that interaction&mdash;are often dichotomized as correct or incorrect based on experimenter-assigned labels. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of subjective (or conscious) social perception using data from the Human Connectome Project in which participants (<I>n</I> = 1049; 486 men, 562 women) viewed animations of geometric shapes during fMRI and indicated whether they perceived a social interaction or random motion. Critically, rather than experimenter-assigned labels, we used observers' own reports of "Social" or "Non-social" to classify percepts and characterize brain activity, including leveraging a particularly ambiguous animation perceived as "Social" by some but "Non-social" by others to control for visual input. Behaviorally, observers were biased toward perceiving information as social (vs non-social); and neurally, observer reports (compared with experimenter labels) explained more variance in activity across much of the brain. Using "Unsure" reports, we identified several regions that responded parametrically to perceived socialness. Neural responses to social versus non-social content diverged early in time and in the cortical hierarchy. Finally, individuals with higher internalizing trait scores showed both a higher response bias toward "Social" and an inverse relationship with activity in default mode and visual association areas while scanning for social information. Findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of using observer reports to study percepts of social interactions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Simple animations involving two or more geometric shapes have been used as a gold standard to understand social cognition and impairments therein. Yet, experimenter-assigned labels of what is social versus non-social are frequently used as a ground truth, despite the fact that percepts of such ambiguous social stimuli are highly subjective. Here, we used behavioral and fMRI data from a large sample of neurotypical individuals to show that participants' responses reveal subtle behavioral biases, help us study neural responses to social content more precisely, and covary with internalizing trait scores. Our findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of considering observer reports in studying behavioral and neural dynamics of social perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Environment Symmetry Drives a Multidirectional Code in Rat Retrosplenial Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>We investigated how environment symmetry shapes the neural processing of direction by recording directionally tuned retrosplenial neurons in male Lister hooded rats exploring multicompartment environments that had different levels of global rotational symmetry. Our hypothesis built on prior observations of twofold symmetry in the directional tuning curves of rats in a globally twofold-symmetric environment. To test whether environment symmetry was the relevant factor shaping the directional responses, here we deployed the same apparatus (two connected rectangular boxes) plus one with fourfold symmetry (a 2 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 2 array of connected square boxes) and one with onefold symmetry (a circular open-field arena). Consistent with our hypothesis we found many neurons with tuning curve symmetries that mirrored these environment symmetries, having twofold, fourfold, or onefold symmetric tuning, respectively. Some cells expressed this pattern only globally (across the whole environment), maintaining singular tuning curves in each subcompartment. However, others also expressed it locally within each subcompartment. Because multidirectionality has not been reported in naive rats in single environmental compartments, this suggests an experience-dependent effect of global environment symmetry on local firing symmetry. An intermingled population of directional neurons were classic head direction cells with globally referenced directional tuning. These cells were electrophysiologically distinct, with narrower tuning curves and a burstier firing pattern. Thus, retrosplenial directional neurons can simultaneously encode overall head direction and local head direction (relative to compartment layout). Furthermore, they can learn about global environment symmetry and express this locally. This may be important for the encoding of environment structure beyond immediate perceptual reach.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We investigated how environment symmetry shapes the neural code for space by recording directionally tuned neurons from the retrosplenial cortex of rats exploring single- or multicompartment environments having onefold, twofold, or fourfold rotational symmetry. We found that many cells expressed a symmetry in their head direction tuning curves that matched the corresponding global environment symmetry, indicating plasticity of their directional tuning. They were also electrophysiologically distinct from canonical head directional cells. Notably, following exploration of the global space, many multidirectionally tuned neurons encoded global environment symmetry, even in local subcompartments. Our results suggest that multidirectional head direction codes contribute to the cognitive mapping of the complex structure of multicompartmented spaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attention to Stimuli of Learned versus Innate Biological Value Relies on Separate Neural Systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neural bases of attention, a set of neural processes that promote behavioral selection, is a subject of intense investigation. In humans, rewarded cues influence attention, even when those cues are irrelevant to the current task. Because the amygdala plays a role in reward processing, and the activity of amygdala neurons has been linked to spatial attention, we reasoned that the amygdala may be essential for attending to rewarded images. To test this possibility, we used an attentional capture task, which provides a quantitative measure of attentional bias. Specifically, we compared reaction times (RTs) of adult male rhesus monkeys with bilateral amygdala lesions and unoperated controls as they made a saccade away from a high- or low-value rewarded image to a peripheral target. We predicted that: (1) RTs will be longer for high- compared with low-value images, revealing attentional capture by rewarded stimuli; and (2) relative to controls, monkeys with amygdala lesions would exhibit shorter RT for high-value images. For comparison, we assessed the same groups of monkeys for attentional capture by images of predators and conspecifics, categories thought to have innate biological value. In performing the attentional capture task, all monkeys were slowed more by high-value relative to low-value rewarded images. Contrary to our prediction, amygdala lesions failed to disrupt this effect. When presented with images of predators and conspecifics, however, monkeys with amygdala lesions showed significantly diminished attentional capture relative to controls. Thus, separate neural pathways are responsible for allocating attention to stimuli with learned versus innate value.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Valuable objects attract attention. The amygdala is known to contribute to reward processing and the encoding of object reward value. We therefore examined whether the amygdala is necessary for allocating attention to rewarded objects. For comparison, we assessed the amygdala's contribution to attending to objects with innate biological value: predators and conspecifics. We found that the macaque amygdala is necessary for directing attention to images with innate biological value, but not for directing attention to recently learned reward-predictive images. These findings indicate that the amygdala makes selective contributions to attending to valuable objects. The data are relevant to mental health disorders, such as social anxiety disorders and small animal phobias, that arise from biased attention to select categories of objects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presenilin and APP Regulate Synaptic Kainate Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Kainate receptors (KARs) form a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors that regulate the activity of neuronal networks by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Their implication in pathologies is well documented for epilepsy. The higher prevalence of epileptic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients questions the role of KARs in AD. Here we investigated whether the synaptic expression and function of KARs was impaired in mouse models of AD. We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude and decay time of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (APP/PS1) of AD. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was observed in CA3 pyramidal cells in male and female mice with a genetic deletion of either presenilin or APP/APLP2 as well as in organotypic cultures treated with -secretase inhibitors. Finally, the GluK2 protein interacts with full-length and C-terminal fragments of APP. Overall, our data suggest that APP stabilizes KARs at synapses, possibly through a transsynaptic mechanism, and this interaction is under the control the -secretase proteolytic activity of presenilin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic impairment correlates strongly with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, many studies have addressed the dysregulation of AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors. Kainate receptors (KARs), which form the third family of iGluRs, represent an underestimated actor in the regulation of neuronal circuits and have not yet been examined in the context of AD. Here we provide evidence that synaptic KARs are markedly impaired in a mouse model of AD. Additional experiments indicate that the -secretase activity of presenilin acting on the amyloid precursor protein controls synaptic expression of KAR. This study clearly indicates that KARs should be taken into consideration whenever addressing synaptic dysfunction and related cognitive deficits in the context of AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Absence of Parkin Does Not Promote Dopamine or Mitochondrial Dysfunction in PolgAD257A/D257A Mitochondrial Mutator Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In this study, we generated a transgenic model by crossing germline Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice with PolgA<sup>D257A</sup> mice, an established model of premature aging and mitochondrial stress. We hypothesized that loss of Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> in PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice would exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to loss of dopamine neurons and nigral-striatal specific neurobehavioral motor dysfunction. We found that aged Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> male and female mice exhibited severe behavioral deficits, nonspecific to the nigral-striatal pathway, with neither dopaminergic neurodegeneration nor reductions in striatal dopamine. We saw no difference in expression levels of nuclear-encoded subunits of mitochondrial markers and mitochondrial Complex I and IV activities, although we did observe substantial reductions in mitochondrial-encoded COX41I, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a result of PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mtDNA mutations. Expression levels of mitophagy markers LC3I/LC3II remained unchanged between cohorts, suggesting no overt mitophagy defects. Expression levels of the parkin substrates, VDAC, NLRP3, and AIMP2 remained unchanged, suggesting no parkin dysfunction. In summary, we were unable to observe dopaminergic neurodegeneration with corresponding nigral-striatal neurobehavioral deficits, nor Parkin or mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice. These findings support a lack of synergism of Parkin loss on mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse models of mitochondrial deficits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Producing a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is etiologically relevant, recapitulates clinical hallmarks, and exhibits reproducible results is crucial to understanding the underlying pathology and in developing disease-modifying therapies. Here, we show that Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice, a previously reported PD mouse model, fails to reproduce a Parkinsonian phenotype. We show that these mice do not display dopaminergic neurodegeneration nor nigral-striatal-dependent motor deficits. Furthermore, we report that Parkin loss does not synergize with mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that Parkin<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/PolgA<sup>D257A/D257A</sup> mice are not a reliable model for PD and adds to a growing body of work demonstrating that Parkin loss does not synergize with mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse models of mitochondrial deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decreased Modulation of Population Correlations in Auditory Cortex Is Associated with Decreased Auditory Detection Performance in Old Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) affects one-third of the world's population. One hallmark of presbycusis is difficulty hearing in noisy environments. Presbycusis can be separated into two components: the aging ear and the aging brain. To date, the role of the aging brain in presbycusis is not well understood. Activity in the primary auditory cortex (A1) during a behavioral task is because of a combination of responses representing the acoustic stimuli, attentional gain, and behavioral choice. Disruptions in any of these aspects can lead to decreased auditory processing. To investigate how these distinct components are disrupted in aging, we performed <I>in vivo</I> 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in both male and female mice (<I>Thy1-GCaMP6s</I> <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> <I>CBA/CaJ</I> mice) that retain peripheral hearing into old age. We imaged A1 neurons of young adult (2-6 months) and old mice (16-24 months) during a tone detection task in broadband noise. While young mice performed well, old mice performed worse at low signal-to-noise ratios. Calcium imaging showed that old animals have increased prestimulus activity, reduced attentional gain, and increased noise correlations. Increased correlations in old animals exist regardless of cell tuning and behavioral outcome, and these correlated networks exist over a much larger portion of cortical space. Neural decoding techniques suggest that this prestimulus activity is predictive of old animals making early responses. Together, our results suggest a model in which old animals have higher and more correlated prestimulus activity and cannot fully suppress this activity, leading to the decreased representation of targets among distracting stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging inhibits the ability to hear clearly in noisy environments. We show that the aging auditory cortex is unable to fully suppress its responses to background noise. During an auditory behavior, fewer neurons were suppressed in the old relative to young animals, which leads to higher prestimulus activity and more false alarms. We show that this excess activity additionally leads to increased correlations between neurons, reducing the amount of relevant stimulus information in the auditory cortex. Future work identifying the lost circuits that are responsible for proper background suppression could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies to preserve auditory processing ability into old age.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of cytosine conversion methods for whole-genome DNA methylation profiling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: DNA methylation, the most common epigenetic modification, is defined as the removal or addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases. Studying DNA methylation provides insight into the regulation of gene expression, transposon mobility, genomic stability, and genomic imprinting. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling (WGDM) is a powerful tool to find DNA methylation. This technique combines standard whole-genome sequencing methodology (e.g., Illumina high-throughput sequencing) with additional steps where unmethylated cytosine is converted to uracil. However, factors such as low cytosine conversion efficiency and inadequate DNA recovery during sample preparation oftentimes render poor-quality data. It is therefore imperative to benchmark sample preparation protocols to increase sequencing data quality and reduce false positives in methylation detection. Methods: A survey analysis was performed to investigate the efficiency of the following commercially available cytosine conversion kits when coupled with the NEBNext® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB): Zymo Research EZ DNA Methylation™ kit (hereafter known as Zymo Conversion kit), QIAGEN EpiTect Bisulfite kit (hereafter known as QIAGEN Conversion kit), and NEBNext® Enzymatic Methyl-seq Conversion Module (hereafter known as NEB EM-seq kit). Input DNA was derived from soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merrill) leaf tissue. Results: Of those tested, the QIAGEN Conversion kit provided the best sample recovery and the highest number of sequencing reads, whereas the Zymo Conversion kit had the best cytosine conversion efficiency and the least duplication. The sequence library obtained with the NEB EM-seq kit had the highest mapping efficiency (percentage of reads mapped to the genome). The data quality (defined by Phred score) and methylated cytosine call were similar between kits. Conclusions: This study offers the groundwork for selecting an effective DNA methylation detection kit for crop genome research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors and mortality outcomes of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli bacteremia: A retrospective cohort study from two Indonesian referral hospitals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) can lead to bloodstream infection and subsequent sepsis which increases morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of risk factors of infection by ESBL-producing E. coli is important as it can decrease inappropriate antibiotic use and mortality rates. This study aimed to identify the risk factors and mortality of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included inpatients with confirmed E. coli blood culture examinations from two referral hospitals in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data suspected as risk factors for ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia (utilization of medical devices, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, history of hospitalization, and history of antibiotic therapy) were collected for analysis. Clinical profiles and independent risk factors of ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia associated mortality were also evaluated. Results: A total of 116 subjects were analyzed with 81% aged ≥18 years old. The most common source of infection was the gastrointestinal and intra-abdominal tracts. Malignancy as comorbidity was present in 46.6% subjects. Significant risk factors for developing ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia were history of antibiotic therapy and utilization of medical devices. The proportion of mortality in ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia was 55.7% with age and sepsis as its independent risk factors. Conclusions: History of antibiotic therapy and utilization of medical devices were significant risk factors for ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia. The proportion of mortality in ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia patients was 55.7% with its independent risk factors being age and sepsis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis led by empagliflozin: A case report and literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new class of medications that have been approved for the treatment of heart failure (HF) in patients with and without type-2 diabetes mellitus. It is important to be aware of the likely side effects of SGLT2i for their optimal use and enhanced patient safety. One such rare but potential side effect is the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA). Objective: We present a case report of EDKA, in a patient who was started on empagliflozin – one of the SGLT2i – highlighting its presenting signs and symptoms, pertinent laboratory findings, differential diagnosis, treatment and outcome. To strengthen our findings and hypothesis, we conducted a literature review of other cases that used SGLT2i and found similar complications. This case report with review can help recognize the serious, potentially life-threatening complications of the new class of medication SGLT2i that has been incorporated into the current practice, and also help to take appropriate steps to mitigate its adverse effects and improve overall health outcomes in our patients.  Conclusions: SGLT2i are increasingly used because of their favorable effects on mortality in the chronic HF patients along with its benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction. A potential underdiagnosed adverse effect of SGLT2i use is diabetic ketoacidosis in a setting of normal blood glucose levels. Thus, it is reasonable to be cognizant of its side effects to prevent any untoward events in a timely manner.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainability of quality of life investments based on the digital transformation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In this paper, the problem of sustainability of investment activity in the direction of the high yield investment program is considered. In these financial instruments, large amounts of money are accumulated, consisting of contributions from the vast majority of the population. For example, pension funds inherent in most developed countries, insurance institutions, etc., can be indicated. Accordingly, the social significance of their activities and the impact on the quality of life of all segments of the population increase. Methods: This article outlines the methods and results aimed at the digital transformation of methods for forecasting long-term institutional investments. The authors use the method of mathematical modeling of the dynamics considering that the sustainability calculation must assume that the life cycle of citizens providing contributions is limited. The parameters of the distribution of the duration of the accumulation phase over the array of people and the time of life in the subsequent period are known. For mathematical modeling, the researchers divide the players by the time they have been present on the market. Results: The authors have developed a mathematical model in the form of a set of algorithms for calculating the sustainability of long-term institutional investments with reference to life quality indicators. Conclusions: The need to develop a methodology for assessing sustainability is dictated by the increased role of digital technologies and the ability to receive the most relevant information for analysis online.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian nowcasting with leading indicators applied to COVID-19 fatalities in Sweden</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fanny Bergström, Felix Günther, Michael Höhle, Tom Britton</p>

The real-time analysis of infectious disease surveillance data is essential in obtaining situational awareness about the current dynamics of a major public health event such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis of e.g., time-series of reported cases or fatalities is complicated by reporting delays that lead to under-reporting of the complete number of events for the most recent time points. This can lead to misconceptions by the interpreter, for instance the media or the public, as was the case with the time-series of reported fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Nowcasting methods provide real-time estimates of the complete number of events using the incomplete time-series of currently reported events and information about the reporting delays from the past. In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian nowcasting approach applied to COVID-19-related fatalities in Sweden. We incorporate additional information in the form of time-series of number of reported cases and ICU admissions as leading signals. We demonstrate with a retrospective evaluation that the inclusion of ICU admissions as a leading signal improved the nowcasting performance of case fatalities for COVID-19 in Sweden compared to existing methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Population coding strategies in human tactile afferents</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giulia Corniani, Miguel A. Casal, Stefano Panzeri, Hannes P. Saal</p>

Sensory information is conveyed by populations of neurons, and coding strategies cannot always be deduced when considering individual neurons. Moreover, information coding depends on the number of neurons available and on the composition of the population when multiple classes with different response properties are available. Here, we study population coding in human tactile afferents by employing a recently developed simulator of mechanoreceptor firing activity. First, we highlight the interplay of afferents within each class. We demonstrate that the optimal afferent density to convey maximal information depends on both the tactile feature under consideration and the afferent class. Second, we find that information is spread across different classes for all tactile features and that each class encodes both redundant and complementary information with respect to the other afferent classes. Specifically, combining information from multiple afferent classes improves information transmission and is often more efficient than increasing the density of afferents from the same class. Finally, we examine the importance of temporal and spatial contributions, respectively, to the joint spatiotemporal code. On average, destroying temporal information is more destructive than removing spatial information, but the importance of either depends on the stimulus feature analysed. Overall, our results suggest that both optimal afferent innervation densities and the composition of the population depend in complex ways on the tactile features in question, potentially accounting for the variety in which tactile peripheral populations are assembled in different regions across the body.

                <p>by Branden J. Olson, Stefan A. Schattgen, Paul G. Thomas, Philip Bradley, Frederick A. Matsen IV</p>

The complexity of entire T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires makes their comparison a difficult but important task. Current methods of TCR repertoire comparison can incur a high loss of distributional information by considering overly simplistic sequence- or repertoire-level characteristics. Optimal transport methods form a suitable approach for such comparison given some distance or metric between values in the sample space, with appealing theoretical and computational properties. In this paper we introduce a nonparametric approach to comparing empirical TCR repertoires that applies the Sinkhorn distance, a fast, contemporary optimal transport method, and a recently-created distance between TCRs called TCRdist. We show that our methods identify meaningful differences between samples from distinct TCR distributions for several case studies, and compete with more complicated methods despite minimal modeling assumptions and a simpler pipeline.

                <p>by Marion F. S. Fischer, James E. Crowe, Jens Meiler</p>

Antibody epitope mapping of viral proteins plays a vital role in understanding immune system mechanisms of protection. In the case of class I viral fusion proteins, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and protein stabilization techniques have highlighted the importance of cryptic or ‘alternative’ conformations that expose epitopes targeted by potent neutralizing antibodies. Thorough epitope mapping of such metastable conformations is difficult but is critical for understanding sites of vulnerability in class I fusion proteins that occur as transient conformational states during viral attachment and fusion. We introduce a novel method Accelerated class I fusion protein Epitope Mapping (AxIEM) that accounts for fusion protein flexibility to improve out-of-sample prediction of discontinuous antibody epitopes. Harnessing data from previous experimental epitope mapping efforts of several class I fusion proteins, we demonstrate that accuracy of epitope prediction depends on residue environment and allows for the prediction of conformation-dependent antibody target residues. We also show that AxIEM can identify common epitopes and provide structural insights for the development and rational design of vaccines.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pannexin 1 activity in astroglia sets hippocampal neuronal network patterns</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Flora Vasile, Elena Dossi, Julien Moulard, Pascal Ezan, Laure Lecoin, Martine Cohen-Salmon, Philippe Mailly, Marc Le Bert, Isabelle Couillin, Alexis Bemelmans, Nathalie Rouach</p>

Astroglial release of molecules is thought to actively modulate neuronal activity, but the nature, release pathway, and cellular targets of these neuroactive molecules are still unclear. Pannexin 1, expressed by neurons and astrocytes, form nonselective large pore channels that mediate extracellular exchange of molecules. The functional relevance of these channels has been mostly studied in brain tissues, without considering their specific role in different cell types, or in neurons. Thus, our knowledge of astroglial pannexin 1 regulation and its control of neuronal activity remains very limited, largely due to the lack of tools targeting these channels in a cell-specific way. We here show that astroglial pannexin 1 expression in mice is developmentally regulated and that its activation is activity-dependent. Using astrocyte-specific molecular tools, we found that astroglial-specific pannexin 1 channel activation, in contrast to pannexin 1 activation in all cell types, selectively and negatively regulates hippocampal networks, with their disruption inducing a drastic switch from bursts to paroxysmal activity. This decrease in neuronal excitability occurs via an unconventional astroglial mechanism whereby pannexin 1 channel activity drives purinergic signaling-mediated regulation of hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN)-gated channels. Our findings suggest that astroglial pannexin 1 channel activation serves as a negative feedback mechanism crucial for the inhibition of hippocampal neuronal networks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An open label, single arm, pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of daily fluconazole 150 mg in subjects suffering from Tinea cruris and Tinea corporis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Dermatophytes are the most common superficial fungal infections worldwide and are treated with prescribed regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, or with weekly doses of fluconazole. Dermatologists are increasingly encountering treatment failures, and experts suggest that standard treatment regimens are not applicable anymore. We planned an open-label study to evaluate the results of fluconazole 150 mg daily for 8 weeks in patients with tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Methods: Patients were enrolled from the La’Mer Clinic, Mumbai, India. We included adult subjects with uncomplicated dermatophytosis confirmed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings. Pregnancy, poor renal function, and recent exposure to anti-fungal therapy were exclusion criteria. Patients were reviewed on days 14, 28 and 56. The treating doctor scored the severity of erythema, scaling, and pruritus on a four-point scale: absent, mild, moderate, and severe. Of 107 subjects screened, 100 were finally included in the study. Eleven were lost to follow up and one subject withdrew consent. Results: The site of disease was body alone in 29, groin alone in 7, and both body and groin in 64 cases. At 5 weeks, 98%, 100%, and 97% of patients had no scaling, erythema, and pruritus, respectively. Skin scrapings showed 100% mycological cure. In one patient the alanine transaminase level rose from 54.9 to 100.2 U/L, and qualified as a grade 1 adverse event not requiring intervention. No other significant adverse events were noted. Conclusions: Our results suggest that fluconazole 150 mg daily for eight weeks effectively treats dermatophytosis. This regimen is safe and well-tolerated even in patients with co-morbidities. Fluconazole is about eight times less expensive than itraconazole or terbinafine and may be the preferred therapy. Registration: The trial was registered with Clinical Trials Registry, India (Registration number CTRI/2020/06/026110) on 24 June 2020. FDC Company, India, provided financial support for the study.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Destabilizers of the thymidylate synthase homodimer accelerate its proteasomal degradation and inhibit cancer growth</a></h4>

              
                Drugs that target human thymidylate synthase (hTS), a dimeric enzyme, are widely used in anti-cancer therapy. However, treatment with classical substrate-site-directed TS inhibitors induces over-expression of this protein and development of drug resistance. We thus pursued an alternative strategy that led us to the discovery of TS-dimer destabilizers. These compounds bind at the monomer-monomer interface and shift the dimerization equilibrium of both the recombinant and the intracellular protein toward the inactive monomers. A structural, spectroscopic, and kinetic investigation has provided evidence and quantitative information on the effects of the interaction of these small molecules with hTS. Focusing on the best among them, E7, we have shown that it inhibits hTS in cancer cells and accelerates its proteasomal degradation, thus causing a decrease in the enzyme intracellular level. E7 also showed a superior anticancer profile to fluorouracil in a mouse model of human pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Thus, over sixty years after the discovery of the first TS prodrug inhibitor, fluorouracil, E7 breaks the link between TS inhibition and enhanced expression in response, providing a strategy to fight drug-resistant cancers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oncogene expression from extrachromosomal DNA is driven by copy number amplification and does not require spatial clustering in glioblastoma stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) are frequently observed in human cancers and are responsible for high levels of oncogene expression. In glioblastoma (GBM), ecDNA copy number correlates with poor prognosis. It is hypothesized that their copy number, size, and chromatin accessibility facilitate clustering of ecDNA and colocalization with transcriptional hubs, and that this underpins their elevated transcriptional activity. Here, we use super-resolution imaging and quantitative image analysis to evaluate GBM stem cells harbouring distinct ecDNA species (<i>EGFR, CDK4, PDGFRA</i>). We find no evidence that ecDNA routinely cluster with one another or closely interact with transcriptional hubs. Cells with <i>EGFR</i>-containing ecDNA have increased <i>EGFR</i> transcriptional output, but transcription per gene copy is similar in ecDNA compared to the endogenous chromosomal locus. These data suggest that it is the increased copy number of oncogene-harbouring ecDNA that primarily drives high levels of oncogene transcription, rather than specific interactions of ecDNA with each other or with high concentrations of the transcriptional machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Weakly migratory metastatic breast cancer cells activate fibroblasts via microvesicle-Tg2 to facilitate dissemination and metastasis</a></h4>

              
                Cancer cell migration is highly heterogeneous, and the migratory capability of cancer cells is thought to be an indicator of metastatic potential. It is becoming clear that a cancer cell does not have to be inherently migratory to metastasize, with weakly migratory cancer cells often found to be highly metastatic. However, the mechanism through which weakly migratory cells escape from the primary tumor remains unclear. Here, utilizing phenotypically sorted highly and weakly migratory human breast cancer cells, we demonstrate that weakly migratory metastatic cells disseminate from the primary tumor via communication with stromal cells. While highly migratory cells are capable of single cell migration, weakly migratory cells rely on cell-cell signaling with fibroblasts to escape the primary tumor. Weakly migratory cells release microvesicles rich in tissue transglutaminase 2 (Tg2) which activate murine fibroblasts and lead weakly migratory cancer cell migration <i>in vitro</i>. These microvesicles also induce tumor stiffening and fibroblast activation <i>in vivo</i> and enhance the metastasis of weakly migratory cells. Our results identify microvesicles and Tg2 as potential therapeutic targets for metastasis and reveal a novel aspect of the metastatic cascade in which weakly migratory cells release microvesicles which activate fibroblasts to enhance cancer cell dissemination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rostral and caudal BLA engage distinct circuits in the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC</a></h4>

              
                Connections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulate memory and emotion and become disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders. The diverse roles attributed to interactions between the BLA and PFC may reflect multiple circuits nested within a wider network. To examine these circuits, we first used retrograde and anterograde anatomy to show that the rostral BLA (rBLA) and caudal BLA (cBLA) differentially project to prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subregions of the mouse PFC. Using <i>ex vivo</i> whole-cell recordings and optogenetics, we then assessed which neuronal subtypes are targeted, showing that rBLA preferentially drives layer 2 (L2) cortico-amygdalar (CA) neurons in PL, whereas cBLA drives layer 5 (L5) pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in IL. We next combined <i>in vivo</i> silicon probe recordings and optogenetics to confirm that cBLA mainly influences IL L5, whereas rBLA primarily activates PL L2, but also evokes polysynaptic activity in PL L5. Lastly, we used soma-tagged optogenetics to explore the local circuits linking superficial and deep layers of PL, showing how rBLA can engage L2 CA neurons to impact L5 PT neuron activity. Together, our findings delineate how subregions of the BLA target distinct networks within the PFC and differentially influence output from PL and IL.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Doublecortin and JIP3 are neural-specific counteracting regulators of dynein-mediated retrograde trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the microtubule (MT)-binding protein doublecortin (DCX) or in the MT-based molecular motor dynein result in lissencephaly. However, a functional link between DCX and dynein has not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that DCX negatively regulates dynein-mediated retrograde transport in neurons from <i>Dcx<sup>-/y</sup></i> or <i>Dcx<sup>-/y</sup>;Dclk1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice by reducing dynein's association with MTs and by disrupting the composition of the dynein motor complex. Previous work showed an increased binding of the adaptor protein C-Jun-amino-terminal kinase-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) to dynein in the absence of DCX. Using purified components, we demonstrate that JIP3 forms an active motor complex with dynein and its cofactor dynactin with two dyneins per complex. DCX competes with the binding of the second dynein, resulting in a velocity reduction of the complex. We conclude that DCX negatively regulates dynein-mediated retrograde transport through two critical interactions by regulating dynein binding to MTs and by regulating the composition of the dynein motor complex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">eDNA-stimulated cell dispersion from Caulobacter crescentus biofilms upon oxygen limitation is dependent on a toxin-antitoxin system</a></h4>

              
                In their natural environment, most bacteria preferentially live as complex surface-attached multicellular colonies called biofilms. Biofilms begin with a few cells adhering to a surface, where they multiply to form a mature colony. When conditions deteriorate, cells can leave the biofilm. This dispersion is thought to be an important process that modifies the overall biofilm architecture and that promotes colonization of new environments. In <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> biofilms, extracellular DNA (eDNA) is released upon cell death and prevents newborn cells from joining the established biofilm. Thus, eDNA promotes the dispersal of newborn cells and the subsequent colonization of new environments. These observations suggest that eDNA is a cue for sensing detrimental environmental conditions in the biofilm. Here we show that the toxin-antitoxin system (TAS) ParDE<sub>4</sub> stimulates cell death in areas of a biofilm with decreased O<sub>2</sub> availability. In conditions where O<sub>2</sub> availability is low, eDNA concentration is correlated with cell death. Cell dispersal away from biofilms is decreased when <i>parDE<sub>4</sub></i> is deleted, probably due to the lower local eDNA concentration. Expression of <i>parDE<sub>4</sub></i> is positively regulated by O<sub>2</sub> and the expression of this operon is decreased in biofilms where O<sub>2</sub> availability is low. Thus, a programmed cell death mechanism using an O<sub>2</sub>-regulated TAS stimulates dispersal away from areas of a biofilm with decreased O<sub>2</sub> availability and favors colonization of a new, more hospitable environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Overcoming the cytoplasmic retention of GDOWN1 modulates global transcription and facilitates stress adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic regulation of transcription is crucial for the cellular responses to various environmental or developmental cues. Gdown1 is a ubiquitously expressed, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) interacting protein, essential for the embryonic development of metazoan. It tightly binds Pol II <i>in vitro</i> and competitively blocks the binding of TFIIF and possibly other transcriptional regulatory factors, yet its cellular functions and regulatory circuits remain unclear. Here, we show that human GDOWN1 strictly localizes in the cytoplasm of various types of somatic cells and exhibits a potent resistance to the imposed driving force for its nuclear localization. Combined with the genetic and microscope-based approaches, two types of the functionally coupled and evolutionally conserved localization regulatory motifs are identified, including the CRM1-dependent nucleus export signal (NES) and a novel Cytoplasmic Anchoring Signal (CAS) that mediates its retention outside of the nuclear pore complexes (NPC). Mutagenesis of CAS alleviates GDOWN1’s cytoplasmic retention, thus unlocks its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties, and the increased nuclear import and accumulation of GDOWN1 results in a drastic reduction of both Pol II and its associated global transcription levels. Importantly, the nuclear translocation of GDOWN1 occurs in response to the oxidative stresses, and the ablation of <i>GDOWN1</i> significantly weakens the cellular tolerance. Collectively, our work uncovers the molecular basis of GDOWN1’s subcellular localization and a novel cellular strategy of modulating global transcription and stress-adaptation via controlling the nuclear translocation of GDOWN1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA damage independent inhibition of NF-kB transcription by anthracyclines</a></h4>

              
                Anthracyclines are among the most used and effective anticancer drugs. Their activity has been attributed to DNA double-strand breaks resulting from topoisomerase II poisoning and to eviction of histones from select sites in the genome. Here we show that the extensively used anthracyclines Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin and Epirubicin decrease the transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent gene targets, but not interferon responsive genes in primary mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) macrophages. Using an NMR-based structural approach, we demonstrate that anthracyclines disturb the complexes formed between the NF-kB subunit RelA and its DNA binding sites. The anthracycline variants Aclarubicin, Doxorubicinone and the newly developed Dimethyl-doxorubicin, which share anticancer properties with the other anthracyclines but do not induce DNA damage, also suppressed inflammation, thus uncoupling DNA damage from the effects on inflammation. These findings have implications for anticancer therapy and for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs with limited side effects for life-threatening conditions such as sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A method for low-coverage single-gamete sequence analysis demonstrates adherence to Mendel's first law across a large sample of human sperm</a></h4>

              
                Recently published single-cell sequencing data from individual human sperm (n = 41,189; 969-3,377 cells from each of 25 donors) offer an opportunity to investigate questions of inheritance with improved statistical power, but require new methods tailored to these extremely low-coverage data (∼0.01 x per cell). To this end, we developed a method, named rhapsodi, that leverages sparse gamete genotype data to phase the diploid genomes of the donor individuals, impute missing gamete genotypes, and discover meiotic recombination breakpoints, benchmarking its performance across a wide range of study designs. Mendel's Law of Segregation states that the offspring of a diploid, heterozygous parent will inherit either allele with equal probability. While the vast majority of loci adhere to this rule, research in model and non-model organisms has uncovered numerous exceptions whereby 'selfish' alleles are disproportionately transmitted to the next generation. Evidence of such 'transmission distortion' (TD) in humans remains equivocal in part because scans of human pedigrees have been under-powered to detect small effects. After applying rhapsodi to the sperm sequencing data, we therefore scanned the gametes for evidence of TD. Our results exhibited close concordance with binomial expectations under balanced transmission. Together, our work demonstrates that rhapsodi can facilitate novel uses of inferred genotype data and meiotic recombination events, while offering a powerful quantitative framework for testing for TD in other cohorts and study systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The NAD+ precursor NMN activates dSarm to trigger axon degeneration in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Axon degeneration contributes to the disruption of neuronal circuit function in diseased and injured nervous systems. Severed axons degenerate following the activation of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, which culminates in the activation of SARM1 in mammals to execute the pathological depletion of the metabolite NAD<sup>+</sup>. SARM1 NADase activity is activated by the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In mammals, keeping NMN levels low potently preserves axons after injury. However, it remains unclear whether NMN is also a key mediator of axon degeneration and dSarm activation in flies. Here, we demonstrate that lowering NMN levels in <i>Drosophila</i> through the expression of a newly generated prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase (NMN-D) preserves severed axons for months and keeps them circuit-integrated for weeks. NMN-D alters the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic flux by lowering NMN, while NAD<sup>+</sup> remains unchanged <i>in vivo</i>. Increased NMN synthesis, by the expression of mouse nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (mNAMPT), leads to faster axon degeneration after injury. We also show that NMN-induced activation of dSarm mediates axon degeneration <i>in vivo</i>. Finally, NMN-D delays neurodegeneration caused by loss of the sole NMN-consuming and NAD<sup>+</sup>-synthesizing enzyme dNmnat. Our results reveal a critical role for NMN in neurodegeneration in the fly, which extends beyond axonal injury. The potent neuroprotection by reducing NMN levels is similar to the interference with other essential mediators of axon degeneration in <i>Drosophila</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inductive biases of neural networks for generalization in spatial navigation</a></h4>

              
                Artificial reinforcement learning agents that perform well in training tasks typically perform worse than animals in novel tasks. We propose one reason: generalization requires modular architectures like the brain. We trained deep reinforcement learning agents using neural architectures with various degrees of modularity in a partially observable navigation task. We found that highly modular architectures that largely separate computations of internal belief of state from action and value allow better generalization performance than agents with less modular architectures. Furthermore, the modular agent's internal belief is formed by combining prediction and observation, weighted by their relative uncertainty, suggesting that networks learn a Kalman filter-like belief update rule. Therefore, smaller uncertainties in observation than in prediction lead to better generalization to tasks with novel observable dynamics. These results exemplify the rationale of the brain's inductive biases and show how insights from neuroscience can inspire the development of artificial systems with better generalization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effectiveness of acellular nerve allografts compared to autografts in animal models: a systematic review and meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Treatment of nerve injuries proves to be a worldwide clinical challenge. Acellular nerve allografts are suggested to be a promising alternative for bridging a nerve gap to the current gold standard, an autologous nerve graft. Objective: To systematically review the efficacy of the acellular nerve allograft, its difference from the gold standard (the nerve autograft) and to discuss its possible indications. Material and methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched until the 4th of January 2022. Original peer reviewed paper that presented 1) distinctive data; 2) a clear comparison between not immunologically processed acellular allografts and autologous nerve transfers; 3) was performed in laboratory animals of all species and sex. Meta analyses and subgroup analyses (for graft length and species) were conducted for muscle weight, sciatic function index, ankle angle, nerve conduction velocity, axon count diameter, tetanic contraction and amplitude using a Random effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted on graft length and species. Results: Fifty articles were included in this review and all were included in the meta-analyses. An acellular allograft resulted in a significantly lower muscle weight, sciatic function index, ankle angle, nerve conduction velocity, axon count and smaller diameter, tetanic contraction compared to an autologous nerve graft. No difference was found in amplitude between acellular allografts and autologous nerve transfers. Post hoc subgroup analyses of graft length showed a significant reduced muscle weight in long grafts versus small and medium length grafts. All included studies showed a large variance in methodological design. Conclusion: Our review shows that the included studies, investigating the use of acellular allografts, showed a large variance in methodological design and are as a consequence difficult to compare. Nevertheless, our results indicate that treating a nerve gap with an allograft results in an inferior nerve recovery compared to an autograft in seven out of eight outcomes assessed in experimental animals. In addition, based on our preliminary post hoc subgroup analyses we suggest that when an allograft is being used an allograft in short and medium (0-1cm, > 1-2cm) nerve gaps is preferred over an allograft in long (> 2cm) nerve gaps.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG error-related potentials encode magnitude of errors and individual perceptual thresholds</a></h4>

              
                Error-related potentials (ErrP) are a prominent electroencephalogram (EEG) correlate of performance monitoring, and so crucial for learning and adapting our behavior. Although there exists an agreement that ErrP signal awareness to errors, it remains poorly understood whether they encode further information. Here we report an experiment with sixteen participants during three recording sessions in which occasional visuomotor rotations of varying magnitude occurred during a cursor reaching task. We designed a brain-computer interface (BCI) to detect ErrP in single trials that provided real-time feedback to participants by changing the color of the cursor upon ErrP detection. The individual ErrP-BCI decoders exhibited good transfer across recording sessions and scalability over the varying magnitude of errors. Our results indicate that ErrPs encode not only the conscious perception of errors, but also their magnitude, in their amplitude and latency. Furthermore, a non-linear relationship between the ErrP-BCI output and the magnitude of errors predicts individual perceptual thresholds to detect rotations. The uncovered relationship is consistent with non-human primate studies, which found a similar relationship between the size of errors and simple spike activity of Purkinje cells, and we conjecture a cerebellar contribution to ErrP. Our experimental setup and findings open new avenues to probe and extend current theories of performance monitoring, which are based on response conflict tasks, by incorporating continuous human-interaction tasks as well as analysis of the ErrP complex as a whole rather than individual peaks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Burst firing is required for induction of Hebbian LTP at lateral perforant path to hippocampal granule cell synapses</a></h4>

              
                High frequency burst firing is critical in summation of back-propagating action potentials (APs) in dendrites, which may greatly depolarize dendritic membrane potential. The physiological significance of burst firings of hippocampal dentate GCs in synaptic plasticity remains unknown. We found that GCs with low input resistance could be categorized into regular-spiking (RS) and burst-spiking (BS) cells based on their initial firing frequency (Finit) upon somatic rheobase current injection, and investigated how two types of GCs differ in long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency lateral perforant pathway (LPP) inputs. Induction of Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses required at least three postsynaptic APs at Finit higher than 100 Hz, which was met in BS but not in RS cells. The synaptically evoked burst firing was critically dependent on persistent Na+ current, which was larger in BS than RS cells. The Ca2+ source for Hebbian LTP at LPP synapses was primarily provided by L-type calcium channels. In contrast, Hebbian LTP at medial PP synapses was mediated by T-type calcium channels, and could be induced regardless of cell types or Finit of postsynaptic APs. These results suggest that intrinsic firing properties affect synaptically driven firing patterns, and that bursting behavior differentially affects Hebbian LTP mechanisms depending on the synaptic input pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RHYTHMIC ENTRAINMENT ECHOES IN AUDITORY PERCEPTION</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic entrainment echoes, rhythmic brain responses that outlast rhythmic stimulation, can evidence endogenous neural oscillations entrained by the stimulus rhythm. We here tested for such echoes in auditory perception. Participants detected a pure tone target, presented at a variable delay after another pure tone that was rhythmically modulated in amplitude. In four experiments involving 154 participants, we tested (1) which stimulus rate produces the strongest entrainment echo and (2), inspired by audition's tonotopical organisation and findings in non-human primates, whether these are organized according to sound frequency. We found strongest entrainment echoes after 6-Hz and 8-Hz stimulation, respectively. Best moments for target detection (in or in anti-phase with the preceding rhythm) depended on whether sound frequencies of entraining and target stimuli matched, in line with a tonotopical organisation. However, for the same experimental condition, best moments were not always consistent across experiments. We provide a speculative explanation for these differences that relies on the notion that neural entrainment and repetition-related adaptation might exercise competing, opposite influences on perception. Together, we find rhythmic echoes in auditory perception that seem more complex than those predicted from initial theories of neural entrainment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mega-scale movie-fields in the mouse visuo-hippocampal network</a></h4>

              
                Natural behavior often involves a continuous series of related images, often while the subject is immobile. How is this information processed across the cortico-hippocampal circuit? The hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory, but most rodent single unit studies require spatial exploration or active engagement. Hence, we investigated neural responses to a silent, iso-luminant, black and white movie in head-fixed mice without any task or locomotion demands, or rewards. The activity of most neurons (97%, 6554/6785) in the thalamo-cortical visual areas was significantly modulated by the 30s long movie clip. Surprisingly, a third (33%, 3379/10263) of hippocampal -dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum- neurons showed movie-selectivity, with elevated firing in specific movie sub-segments, termed movie-fields. On average, a cell had more than 5 movie-fields in visual areas, but only 2 in hippocampal areas. The movie-field durations in all brain regions spanned an unprecedented 1000-fold range: from 0.02s to 20s, termed mega-scale coding. Yet, the total duration of all the movie-fields of a cell was comparable across neurons and brain regions, partly due to broader movie-fields in hippocampal areas, indicating greater sequence coding. Consistently presentation of the movie images in a scrambled sequence virtually abolished hippocampal but not visual-cortical selectivity. The enhancement of sequential movie tuning compared to the scrambled sequence was eight-fold greater in hippocampal than visual areas, further supporting visual sequence encoding. Thus, a movie was encoded in all mouse-brain areas investigated. Similar results are likely to hold in primates and humans. Hence, movies could provide a unified way to probe neural mechanisms of non-spatial information processing and memory across brain regions and species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebral organoids expressing mutant actin genes reveal cellular mechanism underlying microcephalic cortical malformation</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic ACTB and ACTG1 gene variants, encoding the actin isoforms {beta}CYA and {gamma}CYA, respectively, are frequently associated with the Baraitser-Winter-CerebroFrontoFacial syndrome (BWCFF-S) that includes malformations of cortical development. Here we explore whether cerebral organoids grown from BWCFF-S patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells can provide insight into the pathogenesis underlying the cortical malformations of these patients. Cerebral organoids expressing either an ACTB or an ACTG1 gene variant, each with a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution, are reduced in size, showing smaller ventricle-like structures with a thinner ventricular zone (VZ). This decrease in VZ-progenitors is associated with a striking change in the orientation of their cleavage plane from predominantly vertical (control) to predominantly horizontal (BWCFF-S), which is incompatible with increasing VZ-progenitor abundance. The underlying cause appears to be an altered subcellular tubulin localization due to the actin mutations that affects mitotic spindle positioning of VZ-progenitors in BWCFF-S.

                Neural circuit assembly is a multi-step process where synaptic partners are often born at distinct developmental stages, and yet they must find each other and form precise synaptic connections with one another. This developmental process often relies on late-born neurons extending their processes to the appropriate layer to find and make synaptic connections to their early-born targets. The molecular mechanism responsible for the integration of late-born neurons into an emerging neural circuit remains unclear. Here we uncovered a new role for the cytoskeletal protein bII-spectrin in properly positioning pre- and post-synaptic neurons to the developing synaptic layer. Loss of bII-spectrin disrupts retinal lamination, leads to synaptic connectivity defects, and results in impaired visual function. Together, these findings highlight a new function of bII-spectrin in assembling neural circuits in the mouse outer retina.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep restores an optimal computational regime in cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is vitally important for brain function, yet its core process by which brain function is restored remains an open question. Sleep is assumed to subserve brain homeostatic processes; the proper compensatory tuning of circuits is necessary for stable function. Criticality, a computational regime that optimizes information processing capacity, is a homeostatically regulated set-point in isocortical circuits. Criticality is susceptible to degradation by experience-dependent plasticity. Whether criticality is the computational set-point of daily sleep is unknown. To address this question, we evaluated the effects of sleep and wake on emergent, computational dynamics in ensembles of cortical neurons recorded continuously for 10-14 d in freely behaving rats. We show that normal waking experience progressively disrupts criticality, and that sleep functions to restore critical dynamics. Criticality is a universal set-point across animals. We find that criticality is perturbed in a context-dependent manner depending on behavior and environmental variables, and that waking experience is causal in driving these effects. The degree of deviation from criticality is robustly predictive of future behavior. Our results demonstrate that perturbation and recovery of criticality is consistent with a network mechanism at the core of the heuristic Two Process Model, which has been used to describe sleep and wake cycles for 40 years. Summarily, our data suggest that restoration of an optimal computational regime is a key factor in determining why brains sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attention weights accurately predict language representations in the brain</a></h4>

              
                In Transformer-based language models (LMs) the attention mechanism converts token embeddings into contextual embeddings that incorporate information from neighboring words. The resulting contextual hidden state embeddings have enabled highly accurate models of brain responses, suggesting that the attention mechanism constructs contextual embeddings that carry information reflected in language-related brain representations. However, it is unclear whether the attention weights that are used to integrate information across words are themselves related to language representations in the brain. To address this question we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings of participants reading English language narratives. We provided the narrative text as input to two LMs (BERT and GPT-2) and extracted their corresponding attention weights. We then used encoding models to determine how well attention weights can predict recorded brain responses. We find that attention weights accurately predict brain responses in much of the frontal and temporal cortices. Our results suggest that the attention mechanism itself carries information that is reflected in brain representations. Moreover, these results indicate cortical areas in which context integration may occur.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Discrete Ricci curvatures capture age-related changes in human brain functional connectivity networks</a></h4>

              
                Geometry-inspired notions of discrete Ricci curvature have been successfully used as markers of disrupted brain connectivity in neuropsychiatric disorders, but their ability to characterize age-related changes in functional connectivity is unexplored. Here, we apply Forman-Ricci curvature and Ollivier-Ricci curvature to compare functional connectivity networks of healthy young and older subjects from the Max Planck Institute Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions (MPI-LEMON) dataset (N = 225). We found that both Forman-Ricci curvature and Ollivier-Ricci curvature can capture whole-brain and region-level age-related differences in functional connectivity. Meta-analysis decoding demonstrated that those brain regions with age-related curvature differences were associated with cognitive domains known to manifest age-related changes - movement, affective processing and somatosensory processing. Moreover, the curvature values of some brain regions showing age-related differences exhibited correlations with behavioral scores of affective processing. Finally, we found an overlap between brain regions showing age-related curvature differences and those brain regions whose non-invasive stimulation resulted in improved movement performance in older adults. These results suggest that both Forman-Ricci curvature and Ollivier-Ricci curvature correctly identify brain regions that are known to be functionally or clinically relevant. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating the sensitivity of discrete Ricci curvature measures to changes in the organisation of functional connectivity networks, both in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric coding of reward prediction errors in human insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The signed value and unsigned salience of reward prediction errors (RPEs) are critical to understanding reinforcement learning (RL) and cognitive control. Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and insula (INS) are key regions for integrating reward and surprise information, but conflicting evidence for both signed and unsigned activity has led to competing proposals for the nature of RPE representations in these brain areas. Recently, the distributional RL theory (dRL) has been used to explain RPE coding diversity in the rodent midbrain by proposing that dopaminergic neurons have differential sensitivity to positive and negative RPEs. Here, we use intracranially recorded high frequency activity (HFA) to show that this asymmetric scaling strategy captures RPE coding diversity in human dMPFC and INS. We found neural populations responding to valence-specific positive and negative RPEs, as well as unsigned RPE salience, which are spatially interleaved within each region. Furthermore, directional connectivity estimates suggest a leading role of INS in communicating positive and unsigned RPEs to dMPFC. These findings support asymmetric scaling across distinct but intermingled neural populations as a core principle in RPE coding, expand the scope of dRL, and reconcile longstanding theoretical debates on the role of dMPFC and INS in RL and cognitive control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trans-cellular control of synapse properties by a cell type-specific splicing regulator</a></h4>

              
                The recognition of synaptic partners and specification of synaptic properties are fundamental for the function of neuronal circuits. 'Terminal selector' transcription factors coordinate the expression of terminal gene batteries that specify cell type-specific properties. Moreover, pan-neuronal alternative splicing regulators have been implicated in directing neuronal differentiation. However, the cellular logic of how splicing regulators instruct specific synaptic properties remains poorly understood. Here, we combine genome-wide mapping of mRNA targets and cell type-specific loss-of-function studies to uncover the contribution of the nuclear RNA binding protein SLM2 to hippocampal synapse specification. Focusing on hippocampal pyramidal cells and SST-positive GABAergic interneurons, we find that SLM2 preferentially binds and regulates alternative splicing of transcripts encoding synaptic proteins, thereby generating cell type-specific isoforms. In the absence of SLM2, cell type-specification, differentiation, and viability are unaltered and neuronal populations exhibit normal intrinsic properties. By contrast, cell type-specific loss of SLM2 results in highly selective, non-cell autonomous synaptic phenotypes, altered synaptic transmission, and associated defects in a hippocampus-dependent memory task. Thus, alternative splicing provides a critical layer of gene regulation that instructs specification of neuronal connectivity in a trans-synaptic manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Controlling the bioelectrical properties of neurons with ferritin-based Magnetogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Magnetogenetics promises remote control of neurons, but its validity is questioned due to controversies surrounding the underlying mechanisms and deficits in reproducibility. Recent studies discovered that ferritin, used in Magnetogenetics, transduces radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields into biochemical signals (reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipids). Magnetic stimulation of ferritin-tethered TRPV channels induces Ca2+ responses and modulates behavior but electrophysiological studies indicate that a particular channel, Magneto2.0, is ineffective in affecting the neuronal bioelectrical properties. We investigated this problem using the Magnetogenetic technique FeRIC. We resolved the electromagnetic interference caused by RF in patch-clamp recordings and supported the data with voltage imaging experiments. In neurons expressing TRPV4FeRIC, RF depolarizes the membrane potential and increases the spiking frequency. In neurons expressing the chloride-permeable TMEM16AFeRIC, RF hyperpolarizes the membrane potential and decreases the spiking frequency. Our study reveals the control of neuronal bioelectrical properties with Magnetogenetics that is non-instantaneous, long-lasting, and moderate, but effective and comparable to that induced by endogenous signaling molecules.

                Mutations in the vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (VPS35) gene cause late-onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), with a single missense mutation (Asp620Asn, D620N) known to segregate with disease in families with PD. The VPS35 gene encodes a core component of the retromer complex, involved in the endosomal sorting and recycling of transmembrane cargo proteins. VPS35-linked PD is clinically indistinguishable from sporadic PD, although it is not yet known whether VPS35-PD brains exhibit -synuclein-positive brainstem Lewy pathology that is characteristic of sporadic cases. Prior studies have suggested a functional interaction between VPS35 and the PD-linked gene product -synuclein in lower organisms, where VPS35 deletion enhances -synuclein-induced toxicity. In mice, VPS35 overexpression is reported to rescue hippocampal neuronal loss in human -synuclein transgenic mice, potentially suggesting a retromer deficiency in these mice. Here, we employ multiple well-established genetic rodent models to explore a functional or pathological interaction between VPS35 and -synuclein in vivo. We find that endogenous -synuclein is dispensable for nigrostriatal pathway dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by the viral-mediated delivery of human D620N VPS35 in mice, suggesting that -synuclein does not operate downstream of VPS35. We next evaluated retromer levels in affected brain regions from human A53T--synuclein transgenic mice, but find normal levels of the core subunits VPS35, VPS26 or VPS29. We further find that heterozygous VPS35 deletion fails to alter the lethal neurodegenerative phenotype of these A53T--synuclein transgenic mice, suggesting the absence of retromer deficiency in this PD model. Finally, we explored the neuroprotective capacity of increasing VPS35 expression in a viral-based human wild-type -synuclein rat model of PD. However, we find that the overexpression of wild-type VPS35 is not sufficient for protection against -synuclein-induced nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration, -synuclein pathology and reactive gliosis. Collectively, our data suggest a limited interaction of VPS35 and -synuclein in neurodegenerative models of PD, and do not provide support for their interaction within a common pathophysiological pathway.

However, little is known about the brain mechanisms underlying the learning of novel tasks. Specifically, it is unclear to what extent learning of different tasks depends on domain-general and/or domain-specific brain mechanisms. Here human subjects (N=45) learned to perform six new tasks while undergoing functional MRI. The different tasks required the engagement of perceptual, motor, and various cognitive processes (attention, expectation, speed-accuracy tradeoff, and metacognition). We found that a bilateral frontoparietal network was more active during the initial compared to the later stages of task learning, and that this effect was stronger for task variants requiring more new learning. Critically, the same frontoparietal network was engaged by all six tasks, demonstrating its domain generality. Finally, although task learning decreased the overall activity in the frontoparietal network, it increased the connectivity strength between the different nodes of that network. These results demonstrate the existence of a domain-general brain network whose activity and connectivity reflect learning for a wide variety of new tasks, and thus may underlie the human capacity for acquiring new abilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of prefrontal cortex and striatal regions in rats after shifting between rules in a T-maze</a></h4>

              
                Prefrontal cortical and striatal areas have been identified by inactivation or lesion studies to be required for behavioral flexibility, including selecting and processing of different types of information. In order to identify these networks activated selectively during acquisition of new reward contingency rules, rats were trained to discriminate orientations of bars presented in pseudo-random sequence on two video monitors positioned behind the goal sites on a T maze with return arms. A second group already trained in the visual discrimination task learned to alternate left and right goal arm visits in the same maze while ignoring the visual cues still being presented. In each experimental group, once the rats reached criterion performance, the brains were prepared after a 90 minute delay, for later processing for c-fos immunohistochemistry. While both groups extinguished a prior strategy and acquired a new rule, they differed by the identity of the strategies, and previous learning experience. Among the 28 forebrain areas examined, there were significant increases in the relative density of c-fos immunoreactive cell bodies after learning the second rule in prefrontal cortex cingulate, prelimbic and infralimbic areas, in dorsomedial striatum and the core of nucleus accumbens, in ventral subiculum, and the central nucleus of the amygdala. These largely correspond to structures anatomically identified by previous inactivation studies. The data suggest that this dynamic network may underlie reward-based selection for action, a type of cognitive flexibility.

                Datasets collected in neuroscientific studies are of ever-growing complexity, often combining high dimensional time series data from multiple data acquisition modalities. Handling and manipulating these various data streams in an adequate programming environment is crucial to ensure reliable analysis, and to facilitate sharing of reproducible analysis pipelines. Here, we present Pynapple, a lightweight python package designed to process a broad range of time-resolved data in systems neuroscience. The core feature of this package is a small number of versatile objects that support the manipulation of any data streams and task parameters. The package includes a set of methods to read common data formats and allows users to easily write their own. The resulting code is easy to read and write, avoids low-level data processing and other error-prone steps, and is fully open source. Libraries for higher-level analyses are developed within the Pynapple framework but are contained within in a collaborative repository of specialized and continuously updated analysis routines. This provides flexibility while ensuring long-term stability of the core package. In conclusion, Pynapple provides a common framework for data analysis in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Redundant representations are required to disambiguate simultaneously presented complex stimuli</a></h4>

              
                An individual observing a barking dog and purring cat together in a field has distinct pairs of representations of the two animals in their visual and auditory systems. Without prior knowledge, how does the observer infer that the dog barks and the cat purrs? This integration of distributed representations is called the assignment problem, and it must be solved to integrate distinct representations across but also within sensory modalities. Here, we identify and analyze a solution to the assignment problem: the representation of one or more common stimulus features in pairs of relevant brain regions -- for example, estimates of the spatial position of both the cat and the dog represented in both the visual and auditory systems. We characterize how the reliability of this solution depends on different features of the stimulus set (e.g., the size of the set and the complexity of the stimuli) and the details of the split representations (e.g., the precision of each stimulus representation and the amount of overlapping information). Next, we implement this solution in a biologically plausible receptive field code and show how constraints on the number of neurons and spikes used by the code force the brain to navigate a tradeoff between local and catastrophic errors. We show that, when many spikes and neurons are available, representing stimuli from a single sensory modality can be done more reliably across multiple brain regions, despite the risk of assignment errors. Finally, we show that a feedforward neural network can learn the optimal solution to the assignment problem. We also discuss relevant results on assignment errors from the human working memory literature and show that several key predictions of our theory already have support.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of random and systematic visual stimulation on entrained infraslow quasi-periodic global waves in human brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Infraslow (<0.1Hz) electric activity, involved in attention and arousal fluctuations, serve as the unique neurophysiological basis for infraslow BOLD fluctuations. Particularly, the dynamics of infraslow electrical activity in both resting and task-performing human brains exhibit a quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) of consistent, phase-locked spatiotemporal BOLD signal changes. However, it is unclear how environmental stimuli affect the infraslow dynamic QPP or how the ongoing infraslow dynamics might modify the response to the environment in awake humans. To investigate this, we presented checkerboard sequences flashing at 8Hz to subjects. This is a salient visual stimulus that is known to produce a strong response in visual processing regions. Three central questions were investigated: 1) how does visual stimulation affect the QPPs compared to rest, 2) how does variability in visual stimulus onset affect the QPPs, and 3) how does the BOLD response to visual stimuli depend on the phases of the QPPs. Two different visual stimulation sequences were employed, a systematic stimulation sequence in which the visual stimulus appeared every 20.3 secs and a random stimulation sequence in which the visual stimulus occurred randomly every 14~62.3 secs. Three central observations emerged. First, the systematic condition produced a different spatiotemporal pattern of infraslow dynamics compared to both the resting-state and the random stimulation conditions. Second, the QPP was more frequent in the systematic condition with significantly shorter intervals between consecutive QPPs compared to the random condition. Third, the BOLD signal response to the visual stimulus across both conditions was swamped by the QPP at the stimulus onset. These results provide novel insights into the relationship between intrinsic patterns and task-evoked brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide oscillatory network selectively encodes aggression</a></h4>

              
                Social aggression is an innate behavior that can aid an organism in securing access to resources. Aggression can also disrupt group function and reduce survival under conditions of behavioral pathology. Since many brain regions contribute to multiple social behaviors, expanded knowledge of how the brain encodes distinct social states would enable the development of interventions that suppress aggression, while leaving other social behaviors intact. Here we show that murine aggression is optimally encoded by a brain-wide network. This network is organized by prominent theta (4-11Hz) and beta (14-30Hz) oscillations, leading from orbital frontal cortex and medial dorsal thalamus, and converging on ventral medial hypothalamus and medial amygdala. Activity in this network is coupled to brain-wide cellular firing, and the network is conserved in new mice from multiple genetic backgrounds, and in multiple contexts. Finally, we develop a closed loop stimulation protocol based on network activity levels. This protocol suppressed aggression, but not pro-social behavior. Thus, we defined a causal brain-wide network that selectively encodes aggressive behavior across mice and established a new approach for state specific control of affective behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A thermodynamical model of non-deterministic computation in cortical neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex engage in probabilistic coding, effectively encoding the state of the surrounding environment with high accuracy and extraordinary energy efficiency. A new approach models the inherently probabilistic nature of cortical neuron signaling outcomes as a thermodynamic process of non-deterministic computation. A mean field approach is used, with the trial Hamiltonian maximizing free energy and minimizing the net quantity of temperature-entropy, compared with a reference Hamiltonian. Thermodynamic quantities are always conserved during the computation; free energy must be expended to produce information, and free energy is released during information compression, as correlations are identified between the encoding system and its surrounding environment. Due to the relationship between the Gibbs free energy equation and the Nernst equation, any increase in free energy is paired with a local decrease in membrane potential. As a result, this process of thermodynamic computation adjusts the likelihood of each neuron firing an action potential. This model shows that non-deterministic signaling outcomes can be achieved by noisy cortical neurons, through an energy-efficient computational process that involves optimally redistributing a Hamiltonian over some time evolution. Calculations demonstrate that the energy efficiency of the human brain is consistent with this model of non-deterministic computation, with net entropy production far too low to retain the assumptions of a classical system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling electron interference at the neuronal membrane yields a holographic projection of representative information content</a></h4>

              
                It has historically proven difficult to explain the relationship between neural activity and representative information content. A new approach focuses on the unique properties of cortical neurons, which allow both upstream signals and random electrical noise to affect the likelihood of reaching action potential threshold. Here, each electron is modeled as an electromagnetic point source, interacting in a probabilistic manner with each neuronal membrane. The electron is described as some set of probability amplitudes, distributed across five orthogonal axes: x, y, z, energy state, and time. The membrane potential of each neuron is defined by the probabilistic spatial position and atomic orbital of each local electron, after some time evolution. The mixed sum of all probabilistic component pure states is the physical quantity of information held by the neural network, given by a complex-valued wavefunction. If the probabilistic trajectory of each electron over time t affects the voltage state of multiple computational units, then the system state must be computed as a whole, with the state of each neuron being resolved as every component pure state is resolved. This computational process yields a defined system state at a defined location in time, which immediately becomes the past as a new probability density forms. If the membrane surface of each computational unit is also a charge-detecting polymer substrate that meets the criteria of a holographic recording surface, then this encoding process will generate a holographic projection of representative information content. The constructive and destructive interference of high-dimensional probability amplitudes yields a non-deterministic computational outcome for each neuron. That now-defined system state is paired with a multi-sensory percept, which is exclusively accessed by the encoding structure, with content limited by the range and sensitivity of the sensory apparatus. This model usefully offers a plausible explanation for both perceptual content and non-deterministic computational outcomes emerging from cortical neural network activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Random electrical noise drives non-deterministic computation in cortical neural networks</a></h4>

              
                In cortical neurons, spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations affect the likelihood of firing an action potential. Yet despite retaining sensitivity to random electrical noise in gating signaling outcomes, these cells achieve highly accurate computations with extraordinary energy efficiency. A new approach models the inherently probabilistic nature of cortical neuron firing as a thermodynamic process of non-deterministic computation. Typically, the cortical neuron is modeled as a binary computational unit, in either an off-state or an on-state, but here, the cortical neuron is modeled as a two-state quantum system, with some probability of switching from an off-state to an on-state. This approach explicitly takes into account the contribution of random electrical noise in gating signaling outcomes, particularly during cortical up-states. In this model, the membrane potential is described as the mixed sum of all component microstates, or the quantity of von Neumann entropy encoded by the computational unit. This distribution of macrostates is given by a density matrix, which undergoes a unitary change of basis as each unit, System A, interacts with its surrounding environment, System B. Any linear correlations reduce the number of distinguishable pure states, leading to the selection of an optimal system state in the present context. This process of information compression is shown to be equivalent to the extraction of predictive value from a thermodynamic quantity of information. Calculations demonstrate that estimated coulomb scattering profiles and decoherence timescales in cortical neurons are consistent with a quantum system, with random electrical noise driving signaling outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The mechanics underpinning non-deterministic computation in cortical neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neurons allow random electrical noise to contribute to the likelihood of firing a signal. Previous approaches have involved statistically modeling signaling outcomes in neuronal populations, or modeling the dynamical relationship between membrane potential, ion channel activation, and ion conductance in individual neurons. However, these methods do not mechanistically account for the role of random electrical noise in gating the action potential. Here, the membrane potential of a cortical neuron is modeled as the uncertainty in all component pure states, or the amount of information encoded by that computational unit. With this approach, each neuron computes the probability of transitioning from an off-state to an on-state, with the macrostate of each computational unit being a function of all component microstates. Component pure states are integrated into a physical quantity of information, and the derivative of this high-dimensional probability density yields eigenvalues, or an internally-consistent observable system state at a defined point in time. In accordance with the Hellman-Feynman theorem, the resolution of the system state is paired with a spontaneous shift in charge distribution, and so this defined system state instantly becomes the past as a new probability density emerges. This model of Hamiltonian mechanics produces testable predictions regarding the wavelength of free energy released upon information compression. Overall, this model demonstrates how cortical neurons might achieve non-deterministic signaling outcomes through noisy coincidence detection.

                Astrocytes play a critical role in brain homeostasis and normal functions but their changes along the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology remain largely unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing on brain regions along the stereotypical progression of AD pathology from donors ranging the entire normal aging-AD continuum comprising 628,943 astrocyte nuclei from 32 donors across 5 brain regions. We discovered temporal gene-expression-trajectories with gene sets differentially activated at various disease stages. Surprisingly, a gene set enriched in proteostasis and energy metabolism, was upregulated in late-stage but unexpectedly returned to baseline levels in end-stage, suggesting exhaustion of response in "burnt-out" astrocytes. The spatial gene-expression-trajectories revealed that astrocytic genes of tripartite synapses are dysregulated in parallel to the stereotypical progression of tangle pathology across regions. We identified astrocyte heterogeneity across brain regions with a continuum from homeostatic to reactive cells through "intermediate" transitional states. These findings suggest complex astrocytic dysfunction in AD neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abstract deliberation by visuomotor neurons in prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                During visually guided behavior, the prefrontal cortex plays a pivotal role in mapping sensory inputs onto appropriate motor plans. When the sensory input is ambiguous, this involves deliberation. It is not known whether the deliberation is implemented as a competition between possible stimulus interpretations or between possible motor plans. Here we study neural population activity in prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys trained to flexibly report categorical judgments of ambiguous visual stimuli. Our task design allowed for the dissociation of neural predictors of the upcoming categorical choice and the upcoming motor response used to report this choice. We find that the population activity initially represents the formation of a categorical choice before transitioning into the stereotypical representation of the motor plan. We show that stimulus strength and prior expectations both bear on the formation of the categorical choice, but not on the formation of the action plan. These results suggest that prefrontal circuits involved in action selection are also used for the deliberation of abstract propositions divorced from a specific motor plan, thus providing a crucial mechanism for abstract reasoning.

	<p>Neural entrainment to musical rhythm is thought to underlie the perception and production of music. In aging populations, the strength of neural entrainment to rhythm has been found to be attenuated, particularly during attentive listening to auditory streams. However, previous studies on neural entrainment to rhythm and aging have often employed artificial auditory rhythms or limited pieces of recorded, naturalistic music, failing to account for the diversity of rhythmic structures found in natural music. As part of larger project assessing a novel music-based intervention for healthy aging, we investigated neural entrainment to musical rhythms in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened to self-selected musical recordings across a sample of younger and older adults. We specifically measured neural entrainment to the level of musical pulse&amp;amp;mdash;quantified here as the phase-locking value (PLV)&amp;amp;mdash;after normalizing the PLVs to each musical recording&amp;amp;rsquo;s detected pulse frequency. As predicted, we observed strong neural phase-locking to musical pulse, and to the sub-harmonic and harmonic levels of musical meter. Overall, PLVs were not significantly different between older and younger adults. This preserved neural entrainment to musical pulse and rhythm could support the design of music-based interventions that aim to modulate endogenous brain activity via self-selected music for healthy cognitive aging.</p>

	<p>PICALM rs3851179, one of the genes most frequently linked to susceptibility of late-onset Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (LOAD), plays a crucial role in regulating amyloid precursor protein, and amyloid &amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) transcytosis. To explore the effects of PICALM and AD continuum stage on cortex thickness, CSF A&amp;amp;beta;, and tau, 188 cognitively normal controls, 261 MCI patients, and 140 early LOAD patients were recruited, and each group was divided into rs3851179 A-carriers and GG-carriers. A full factorial ANCOVA was used to analyze the main effects and interactive effects of AD continuum stage, and PICALM. The interactive effects of AD continuum stage and PICALM on cortex thickness and CSF biomarkers were not significant. The main effect of PICALM was significant on the left postcentral cortex thickness, and the cortex thickness of A-carriers was less than that of GG-carriers. The rs3851179 A-carriers displayed higher A&amp;amp;beta;42 levels and A&amp;amp;beta;42/40 ratios, and lower P/T&amp;amp;ndash;tau ratios, compared with GG-carriers. A higher MMSE score was found in A-carriers among the LOAD patients. In conclusion, the main effects of PICALM were independent of AD continuum stage, and PICLAM rs3851179 genotypes may modulate left postcentral cortex thickness, A&amp;amp;beta;42 level, and P/T&amp;amp;ndash;tau ratio. The rs3851179 A-allele may protect the cognitive function of LOAD patients.</p>

	<p>Background: New trials are planned regularly to provide the highest quality of evidence and invade new occlusion territories, which requires a pre-defined reporting strategy with consistent, common data elements for more straightforward collective evidence synthesis. We sought to review all active endovascular thrombectomy trials to investigate their patient selection criteria, intervention description, and reported outcomes. Methods: A literature search was systematically conducted on clinicaltrials.gov for active trials and all intervention, inclusion criteria, and outcomes reported were extracted. A qualitative synthesis of the frequency of study design types and data elements are graphically and narratively presented. Results: A total of 32 studies were tagged and included in the final qualitative analysis. The inclusion criteria were highly variable, including different cut-offs for the last well-known baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, and modified Rankin scale (mRS). Half of the studies (16/32) mentioned &amp;amp;ldquo;thrombectomy&amp;amp;rdquo; without defining which technique or device was used, and the final thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale was provided in 19 (59.4%) studies. Heterogeneity was also present among the studies reporting a first-pass effect, both in how studies defined the outcome and in used ranges for mRS. Mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were more homogenous in their presentation and follow-up. Conclusions: There is a great degree of heterogeneity in the active thrombectomy trials concerning inclusion criteria, interventions used, and how outcomes are being reported.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness. This study used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the effects of music therapy on brain networks in MDD patients and to elucidate changes in functional brain connectivity in subjects before and after musical stimulation. EEG signals were collected from eight MDD patients and eight healthy controls. The phase locking value was adopted to calculate the EEG correlation of different channels in different frequency bands. Correlation matrices and network topologies were studied to analyze changes in functional connectivity between brain regions. The results of the experimental analysis found that the connectivity of the delta and beta bands decreased, while the connectivity of the alpha band increased. Regarding the characteristics of the EEG functional network, the average clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and degree of each node in the delta band decreased significantly after musical stimulation, while the characteristic path length in the beta band increased significantly. Characterized by the average clustering coefficient and characteristic path length, the classification of depression and healthy controls reached 93.75% using a support vector machine.</p>

	<p>Motor and cognitive rehabilitation in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a growing field of clinical and research interest. In fact, novel rehabilitative approaches allow a very early verticalization and gait training through robotic devices and other innovative tools boosting neuroplasticity, thanks to the high-intensity, repetitive and task-oriented training. In the same way, cognitive rehabilitation is also evolving towards advanced interventions using virtual reality (VR), computer-based approaches, telerehabilitation and neuromodulation devices. This review aimed to systematically investigate the existing evidence concerning the role of innovative technologies in the motor and cognitive neurorehabilitation of TBI patients. We searched and reviewed the studies published in the Cochrane Library, PEDro, PubMed and Scopus between January 2012 and September 2022. After an accurate screening, only 29 papers were included in this review. This systematic review has demonstrated the beneficial role of innovative technologies when applied to cognitive rehabilitation in patients with TBI, while evidence of their effect on motor rehabilitation in this patient population is poor and still controversial.</p>

	<p>(1) Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of high altitude on inhibitory control processes that underlie sustained attention in the neural correlates of EEG data, and explore whether the EEG data reflecting inhibitory control contain valuable information to classify high-altitude chronic hypoxia and plain controls. (2) Methods: 35 chronic high-altitude hypoxic adults and 32 matched controls were recruited. They were required to perform the go/no-go sustained attention task (GSAT) using event-related potentials. Three machine learning algorithms, namely a support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and a decision tree (DT), were trained based on the related ERP components and neural oscillations to build a dichotomous classification model. (3) Results: Behaviorally, we found that the high altitude (HA) group had lower omission error rates during all observation periods than the low altitude (LA) group. Meanwhile, the ERP results showed that the HA participants had significantly shorter latency than the LAs for sustained potential (SP), indicating vigilance to response-related conflict. Meanwhile, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis suggested that lowlander immigrants exposed to high altitudes may have compensatory activated prefrontal cortexes (PFC), as reflected by slow alpha, beta, and theta frequency-band neural oscillations. Finally, the machine learning results showed that the SVM achieved the optimal classification F1 score in the later stage of sustained attention, with an F1 score of 0.93, accuracy of 92.54%, sensitivity of 91.43%, specificity of 93.75%, and area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97. The results proved that SVM classification algorithms could be applied to identify chronic high-altitude hypoxia. (4) Conclusions: Compared with other methods, the SVM leads to a good overall performance that increases with the time spent on task, illustrating that the ERPs and neural oscillations may provide neuroelectrophysiological markers for identifying chronic plateau hypoxia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mental health status of women in reproductive age group and its determinants in rural Odisha, India using GHQ 12 questionnaire [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The study was conceived with support from the Department of Health Research (DHR), India to use the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), to screen women in the reproductive age group, stratified for pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant and non-lactate women (NPNL), for their mental health status and examine it with their social background to understand the influences around their mental health.   Methods: By multistage sampling, subcenters were selected from 6 districts; women in the 3 groups were selected proportionately in each district, and data was collected on the basis of a pre-tested, pre-designed questionnaire along with the GHQ-12.   Results: Results showed GHQ-12 scores across the 3 categories of women are nearly the same with no significant difference (p=0.91). The higher GHQ (scores >11 to 36) were also noted to be equal for pregnant and lactating women i.e. 41.4% and mildly less for NPNL women 40.7%, reaffirming that pregnancy and the postnatal period add more stress to the woman’s life. Age of the women, age at marriage, hemoglobin levels, and poor Iron Folic Acid (IFA) intake were common predictors for poor mental health in all the 3 strata.  Conclusions: The study suggests that psychological stressors are cross-sectionally present in all three groups of women in the reproductive age group and all three strata need equal focus. Above 40% distress in mental health in women in all strata of the reproductive age group (ie pregnant women, post-natal women, and women not pregnant or lactating) is appalling, contrary to the general opinion that post-natal women alone face mental health compromise. Hence, the life cycle approach is recommended for best results.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The odd log-logistic generalized exponential distribution: Application on survival times of chemotherapy patients data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The creation of developing new generalized classes of distributions has attracted applied and theoretical statisticians owing to their properties of flexibility. The development of generalized distribution aims to find distribution flexibility and suitability for available data. In this decade, most authors have developed classes of distributions that are new, to become valuable for applied researchers. Methods: This study aims to develop the odd log-logistic generalized exponential distribution (OLLGED), one of the lifetime newly generated distributions in the field of statistics. The advantage of the newly generated distribution is the heavily tailed distributed lifetime data set. Most of the probabilistic properties are derived including generating functions, moments, and quantile and order statistics. Results: Estimation of the model parameter is done by the maximum likelihood method. The performance of parametric estimation is studied through simulation. Application of OLLGED and its flexibilities is done using two data sets and while its performance is done on the randomly simulated data set. Conclusions: The application and flexibility of the OLLGED are ensured through empirical observation using two sets of lifetime data, establishing that the proposed OLLGED can provide a better fit in comparison to existing rival models, such as odd generalized log-logistic, type-II generalized log-logistic, exponential distributions, odd exponential log-logistic, generalized exponential, and log-logistic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Oral manifestations associated with Novel Coronavirus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19): A questionnaire based hypothetical study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019, the virus has evolved drastically, presenting with sets of mutations that influence its properties, including transmissibility and antigenicity. The oral mucosa is postulated as probable portal entry and several oral manifestations have been identified, which places dental professionals in a position to recognize probable COVID-19 patients depending on oral signs and symptoms in the initial phases of the disease itself. As co-existing with COVID-19 seems to be a new reality, greater understanding is required regarding early oral signs and symptoms which can be predictors for timely intervention and prevention of complications in COVID-19 patients. The objective of the study is to identify the distinguishing oral signs and symptoms among COVID-19 patients and to establish possible correlation between severity of COVID-19 infection and oral symptoms. Methods: This study recruited 179 ambulatory, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province's designated hotels for COVID-19 and home isolated patients from the same region using a convenience sample method. Data was collected by qualified and experienced investigators, including two physicians and three dentists, using a validated comprehensive questionnaire through telephonic interviews with the participants. The X2 was used to assess the categorical variables, and odd's ratio was calculated to determine the strength of the association between general symptoms and oral manifestations. Results: Oral and nasopharyngeal lesions or conditions like loss of smell and taste, xerostomia, sore throat, and burning sensation were predictors of COVID-19-related systemic symptoms such as cough, fatigue, fever, and nasal congestion were identified to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions: The study reveals the occurrence of olfactory or taste dysfunction, dry mouth, sore throat, and burning sensation along with COVID-19 generic symptoms, should be considered as suggestive yet not conclusive indicators of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A rapid review of the prevalence and onset of urticaria triggered by COVID-19 vaccine [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is essential to reduce the spread of this disease virus and is very effective at preventing patients with severe symptoms of the disease from dying. As of February 2022, more than 10 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide, and at least 60% of the world's population have received the first dose of the vaccine. The increasing number of populations receiving the COVID-19 vaccine has increased reports of post-immunization follow-up events, one of which is urticaria. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: This study used a rapid review method based on previous research on the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the COVID-19 vaccine. The articles were obtained from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The inclusion criteria were articles containing data on the prevalence and onset of urticaria due to the COVID-19 vaccine, published from December 2020 – January 2022. Results: From the search results and article selection, 20 articles were included in this study. There are 7 articles containing prevalence data, 11 articles containing onset data, and 2 articles containing prevalence and onset data. Research in these articles was conducted in several different countries. There were seven types of vaccine used with doses of 1 or 2. The sample age ranged from 16 to 76 years. In all of the articles, the sample and the incidence of urticaria were mostly female. There were a history of allergies and atopic history in the sample studied. Conclusion: The prevalence rate of urticaria in the population given the COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 0.035% to 3.2%. The time of onset of urticaria in the population given the COVID-19 vaccine ranged from 5 minutes to 10 days.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of Albania's diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union during the years 1948-1959 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper aims to shed light on a very intense period of relations between Albania and the Soviet Union (USSR), focusing on the period from 1948 with the intensification of Albania's relations with the USSR until the termination of diplomatic relations in 1959. The main objective of this paper is to know the truth of the relations of the USSR and its behavior with Albania. Methods: The paper focuses on analyzing this period as a case study, selecting three levels (context-actors-outcomes). Evaluation of the period (1948-1959) is done through the identification of key indicators and the implications of the relationship in domestic and international contexts. The sources used include documents, interviews, films, newspapers, and books. We requested permission to use the Archival resources of the Albanian Central State Archives (AQSH), where they made some accessible non-state secret resources workable only within the archive available to us. Results: The facts show that the relations between Albania and the USSR benefitted Albania more. particularly with a lot of economic support from the USSR, which helped Albania emerge from crisis and build the so-called ‘socialist state’. Through these relations and contributions, Albania took its place in the international arena. We find that this may be because of the geographical position of Albania, as the construction of the Pashaliman naval base and the bay of Vlora indicates. Conclusions: This study tries to demystify this relationship that has had a lot of ambiguity cast over it. Documents of the AQSH do not provide an unbiased overview, as they were compiled with an ideologically charged spirit, making it difficult for researchers to reach conclusions without ideological input from both sides. We hope that we will have the opportunity to access restricted documents to provide a clearer picture of the relations between Albania and the USSR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community review: a robust and scalable selection system for resource allocation within open science and innovation communities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Resource allocation is essential to selection and implementation of innovative projects in science and technology. Current “winner-take-all” models for grant applications require significant researcher time in writing extensive project proposals, and rely on the availability of a few time-saturated volunteer experts. Such processes usually carry over several months, resulting in high effective costs compared to expected benefits. We devised an agile “community review” system to allocate micro-grants for the fast prototyping of innovative solutions. Here we describe and evaluate the implementation of this community review across 147 projects from the “Just One Giant Lab’s OpenCOVID19 initiative” and “Helpful Engineering” open research communities. The community review process uses granular review forms and requires the participation of grant applicants in the review process. Within a year, we organised 7 rounds of review, resulting in 614 reviews from 201 reviewers, and the attribution of 48 micro-grants of up to 4,000 euros. The system is fast, with a median process duration of 10 days, scalable, with a median of 4 reviewers per project independent of the total number of projects, and fair, with project rankings highly preserved after the synthetic removal of reviewers. Regarding potential bias introduced by involving applicants in the process, we find that review scores from both applicants and non-applicants have a similar correlation of r=0.28 with other reviews within a project, matching traditional approaches. Finally, we find that the ability of projects to apply to several rounds allows to foster the further implementation of successful early prototypes, as well as provide a pathway to constructively improve an initially failing proposal in an agile manner. Overall, this study quantitatively highlights the benefits of a frugal, community review system acting as a due diligence for rapid and agile resource allocation in open research and innovation programs, with implications for decentralised communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: The first reported case of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with myasthenia gravis in a 27-year-old patient [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a very rare diffuse lung disease characterized by the accumulation of amorphous and periodic acid Schiff-positive lipoproteinaceous material in the alveolar spaces due to impaired surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. Three main types were identified: Autoimmune, secondary and congenital. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis has been previously reported to be associated with several systemic auto-immune diseases. Accordingly, we present the first case report of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with myasthenia gravis. Case: A 27-year-old female patient, ex-smoker, developed a dyspnea on exertion in 2020. The chest X-ray detected diffuse symmetric alveolar opacities. Pulmonary infection was ruled out, particularly COVID-19 infection. The chest scan revealed the “crazy paving” pattern. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed a rosy liquid with granular acellular eosinophilic material Periodic acid-Schiff positive. According to the lung biopsy results, she was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies were negative. Nine months later, she was diagnosed with bulbar seronegative myasthenia gravis, confirmed with the electroneuromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation showing significant amplitude decrement of the trapezius and spinal muscles. She was treated with pyridostigmine, oral corticosteroids and azathioprine. Given the worsening respiratory condition of the patient, a bilateral whole lung lavage was performed with a partial resolution of symptoms. Thus, this previously unreported association was treated successfully with rituximab, including improvement of dyspnea, diplopia and muscle fatigability at six months of follow-up. Conclusions: This case emphasizes on the possible association of auto-immune disease to PAP, which could worsen the disease course, as the specific treatment does not exist yet. Hence, further studies are needed to establish clear-cut guidelines for PAP management, particularly when associated to auto-immune diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the spatial dynamics of oncolytic virotherapy in the presence of virus-resistant tumour cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Darshak Kartikey Bhatt, Thijs Janzen, Toos Daemen, Franz J. Weissing</p>

Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising form of cancer treatment that uses native or genetically engineered viruses to target, infect and kill cancer cells. Unfortunately, this form of therapy is not effective in a substantial proportion of cancer patients, partly due to the occurrence of infection-resistant tumour cells. To shed new light on the mechanisms underlying therapeutic failure and to discover strategies that improve therapeutic efficacy we designed a cell-based model of viral infection. The model allows us to investigate the dynamics of infection-sensitive and infection-resistant cells in tumour tissue in presence of the virus. To reflect the importance of the spatial configuration of the tumour on the efficacy of virotherapy, we compare three variants of the model: two 2D models of a monolayer of tumour cells and a 3D model. In all model variants, we systematically investigate how the therapeutic outcome is affected by the properties of the virus (e.g. the rate of viral spread), the tumour (e.g. production rate of resistant cells, cost of resistance), the healthy stromal cells (e.g. degree of resistance to the virus) and the timing of treatment. We find that various therapeutic outcomes are possible when resistant cancer cells arise at low frequency in the tumour. These outcomes depend in an intricate but predictable way on the death rate of infected cells, where faster death leads to rapid virus clearance and cancer persistence. Our simulations reveal three different causes of therapy failure: rapid clearance of the virus, rapid selection of resistant cancer cells, and a low rate of viral spread due to the presence of infection-resistant healthy cells. Our models suggest that improved therapeutic efficacy can be achieved by sensitizing healthy stromal cells to infection, although this remedy has to be weighed against the toxicity induced in the healthy tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Coloring coral larvae allows tracking of local dispersal and settlement</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Doropoulos, George Roff</p>

Quantifying patterns of dispersal and settlement in marine benthic invertebrates is challenging, largely due the complexity of life history traits, small sizes of larvae (<1 mm), and potential for large-scale dispersal (>100 km) in the marine environment. Here, we develop a novel method that allows for immediate differentiation and visual tracking of large numbers of coral larvae (10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup>) from dispersal to settlement. Neutral red and Nile blue stains were extremely effective in coloring larvae, with minimal impacts on survival and settlement following optimization of incubation times and stain concentrations. Field validation to wild-captured larvae from the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates the efficacy of staining across diverse taxa. The method provides a simple, rapid (<60 minutes), low-cost (approximately USD$1 per 10<sup>5</sup> larva) tool to color coral larvae that facilitates a wide range of de novo laboratory and field studies of larval behavior and ecology with potential applications for conservation planning and understanding patterns of connectivity.

Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, they demonstrate that miR-17∼92 regulates neural stem cell proliferation, modulates transit amplifying cell heterogeneity by repressing an oligodendrogenic program, and affects intraventricular oligodendrocyte progenitors.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The insulin and IGF signaling pathway sustains breast cancer stem cells by IRS2/PI3K-mediated regulation of MYC</a></h4>

              
                Lee et al. show that the insulin/IGF signaling pathway regulates breast cancer stem cell (CSC) function in an IRS2- and PI3K-dependent manner. This regulation involves the activation and stabilization of MYC, as shown by the ability of a stable T58A-MYC mutant to restore CSC function in IRS2−/− cells.

                RNA can become trapped in DNA to form stable R loops, which threaten genomic stability. Hodson et al. identify branchpoint translocation as a potent mechanism of R-loop removal. Branchpoint translocases such as FANCM, SMARCAL1, and ZRANB3 are associated with human disease and, additively, suppress R-loop formation and maintain genome stability.

                The factors defining chromosome shape remain an unresolved enigma. Here, Kakui et al. compare chromosome dimensions between yeasts and humans. They find that chromosomes are characterized by species-specific widths but also that within each species, longer chromosome arms are always wider. These observations challenge current models of mitotic chromosome formation.

                The precise cues driving monocyte functional diversity in cancer remain unclear. Here, Kwart et al. demonstrate that cancer cell-derived type I interferons drive polarization of a phenotypically distinct subset of immunostimulatory tumor monocytes associated with response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.

Tang et al. report a type VI secretion system (T6SS)-delivered toxin in V. parahaemolyticus, RhsP, which contains a VrgG2-interacting region (VIR). The VIR alters conformation upon RhsP autoproteolysis and promotes RhsP dimerization, which is essential for prey targeting by V. parahaemolyticus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A unified framework for measuring selection on cellular lineages and traits</a></h4>

              
                Intracellular states probed by gene expression profiles and metabolic activities are intrinsically noisy, causing phenotypic variations among cellular lineages. Understanding the adaptive and evolutionary roles of such variations requires clarifying their linkage to population growth rates. Extending a cell lineage statistics framework, here we show that a population’s growth rate can be expanded by the cumulants of a fitness landscape that characterize how fitness distributes in a population. The expansion enables quantifying the contribution of each cumulant, such as variance and skewness, to population growth. We introduce a function that contains all the essential information of cell lineage statistics, including mean lineage fitness and selection strength. We reveal a relation between fitness heterogeneity and population growth rate response to perturbation. We apply the framework to experimental cell lineage data from bacteria to mammalian cells, revealing distinct levels of growth rate gain from fitness heterogeneity across environments and organisms. Furthermore, third or higher order cumulants’ contributions are negligible under constant growth conditions but could be significant in regrowing processes from growth-arrested conditions. We identify cellular populations in which selection leads to an increase of fitness variance among lineages in retrospective statistics compared to chronological statistics. The framework assumes no particular growth models or environmental conditions, and is thus applicable to various biological phenomena for which phenotypic heterogeneity and cellular proliferation are important.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The clinical pharmacology of tafenoquine in the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria: An individual patient data meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Tafenoquine is a newly licensed antimalarial drug for the radical cure of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria. The mechanism of action and optimal dosing are uncertain. We pooled individual data from 1102 patients and 72 healthy volunteers studied in the pre-registration trials. We show that tafenoquine dose is the primary determinant of efficacy. Under an Emax model, we estimate the currently recommended 300 mg dose in a 60 kg adult (5 mg/kg) results in 70% of the maximal obtainable hypnozoiticidal effect. Increasing the dose to 7.5 mg/kg (i.e. 450 mg) would result in 90% reduction in the risk of <i>P. vivax</i> recurrence. After adjustment for dose, the tafenoquine terminal elimination half-life, and day 7 methaemoglobin concentration, but not the parent compound exposure, were also associated with recurrence. These results suggest that the production of oxidative metabolites is central to tafenoquine’s hypnozoiticidal efficacy. Clinical trials of higher tafenoquine doses are needed to characterise their efficacy, safety and tolerability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Desiccation resistance differences in Drosophila species can be largely explained by variations in cuticular hydrocarbons</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining water balance is a universal challenge for organisms living in terrestrial environments, especially for insects, which have essential roles in our ecosystem. Although the high surface area to volume ratio in insects makes them vulnerable to water loss, insects have evolved different levels of desiccation resistance to adapt to diverse environments. To withstand desiccation, insects use a lipid layer called cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to reduce water evaporation from the body surface. It has long been hypothesized that the waterproofing capability of this CHC layer, which can confer different levels of desiccation resistance, depends on its chemical composition. However, it is unknown which CHC components are important contributors to desiccation resistance and how these components can determine differences in desiccation resistance. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms, correlation analyses, and synthetic CHCs to investigate how different CHC components affect desiccation resistance in 50 <i>Drosophila</i> and related species. We showed that desiccation resistance differences across these species can be largely explained by variation in CHC composition. In particular, length variation in a subset of CHCs, the methyl-branched CHCs (mbCHCs), is a key determinant of desiccation resistance. There is also a significant correlation between the evolution of longer mbCHCs and higher desiccation resistance in these species. Given that CHCs are almost ubiquitous in insects, we suggest that evolutionary changes in insect CHC components can be a general mechanism for the evolution of desiccation resistance and adaptation to diverse and changing environments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Host-microbiome metabolism of a plant toxin in bees</a></h4>

              
                While foraging for nectar and pollen, bees are exposed to a myriad of xenobiotics, including plant metabolites, which may exert a wide range of effects on their health. Although the bee genome encodes enzymes that help in the metabolism of xenobiotics, it has lower detoxification gene diversity than the genomes of other insects. Therefore, bees may rely on other components that shape their physiology, such as the microbiota, to degrade potentially toxic molecules. In this study, we show that amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in honey bee-pollinated almond trees, can be metabolized by both bees and members of the gut microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, leading to prunasin accumulation in the midgut and hindgut. In microbiota-colonized bees, on the other hand, amygdalin is degraded even further, and prunasin does not accumulate in the gut, suggesting that the microbiota contribute to the full degradation of amygdalin into hydrogen cyanide. <i>In vitro</i> experiments demonstrated that amygdalin degradation by bee gut bacteria is strain-specific and not characteristic of a particular genus or species. We found strains of <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Bombilactobacillus</i> and <i>Gilliamella</i> that can degrade amygdalin. The degradation mechanism appears to vary since only some strains produce prunasin as an intermediate. Finally, we investigated the basis of degradation in <i>Bifidobacterium</i> wkB204, a strain that fully degrades amygdalin. We found overexpression and secretion of several carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, including one in glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3). We expressed this GH3 in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and detected prunasin as a byproduct when cell lysates were cultured with amygdalin, supporting its contribution to amygdalin degradation. These findings demonstrate that both host and microbiota can act together to metabolize dietary plant metabolites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proteome-wide systems genetics identifies UFMylation as a regulator of skeletal muscle function</a></h4>

              
                Improving muscle function has great potential to improve the quality of life. To identify novel regulators of skeletal muscle metabolism and function, we performed a proteomic analysis of gastrocnemius muscle from 73 genetically distinct inbred mouse strains, and integrated the data with previously acquired genomics and &gt;300 molecular/phenotypic traits via quantitative trait loci mapping and correlation network analysis. These data identified thousands of associations between protein abundance and phenotypes and can be accessed online (https://muscle.coffeeprot.com/) to identify regulators of muscle function. We used this resource to prioritize targets for a functional genomic screen in human bioengineered skeletal muscle. This identified several negative regulators of muscle function including UFC1, an E2 ligase for protein UFMylation. We show UFMylation is up-regulated in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that involves muscle atrophy. Furthermore, in vivo knockdown of UFMylation increased contraction force, implicating its role as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Clarifying the role of an unavailable distractor in human multiattribute choice</a></h4>

              
                Decisions between two economic goods can be swayed by a third <i>unavailable</i> 'decoy' alternative, which does not compete for choice, notoriously violating the principles of rational choice theory. Although decoy effects typically depend on the decoy's position in a multiattribute choice space, recent studies using risky prospects (i.e., varying in reward and probability) reported a novel 'positive' decoy effect operating on a single 'value' dimension: the higher the 'expected value' of an unavailable (distractor) prospect was, the easier the discrimination between two available target prospects became, especially when their expected-value difference was small. Here we show that this unidimensional distractor effect affords alternative interpretations: it occurred because the distractor's expected value covaried positively with the subjective utility difference between the two targets. Looking beyond this covariation, we report a modest 'negative' distractor effect operating on subjective utility, as well as classic multiattribute decoy effects. A normatively meaningful model (selective integration), in which subjective utilities are shaped by 'intra-attribute' information distortion, reproduces the multiattribute decoy effects, and as an epiphenomenon, the negative unidimensional distractor effect. These findings clarify the modulatory role of an unavailable distracting option, shedding fresh light on the mechanisms that govern multiattribute decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How enzymatic activity is involved in chromatin organization</a></h4>

              
                Spatial organization of chromatin plays a critical role in genome regulation. Previously, various types of affnity mediators and enzymes have been attributed to regulate spatial organization of chromatin from a thermodynamics perspective. However, at the mechanistic level, enzymes act in their unique ways and perturb the chromatin. Here, we construct a polymer physics model following the mechanistic scheme of Topoisomerase-II, an enzyme resolving topological constraints of chromatin, and investigate how it affects interphase chromatin organization. Our computer simulations demonstrate Topoisomerase-II's ability to phase separate chromatin into eu- and heterochromatic regions with a characteristic wall-like organization of the euchromatic regions. We realized that the ability of the euchromatic regions to cross each other due to enzymatic activity of Topoisomerase-II induces this phase separation. This realization is based on the physical fact that partial absence of self-avoiding interaction can induce phase separation of a system into its self-avoiding and non-self-avoiding parts, which we reveal using a mean-field argument. Furthermore, motivated from recent experimental observations, we extend our model to a bidisperse setting and show that the characteristic features of the enzymatic activity driven phase separation survive there. The existence of these robust characteristic features, even under the non-localized action of the enzyme, highlights the critical role of enzymatic activity in chromatin organization.

                We develop integrated co-evolution and dynamic coupling (ICDC) approach to identify, mutate, and assess distal sites to modulate function. We validate the approach first by analyzing the existing mutational fitness data of TEM-1 β-lactamase and show that allosteric positions co-evolved and dynamically coupled with the active site significantly modulate function. We further apply ICDC approach to identify positions and their mutations that can modulate binding affinity in a lectin, cyanovirin-N (CV-N), that selectively binds to dimannose, and predict binding energies of its variants through Adaptive BP-Dock. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that binding enhancing mutants identified by ICDC impact the dynamics of the binding pocket, and show that rigidification of the binding residues compensates for the entropic cost of binding. This work suggests a mechanism by which distal mutations modulate function through dynamic allostery and provides a blueprint to identify candidates for mutagenesis in order to optimize protein function.

                Trial-by-trial variability is a ubiquitous property of neuronal activity in vivo and affects the stimulus response. Computational models have revealed how local network structure and feedforward inputs control the trial-by-trial variability. However, the role of input statistics and different interneuron subtypes in shaping the trial-by-trial variability was less understood. Here we investigated the dynamics of stimulus response in a model of cortical microcircuit with one excitatory and three inhibitory interneuron populations (PV, SST, VIP). We show that the variance ratio of inputs to different neuron populations and input covariances are the main determinants of output trial-by-trial variability. The effect of input covariances is contingent on the input variance ratios. In general, the network shows smaller output trial-by-trial variability in a PV-dominated regime than in an SST-dominated regime. Our work reveals mechanisms by which output trial-by-trial variability can be controlled in a context, state, and task-dependent manner.

                Non-epileptic seizures are identified as a common epileptogenic trigger. Early metaplasticity following seizures may contribute to epileptogenesis by abnormally altering synaptic strength and homeostatic plasticity. We now studied how in vitro epileptiform activity triggers early changes in CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) in rat hippocampal slices and the involvement of lipid rafts in these early metaplasticity events. Two forms of epileptiform activity (EA) were induced: 1) interictal-like EA triggered by withdrawal of Mg2+ and K+ elevation to 6mM in the superfusion medium or 2) ictal-like EA induced by bicuculine (10 M) delivery. LTP induced 30 min post EA was impaired, an effect more pronounced after ictal-like EA. LTP recovered to control levels 60 min post interictal-like EA but was still impaired 60 min after ictal-like EA. The synaptic molecular events underlying this altered LTP were investigated 30 min post EA. Synaptosomes isolated from parallel slices showed enhanced AMPA GluA1 Ser831 phosphorylation but decreased Ser 845 phosphorylation and a marked decrease in GluA1/GluA2 ratio. A marked decrease in flotillin-1 and caveolin-1 levels concomitantly with a moderate increase in PSD-95 and marked increase in gephyrin levels. Altogether, EA differentially influences hippocampal CA1 LTP thorough regulation of GluA1/GluA2 levels and AMPA GluA1 phosphorylation suggesting altered LTP post-seizures may be a relevant target of antiepileptogenic therapies. In addition, this metaplasticity is also associated with marked alterations in classic and synaptic lipid raft markers, suggesting these may also constitute promising targets in epileptogenesis prevention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG correlates of olfactory processing during an instructed-delay task</a></h4>

              
                EEG correlates of olfaction are of fundamental and practical interest for many reasons. In the field of neural technologies, olfactory-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent an approach that could be useful for neurorehabilitation of anosmia, dysosmia and hyposmia. While the idea of a BCI that decodes neural responses to different odors and/or enables odor-based neurofeedback is appealing, the results of previous EEG investigations into the olfactory domain are rather inconsistent, particularly when non-primary processing of olfactory signals is concerned. Here we report the results from an EEG study where an olfaction-based instructed-delay task was implemented. We utilized an olfactory display and a sensor of respiration to present odors in a strictly controlled fashion. Spatio-spectral EEG properties were analyzed to assess the olfactory-related components. Under these experimental conditions, EEG components representing processing of olfactory information were found around channel C4, where changes were detected for the 12-Hz spectral component. Additionally, significant differences in EEG patterns were observed when responses to odors were compared to the responses to odorless stimuli. We conclude EEG recordings are suitable for detecting active processing of odors. As such they could be integrated in a BCI that strives to rehabilitate olfactory disabilities or uses odors for hedonistic purposes.

                Tissue clearing renders entire organs transparent to enable combination with light sheet fluorescence microscopy and accelerate whole tissue imaging. Yet, challenges remain in analyzing the large resulting 3D datasets that consist of terabytes of images and information on millions of labeled cells. Previous work has established pipelines for automated analysis of tissue cleared mouse brains. However, they have focused on single color channels and/or detection of nuclear localized signals, in relatively low-resolution images. To address this gap, we present an automated workflow to map labeled neurons and astrocytes in the genetically distinct Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) mouse forebrains. We named the workflow COMBINe (Cell detectiOn in Mouse BraIN) as it combines modules from multiple pipelines. With RetinaNet in its core, we quantitatively analyzed the regional and subregional effects of MADM-based deletion of the Epidermal growth factor receptor on neuronal and astrocyte populations in the mouse forebrain.

                Gene expression intersects with neural activity to produce cortical circuits during brain development. However, the cell biological mechanisms linking gene expression to activity-dependent cortical circuit assembly remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate in mice that a newly discovered function of the neurodevelopmental disorder gene, Syngap1, is to cell-autonomously control intrinsic membrane excitability (IME) in developing cortical glutamatergic neurons. Syngap1 regulation of IME was mechanistically linked to wiring of a cortical circuit motif required for sensory processing and behavioral action. Restoring depressed IME in Syngap1 deficient neurons through genetic targeting of hyper-functional potassium currents unleashed deficient dendritic morphogenesis in upper lamina sensory cortex pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, enhancing dendritic morphogenesis was sufficient to stimulate assembly of translaminar feed-forward excitatory circuit motifs. Thus, Syngap1 promotes excitatory circuit assembly during cortical development by maintaining IME in a range that enables trophic neuronal activity to maximize pyramidal cell somatodendritic maturation and subsequent synapse formation.

                Rodent premotor cortex (M2) integrates information from sensory and cognitive networks for action selection and planning during goal-directed decision making. M2 function is regulated by cortical inputs and ascending neuromodulators, including norepinephrine (NE) released from the locus coeruleus (LC). LC-NE has been shown to modulate the signal to noise ratio of neural representations in target regions prior to decision execution, to increase the salience of relevant stimuli. Using rats performing a two-alternative forced choice task after administration of an adrenergic antagonist (propranolol), we show that action planning in M2 is mediated by adrenergic signaling. Loss of adrenergic signaling results in failure to suppress irrelevant action plans in M2 that disrupts decoding of cue related information, delays decision times, and increases trial omissions, particularly in females. Furthermore, we identify a potential mechanism for the sex bias in behavioral and neural changes after propranolol administration via differential expression of receptors across sexes, particularly on local inhibitory neurons. Overall, we show a critical role for adrenergic signaling in M2 during decision making by suppressing irrelevant information to enable efficient action planning and decision execution.

                Little is known about how animals use tactile sensation to detect important objects and remember their location in a world-based coordinate system. Here, we hypothesized that retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a key network for contextual memory and spatial navigation, represents the location of objects based on tactile sensation. We studied mice that palpate objects with their whiskers while running on a treadmill in a tactile virtual reality in darkness. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we discovered a population of neurons in agranular RSC that signal the location of tactile objects. Tactile object location responses do not simply reflect the sensory stimulus. Instead, they are highly task- and context-dependent and often predict the upcoming object before it is within reach. In addition, most tactile object location neurons also maintain a memory trace of the object's location. These data show that RSC encodes the location and arrangement of tactile objects in a spatial reference frame.

                The availability of high-calorie foods is likely a causative factor for high rates of obesity and metabolic disorders, which have been linked to food intake dysregulation. Several gut peptides have been implicated in feeding modulation and body mass accumulation. For example, glucagon peptide-like 1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) have been shown to mediate satiety and reduce food intake. While systemic administration of such peptides has been explored as a therapy for metabolic disease, the effects of these hormones on taste signaling should also be considered given the importance of taste to feeding decisions. Peptide signaling systems are present in taste buds and oral GLP-1 and PYY signaling has been shown to influence taste responsiveness and feeding. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that genetic knockout of PYY in mice can impact on taste responsiveness and feeding and that viral overexpression of PYY in the salivary glands of these mice can rescue responsiveness. The present work uses AAV-mediated salivary gland treatment of both GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 and PYY encoding vectors to explore the impact of the presence of these peptides on taste and body-mass accumulation in wild-type mice with intact peptide signaling systems. Results showed a significant effect of salivary gland treatment on responsiveness to multiple taste qualities. Treatment with a vector designed to overexpress both peptides in saliva resulted in substantial reduction in body mass accumulation. These findings show taste modulation and impacts on body mass accumulation by the targeting of salivary glands with vectors designed to overexpress metabolic peptides in wild-type mice and suggest that the taste bud is a promising substrate for food intake modulation.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, afflicting over 1% of the population of age 60 years and above. The loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons is the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is the primary cause of its characteristic motor symptoms. Studies using Drosophila melanogaster and other model systems have provided much insight into the pathogenesis of PD. However, little is known why certain cell types are selectively susceptible to degeneration in PD. Here we describe an approach to identify vulnerable subpopulations of neurons in the genetic background linked to PD in Drosophila, using the split-GAL4 divers that enable genetic manipulation of a small number of defined cell population. We identify a subtype of DA neurons selectively vulnerable in the model of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)-linked familial PD, demonstrating the utility of this approach. We also show an unexpected caveat of the split-GAL4 system in aging-related research: the age-dependent increase in the number of GAL4-labeled cells.

                Sleep benefits the consolidation of motor skills learned by physical practice, mainly through periodic thalamocortical sleep spindle activity. However, motor skills can be learned without overt movement, either through motor imagery or action observation. Here, we investigated whether sleep spindle activity also supports the consolidation of non-physically learned movements. Forty-five electroencephalographic sleep recordings were collected during a daytime nap after motor sequence learning by physical practice, motor imagery or action observation. Our findings revealed that irrespective of the modality of practice, spindles tend to cluster in trains on a low-frequency time scale of about 50 seconds, and during which spindles iterate every 3-4 seconds. However, despite this apparent modality-unspecific temporal organization of sleep spindles, different behavioral outcomes were elicited. We show that a daytime nap offers an early sleep window that promotes the retention of the learned motor skill following PP and MI practice, and its generalizability towards the transfer of skill from one effector to another after AO practice. Altogether, we demonstrated that the temporal cluster-based organization of sleep spindles may be a general mechanism for effective memory reprocessing.

                Non-human primates (NHPs) have become key for translational research in noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). However, in order to create comparable stimulation conditions to humans it is vital to evaluate and match electric fields across species. Numerical models to simulate electric fields are an important tool for experimental planning in NHPs and translation to human studies. It is thus essential to evaluate how anatomical details in NHP models affect NIBS electric fields. Here, we create a highly accurate head model of a non-human primate (NHP) from 10.5 T MR data. We systematically evaluate how muscle tissue and head size (due to different MRI fields of view) affect simulation results in transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation (TES and TMS). Our findings indicate that the inclusion of muscle can affect TES electric field strength up to 29.5% while TMS is largely unaffected. Additionally, comparing a full head model to a cropped head model illustrates the impact of head size on electric fields for both TES and TMS. We find opposing effects between TES and TMS with an increase up to 13.5% for TES and a decrease up to 21.5% for TMS for the cropped head model compared to the full head model. Our results provide important insights into the level of anatomical detail needed for NHP head models and can inform future translational efforts for NIBS studies.

                Astroglial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD), and glial replacement can ameliorate disease course. To establish the topographic relationship of diseased astrocytes to medium spiny neuron (MSN) synapses in HD, we used 2-photon imaging to map the relationship of tRFP-tagged striatal astrocytes and rabies-traced, EGFP-tagged coupled neuronal pairs, in R6/2 HD and wild-type (WT) mice. The tagged, prospectively-identified corticostriatal synapses were then studied by correlated light electron microscopy followed by serial block-face scanning EM, allowing nm scale assessment of synaptic structure in 3D. By this means, we compared the astrocytic engagement of single striatal synapses in HD and WT brains. R6/2 HD astrocytes exhibited constricted domains, with significantly less coverage of mature dendritic spines than WT astrocytes, despite enhanced engagement of immature, thin spines. These data suggest that disease-dependent changes in astroglial engagement and sequestration of MSN synapses enable the high synaptic and extrasynaptic levels of glutamate and K+ that underlie the striatal hyperexcitability of HD. As such, these data suggest that astrocytic structural pathology may causally contribute to the synaptic dysfunction and disease phenotype of those neurodegenerative disorders characterized by network overexcitation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fractions strategy differences in those born extremely preterm</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: For those with weak cognitive skills, certain mathematical problem-solving strategies may be more difficult than others. Tailored mathematical instruction that recognizes cognitive load and incorporates ways to reduce this may help to overcome mathematical difficulties. To investigate the effects of different strategies and cognitive load we explored brain hemodynamic responses associated with the use of different strategies to solve subtraction of fractions. We focused on those born extremely preterm (EPT; less than 28 weeks gestation) as they are known to have cognitive challenges and struggle with mathematics in particular. We also included a group of full-term (FT) peers for comparison. Methods: Functional MRI was acquired while the participants mentally solved fraction equations using either an improper fractions strategy, where whole numbers are converted to improper fractions before solving, or a mixed fractions strategy, where computations are carried out separately for the whole numbers and fraction components. Different fraction item types were given, which affected respective required cognitive loads per strategy. Diffusion and T1-weighted structural images were also acquired. All imaging modalities were compared between the two groups. Results: The EPT and FT groups differed in terms of task-related hemodynamic responses, regional volumes, and white matter connectivity. Functional group differences varied with strategy and item type. These differences were greatest when the mixed fractions strategy was prompted for an item type that required relatively greater cognitive load and involved borrowing. Other findings showed reduced white and grey matter volume and reduced white matter connectivity in widespread areas in the EPT group compared to the FT group. Conclusion: Changes in the brain related to preterm birth are complex. The understanding of function and structure presented here may help inform pedagogical practices by allowing for tailoring of mathematical education through identifying suitable strategy adoption that depends on problem type, to circumvent weaknesses in cognitive skills.

                Background: Early-life adversity (ELA) is associated with increased risk for mood disorders including depression and substance use disorders. These are characterized by impaired reward-related behaviors, suggesting compromised operations of reward-related brain circuits. However, the brain regions engaged by ELA that mediate these enduring consequences of ELA remain largely unknown. In an animal model of ELA, we have identified aberrant reward-seeking behaviors, a discovery that provides a framework for assessing the underlying circuits. Methods: Employing TRAP2 male and female mice, in which neurons activated within a defined timeframe are permanently tagged, we compared ELA and control-reared mice, assessing the quantity and distribution of ELA-related neuronal activation. After validating the TRAP2 results using native cFos labeling, we defined the molecular identity of this population of activated neurons. Results: We uniquely demonstrate that the TRAP2 system is feasible and efficacious in neonatal mice. Surprisingly, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is robustly and almost exclusively activated by ELA and is the only region distinguishing ELA from typical rearing. Remarkably, a large proportion of ELA-activated PVT neurons express CRFR1, the receptor for the stress-related peptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), but these neurons do not express CRH itself. Conclusions: We show here that the PVT, an important component of reward circuits which is known to encode remote, emotionally salient experiences to influence future motivated behaviors, encodes adverse experiences as remote as those occurring during the early postnatal period and is thus poised to contribute to the enduring deficits in reward-related behaviors consequent to ELA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aβ-CT affective touch: Touch pleasantness ratings for gentle stroking and deep pressure exhibit dependence on A-fibers</a></h4>

              
                Gentle stroking of the skin is a common social touch behavior with positive affective consequences. A preference for slow versus fast stroking of hairy skin has been closely linked to the firing of unmyelinated C-tactile (CT) somatosensory afferents. Because the firing of CT afferents strongly correlates with touch pleasantness, the CT pathway has been considered a social-affective sensory pathway. Recently, ablation of the spinothalamic pathway- thought to convey all C-fiber sensations- in patients with cancer pain impaired pain, temperature, and itch, but not ratings of pleasant touch. This suggested integration of A and CT fiber input in the spinal cord, or A-fiber contributions to computations of touch pleasantness in the brain. However, the causal contribution of A-fibers to touch pleasantness- in humans without pain- remains unknown. In the current, single-blinded study we performed two types of peripheral nerve blocks in healthy adults to temporarily eliminate the contribution of A-fibers to touch perception. Our findings show that when A-fiber function is greatly diminished, the perceived intensity and pleasantness of both gentle stroking and deep pressure are nearly abolished. These findings demonstrate that explicit perception of the pleasantness of CT-targeted brushing and pressure both critically depend on A-fibers.

                We examined the superior colliculus (SC) with ultra-high resolution 7-Tesla fMRI during an N-back working memory task. We observed both increased BOLD signal intensity and functional connectivity that followed a layer-dependent pattern predicted from anatomical connections between SC and other brain structures important for visual processing, motor control, and executive function. Our results highlight a role for the human SC in cognitive functions that are usually associated with the cerebral cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of a population of descending neurons in the optomotor response in flying Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                To maintain stable flight, animals continuously perform trimming adjustments to compensate for internal and external perturbations. Whereas animals use many different sensory modalities to detect such perturbations, insects rely extensively on optic flow to modify their motor output and remain on course. We studied this behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by exploiting the optomotor response, a robust reflex in which an animal steers so as to minimize the magnitude of rotatory optic flow it perceives. Whereas the behavioral and algorithmic structure of the optomotor response has been studied in great detail, its neural implementation is not well-understood. In this paper, we present findings implicating a group of nearly homomorphic descending neurons, the DNg02s, as a core component for the optomotor response in flying Drosophila. Prior work on these cells suggested that they regulate the mechanical power to the flight system, presumably via connections to asynchronous flight motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord. When we chronically inactivated these cells, we observed that the magnitude of the optomotor response was diminished in proportion to the number of cells silenced, suggesting that the cells also regulate bilaterally asymmetric steering responses via population coding. During an optomotor response, flies coordinate changes in wing motion with movements of their head, abdomen, and hind legs, which are also diminished when the DNg02 cells are silenced. Using two-photon functional imaging, we show that the DNg02 cells respond most strongly to patterns of horizontal motion and that neuronal activity is closely correlated to motor output. However, unilateral optogenetic activation of DNg02 neurons does not elicit the asymmetric changes in wing motion characteristic of the optomotor response to a visual stimulus, but rather generates bilaterally symmetric increases in wingbeat amplitude. We interpret our experiments to suggest that flight maneuvers in flies require a more nuanced coordination of power muscles and steering muscles than previously appreciated, and that the physical flight apparatus of a fly might permit mechanical power to be distributed differentially between the two wings. Thus, whereas our experiments identify the DNg02 cells as a critical component of the optomotor reflex, our results suggest that other classes of descending cells targeting the steering muscle motor neurons are also required for the behavior.

	<p>Background: The severity of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in patients with acute lacunar stroke (ALS) may be not completely parallel to cognitive impairment. Controversies persist about the effects of WMH on cognitive dysfunction. It is vital to explore whether the association may be affected by certain factors and whether a subsequent subgroup analysis is necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between WMH and cognitive impairment in acute lacunar stroke patients and the possible causal factors. Methods: We continuously enrolled patients with ALS who were hospitalized at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between October 2017 and June 2022. The cognitive function of all patients was assessed by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale 14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2 days after the onset of AIS, and the results were adjusted to the education level. The MoCA scale was reevaluated at the 6-month (day 182 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7) follow-up by outpatient visit or video. Demographic and clinical data were collected. The manifestations of chronic cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD), including the total Fazekas score and total CSVD burden score, were assessed with an MRI scan. A mismatch refers to an inconsistency between the severity of WMH and cognitive dysfunction. A Type 1 mismatch refers to cognitive impairment with mild WMH (total Fazekas score = 0&amp;amp;ndash;1), and a Type 2 mismatch refers to severe WMH (total Fazekas score = 5&amp;amp;ndash;6) in patients with normal cognitive function. Results: Among 213 enrolled ALS patients, 66 patients (31.0%) had cognitive dysfunction, and 40 patients (18.8%) had mismatches. Twenty-seven cases (12.7%) were Type 1 mismatched, and seventeen cases (8.0%) were Type 2 mismatched. Age, gender, fibrinogen and cerebral infarction history were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment in ALS patients. Imaging features, including moderate to severe WMH, deep WMH and the total CSVD burden score, were also independently associated with cognitive impairment. The patients in the mismatched group were older, had more severe deep WMH and had a higher occurrence of depression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The NIHSS score, depression and microbleeds were significantly different between the Type 1 mismatched group and the matched group (p = 0.018, p = 0.012 and p = 0.047). Patients in the Type 2 mismatched group were male (p = 0.04), had a lower level of fibrinogen (p = 0.005), a lower incidence of CMBs (p = 0.003), a lower total CSVD burden score (p = 0.017), more severe paraventricular WMH (p = 0.035) and milder deep WMH (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Our study examined a homogeneous study cohort of recruited patients with symptomatic ALS. We found heterogeneity between WMH and cognitive function in ALS patients. Despite a similar WMH severity, some baseline clinical features and other conventional CSVD imaging characteristics may account for this heterogeneity phenomenon. Our findings provide data for the early diagnosis and prevention of cognitive impairment in ALS patients and suggest that the severity of WMH is not completely parallel to cognitive impairment. The white matter microstructural injury and remote WMH effects may account for the mismatch phenomenon. More attention should be paid to understanding the underlying mechanisms and finding new imaging markers.</p>

	<p>Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) are brain-derived electrical signals, following an auditory stimulus, utilised to examine any obstructions along the brain neural-pathways and to diagnose hearing impairment. The clinical evaluation of AEPs is based on the measurements of the latencies and amplitudes of waves of interest; hence, their identification is a prerequisite for AEP analysis. This process has proven to be complex, as it requires relevant clinical experience, and the existing software for this purpose has little practical use. The aim of this study was the development of two automated annotation tools for ABR (auditory brainstem response)- and AMLR (auditory middle latency response)-tests. After the acquisition of 1046 raw waveforms, appropriate pre-processing and implementation of a four-stage development process were performed, to define the appropriate logical conditions and steps for each algorithm. The tools&amp;amp;rsquo; detection and annotation results, regarding the waves of interest, were then compared to the clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; manual annotation, achieving match rates of at least 93.86%, 98.51%, and 91.51% respectively, for the three ABR-waves of interest, and 93.21%, 92.25%, 83.35%, and 79.27%, respectively, for the four AMLR-waves. The application of such tools in AEP analysis is expected to assist towards an easier interpretation of these signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Electronic signature and attestation in conveyancing practice: A Malaysian legal perspective [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background  The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about an unprecedented disruption to global business activities. Physical face-to-face activities must be restricted due to movement control order (MCO). The clients are required to sign the documents physically in the presence of the solicitor who must subsequently attest to the signature of the clients. The issue arises whether electronic signature (e-signature) and attestation are permissible under the laws of Malaysia. The aim of this research was to study the legality of e-signature and attestation in conveyancing practice in Malaysia and subsequently to propose recommendations to overcome these issues.   Methods   This is qualitative study and not an empirical study. The data was collected by library-based research from various primary and secondary data sources, including case law in Malaysia, written statutes, publication of journal and article.   Results  The Digital Signatures Act 1997 (DSA) and the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 (ECA) have legalised e-signatures. The DSA is the law that governs the digital signatures in Malaysia. ECA has listed a few documents which are not legally accepted if signed electronically, namely Power of Attorney, the Wills and codicils, the Trusts, and negotiable instruments. However, with regards to the issue of attestation of these documents, there are no clear laws which govern the attestation. The legal issue arises when the lawyers who have attested these documents are liable to be called as witness under the Evidence Act 1950 to testify their signature if these documents are tendered as evidence in any court proceedings.   Conclusion  The laws in Malaysia have provided sufficient provisions for e-signatures but not the issue of attestation via online. Thus, it is suggested that there is a need for unique legal framework for attestation via online in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer in health care quality improvements. A second systematic review. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traditionally, EB-CPGs have been believed to mainly improve the quality and consistency of health care, but this claim must be conclusively proven. We used the Donabedian three-dimensional model (structure, process, and patient outcomes) to assess improvements in the quality of medical care derived from implementing EB-CPGs. This study corresponds to the second systematic review carried out as a series of studies on different clinical issues that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of the EB-CPG for improving the quality of care. Methods: We followed the methods described by the Cochrane Handbook and presented a descriptive analysis because of the high heterogeneity found across the included studies. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EBSCO Host databases, as well as the grey literature, between 1990 and April 2021. No language restrictions were applied. Only randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were selected. Results: Of the total of 364 interventions included in the eleven RCTs evaluated, 11 (3%) were related to healthcare structure, 51 (14%) to the healthcare delivery process and 302 (83%) to patient outcomes. Regarding the impact of using the EB-CPGs, in 303 interventions (83%), there were no significant differences between the control and experimental groups. In 4 interventions (1%), the result favoured the control and intervention groups in 57 of the interventions (16%). Conclusions: Our study showed that EB-CPGs slightly enhanced the quality of health care in the three dimensions described by Donabedian. Future RCTs should improve their design and methodological rigour by considering the certainty of the evidence supporting the EB-CPGs recommendations. In that context, broader analyses could be performed, having more concise hypotheses for further research. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020205594

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mutation patterns of resistance genes for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in nontuberculous mycobacteria isolates from Kenya [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) treatment constitutes a macrolide-based antibiotic regimen in combination with aminoglycosides for Rapid-Growing mycobacteria (RGM), and rifampicin for Slow-Growing mycobacteria (SGM). Mutations in the anti-NTM drug target regions promote NTM evolution to mutant strains that are insusceptible to NTM drugs leading to treatment failure. We, therefore, described the mutation patterns of anti-NTM drug target genes including rrl, rrs, and rpoB in NTM isolates from Kenya.  Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study that included 122 NTM obtained from the sputum of symptomatic tuberculosis-negative patients in Kenya. All the 122 NTM underwent targeted sequencing of the rrl gene. The 54 RGM were also sequenced for rrs, and the 68 SGM were sequenced for rpoB genes using ABI 3730XL analyzer. The obtained sequences were aligned to their wild-type reference sequences for each gene using Geneious then mutations were identified. Pearson chi-square at 95% confidence interval tested the association of NTM to mutation patterns for each gene. Results: Twenty-eight (23%) of the NTM harbored mutations associated with resistance to at least one of the macrolide-based therapy antibiotics. Twelve (10.4%)  NTM comprising 7(58.3%) of RGM and 5(41.7%) of SGM had mutations in the rrl gene. For ten (83.3%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2058, while for two (16.6%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2059. Six (11.1%) of the 54 RGM exhibited mutations in the aminoglycoside target gene rrs at location 1408. Ten (14.7%) of the 68 SGM harbored mutations in the rpoB gene with 40 percent having mutations at codon 531. Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant level of mutations associated with drug resistance for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in NTM isolated from symptomatic TB negative patients in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of open research in improving the standards of evidence synthesis: current challenges and potential solutions in systematic reviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine and are placed at the top of the level-of-evidence pyramid. To date, there are several methodological resources available from international organizations such as the Cochrane Collaboration that aim to aid researchers in conducting high-quality secondary research and promoting reproducibility, transparency and scientific rigour. Nevertheless, researchers still face challenges in most stages of evidence synthesis. Open research and the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles are rising initiatives being increasingly implemented in primary research. However, their beneficial role in secondary research is less emphasized. This article addresses how the challenges commonly faced during evidence synthesis research could be overcome using open research practices and currently available open research tools. Despite the phenomenally simple SR workflow, researchers still find tasks such as framing the SR research question, search strategy development, data extraction, and assessing for bias, challenging. The implementation of FAIR practices, including prospective registration at the PROSPERO database, abiding with the PRISMA guidelines, and making all SR data openly available could have significant benefits in avoiding duplication of effort and reducing research waste while improving the reporting standards of SRs. Additionally, this article highlights the need for further education in open research culture to overcome ethical and motivational barriers in implementing open research practices in evidence synthesis. Finally, in the era of technological breakthroughs, artificial intelligence may eventually be incorporated into the process of SRs and should abide by the FAIR standards for open research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Remeshing flexible membranes under the control of free energy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xinxin Wang, Gaudenz Danuser</p>

Cell membranes are flexible and often undergo large-scale morphological changes during processes like mitosis, protrusion and retraction, or vesicle fusion. Mathematical modeling of cell membranes depends on a representation of the free-form surface by discrete meshes. During morphological changes, these meshes must be adjusted under the minimization of the total free energy. Current methodology for meshing is limited in one of two ways: 1) Free energy-dependent methods have no restriction on the mesh geometry. The resulting irregular meshes cause artifacts in follow-up models of morphodynamics. 2) Geometry-dependent methods maintain mesh quality but violate the physics of free energy minimization. To fill this gap, we regulate mesh geometries via a free-energy-determined remeshing process: adding and removing mesh elements upon morphological changes based on barrier crossings in a double-barrier potential between neighboring vertices in the meshes. We test the method’s robustness by reproducing the morphodynamics of red blood cells and vesicle fusions; and we demonstrate the method’s adaptability by simulating the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia and invaginations. Finally, we use the method to study a mechanical decoupling effect of two connected membrane tethers that has been recently observed experimentally, but has not been mechanistically explained in the context of a complete membrane surface. We propose a biophysical model that strengthens the decoupling effect and broadens the original interpretation of the experiment. The method is developed in C/Matlab and distributed via https://github.com/DanuserLab/biophysicsModels.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Secuer: Ultrafast, scalable and accurate clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nana Wei, Yating Nie, Lin Liu, Xiaoqi Zheng, Hua-Jun Wu</p>

Identifying cell clusters is a critical step for single-cell transcriptomics study. Despite the numerous clustering tools developed recently, the rapid growth of scRNA-seq volumes prompts for a more (computationally) efficient clustering method. Here, we introduce Secuer, a Scalable and Efficient speCtral clUstERing algorithm for scRNA-seq data. By employing an anchor-based bipartite graph representation algorithm, Secuer enjoys reduced runtime and memory usage over one order of magnitude for datasets with more than 1 million cells. Meanwhile, Secuer also achieves better or comparable accuracy than competing methods in small and moderate benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we showcase that Secuer can also serve as a building block for a new consensus clustering method, Secuer-consensus, which again improves the runtime and scalability of state-of-the-art consensus clustering methods while also maintaining the accuracy. Overall, Secuer is a versatile, accurate, and scalable clustering framework suitable for small to ultra-large single-cell clustering tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Leveraging infectious disease models to interpret randomized controlled trials: Controlling enteric pathogen transmission through water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew F. Brouwer, Marisa C. Eisenberg, Kevin M. Bakker, Savannah N. Boerger, Mondal H. Zahid, Matthew C. Freeman, Joseph N. S. Eisenberg</p>

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluate hypotheses in specific contexts and are often considered the gold standard of evidence for infectious disease interventions, but their results cannot immediately generalize to other contexts (e.g., different populations, interventions, or disease burdens). Mechanistic models are one approach to generalizing findings between contexts, but infectious disease transmission models (IDTMs) are not immediately suited for analyzing RCTs, since they often rely on time-series surveillance data. We developed an IDTM framework to explain relative risk outcomes of an infectious disease RCT and applied it to a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) RCT. This model can generalize the RCT results to other contexts and conditions. We developed this compartmental IDTM framework to account for key WASH RCT factors: i) transmission across multiple environmental pathways, ii) multiple interventions applied individually and in combination, iii) adherence to interventions or preexisting conditions, and iv) the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. We employed a hybrid sampling and estimation framework to obtain posterior estimates of mechanistic parameter sets consistent with empirical outcomes. We illustrated our model using WASH Benefits Bangladesh RCT data (n = 17,187). Our model reproduced reported diarrheal prevalence in this RCT. The baseline estimate of the basic reproduction number R 0 for the control arm (1.10, 95% CrI: 1.07, 1.16) corresponded to an endemic prevalence of 9.5% (95% CrI: 7.4, 13.7%) in the absence of interventions or preexisting WASH conditions. No single pathway was likely able to sustain transmission: pathway-specific R 0 s for water, fomites, and all other pathways were 0.42 (95% CrI: 0.03, 0.97), 0.20 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.59), and 0.48 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.94), respectively. An IDTM approach to evaluating RCTs can complement RCT analysis by providing a rigorous framework for generating data-driven hypotheses that explain trial findings, particularly unexpected null results, opening up existing data to deeper epidemiological understanding.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">EEG-representational geometries and psychometric distortions in approximate numerical judgment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefan Appelhoff, Ralph Hertwig, Bernhard Spitzer</p>

When judging the average value of sample stimuli (e.g., numbers) people tend to either over- or underweight extreme sample values, depending on task context. In a context of overweighting, recent work has shown that extreme sample values were overly represented also in neural signals, in terms of an anti-compressed geometry of number samples in multivariate electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. Here, we asked whether neural representational geometries may also reflect a relative underweighting of extreme values (i.e., compression) which has been observed behaviorally in a great variety of tasks. We used a simple experimental manipulation (instructions to average a single-stream or to compare dual-streams of samples) to induce compression or anti-compression in behavior when participants judged rapid number sequences. Model-based representational similarity analysis (RSA) replicated the previous finding of neural anti-compression in the dual-stream task, but failed to provide evidence for neural compression in the single-stream task, despite the evidence for compression in behavior. Instead, the results indicated enhanced neural processing of extreme values in either task, regardless of whether extremes were over- or underweighted in subsequent behavioral choice. We further observed more general differences in the neural representation of the sample information between the two tasks. Together, our results indicate a mismatch between sample-level EEG geometries and behavior, which raises new questions about the origin of common psychometric distortions, such as diminishing sensitivity for larger values.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regional mutational signature activities in cancer genomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Caitlin Timmons, Quaid Morris, Caitlin F. Harrigan</p>

Cancer genomes harbor a catalog of somatic mutations. The type and genomic context of these mutations depend on their causes and allow their attribution to particular mutational signatures. Previous work has shown that mutational signature activities change over the course of tumor development, but investigations of genomic region variability in mutational signatures have been limited. Here, we expand upon this work by constructing regional profiles of mutational signature activities over 2,203 whole genomes across 25 tumor types, using data aggregated by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. We present GenomeTrackSig as an extension to the TrackSig R package to construct regional signature profiles using optimal segmentation and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We find that 426 genomes from 20 tumor types display at least one change in mutational signature activities (changepoint), and 306 genomes contain at least one of 54 recurrent changepoints shared by seven or more genomes of the same tumor type. Five recurrent changepoint locations are shared by multiple tumor types. Within these regions, the particular signature changes are often consistent across samples of the same type and some, but not all, are characterized by signatures associated with subclonal expansion. The changepoints we found cannot strictly be explained by gene density, mutation density, or cell-of-origin chromatin state. We hypothesize that they reflect a confluence of factors including evolutionary timing of mutational processes, regional differences in somatic mutation rate, large-scale changes in chromatin state that may be tissue type-specific, and changes in chromatin accessibility during subclonal expansion. These results provide insight into the regional effects of DNA damage and repair processes, and may help us localize genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during cancer development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ToMExO: A probabilistic tree-structured model for cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammadreza Mohaghegh Neyshabouri, Jens Lagergren</p>

Identifying the interrelations among cancer driver genes and the patterns in which the driver genes get mutated is critical for understanding cancer. In this paper, we study cross-sectional data from cohorts of tumors to identify the cancer-type (or subtype) specific process in which the cancer driver genes accumulate critical mutations. We model this mutation accumulation process using a tree, where each node includes a driver gene or a set of driver genes. A mutation in each node enables its children to have a chance of mutating. This model simultaneously explains the mutual exclusivity patterns observed in mutations in specific cancer genes (by its nodes) and the temporal order of events (by its edges). We introduce a computationally efficient dynamic programming procedure for calculating the likelihood of our noisy datasets and use it to build our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference algorithm, ToMExO. Together with a set of engineered MCMC moves, our fast likelihood calculations enable us to work with datasets with hundreds of genes and thousands of tumors, which cannot be dealt with using available cancer progression analysis methods. We demonstrate our method’s performance on several synthetic datasets covering various scenarios for cancer progression dynamics. Then, a comparison against two state-of-the-art methods on a moderate-size biological dataset shows the merits of our algorithm in identifying significant and valid patterns. Finally, we present our analyses of several large biological datasets, including colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer. In all the analyses, we validate the results using a set of method-independent metrics testing the causality and significance of the relations identified by ToMExO or competing methods.

Identifying host factors that influence infectious disease transmission is an important step toward developing interventions to reduce disease incidence. Recent advances in methods for reconstructing infectious disease transmission events using pathogen genomic and epidemiological data open the door for investigation of host factors that affect onward transmission. While most transmission reconstruction methods are designed to work with densely sampled outbreaks, these methods are making their way into surveillance studies, where the fraction of sampled cases with sequenced pathogens could be relatively low. Surveillance studies that use transmission event reconstruction then use the reconstructed events as response variables (i.e., infection source status of each sampled case) and use host characteristics as predictors (e.g., presence of HIV infection) in regression models. We use simulations to study estimation of the effect of a host factor on probability of being an infection source via this multi-step inferential procedure. Using TransPhylo—a widely-used method for Bayesian estimation of infectious disease transmission events—and logistic regression, we find that low sensitivity of identifying infection sources leads to dilution of the signal, biasing logistic regression coefficients toward zero. We show that increasing the proportion of sampled cases improves sensitivity and some, but not all properties of the logistic regression inference. Application of these approaches to real world data from a population-based TB study in Botswana fails to detect an association between HIV infection and probability of being a TB infection source. We conclude that application of a pipeline, where one first uses TransPhylo and sparsely sampled surveillance data to infer transmission events and then estimates effects of host characteristics on probabilities of these events, should be accompanied by a realistic simulation study to better understand biases stemming from imprecise transmission event inference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Input correlations impede suppression of chaos and learning in balanced firing-rate networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rainer Engelken, Alessandro Ingrosso, Ramin Khajeh, Sven Goedeke, L. F. Abbott</p>

Neural circuits exhibit complex activity patterns, both spontaneously and evoked by external stimuli. Information encoding and learning in neural circuits depend on how well time-varying stimuli can control spontaneous network activity. We show that in firing-rate networks in the balanced state, external control of recurrent dynamics, i.e., the suppression of internally-generated chaotic variability, strongly depends on correlations in the input. A distinctive feature of balanced networks is that, because common external input is dynamically canceled by recurrent feedback, it is far more difficult to suppress chaos with common input into each neuron than through independent input. To study this phenomenon, we develop a non-stationary dynamic mean-field theory for driven networks. The theory explains how the activity statistics and the largest Lyapunov exponent depend on the frequency and amplitude of the input, recurrent coupling strength, and network size, for both common and independent input. We further show that uncorrelated inputs facilitate learning in balanced networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Orientation control strategies and adaptation to a visuomotor perturbation in rotational hand movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Or Zruya, Ilana Nisky</p>

Computational approaches to biological motor control are used to discover the building blocks of human motor behaviour. Models explaining features of human hand movements have been studied thoroughly, yet only a few studies attempted to explain the control of the orientation of the hand; instead, they mainly focus on the control of hand translation, predominantly in a single plane. In this study, we present a new methodology to study the way humans control the orientation of their hands in three dimensions and demonstrate it in two sequential experiments. We developed a quaternion-based score that quantifies the geodicity of rotational hand movements and evaluated it experimentally. In the first experiment, participants performed a simple orientation-matching task with a robotic manipulator. We found that rotations are generally performed by following a geodesic in the quaternion hypersphere, which suggests that, similarly to translation, the orientation of the hand is centrally controlled, possibly by optimizing geometrical properties of the hand’s rotation. This result established a baseline for the study of human response to perturbed visual feedback of the orientation of the hand. In the second experiment, we developed a novel visuomotor rotation task in which the rotation is applied on the hand’s rotation, and studied the adaptation of participants to this rotation, and the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation. We observed partial adaptation to the rotation. The patterns of the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation were consistent with the representation of the orientation in extrinsic coordinates. The methodology that we developed allows for studying the control of a rigid body without reducing the dimensionality of the task. The results of the two experiments open questions for future studies regarding the mechanisms underlying the central control of hand orientation. These results can be of benefit for many applications that involve fine manipulation of rigid bodies, such as teleoperation and neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Early enforcement of cell identity by a functional component of the terminally differentiated state</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zahra Bahrami-Nejad, Zhi-Bo Zhang, Stefan Tholen, Sanjeev Sharma, Atefeh Rabiee, Michael L. Zhao, Fredric B. Kraemer, Mary N. Teruel</p>

How progenitor cells can attain a distinct differentiated cell identity is a challenging problem given the fluctuating signaling environment in which cells exist and that critical transcription factors are often not unique to a differentiation process. Here, we test the hypothesis that a unique differentiated cell identity can result from a core component of the differentiated state doubling up as a signaling protein that also drives differentiation. Using live single-cell imaging in the adipocyte differentiation system, we show that progenitor fat cells (preadipocytes) can only commit to terminally differentiate after up-regulating FABP4, a lipid buffer that is highly enriched in mature adipocytes. Upon induction of adipogenesis in mouse preadipocyte cells, we show that after a long delay, cells first abruptly start to engage a positive feedback between CEBPA and PPARG before then engaging, after a second delay, a positive feedback between FABP4 and PPARG. These sequential positive feedbacks both need to engage in order to drive PPARG levels past the threshold for irreversible differentiation. In the last step before commitment, PPARG transcriptionally increases FABP4 expression while fatty acid-loaded FABP4 increases PPARG activity. Together, our study suggests a control principle for robust cell identity whereby a core component of the differentiated state also promotes differentiation from its own progenitor state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity orchestrates resilience to brain aging in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sheng Huang, Chengji Piao, Christine B. Beuschel, Zhiying Zhao, Stephan J. Sigrist</p>

The brain as a central regulator of stress integration determines what is threatening, stores memories, and regulates physiological adaptations across the aging trajectory. While sleep homeostasis seems to be linked to brain resilience, how age-associated changes intersect to adapt brain resilience to life history remains enigmatic. We here provide evidence that a brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity (“PreScale”), characterized by increases of active zone scaffold proteins and synaptic vesicle release factors, integrates resilience by coupling sleep, longevity, and memory during early aging of <i>Drosophila</i>. PreScale increased over the brain until mid-age, to then decreased again, and promoted the age-typical adaption of sleep patterns as well as extended longevity, while at the same time it reduced the ability of forming new memories. Genetic induction of PreScale also mimicked early aging-associated adaption of sleep patterns and the neuronal activity/excitability of sleep control neurons. Spermidine supplementation, previously shown to suppress early aging-associated PreScale, also attenuated the age-typical sleep pattern changes. Pharmacological induction of sleep for 2 days in mid-age flies also reset PreScale, restored memory formation, and rejuvenated sleep patterns. Our data suggest that early along the aging trajectory, PreScale acts as an acute, brain-wide form of presynaptic plasticity to steer trade-offs between longevity, sleep, and memory formation in a still plastic phase of early brain aging.
