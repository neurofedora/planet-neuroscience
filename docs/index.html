              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03241">Quantum Models of Consciousness from a Quantum Information Science Perspective</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective explores various quantum models of consciousness from the viewpoint of quantum information science, offering potential ideas and insights. The models under consideration can be categorized into three distinct groups based on the level at which quantum mechanics might operate within the brain: those suggesting that consciousness arises from electron delocalization within microtubules inside neurons, those proposing it emerges from the electromagnetic field surrounding the entire neural network, and those positing it originates from the interactions between individual neurons governed by neurotransmitter molecules. Our focus is particularly on the Posner model of cognition, for which we provide preliminary calculations on the preservation of entanglement of phosphate molecules within the geometric structure of Posner clusters. These findings provide valuable insights into how quantum information theory can enhance our understanding of brain functions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03246">Bridging Auditory Perception and Language Comprehension through MEG-Driven Encoding Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms behind auditory and linguistic processing is key to advancing cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03247">A sub-Riemannian model of neural states in the primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a neurogeometric model for the arm area of motor cortex, which encodes complex motor primitives, ranging from simple movement features like movement direction, to short hand trajectories, termed fragments, and ultimately to more complex patterns known as neural states (Georgopoulos, Hatsopoulos, Kadmon-Harpaz et al). Based on the sub-riemannian framework introduced in 2023, we model the space of fragments as a set of short curves defined by kinematic parameters. We then introduce a geometric kernel that serves as a model for cortical connectivity and use it in a differential equation to describe cortical activity. By applying a grouping algorithm to this cortical activity model, we successfully recover the neural states observed in Kadmon-Harpaz et al, which were based on measured cortical activity. This confirms that the choice of kinematic variables and the distance metric used here are sufficient to explain the phenomena of neural state formation. The modularity of our model reflects the brain's hierarchical structure, where initial groupings in the kinematic space $\mathcal{M}$ lead to more abstract representations. This approach mimics how the brain processes stimuli at different scales, extracting both local and global properties.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03741">Neural encoding with affine feature response transforms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current linearizing encoding models that predict neural responses to sensory input typically neglect neuroscience-inspired constraints that could enhance model efficiency and interpretability. To address this, we propose a new method called affine feature response transform (AFRT), which exploits the brain's retinotopic organization. Applying AFRT to encode multi-unit activity in areas V1, V4, and IT of the macaque brain, we demonstrate that AFRT reduces redundant computations and enhances the performance of current linearizing encoding models by segmenting each neuron's receptive field into an affine retinal transform, followed by a localized feature response. Remarkably, by factorizing receptive fields into a sequential affine component with three interpretable parameters (for shifting and scaling) and response components with a small number of feature weights per response, AFRT achieves encoding with orders of magnitude fewer parameters compared to unstructured models. We show that the retinal transform of each neuron's encoding agrees well with the brain's receptive field. Together, these findings suggest that this new subset within spatial transformer network can be instrumental in neural encoding models of naturalistic stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03571">AADNet: Exploring EEG Spatiotemporal Information for Fast and Accurate Orientation and Timbre Detection of Auditory Attention Based on A Cue-Masked Paradigm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding from electroencephalogram (EEG) could infer to which source the user is attending in noisy environments. Decoding algorithms and experimental paradigm designs are crucial for the development of technology in practical applications. To simulate real-world scenarios, this study proposed a cue-masked auditory attention paradigm to avoid information leakage before the experiment. To obtain high decoding accuracy with low latency, an end-to-end deep learning model, AADNet, was proposed to exploit the spatiotemporal information from the short time window of EEG signals. The results showed that with a 0.5-second EEG window, AADNet achieved an average accuracy of 93.46% and 91.09% in decoding auditory orientation attention (OA) and timbre attention (TA), respectively. It significantly outperformed five previous methods and did not need the knowledge of the original audio source. This work demonstrated that it was possible to detect the orientation and timbre of auditory attention from EEG signals fast and accurately. The results are promising for the real-time multi-property auditory attention decoding, facilitating the application of the neuro-steered hearing aids and other assistive listening devices.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07327">Gradient Diffusion: Enhancing Existing Neural Models with Homeostatic Control and Tuning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.07327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realistic brain modeling requires precise estimation of numerous unobserved parameters, a task hindered by complex nonlinearities and the inaccessibility of the brain's full dynamical state. Current multicompartmental-model simulations predominantly rely on gradient-free optimization methods, which suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' and are incompatible with online tuning crucial for emulating biological homeostasis. Gradient-based methods offer superior scalability and facilitate online adaptation but are currently inaccessible within existing brain simulators due to the significant resource investment and incompatibility with established simulators. This work introduces a novel methodology for computing parameter gradients for any existing model-and-simulator combination, enabling both offline and online tuning, including the implementation of homeostatic-control mechanisms. Our approach seamlessly integrates traditional simulations with gradient-based optimization, facilitating scalable, robust and adaptive brain simulation without the need for developing new simulators.

                arXiv:2501.01022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the intricate local morphology of neurons and their long-range projecting axons can address many connectivity related questions in neuroscience. The main bottleneck in connectomics pipelines is correcting topological errors, as multiple entangled neuronal arbors is a challenging instance segmentation problem. More broadly, segmentation of curvilinear, filamentous structures continues to pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we extend the notion of simple points from digital topology to connected sets of voxels (i.e. supervoxels) and propose a topology-aware neural network segmentation method with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a new public dataset of 3-d light microscopy images of mouse brains, along with the benchmark datasets DRIVE, ISBI12, and CrackTree.

                arXiv:2501.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.

                arXiv:2501.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarm intelligence optimization algorithms have gained significant attention due to their ability to solve complex optimization problems. However, the efficiency of optimization in large-scale problems limits the use of related methods. This paper presents a GPU-accelerated version of the Multi-Guiding Spark Fireworks Algorithm (MGFWA), which significantly improves the computational efficiency compared to its traditional CPU-based counterpart. We benchmark the GPU-MGFWA on several neural network black-box optimization problems and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of both speed and solution quality. By leveraging the parallel processing power of modern GPUs, the proposed GPU-MGFWA results in faster convergence and reduced computation time for large-scale optimization tasks.

Abstract: Neural networks based on soft and biological matter constitute an interesting potential alternative to traditional implementations based on electric circuits. DNA is a particularly promising system in this context due its natural ability to store information. In recent years, researchers have started to construct neural networks that are based on DNA. In this chapter, I provide a very basic introduction to the concept of DNA neural networks, aiming at an audience that is not familiar with biochemistry.

                arXiv:2501.03254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative method for predicting deformation in architected lattice structures that combines Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with finite element analysis. A thorough study was carried out on FCC-based lattice beams utilizing five different materials (Structural Steel, AA6061, AA7075, Ti6Al4V, and Inconel 718) under varied edge loads (1000-10000 N). The PINN model blends data-driven learning with physics-based limitations via a proprietary loss function, resulting in much higher prediction accuracy than linear regression. PINN outperforms linear regression, achieving greater R-square (0.7923 vs 0.5686) and lower error metrics (MSE: 0.00017417 vs 0.00036187). Among the materials examined, AA6061 had the highest displacement sensitivity (0.1014 mm at maximum load), while Inconel718 had better structural stability.

                arXiv:2501.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path planning is essential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as it determines the path that the UAV needs to follow to complete a task. This work addresses this problem by introducing a new algorithm called navigation variable-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization (NMOPSO). It first models path planning as an optimization problem via the definition of a set of objective functions that include optimality and safety requirements for UAV operation. The NMOPSO is then used to minimize those functions through Pareto optimal solutions. The algorithm features a new path representation based on navigation variables to include kinematic constraints and exploit the maneuverable characteristics of the UAV. It also includes an adaptive mutation mechanism to enhance the diversity of the swarm for better solutions. Comparisons with various algorithms have been carried out to benchmark the proposed approach. The results indicate that the NMOPSO performs better than not only other particle swarm optimization variants but also other state-of-the-art multi-objective and metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Experiments have also been conducted with real UAVs to confirm the validity of the approach for practical flights. The source code of the algorithm is available at https://github.com/ngandng/NMOPSO.

                arXiv:2501.03264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neural process (NP) is a family of computationally efficient models for learning distributions over functions. However, it suffers from under-fitting and shows suboptimal performance in practice. Researchers have primarily focused on incorporating diverse structural inductive biases, \textit{e.g.} attention or convolution, in modeling. The topic of inference suboptimality and an analysis of the NP from the optimization objective perspective has hardly been studied in earlier work. To fix this issue, we propose a surrogate objective of the target log-likelihood of the meta dataset within the expectation maximization framework. The resulting model, referred to as the Self-normalized Importance weighted Neural Process (SI-NP), can learn a more accurate functional prior and has an improvement guarantee concerning the target log-likelihood. Experimental results show the competitive performance of SI-NP over other NPs objectives and illustrate that structural inductive biases, such as attention modules, can also augment our method to achieve SOTA performance. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/hhq123gogogo/SI_NPs}.

                arXiv:2105.11233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain, has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the neural network model, in combination with its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in digital computers is intrinsically energy hungry, with energy consumption becoming prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing system. The learning process in these material systems, realized, e.g., by artificial evolution, equilibrium propagation or surrogate modelling, is a complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet efficient and accurate gradient extraction method, based on the principle of homodyne detection, for performing gradient descent on a loss function directly in a physical system without the need of an analytical description. By perturbing the parameters that need to be optimized using sinusoidal waveforms with distinct frequencies, we effectively obtain the gradient information in a highly robust and scalable manner. We illustrate the method in dopant network processing units, but argue that it is applicable in a wide range of physical systems. Homodyne gradient extraction can in principle be fully implemented in materia, facilitating the development of autonomously learning material systems.

	<p>Background/Objectives: While most studies on the postoperative condition of patients with spinal cord tumors describe long-term outcomes, data are needed on immediate surgical outcomes demanding rehabilitation to make informed assessments for postoperative planning. The aim of this study was to identify factors predicting function and rehabilitative needs after intradural spinal tumor surgery. Methods: Eighty-five prospectively recruited patients underwent surgery for intradural intramedullary (ID-IM; n = 23) and extramedullary (ID-EM; n = 62) tumors. Neurological and functional status were assessed before surgery, after surgery, and at discharge using the modified McCormick scale (MMS), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scale, Barthel index (BI), and the gait index (GI). Results: There were no significant predictors of early postoperative rehabilitation in the ID-IM group. In the ID-EM group, age, thoracic level, subtotal resection (STR), repeat surgery, and functional scale scores predicted the need for rehabilitation. In multivariable analysis, MMS (odds ratio (OR) 8.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.37&amp;amp;ndash;32.44) and STR (OR 13.00; 95%CI: 1.56&amp;amp;ndash;107.87) remained independent predictors of rehabilitation need (area under curve, 92%). Despite their younger age, most patients with ID-IM tumors, especially ependymomas, required rehabilitation but improved quickly (KPS, BI, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Among ID-EM tumors, meningiomas were characterized by poorer preoperative function and low gross total resection (GTR) rates, but did not deteriorate neurologically after surgery. Patients with schwannoma and ID-EM ependymomas achieved the highest GTR rate and had the best function both before and after surgery. Conclusions: These results may be useful for estimating early rehabilitation needs after intradural tumor surgery and counseling patients before surgery about the expected postoperative course.</p>

                Abstract Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when dealing with widespread metastatic disease.

                Background Better affordability of data plans and an increase in “budget” smartphones have resulted in an exponential rise in internet and smartphone users. The ease of access to sexually explicit material (SEM) coupled with adolescents’ impulsivity makes them prone to excessive SEM exposure and may affect the development of sexuality via the perceived realism of such content. This study was done to study the influence between problematic smartphone usage (PSU) and sexuality development among late adolescent boys. Methods One hundred and thirty-four adolescents aged 18-19 years, studying in a medical university, participated in this cross-sectional study. Smartphone Addiction Scale – short version (SAS-SV) to evaluate PSU and a content validated semi-structured proforma to evaluate gender identity, sexual orientation, sources of information on pubertal changes, and exposure to pornographic content was used. We expressed results as proportion and summary measures (Mean±SD), Chi-square test to find influence between PSU and adolescent sexuality development. Results We found a 45.5% prevalence of PSU. Among study participants, 88% were attracted to the opposite sex, 6% were attracted to the same-sex, and 6% were attracted to both sexes. Three per cent of participants liked wearing clothes of the opposite sex, 7.5% wanted to be members of the opposite sex, whereas 10.4% were not comfortable with their genitalia. They obtained information regarding pubertal changes from friends (85) and media (78). Many had exposure to pornographic content (90%), with the youngest being nine years old. Conclusion Nearly half of the late adolescents have PSU. Pornographic contents are accessed through Smartphones.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic led to a sudden shift to Emergency Remote Learning, significantly impacting students’ mental health. This study visualizes and analyses various stressors contributing to stress levels among university students during Emergency Remote Learning and explores how different factors from environmental and instructional mediums contribute to their perceived stress. Method Data was collected through a cross-sectional survey using the Modified Perceived Stress Scale and an additional set of 20 Likert scale items on Emergency Remote Learning. One-sample t-tests were performed to assess the consistency of responses across questionnaire items, and correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between different stressors. Frequency distributions were also analyzed to capture the prevalence of stress levels across demographic, environmental, and instructional variables. Conclusion The study revealed that frequent thoughts about unaccomplished tasks were associated with high stress (14.12%). Other factors include feeling nervous and stressed, feeling things that are not going their way, and difficulties piling up significantly elevated stress levels. Items specific to Emergency Remote Learning revealed that a sudden shift to Remote Learning heavily influenced students’ mental well-being. Additionally, demographic analysis showed that students aged 21 experienced the highest stress levels. Living arrangements, internet connectivity, and the impact of COVID-19 on close affinities further contributed to stress. This study underscores the complexity of stress during Emergency Remote Learning. It emphasizes the need for institutions to address psychological and instructional factors to support students better during remote learning environments.

                <p>by Lucas Böttcher, Maria R. D’Orsogna, Tom Chou</p>

Gathering observational data for medical decision-making often involves uncertainties arising from both type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors. In this work, we develop a statistical model to study how medical decision-making can be improved by aggregating results from repeated diagnostic and screening tests. Our approach is relevant to not only clinical settings such as medical imaging, but also to public health, as highlighted by the need for rapid, cost-effective testing methods during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our model enables the development of testing protocols with an arbitrary number of tests, which can be customized to meet requirements for type I and type II errors. This allows us to adjust sensitivity and specificity according to application-specific needs. Additionally, we derive generalized Rogan–Gladen estimates of disease prevalence that account for an arbitrary number of tests with potentially different type I and type II errors. We also provide the corresponding uncertainty quantification.

The denitrifying bacterium <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T, a common member of microbial communities in wastewater treatment facilities, can produce different compounds from a range of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In these different conditions, <i>Thauera</i> modifies its metabolism to produce different compounds that influence the microbial community. In particular, <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T produces different exopolysaccharides with floc-forming properties, impacting the physical disposition of wastewater consortia and the efficiency of nutrient assimilation by the microbial community. Under N-limiting conditions, <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T decreases its growth rate and accelerates the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate-related (PHA) compounds including polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which plays a fundamental role as C and energy storage in this β-proteobacterium. However, the metabolic mechanisms employed by <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T to assimilate and catabolize many of the different C and N sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions remain unknown. Systems biology approaches such as genome-scale metabolic modeling have been successfully used to unveil complex metabolic mechanisms for various microorganisms. Here, we developed a comprehensive metabolic model (M-model) for <i>Thauera sp</i>. MZ1T (<i>i</i>Thauera861), consisting of 1,744 metabolites, 2,384 reactions, and 861 genes. We validated the model experimentally using over 70 different C and N sources under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. <i>i</i>Thauera861 achieved a prediction accuracy of 95% for growth on various C and N sources and close to 85% for assimilation of aromatic compounds under denitrifying conditions. The M-model was subsequently deployed to determine the effects of substrates, oxygen presence, and the C:N ratio on the production of PHB and exopolysaccharides (EPS), showing the highest polymer yields are achieved with nucleotides and amino acids under aerobic conditions. This comprehensive M-model will help reveal the metabolic processes by which this ubiquitous species influences communities in wastewater treatment systems and natural environments.

Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants, usually single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associated with human traits, including disease and disease risk. These variants (or causal variants in linkage disequilibrium with them) usually affect the regulation or function of a nearby gene. A GWAS locus can span many genes, however, and prioritizing which gene or genes in a locus are most likely to be causal remains a challenge. Better prioritization and prediction of causal genes could reveal disease mechanisms and suggest interventions.
Results: We describe a new Bayesian method, termed SigNet for significance networks, that combines information both within and across loci to identify the most likely causal gene at each locus. The SigNet method builds on existing methods that focus on individual loci with evidence from gene distance and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) by sharing information across loci using protein-protein and gene regulatory interaction network data. In an application to cardiac electrophysiology with 226 GWAS loci, only 46 (20%) have within-locus evidence from Mendelian genes, protein-coding changes, or colocalization with eQTL signals. At the remaining 180 loci lacking functional information, SigNet selects 56 genes other than the minimum distance gene, equal to 31% of the information-poor loci and 25% of the GWAS loci overall. Assessment by pathway enrichment demonstrates improved performance by SigNet. Review of individual loci shows literature evidence for genes selected by SigNet, including <i>PMP22</i> as a novel causal gene candidate.

                <p>by Asgeir Kobro-Flatmoen, Stig W. Omholt</p>

Numerous studies of the human brain supported by experimental results from rodent and cell models point to a central role for intracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a rat model used to study AD, it was recently shown that in layer II neurons of the anteriolateral entorhinal cortex expressing high levels of the glycoprotein reelin (Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons), reelin and Aβ engage in a direct protein–protein interaction. If reelin functions as a sink for intracellular Aβ and if the binding to reelin makes Aβ physiologically inert, it implies that reelin can prevent the neuron from being exposed to the harmful effects typically associated with increased levels of oligomeric Aβ. Considering that reelin expression is extraordinarily high in Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons compared to most other cortical neurons, such a protective role appears to be very difficult to reconcile with the fact that this subset of ECLII neurons is clearly a major cradle for the onset of AD. Here, we show that this conundrum can be resolved if Re<sup>+</sup>alECLII neurons have a higher maximum production capacity of Aβ than neurons expressing low levels of reelin, and we provide a rationale for why this difference has evolved.

Identifying the driver nodes of a network has crucial implications in biological systems from unveiling causal interactions to informing effective intervention strategies. Despite recent advances in network control theory, results remain inaccurate as the number of drivers becomes too small compared to the network size, thus limiting the concrete usability in many real-life applications. To overcome this issue, we introduced a framework that integrates principles from spectral graph theory and output controllability to project the network state into a smaller topological space formed by the Laplacian network structure. Through extensive simulations on synthetic and real networks, we showed that a relatively low number of projected components can significantly improve the control accuracy. By introducing a new low-dimensional controllability metric we experimentally validated our method on N = 6134 human connectomes obtained from the UK-biobank cohort. Results revealed previously unappreciated influential brain regions, enabled to draw directed maps between differently specialized cerebral systems, and yielded new insights into hemispheric lateralization. Taken together, our results offered a theoretically grounded solution to deal with network controllability and provided insights into the causal interactions of the human brain.

                <p>by Kevin P. Greenman, Ava P. Amini, Kevin K. Yang</p>

Machine learning sequence-function models for proteins could enable significant advances in protein engineering, especially when paired with state-of-the-art methods to select new sequences for property optimization and/or model improvement. Such methods (Bayesian optimization and active learning) require calibrated estimations of model uncertainty. While studies have benchmarked a variety of deep learning uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods on standard and molecular machine-learning datasets, it is not clear if these results extend to protein datasets. In this work, we implemented a panel of deep learning UQ methods on regression tasks from the Fitness Landscape Inference for Proteins (FLIP) benchmark. We compared results across different degrees of distributional shift using metrics that assess each UQ method’s accuracy, calibration, coverage, width, and rank correlation. Additionally, we compared these metrics using one-hot encoding and pretrained language model representations, and we tested the UQ methods in retrospective active learning and Bayesian optimization settings. Our results indicate that there is no single best UQ method across all datasets, splits, and metrics, and that uncertainty-based sampling is often unable to outperform greedy sampling in Bayesian optimization. These benchmarks enable us to provide recommendations for more effective design of biological sequences using machine learning.

                <p>by Glen McLachlan, Piotr Majdak, Jonas Reijniers, Michael Mihocic, Herbert Peremans</p>

Self-motion is an essential but often overlooked component of sound localisation. As the directional information of a source is implicitly contained in head-centred acoustic cues, that acoustic input needs to be continuously combined with sensorimotor information about the head orientation in order to decode to a world-centred frame of reference. When utilised, head movements significantly reduce ambiguities in the directional information provided by the incoming sound. In this work, we model human active sound localisation (considering small head rotations) as an ideal observer. In the evaluation, we compared human performance obtained in a free-field active localisation experiment with the predictions of a Bayesian model. Model noise parameters were set a-priori based on behavioural results from other studies, i.e., without any post-hoc parameter fitting to behavioural results. The model predictions showed a general agreement with actual human performance. However, a spatial analysis revealed that the ideal observer was not able to predict localisation behaviour for each source direction. A more detailed investigation into the effects of various model parameters indicated that uncertainty on head orientation significantly contributed to the observed differences. Yet, the biases and spatial distribution of the human responses remained partially unexplained by the presented ideal observer model, suggesting that human sound localisation is sub-optimal.

                <p>by Guillem Murciano-Julià, Marina Francos-Cárdenas, Clàudia Salat-Canela, Elena Hidalgo, José Ayté</p>

Fission yeast is an excellent model system that has been widely used to study the mechanism that control cell cycle progression. However, there is a lack of tools that allow to measure with high precision the duration of the different phases of the cell cycle in individual cells. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a fluorescent reporter that allows the quantification of the different phases of the cell cycle at the single-cell level in most genetic backgrounds. To prove the accuracy of this fluorescent reporter, we have tested the reporter in strains known to have a delay in the G1/S or G2/M transitions, confirming the strength and versatility of the system. An advantage of this reporter is that it eliminates the need for culture synchronization, avoiding stressing the cells. Using this reporter, we show that unperturbed cells lacking Sty1 have a standard cell cycle length and distribution and that the extended length of these cells is due to their increased cell growth rate but not to alterations in their cell cycle progression.

NEW: Association between no referral versus health centres referrals preceding hospital admission and in-hospital child mortal</a></h4>

              
                Background The under-five mortality rate counted 71 deaths per 1000 live births for children under five in Sub Saharan Africa in 2022, far above the SDG under five-mortality goal of 25 deaths per live 1000 birth. Referral issues are major challenges to child health and a hypothesis is that care at lower-level facilities delays quality emergency care. This study investigates the extent of no-referral versus health centres-referrals prior to hospital admission for sick children, and with inpatient mortality associations in Malawi. Methods We conducted a cohort study of children aged 0-12 years admitted to hospitals in Mchinji district. Data-collection was done from September 2019 to April 2020 at one district-hospital and three community-hospitals. Information was collected from caregivers, patient files and ward admission registers. The primary analysis assesses the association between referral from a health centre and in-hospital outcomes using logistic regression. Inpatient mortality was the primary outcome. Result The 4926 included children demonstrated that 86.6% had gone straight to hospital without referral. The majority (67.9%) were admitted due to malaria, sepsis (21.3%) and pneumonia (13.3%). Referred children had a case fatality rate of 5.3%, while the non-referred had a case fatality rate of 2.5%. Referred children had higher odds of dying (AOR: 2.0, CI 95%: 1.3-3.0), compared to not referred children. Children with anaemia (AOR: 4.1, CI 95%: 2.7-6.3) and malnutrition (AOR: 6.3, CI 95%: 2.7-14.6) had significantly higher odds of dying, than those without these conditions. Conclusion Most children admitted to hospital were taken without a referral, and these children had better survival than those who were referred. While being referred could be a proxy for being more severely sick the mortality difference emphasises a need to better understand care-seeking pathways, including referral challenges, to direct interventions to improve timely provision of care for sick children.

                Background Approximately 1.6 billion people worldwide are currently affected by myopia, with estimates suggesting that by 2050, close to half of the global population may experience this condition. Additionally, the prevalence of myopia has been increasing in Trinidad, with rates ranging from 21.5% to 46%. A study has been conducted to determine better patients’ and students’ levels of knowledge, attitudes, and preferences toward the management of myopia in Trinidad. Methods This cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and preferences for myopia management among a sample of 323 participants, including patients and university students in Trinidad and Tobago, aged 18-40. Participants were randomly selected, and data were gathered using a structured questionnaire administered through telephone interviews for patients and emailed to students. Descriptive statistics and inferential analyses, including ANOVA and T-tests, were applied to identify significant associations, with a p-value threshold of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results A total of 317 participants were examined, resulting in a response rate of 98.1%. The average knowledge score of the participants was 12 out of 25. A slight difference was observed in the knowledge scores of males, with a p-value of 0.052. The results also indicated that the majority of the participants had a good attitude score (21.6 out of 30) toward myopia management. Age and gender had a negligible negative correlation (with a coefficient of -0.022 and p-value of 0.692, respectively) with management preference. Conclusion This study reveals critical gaps in knowledge and diverse attitudes toward myopia management among participants, highlighting the need for targeted educational interventions. While attitudes are generally positive, age and gender influence preferences for myopia correction, with spectacles and contact lenses being the most preferred methods. These insights can guide healthcare professionals in developing tailored approaches for myopia management in Trinidad and Tobago.

                Background This paper aims to examine the efficiency of Mexico’s dairy farms within its four regions of Tlaxcala Stated. Methods The Envelopment Data Analysis (DEA) applied to the variable returns to a scale model (VRS) for the year 2020. Also, Examine the statistical accuracy of efficiency estimation using bootstrap resampling techniques. The results reveal that Tlaxcala’s dairy farm efficiency, on the other hand, was adversely influenced by three inputs (costs): cost of investment in livestock, the total annual cost for feeding, reproduction, diseases and treatments, preventive medicine, sanitation, milking, fuel, and total labor. Results The efficiency distribution among farms using VRS, CRS, and FDH technologies reveals varying patterns. Under VRS and CRS, the majority of farms exhibit high efficiency within the 0 to less than 0.2 range, while FDH displays a broader distribution, with notable efficiency at 1 and across various ranges. These findings highlight the diverse landscape of efficiency levels across different technological approaches within the agricultural sector, offering valuable insights for optimization strategies and resource allocation. Conclusions The utilization of Bootstrap methodology enhances the reliability of efficiency assessments by providing robust statistical techniques that accommodate non-normal data distributions. By incorporating Bootstrap, decision-makers can obtain more accurate estimates of efficiency levels and confidence intervals, thereby making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and optimization strategies within the agricultural sector. As part of the study, provided The Policy suggestions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-38/v1?src=rss">Perceptions of communicable disease surveillance system attributes among key informants at primary healthcare centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Communicable disease surveillance systems (CDSSs) are essential for the timely identification and response to health threats, particularly in cities such as Jeddah, which serve as major gateways for international travelers and pilgrims. This study examined key informants’ perceptions of CDSS attributes at primary healthcare centers (PHCCs) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2017 to March 2018 at 45 PHCCs. Key informants completed a validated electronic questionnaire using a seven-point Likert scale to evaluate their perceptions of CDSS attributes, including timeliness, usefulness, simplicity, acceptability, and flexibility. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of neutral responses on the findings. Results Of the 42 eligible key informants, 40 participated, yielding a 95% response rate. The CDSS was perceived as timely by 69% of participants, whereas lower proportions rated it as useful (42%), simple (36%), acceptable (24%), and flexible (27%). No substantial associations were found between perceptions and variables such as years of experience, family medicine specialization, or CDSS training. Key informants highlighted staffing gaps (85%) and the need for electronic system implementation (95%) as primary areas for improvement. Conclusion While the CDSS demonstrated relative strength in timeliness, substantial improvements are required in other attributes. The findings underscore the importance of enhanced electronic systems, adequate staffing, and effective training programs. Further quantitative assessments are needed to validate these perceptions and inform improvements at local and national levels.

                Despite the substantial contribution of disruptions in GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission to the etiology of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders, surprisingly few drugs targeting the GABAergic system are currently available, partly due to insufficient understanding of circuit-specific GABAergic synapse biology. In addition to GABA receptors, GABAergic synapses contain an elaborate organizational protein machinery that regulates the properties of synaptic transmission. Until recently, this machinery remained largely unexplored, but key methodological advances have now led to the identification of a wealth of new GABAergic organizer proteins. Notably, many of these proteins appear to function only at specific subsets of GABAergic synapses, creating a diversity of organizer complexes that may serve as circuit-specific targets for pharmacotherapies. The present review aims to summarize the methodological developments that underlie this newfound knowledge and provide a current overview of synapse-specific GABAergic organizer complexes, as well as outlining future avenues and challenges in translating this knowledge into clinical applications.

Toller-Kawahisa et al. showed that this increase in IL-10 improves mitochondrial health and is due to a mechanism dependent on the ATP hydrolysis to adenosine.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91168">Recognition and cleavage of human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 main protease</a></h4>

              
                The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup> or Nsp5) is critical for production of viral proteins during infection and, like many viral proteases, also targets host proteins to subvert their cellular functions. Here, we show that the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 is recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. TRMT1 installs the <i>N</i><sup>2</sup>,<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification on mammalian tRNAs, which promotes cellular protein synthesis and redox homeostasis. We find that M<sup>pro</sup> can cleave endogenous TRMT1 in human cell lysate, resulting in removal of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain. Evolutionary analysis shows the TRMT1 cleavage site is highly conserved in mammals, except in Muroidea, where TRMT1 is likely resistant to cleavage. TRMT1 proteolysis results in reduced tRNA binding and elimination of tRNA methyltransferase activity. We also determined the structure of an M<sup>pro</sup>-TRMT1 peptide complex that shows how TRMT1 engages the M<sup>pro</sup> active site in an uncommon substrate binding conformation. Finally, enzymology and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that kinetic discrimination occurs during a later step of M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated proteolysis following substrate binding. Together, these data provide new insights into substrate recognition by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> that could help guide future antiviral therapeutic development and show how proteolysis of TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs both TRMT1 tRNA binding and tRNA modification activity to disrupt host translation and potentially impact COVID-19 pathogenesis or phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100928">Noncanonical roles of ATG5 and membrane atg8ylation in retromer assembly and function</a></h4>

              
                ATG5 is one of the core autophagy proteins with additional functions such as noncanonical membrane atg8ylation, which among a growing number of biological outputs includes control of tuberculosis in animal models. Here, we show that ATG5 associates with retromer’s core components VPS26, VPS29, and VPS35 and modulates retromer function. Knockout of ATG5 blocked trafficking of a key glucose transporter sorted by the retromer, GLUT1, to the plasma membrane. Knockouts of other genes essential for membrane atg8ylation, of which ATG5 is a component, affected GLUT1 sorting, indicating that membrane atg8ylation as a process affects retromer function and endosomal sorting. The contribution of membrane atg8ylation to retromer function in GLUT1 sorting was independent of canonical autophagy. These findings expand the scope of membrane atg8ylation to specific sorting processes in the cell dependent on the retromer and its known interactors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89690">Binding of LncDACH1 to dystrophin impairs the membrane trafficking of Nav1.5 protein and increases ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Dystrophin is a critical interacting protein of Nav1.5 that determines its membrane anchoring in cardiomyocytes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the regulation of cardiac ion channels, while their influence on sodium channels remains unexplored. Our preliminary data showed that lncRNA-<i>Dachshund</i> homolog 1 (<i>lncDach1</i>) can bind to dystrophin, which drove us to investigate if <i>lncDach1</i> can regulate sodium channels by interfering with dystrophin. Western blot and immunofluorescent staining showed that cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of <i>lncDach1</i> (<i>lncDach1</i>-TG) reduced the membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5 in cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, peak <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub> was reduced in the hearts of <i>lncDach1</i>-TG mice than wild-type (WT) controls. The opposite data of western blot, immunofluorescent staining and patch clamp were collected from <i>lncDach1</i> cardiomyocyte conditional knockout (<i>lncDach1</i>-cKO) mice. Moreover, increased ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility was observed in <i>lncDach1</i>-TG mice in vivo and ex vivo. The conservative fragment of <i>lncDach1</i> inhibited membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5, and promoted the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmia. Strikingly, activation of <i>Dystrophin</i> transcription by dCas9-SAM system in <i>lncDach1</i>-TG mice rescued the impaired membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5, and prevented the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. Furthermore, <i>lncDach1</i> was increased in transaortic constriction (TAC) induced failing hearts, which promoted the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmia. And the expression of <i>lncDach1</i> is regulated by hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase subunit beta (hadhb), which binds to <i>lncDach1</i> and decreases its stability. The human homologue of <i>lncDACH1</i> inhibited the membrane distribution of Nav1.5 in human iPS-differentiated cardiomyocytes. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of Nav1.5 membrane targeting and the development of ventricular arrhythmias.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94825">Partial rejuvenation of the spermatogonial stem cell niche after gender-affirming hormone therapy in trans women</a></h4>

              
                Although the impact of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) on spermatogenesis in trans women has already been studied, data on its precise effects on the testicular environment is poor. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize, through histological and transcriptomic analysis, the spermatogonial stem cell niche of 106 trans women who underwent standardized GAHT, comprising estrogens and cyproterone acetate. A partial dedifferentiation of Sertoli cells was observed, marked by the co-expression of androgen receptor and anti-Müllerian hormone which mirrors the situation in peripubertal boys. The Leydig cells also exhibited a distribution analogous to peripubertal tissue, accompanied by a reduced insulin-like factor 3 expression. Although most peritubular myoid cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin 2, the expression pattern was disturbed. Besides this, fibrosis was particularly evident in the tubular wall and the lumen was collapsing in most participants. A spermatogenic arrest was also observed in all participants. The transcriptomic profile of transgender tissue confirmed a loss of mature characteristics - a partial rejuvenation - of the spermatogonial stem cell niche and, in addition, detected inflammation processes occurring in the samples. The present study shows that GAHT changes the spermatogonial stem cell niche by partially rejuvenating the somatic cells and inducing fibrotic processes. These findings are important to further understand how estrogens and testosterone suppression affect the testis environment, and in the case of orchidectomized testes as medical waste material, their potential use in research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98992">The phytoplasma SAP54 effector acts as a molecular matchmaker for leafhopper vectors by targeting plant MADS-box factor SVP</a></h4>

              
                Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required. Here, we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase (SVP) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed <i>svp null</i> mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.

                Daily choices are determined by prior direct or indirect associations between low-salience cues and reinforcers. In this study, we used a mouse odor-taste sensory preconditioning task combined with genetic, intersectional and chemogenetic approaches to identify a novel brain circuit involved in mediated learning. We found that neuronal projections from the lateral entorhinal cortex to the basolateral amygdala are engaged during low-salience stimuli associations, which is essential for mediated learning formation.

">A stress-activated mid-insula to BNST pathway regulates susceptibility to abstinence-induced negative affect in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Stress is central to many neuropsychiatric conditions, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Stress influences the initiation and continued use of alcohol, the progression to AUD, and relapse. Identifying the neurocircuits activated during stress, and individual variability in these responses is critical for developing new treatment targets for AUD, particularly to mitigate stress-induced relapse. Using a longitudinal approach, this study examined the relationship between sub-chronic stress exposure and negative affect during protracted abstinence following chronic ethanol exposure. Sub-chronic restraint stress heightened negative affect-like behavior in protracted abstinence. Interestingly, this was driven by a subset of stress-susceptible female mice. We examined the mid-insula, a hub in the salience network, as a driver of this effect, given its role in emotional regulation and links to alcohol craving, consumption, and abstinence-induced negative affect. Mid-insula GCaMP fiber photometry revealed that GCaMP activity during stress exposure was positively correlated with activity during the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) two weeks into abstinence. A distinct subset of mice exhibited increasing activity during the consummatory phase, implicating the mid-insula as a neural basis for heightened negative affect in abstinence. Chemogenetic inhibition of mid-insula neurons projecting to the dorsal BNST during stress disrupted the emergence of stress susceptibility, highlighting this circuit as a key determinant of susceptibility to abstinence-induced negative affect. These outcomes were female-specific, addressing a critical gap in understanding AUD risk in women. Furthermore, female mice exhibited higher struggling behavior during stress than males. However, this effect was blocked in mice that had inhibition of the insula-BNST pathway during stress. By linking pre-alcohol stress response with abstinence outcomes, this work positions the insula-BNST pathway as a potential AUD circuit activity biomarker and therapeutic target.

">Human cortical dynamics reflect graded contributions of local geometry and network topography</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a physically embedded and heavily interconnected system that expresses neural rhythms across multiple time scales. While these dynamics result from the complex interplay of local and inter-regional factors, the relative contribution of such mechanisms across the cortex remains unclear. Our study explored geometric, microstructural, and connectome-level constraints on cortex-wide neural activity. We leveraged intracranial electroencephalography recordings to derive an intrinsic coordinate system of human cortical dynamics. Using multimodal neuroimaging, we could then demonstrate that these patterns were largely explainable by geometric properties indexed by inter-regional distance. However, dynamics in transmodal association regions were additionally explainable by incorporation of inter-regional microstructural similarity and connectivity information. Our findings were consistent when cross-referencing electroencephalography and imaging data from large-scale atlases and when using data obtained in the same individuals, suggesting subject-specificity and population-level generalizability. Together, our results support gradual shifts in the balance of local and macroscale constraints on cortical dynamics and highlight a key role of transmodal networks in inter-regional cortical coordination.

">Nucleus accumbens dopamine encodes the trace period during appetitive Pavlovian conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Pavlovian conditioning tasks have been used to identify the neural systems involved with learning cue-outcome relationships. In delay conditioning, the presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS) overlaps or co-terminates with the delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US). Prior studies demonstrate that behavioral responding during delay conditioning is regulated by dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In particular, the dopamine response to the CS reflects the relative value of the upcoming reward in these tasks. In contrast to delay conditioning, trace conditioning involves a trace period that separates the end of the CS and the delivery of the US. While dopamine has been implicated in trace conditioning, no studies to date have examined how NAc dopamine responds to reward-related stimuli in these tasks. To address this, we developed a within-subject trace conditioning task where distinct audio CSs signaled either a short trace period (5s) or a long trace period (55s) prior to the delivery of a food reward. Male rats exhibited higher levels of conditioned responding and a faster latency to respond to the Short Trace CS relative to the Long Trace CS. Voltammetry recordings in the NAc found that dopamine levels to the CS increased on Short Trace trials but decreased on Long Trace trials. Conversely, US-evoked dopamine responses were greater on Long Trace trials relative to Short Trace trials. We found that the CS dopamine response correlated with the latency to respond and not to the level of conditioned responding. Furthermore, the relationship between CS dopamine and latency was best explained by an exponential function. Taken together, our results illustrate how CS-evoked dopamine signals in the NAc relate to behavioral outcomes. Furthermore, we find that trace period is encoded by the bidirectional NAc dopamine response to the CS during Pavlovian conditioning.

">Locally induced traveling waves generate globally observable traveling waves</a></h4>

              
                Cortical traveling waves have been proposed as a fundamental mechanism for neural communication and computation. Methodological uncertainties currently limit the interpretability of non-invasive, extracranial traveling wave data, sparking debates about their cortical origin. Studies using EEG or MEG typically report waves that cover large portions of the sensor array which are often interpreted as reflecting long range cortical waves. Meanwhile, invasive, intracranial recordings in humans and animals routinely find both local, mesoscopic waves and large scale, macroscopic waves in cortex. Whether the global sensor-array waves found with EEG/MEG necessarily correspond to macroscopic cortical waves or whether they are merely projections of local dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we made use of the well-established retinotopic organization of early visual cortex to generate traveling waves with known properties in human participants (N=19, m/f) via targeted visual stimulation, while simultaneously recording MEG and EEG. The inducer stimuli were designed to elicit waves whose traveling direction in mesoscopic retinotopic visual areas depends on stimulus direction, while leaving macroscopic activation patterns along the visual hierarchy largely unchanged. We observed that the preferred direction of traveling waves across the sensor array was influenced by that of the visual stimulus, but only at the stimulation frequency. Comparison between single-trial and trial-averaged responses further showed considerable temporal variation in traveling wave patterns across trials. Our results highlight that under tight experimental control, non-invasive, extracranial recordings can recover mesoscopic traveling wave activity, thus making them viable tools for the investigation of spatially constrained wave dynamics.

">Human sleep spindles track experimentally excited brain circuits</a></h4>

              
                Spindles are hallmark oscillations during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. Together with slow oscillations (SOs), they are thought to play a mechanistic role in the consolidation of learned information. The quantity and spatial distribution of spindles has been linked to brain activity during learning before sleep and to memory performance after sleep. If spindles are drawn to cortical areas excited through pre-sleep learning tasks, this begs the question whether the spatial distribution of spindles is flexible, and whether their regional expression can also be manipulated with experimental brain stimulation. We used excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the left and right motor cortex in a repeated-measures experimental design. After stimulation, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep to test how local stimulation modulated the regional expression of sleep spindles. Indeed, we show that excitatory tDCS of local cortical sites before sleep biases the expression of spindles to the excited locations during subsequent sleep. No effects of localised tDCS excitation were seen for SOs. These results demonstrate that the spatial topography of sleep spindles is neither hard-wired nor random, with spindles being flexibly directed to exogenously excited cortical circuits.

">Intuitive sensorimotor decisions under risk take Newtonian physics into account</a></h4>

              
                The success of our interactions with objects in natural tasks depends on generating motor actions, which are subject to sensorimotor variability, the objects' physical properties, which are governed by the laws of kinematics, and the costs and benefits associated with the actions' outcomes. Therefore, such interactions jointly involve sensorimotor control, intuitive physics, and decision-making under risk. Here, we devised a mixed reality experiment, which allows investigating human behavior involving the interaction of all three of these cognitive faculties. Participants slid pucks to target areas associated with monetary rewards and losses within an immersive, naturalistic virtual environment. In this task, signal-dependent variability inherent in motor control interacts non-linearly with the physical relationships governing objects' motion under friction. By systematically testing generative models of behavior incorporating different assumptions about how participants may generate the slides, we find decisive evidence that participants' decision under risk readily took their individual motor variability and Newtonian physics into account to gain monetary rewards without relying on trial by trial learning.

">Neural encoding of biomechanically (im)possible human movements in occipitotemporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the human brain processes body movements is essential for clarifying the mechanisms underlying social cognition and interaction. This study investigates the encoding of biomechanically possible and impossible body movements in occipitotemporal cortex using ultra-high field 7Tesla fMRI. By predicting the response of single voxels to impossible/possible movements using a computational modelling approach, our findings demonstrate that a combination of postural, biomechanical, and categorical features significantly predicts neural responses in the ventral visual cortex, particularly within the extrastriate body area (EBA), underscoring the brain's sensitivity to biomechanical plausibility. Lastly, these findings highlight the functional heterogeneity of EBA, with specific regions (middle/superior occipital gyri) focusing on detailed biomechanical features and anterior regions (lateral occipital sulcus and inferior temporal gyrus) integrating more abstract, categorical information.

">Loss of Elp3 impairs the maturation tempo of brain ependymal cells</a></h4>

              
                Conditional deletion of Elp3 in the mouse forebrain leads to microcephaly at birth. In this study, we demonstrate that these mice also develop postnatal hydrocephalus, associated with an enlargement of the brain ventricles. In wild-type mice, ependymal motile cilia are properly aligned to facilitate the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles. Our findings reveal that Elp3 loss induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and upregulation of ATF4 expression in ependymal cell progenitors, which compromises Notch signaling and accelerates their maturation. This is accompanied by a disruption in the establishment of rotational and translational polarities of the motile cilia of maturing ependymal cells, resulting in disorganized cilia bundles. Collectively, these molecular abnormalities lead to the premature and abnormal development of ependymal cells, culminating in cilia beating dysfunction, impaired CSF clearance, and the development of hydrocephalus.

">Using magnetoencephalography to track the propagation of 40 Hz invisible spectral flicker</a></h4>

              
                Brain stimulation with novel 40 Hz invisible spectral flicker (ISF) has been proposed as a therapy for Alzheimer's disease, with leading hypotheses suggesting local promotion of glymphatic clearance of amyloid as the mechanism of action. Neural signals in the gamma range and their spatial propagation over the brain can be tracked using magnetoencephalography (MEG) with high temporal and good spatial detail. However, stimulation with 40 Hz ISF requires specialised hardware which causes electromagnetic interference (EMI) with MEG equipment. MEG measures the tiny magnetic fields of the brain, which are easily distorted by external magnetic fields. Using MEG to track the propagation of 40 Hz ISF requires multiple modifications to the experimental setup. These include, at least 1) an experimental design that promotes modulation of the neural signal, but not the artifact, 2) removal of all electronics not strictly necessary for light production from the stimulators, and 3) signal processing for 40 Hz EMI artifact suppression. Here, we present an MEG study on the cortical propagation of 40 Hz ISF. In two experiments, we investigate the modulation that visual and non-visual cognitive tasks have on the power and propagation of cortical activity induced by 40 Hz ISF. With the chosen experimental setup and design, the 40 Hz EMI artifact could not be entirely disentangled from the neural signal of interest, thus rendering inference on the spatial propagation of the 40 Hz signal impossible. Further improvements need to be implemented in a follow-up experimental design. We present potential solutions to allow for future investigation of 40 Hz ISF with MEG.

">Stress, Epigenetic Remodeling and FKBP51: Pathways to Chronic Pain Vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                Stress is thought to contribute to the persistence of pain and comorbid anxiety, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In our pre-clinical model, sub-chronic stress exacerbated subsequently induced inflammatory pain and accelerated the development of comorbid anxiety. DNA methylation analysis of spinal cord tissue after stress exposure revealed hypomethylation in the Fkbp5 promoter site for the canonical FKBP51 transcript and other stress-related genes. However, most epigenetic changes in key regulatory regions did not correlate with changes in gene expression assessed by RNA sequencing, suggesting that stress exposure had remodeled the epigenome without altering gene activity and primed genes for hyper-responsiveness to future challenges. FKBP51 inhibition during stress exposure reduced the exacerbation of inflammatory pain by stress and reversed several stress-induced DNA methylation changes in promoter regions of genes associated with stress and nociception, including Rtn4, Cdk5 and Nrxn1, but not Fkbp5. These results indicate that sub-chronic stress leads to the hypomethylation of Fkbp5 and increased susceptibility to chronic pain driven by FKBP51, but reversing Fkbp5 hypomethylation is not necessary to prevent chronic pain vulnerability, which is likely driven by complex epigenetic regulation of multiple stress-regulated genes.

">Identification of low copy synaptic glycine receptors in the mouse brain using single molecule localisation microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brainstem and spinal cord, where they regulate motor and sensory processes. GlyRs are clustered at the post-synaptic membrane by a strong interaction of the beta subunit with the scaffold protein gephyrin. Even though GlyRbeta mRNA is highly expressed throughout the brain, the existence of synaptic GlyRs remains controversial as there is little conclusive evidence using conventional fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiological recordings. Here we exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) to investigate the presence of GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the brain, focusing on several areas in the telencephalon, including hippocampus and striatum. Making use of a knock-in mouse model expressing endogenous mEos4b-tagged GlyRbeta we identified low-copy GlyR complexes at inhibitory synapses in different hippocampal regions. Dual-colour SMLM further revealed that the sparse GlyRs are integrated within the post-synaptic gephyrin domain, pointing to a possible role in maintaining the structural integrity of inhibitory synapses. In contrast, we found functionally relevant numbers of synaptic GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the ventral striatum. Our results further highlight the strength of SMLM to detect few and sparsely distributed synaptic molecules in complex samples and to analyse their organisation with high spatial precision.

">Dynamic Transcriptomic Remodeling in Human Neural Progenitor Cells Reveals Mechanisms for Vision Preservation in Retinitis Pigmentosa Model</a></h4>

              
                Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) have shown promise in slowing down retinal degeneration in animal models and are currently being tested in clinical trials for treating retinitis pigmentosa (RP). However, the status of grafted hNPCs and their interaction with host retinal cells over time is largely unknown. Here, we investigated single-cell transcriptomic changes in grafted hNPCs and host retinal cells following injection into a rodent model for RP. Grafted hNPCs and host retinal cells undergo dynamic transcriptomic changes in the degenerative retinal environment. Grafted hNPCs protect vision through multiple mechanisms, including trophic factor support, modulation of metabolic activity, reduction of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, alongside extracellular matrix remodeling. CellChat analysis revealed a progressive decline in intercellular signaling and communication strength between hNPCs and host retinal cells over time. This study indicates that enhancing trophic factor supports and improving host retinal environment are key targets to enable long-term vision preservation.

">Intrastriatal delivery of a zinc finger protein targeting the mutant HTT gene obviates lipid phenotypes in zQ175DN HD mice</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: Reducing the burden of mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) protein in brain cells is a strategy for treating Huntington's disease (HD). However, it is still unclear what pathological changes can be reproducibly reversed by mHTT lowering. We previously found that lipid changes that occur with HD progression could be prevented by attenuating HTT transcription of the mutant allele in a genetic mouse model (LacQ140) with inducible whole body lowering. Here, we tested whether intrastriatal injection of a therapeutic capable of repressing the mutant HTT allele with expanded CAG can provide similar protection against lipid changes in HD mice with a deletion of neo cassette (zQ175DN). Methods: Wild-type or zQ175DN mice were injected with AAV9 bearing a cDNA for a zinc finger protein (ZFP) which preferentially targets mutant HTT (ZFP-HTT) to repress transcription (Zeitler et al., 2019). Proteins were analyzed using western blot, capillary electrophoresis, and nitrocellulose filtration methods. Lipid analyses were conducted by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Somatic expansion index was assessed using capillary gel electrophoresis of PCR products. Conclusions: Lowering mHTT levels by 43% for 4 months prevented numerous changes in lipids of caudate-putamen in zQ175DN mice. Our data support the idea that mHTT lowering can provide meaningful benefits and support brain health. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that analyzing lipid signatures is a valuable method for evaluating potential therapies in a preclinical model of HD.

">Attentional cueing effects are reversed during locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Everyday human cognition and behaviour evolved in dynamic and ever-changing environments, but static paradigms still dominate experimental research despite concerns about generalisability of the results. In the case of attention, traditional stationary studies show that pre-orienting attention with spatial cues leads to faster, more accurate responses. However, how movement and environmental features shape such attentional processes in everyday behaviour remains unknown. Here we show that active movement through curved corridors reverses the typical spatial attention effect, with faster response times and higher accuracy for stimuli incongruent to implicit spatial cues provided by the movement direction, contradicting previous findings from static settings. We found that early (N1) and late (P3) attention-related electrophysiological responses were modulated by environmental features and motor demands. The posterior N1-component, reflecting visuo-spatial attention, showed decreasing amplitudes as turning angles and motor-control demands increased for congruent stimuli appearing on the side of the turning direction. Similarly, the P3-complex varied with motor and visual processing demands for congruent stimuli, showing decreased amplitudes as motor-control demands increased. We propose that congruent stimuli, displayed against a dynamically changing visual context, increase pulvino-cortical processing load and slowing early visual processing that affect behavioural responses. Incongruent stimuli, however, are displayed against a predictable context allowing faster target processing. These findings challenge attentional mechanisms' assumed consistency across static and dynamic settings, revealing instead their dependence on behavioural and environmental context. We advocate for naturalistic paradigms, arguing that moving beyond static experiments could reshape core views on cognition and behaviour.

">Early amyloid spine response and impaired synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons in human biopsies with Alzheimer's Disease-related pathology</a></h4>

              
                Studies of neuronal functions during the pathological progression of Alzheimers disease (AD) in humans are limited due to the lack of live human brain tissue from patients with AD. To address this gap, we have established an exceptional approach to study the electrophysiological properties and cell morphologies of human neurons in acute slices obtained from cortical biopsies of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). Histological examination of Broadman area 8-9 cortical biopsies from these patients have revealed that approximately 40% of the patients show signs of early AD-related pathology in the form of low to moderate, often fleecy beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits and additional, occasional tau in 10% of the cases. Thus, the iNPH brain biopsies, obtained during the shunt surgery to treat the patients, offer a unique window to investigate how existing AD-related pathology alters the operational properties of human cortical neurons. Here we carried out integrative analysis of human neuronal electrophysiology at single neuron and network level followed by subsequent cellular morphological reconstructions to register the primary pathological changes in neuronal functions in correlation with existing AD-related pathology. The presence of Abeta plaques induced a decrease in basal excitatory synaptic activity in pyramidal neurons residing on supragranular layers of the cortex. These neurons received less of L1-induced inhibition and appeared hyperexcitable in response to application to NMDA in multielectrode array (MEA) recordings. Interestingly, the global spine density of supraganular pyramidal neurons was increased in biopsies with AD-related pathology. The increase in spine density was coincidental with a partial recovery of excitatory transmission (frequency but not amplitude), of L1-induced inhibition in supragranular layers pyramidal neurons and of NMDA induced supragranular firing (but not of bursting hyperexcitability) indicating a potential differential effect of tau in the presence of Abeta on the progression of neuronal functions. Despite the partial renormalization of deficits seen in cases with Abeta pathology only, pyramidal neurons in cases with both Abeta and tau exhibited more consistent deficits in the intrinsic neuronal properties with increase in sodium and potassium currents and a strong propensity to bursting under NMDA stimulation. We conclude that complex mechanisms operate in response to accumulation of Abeta and tau including re-structuring of the apparatus of synaptic transmission and consolidation of a hyperexcitable supragranular cortical network phenotype. The observed changes in spine density and synaptic activity are reminiscent of parallels seen in homeostatic plasticity and synaptic scaling and may depend on strong interactions with the local microenvironment (astrocytes and microglia). This is the first study to report the impact of AD-related pathology on single-neuron operational properties and morphology in humans.

">Mapping Early Brain Maturation: Anatomical Substrates of Cortical Connectivity Shifts in Neonates</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the early development of brain connectivities is essential for unraveling the mechanisms of brain maturation. In this study, we utilized diffusion MRI data from 242 term neonates to chart the developmental trajectory of cortical connectivities in infants. We quantified interareal connectivity variations and identified three distinct global connectopies (GCs) along the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes through gradient mapping techniques. A pivotal age-dependent shift between the dorsoventral and mediolateral GCs occurred at 40 postmenstrual weeks, which was diminished by virtual thalamic fiber lesions, underscoring the critical role of thalamic projections. Longitudinal analysis disclosed delayed structural connectivity pattern development in preterm infants who failed to exhibit the anticipated shift. This research clarifies the topographic principles that shape infant brain organization and emphasizes the influence of thalamic connectivity on early brain development. Our findings elucidate the anatomical underpinnings of early brain development, providing critical insights into the formation of cortical hierarchies and highlighting the influence of thalamic connectivity on developmental trajectories, essential for understanding typical brain growth and the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Noncanonical Short-Latency Auditory Pathway Directly Activates Deep Cortical Layers</a></h4>

              
                Auditory processing in the cerebral cortex is considered to begin with thalamocortical inputs to layer 4 (L4) of the primary auditory cortex (A1). In this canonical model, A1 L4 inputs initiate a hierarchical cascade, with higher-order cortices receiving pre-processed information for the slower integration of complex sounds. Here, we identify alternative ascending pathways in mice that bypass A1 and directly reach multiple layers of the secondary auditory cortex (A2), indicating parallel activation of these areas alongside sequential information processing. We found that L6 of both A1 and A2 receive short-latency (<10 ms) sound inputs, comparable in speed to the canonical A1 L4 input but transmitted through higher-order thalamic nuclei. Additionally, A2 L4 is innervated by a caudal subdivision within the traditionally defined primary thalamus, which we now identify as belonging to the non-primary system. Notably, both thalamic regions receive projections from distinct subdivisions of the higher-order inferior colliculus, which in turn are directly innervated by cochlear nucleus neurons. These findings reveal alternative ascending pathways reaching A2 at L4 and L6 via secondary subcortical structures. Thus, higher-order auditory cortex processes both slow, pre-processed information and rapid, direct sensory inputs, enabling parallel and distributed processing of fast sensory information across cortical areas.

">NMDA-dependent coplasticity in VIP interneuron-driven inhibitory circuits</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory plasticity is emerging as a key regulator of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, a fundamental determinant of brain network dynamics. While significant progress has been made in understanding inhibitory plasticity at synapses targeting excitatory principal neurons (I - E), the mechanisms and functional implications of plasticity at interneuron-interneuron (I - I) synapses remain largely unexplored. Herein, we investigated the properties and plasticity of inhibitory inputs from vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons onto stratum oriens interneurons (soINs) in the hippocampal CA1 region. Using optogenetics, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and morphological reconstructions, we characterized the kinetics, short-term plasticity, and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term plasticity at VIP[-&gt;]soIN synapses in two distinct soIN subtypes: fast-spiking (FS) and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM)/bistratified interneurons. Optogenetically evoked VIP - soIN IPSCs showed faster rise times and slower decay kinetics in FS interneurons compared to OLM/bistratified cells, although both subtypes exhibited similar short-term plasticity profiles. Brief NMDA receptor activation (1 min) induced long-term depression (iLTD) at VIP - OLM/bistratified synapses, but not at VIP - FS synapses, underscoring subtype-specific plasticity. However, prolonged NMDA exposure (2 min) elicited iLTD in both interneuron subtypes. Interestingly, excitatory inputs to soINs demonstrated NMDA-induced long-term potentiation (E - I LTP) after brief NMDA exposure, but not after prolonged application. Notably, coplasticity analysis in individual soINs revealed asymmetric co-expression of I - I LTD and E - I LTP in OLM/bistratified interneurons. In contrast, FS interneurons exhibited a duration-dependent transition between asymmetric and symmetric coplasticity. These findings reveal a target-cell-specific landscape of inhibitory I - I plasticity and its co-expression with excitatory plasticity, highlighting VIP interneurons as key modulators of E/I balance within local hippocampal circuits.

">Dorsal hippocampus mediates light-tone sensory preconditioning task in mice</a></h4>

              
                Daily choices are often influenced by environmental cues that are not directly linked to reinforcers. This process is known as higher-order conditioning and can be measured using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm requires the repeated and simultaneous presentation of two low-salience stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase where one stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild footshock. The outcome is a conditioned response (i.e. freezing response) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we set up a successful light-tone sensory preconditioning task in male and female mice. Sex differences were seen on the number of conditioning sessions required to acquire mediated learning and in the behavioral responses observed in certain control experimental groups. We used in vivo calcium imaging to characterize the activity of hippocampal neurons in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus when associations between low-salience stimuli and reinforcers occur. Finally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to assess the role of these two hippocampal subregions in mediated learning. Our results indicate that dorsal, but not ventral, CaMKII-positive cells mediate the encoding of low-salience stimuli during the preconditioning phase. Overall, we implemented a novel light-tone sensory preconditioning protocol in mice that allowed us to detect sex differences and to further elucidate the role of particular hippocampal subregions and cell types in regulating these complex cognitive processes.

">WormID-Benchmark: Extracting Whole-Brain Neural Dynamics of C. elegans At the Neuron Resolution</a></h4>

              
                The nematode C. elegans is a well-studied model organism for characterizing the structure, connectivity, and function of a complete nervous system. Recent technical breakthroughs in 3D light microscopy and fluorescent protein tagging of individual neurons have brought us closer to capturing the neural dynamics of the worm at whole-brain resolution. Nevertheless, capturing a complete map of neural dynamics using these high-resolution recordings requires solving three specific challenges: i) detection of individual neurons in fluorescence videos, ii) identification of these neurons according to their anatomically defined classes, and iii) tracking of neural positions over time. Successfully addressing these challenges with high sensitivity, specificity, and throughput can enable us to analyze a large population sample, providing unprecedented insights into the structure and function of an entire brain at single-neuron resolution, a feat previously unaccomplished in any organism. To facilitate this scientific goal, we have curated publicly available annotated datasets from 118 worms across five distinct laboratories and established systematic benchmarks, decomposing the overarching objective into three well-defined tasks: i) neural detection, ii) identification, and iii) spatiotemporal tracking. Our preliminary analysis has revealed considerable room for improvement in existing state-of-the-art computational methods. Consequently, we envision that our WormID-Benchmark can catalyze efforts by a broad audience specializing in computer vision to develop robust and accurate methods that significantly enhance the throughput of generating annotated whole-brain neural dynamics datasets. We make our benchmark results reproducible; our code is publicly available at https://github.com/focolab/WormND.

">Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models with Attention for Subject-Specific Brain Network Synthesis</a></h4>

              
                The development of diffusion models, such as Glide, DALLE 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion, marks a significant advancement in generative AI for image synthesis. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for synthesizing intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) by utilizing the nonlinear capabilities of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). This approach builds upon and extends traditional linear methods, such as independent component analysis (ICA), which are commonly used in neuroimaging studies. A central contribution of our work is the integration of attention mechanisms into conditional DDPMs, enabling the generation of subject-specific 3D ICNs. Conditioning the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data on the corresponding ICNs enables the extraction of individualized brain connectivity patterns, effectively capturing within-subject and between-subject variability. Unlike prior models limited to 2D visualization, this framework generates 3D representations, providing a more comprehensive depiction of ICNs. The model's performance is validated on an external dataset to prevent overfitting and for overall generalizability. Furthermore, comparative evaluations also demonstrate that the proposed DDPM-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art generative models in producing more detailed and accurate ICNs, as validated through qualitative assessments.

                Neuromodulatory signaling is poised to serve as a neural mechanism for gain control, acting as a crucial tuning factor to influence neuronal activity by dynamically shaping excitatory and inhibitory fast neurotransmission. The endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system, the most widely expressed neuromodulatory system in the mammalian brain, is known to filter excitatory and inhibitory inputs through retrograde, pre-synaptic action. However, whether eCBs exert retrograde gain control to ultimately facilitate reward-seeking behaviors in freely moving mammals is not established. Using a suite of in vivo physiological, imaging, genetic, and machine learning-based approaches, we report a fundamental role for eCBs in controlling behavioral engagement in reward-seeking behavior through a defined thalamo-striatal circuit.

">Transcriptional responses to prolonged oxidative stress require cholinergic activation of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling</a></h4>

              
                Organisms have evolved protective strategies that are geared toward limiting cellular damage and enhancing organismal survival in the face of environmental stresses, but how these protective mechanisms are coordinated remains unclear. Here, we define a requirement for neural activity in mobilizing the antioxidant defenses of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans both during prolonged oxidative stress and prior to its onset. We show that acetylcholine-deficient mutants are particularly vulnerable to prolonged oxidative stress. We find that prolonged oxidative stress mobilizes a broad transcriptional response which is strongly dependent on both cholinergic signaling and activation of the muscarinic G-protein acetylcholine coupled receptor (mAChR) GAR-3. Gene enrichment analysis revealed a lack of upregulation of proteasomal proteolysis machinery in both cholinergic-deficient and gar-3 mAChR mutants, suggesting that muscarinic activation is critical for stress-responsive upregulation of protein degradation pathways. Further, we find that GAR-3 overexpression in cholinergic motor neurons prolongs survival during prolonged oxidative stress. Our studies demonstrate neuronal modulation of antioxidant defenses through cholinergic activation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, defining new potential links between cholinergic signaling, oxidative damage, and neurodegenerative disease.

">Diurnal Modulation of Locus Coeruleus Noradrenergic Neurons in Anesthetized Adult Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) is the primary source of noradrenaline (NA) in brain and its activity is essential for learning, memory, stress, arousal, and mood. LC-NA neuron activity varies over the sleep-wake cycle, with higher activity during wakefulness, correlating with increased CSF NA levels. Whether spontaneous and burst firing of LC-NA neurons during active and inactive periods is controlled by mechanisms independent of wakefulness and natural sleep, is currently unknown. Here, using multichannel in vivo electrophysiology under anesthesia, we assessed LC-NA neuron firing in adult male Fisher 344 rats at two different times of day- ZT4- the inactive period (light phase) and ZT16-the active period (dark phase)- independent of contributions from behavioral arousal and natural sleep. In the dark phase, LC-NA neurons exhibit increased average firing rate during baseline compared to the light phase. Using a relatively weak foot shock paradigm, we observed distinct populations of LC-NA neurons with some increasing, and others decreasing, their firing rate compared to baseline. Additionally, while spike frequency during spontaneous and evoked bursts is consistent across the dark-light phase, units recorded during the dark phase have more frequent bursts with a longer duration than those during the light phase. Our findings show that independent of wake state, LC-NA neurons exhibit intrinsic diurnal activity, and that the variability of response to foot shock stimulation demonstrates a physiological heterogeneity of LC-NA neurons that is just beginning to be appreciated.

                Navigating uncertainty is crucial for survival, with the location and availability of reward varying in different and unsignalled ways. Hippocampal place cell populations over-represent salient locations in an animal's environment, including those associated with rewards; however, how the spatial uncertainties impact the cognitive map is unclear. We report a virtual spatial navigation task designed to test the impact of different levels and types of uncertainty about reward on place cell populations. When the reward location changed on a trial-by-trial basis, inducing expected uncertainty, a greater proportion of place cells followed along, and the reward and the track end became anchors of a warped spatial metric. When the reward location then unexpectedly moved, the fraction of reward place cells that followed was greater when starting from a state of expected, compared to low, uncertainty. Overall, we show that different forms of potentially interacting uncertainty generate remapping in parallel, task-relevant, reference frames.

">Mirror effect of genomic deletions and duplications on cognitive ability across the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of gene expression shapes the interaction between brain networks which in turn supports psychological processes such as cognitive ability. How changes in the level of gene expression across the cerebral cortex influence cognitive ability remains unknown. Here, we tackle this by leveraging genomic deletions and duplications - copy number variants (CNVs) that fully encompass one or more genes expressed in the human cortex - which lead to large effects on gene expression levels. We assigned genes to 180 regions of the human cerebral cortex based on their preferential expression across the cortex computed using data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We aggregated CNVs in cortical regions, and ran a burden association analysis to compute the mean effect size of genes on general cognitive ability for each of the 180 regions. When affected by CNVs, most of the regional gene-sets were associated with lower cognitive ability. The spatial patterns of effect sizes across the cortex were correlated negatively between deletions and duplications. The largest effect sizes for deletions and duplications were observed for gene-sets with high expression in sensorimotor and association regions, respectively. These two opposing patterns of effect sizes were not influenced by intolerance to loss of function, demonstrating orthogonality to dosage-sensitivity scores. The same mirror patterns were also observed after stratifying genes based on cell types and developmental epoch markers. These results suggest that the effect size of gene dosage on cognitive ability follows a cortical gradient. The same brain region and corresponding gene set may show different effects on cognition depending on whether variants increase or decrease transcription. The latter has major implications for the association of brain networks with phenotypes.

	<p>Background: Decoding motor intentions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a critical component of motor imagery-based brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (MI&amp;amp;ndash;BCIs). In traditional EEG signal classification, effectively utilizing the valuable information contained within the electroencephalogram is crucial. Objectives: To further optimize the use of information from various domains, we propose a novel framework based on multi-domain feature rotation transformation and stacking ensemble for classifying MI tasks. Methods: Initially, we extract the features of Time Domain, Frequency domain, Time-Frequency domain, and Spatial Domain from the EEG signals, and perform feature selection for each domain to identify significant features that possess strong discriminative capacity. Subsequently, local rotation transformations are applied to the significant feature set to generate a rotated feature set, enhancing the representational capacity of the features. Next, the rotated features were fused with the original significant features from each domain to obtain composite features for each domain. Finally, we employ a stacking ensemble approach, where the prediction results of base classifiers corresponding to different domain features and the set of significant features undergo linear discriminant analysis for dimensionality reduction, yielding discriminative feature integration as input for the meta-classifier for classification. Results: The proposed method achieves average classification accuracies of 92.92%, 89.13%, and 86.26% on the BCI Competition III Dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV Dataset I, and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, respectively. Conclusions: Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper outperforms several existing MI classification methods, such as the Common Time-Frequency-Spatial Patterns and the Selective Extract of the Multi-View Time-Frequency Decomposed Spatial, in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains a prevalent issue among people with HIV (PWH) despite advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART). The pathogenesis of HIV-associated NCI is linked to chronic neuroinflammation caused by HIV, even in those with successful viral suppression. Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15), a protein involved in inflammatory and metabolic stress responses, has emerged as a key player and potential biomarker for various neurological conditions. This study investigates the relationship between GDF15 expression and HIV-associated NCI. Methods: PWH from the California NeuroAIDS Tissue Network (CNTN) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological exams within 12 months before death and were categorized based on cognitive performance. We examined GDF15 levels in their CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) and brain tissues using immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, double immunolabeling, and ELISA. Results: The cohort was of a similar age across HIV-associated NCI statuses (mean = 40.5), with a predominance of males (77%). The mean plasma viral load was 3.56 log10 copies/mL for Neurocognitively Unimpaired (NUI) PWH and 5.38 log10 copies/mL for people with HIV-associated NCI. GDF15 protein levels were significantly elevated in the frontal cortices of PWH with NCI compared to NUI PWH. Conclusions: The findings indicate that GDF15 may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated NCI, possibly through neuroinflammatory mechanisms. The strong association between GDF15 levels and cognitive impairment severity suggests its potential as a biomarker for the early detection and monitoring of NCI in PWH.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Based on previous data reporting the status of health professionals&amp;amp;rsquo; training about sleep clinical psychophysiology, insomnia, and its treatment in the US and Canada, this paper aims at providing a snapshot of the Italian situation, considering health professionals qualified to offer cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Adding information on different countries is important, as national health systems differ significantly, and distinct evidence-based pathways for change may be proposed. Methods: Two hundred and thirteen CBT professionals (180 females; 33 males) answered a 5 min survey about their training and experience in recognizing and treating behavioral sleep disorders in their practice. The questionnaire was diffused through the mailing list of the Italian Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy Society (Societ&amp;amp;agrave; Italiana di Terapia Comportamentale e Cognitiva, SITCC) throughout December 2023 and January 2024. Results: A total of 213 participants completed the survey. Only a minor proportion of respondents (37.1%) reported having received training for diagnosis and treatment of insomnia or other behavioral sleep disorders. Familiarity with psychological therapeutics for sleep was mainly associated with knowledge of sleep hygiene rules, relaxation, and mindfulness techniques, but not with core CBT strategies for insomnia (i.e., sleep restriction and stimulus control) and sleep regulation. The less familiar therapeutics were those for pediatric insomnia. Conclusions: The results of this study highlight scarce knowledge and consideration of sleep problems in CBT practice in Italy. As insomnia is prevalent, an independent mental disorder, and a predictor for mental and somatic comorbid conditions, these findings underscore an urgency to enlarge and strengthen CBT professionals&amp;amp;rsquo; training on sleep psychophysiology, sleep clinical psychology, insomnia, behavioral sleep problems, and their treatment.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Clarity AD phase III trial showed that lecanemab reduced amyloid markers in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and resulted in less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo. Herein, we aimed to characterize amyloid-β (Aβ) protofibril (PF) captured by lecanemab in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living participants with different stages in AD, which enable an enhanced understanding of the dynamic changes of lecanemab-associated Aβ-PF (Lec-PF) in vivo.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We newly developed a unique and highly sensitive immunoassay method using lecanemab that selectively captures Lec-PF. The CSF level of Lec-PF, Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, p-tau 217, total tau, and neurogranin were measured in Japanese participants (n = 163). The participants in this study consisted of 48 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-negative (CU–), 8 cognitively impaired diagnosed as suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, 9 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-positive (CU+), 34 Aβ-positive with mild cognitive impairment (MCI+), and 64 Aβ-positive with AD dementia (AD+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The CSF Lec-PF levels significantly increased in the groups of MCI+ and AD+ compared with CU– group. Notably, CSF Lec-PF showed modest correlation with plaque-associated biomarkers in Aβ-positive participants and stronger correlation with neurodegeneration biomarkers, such as CSF total tau and neurogranin, suggesting that CSF Lec-PF levels proximally reflect neurodegeneration as well as the amount of senile amyloid plaques.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first report describing Aβ-PF species captured by lecanemab in human CSF and supporting that Lec-PF is correlated with neurodegeneration in AD and may explain the mechanism of the clinical effect of lecanemab. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Cuprizone (CPZ) is a widely used toxin that induces demyelinating diseases in animal models, producing multiple sclerosis (MS)-like pathology in rodents. CPZ is one of the few toxins that triggers demyelination and subsequent remyelination following the cessation of its application. This study examines the functional consequences of CPZ-induced demyelination and the subsequent recovery of neural communication within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), with a particular focus on interhemispheric connectivity via the corpus callosum (CC). By employing wide-field, high-speed, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we were able to provide real-time mapping of neural activity in the ACC of CPZ-fed mice. Although we could not record physiological signals from the CC, the results demonstrated a notable impairment in interhemispheric connections within the ACC via the CC, with the most pronounced loss observed in a specific coronal slice among a series of slices examined. Notably, the latency of neural signal propagation remained largely unaltered despite connectivity loss, indicating that demyelination affects the extent, rather than the temporal dynamics, of neural communication. It is noteworthy that while functional connectivity appeared to recover fully after the cessation of CPZ, histological analysis revealed only partial recovery of myelination, indicating a discrepancy between functional and structural recovery. These findings enhance our understanding of how demyelination affects the ACC's role in orchestrating neural activity, particularly in light of the slice-specific nature of interhemispheric communication impairments. These findings offer new insights into MS pathology, particularly regarding the role of the CC in interhemispheric communication and potential therapeutic strategies.</p>

                Background This study sought to quantify the levels of saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins, as well as the IC50 values of avocado seed and aloe vera extracts. Methods The materials included in the investigation consisted of 70% ethanol extracts derived from avocado seeds and Aloe vera. Both samples underwent quantitative phytochemical analyses to ascertain total component content and an antioxidant activity assessment utilizing the 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) technique to evaluate % inhibition and IC50 values. The absorbance of the samples was quantified using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, which facilitated the calculation of total chemical content and antioxidant activity. Results The avocado seed extract comprised saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins at concentrations of 0.21%, 0.0232%, 19.94%, and 10.66%, respectively, with an IC50 value of 135 μg/mL. The aloe vera extract comprises saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins at concentrations of 0.74%, 0.0313%, 0.99%, and 4.68%, respectively, with an IC50 value of 4614 μg/mL. Conclusion Avocado seeds exhibited elevated levels of flavonoids and tannins, while aloe vera demonstrated increased concentrations of alkaloids and saponins. In the antioxidant activity assessment, avocado seeds demonstrated superior antioxidant efficacy.

                Objective To analyze the effectiveness of various techniques available for printing, finishing and polishing of 3D printed prosthesis. Methods The articles were selected from electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus. Recently, lot of advancements have been observed in the field of 3D printing in dentistry. Results Numerous studies were found explaining the factors affecting the surface roughness such as printing speed, direction, layer thickness, post curing, etc., and the significance in achieving a smooth surface finish of a 3D printed prosthesis. The methods employed to achieve this range, similar to conventional and chairside polishing, are to use advanced coating materials such as light cured glazes to nanoparticles. Conclusion 3D printing is being used in day-to-day practice and the prosthesis must be aesthetic looking to satisfy the patients’ expectations. There is a lack of data supporting any one polishing method for the prosthesis. There is a need for further research on the existing techniques and newer advancements yielding aesthetic prostheses with an optimal surface finish.

                Background In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, intradialytic hypertension and intradialytic hypotension are the common complications. The study aimed to collect and assess intradialytic Blood Pressure (BP) complications and their association with BP medications. Methods This was a prospective observational study, conducted at the hemodialysis center in a teaching hospital in the UAE, that provide a specialist’s care for the patients receiving ongoing hemodialysis. Patient demographics, medications used, lab data and the peridialytic BP (pre-, intra-, and post-) dialytic BP were collected for a period of 6 months. SPSS Version 29, Armonk, NY was used for statistical analysis. Pearson Chi-square test and Fischer’s Exact test were used to compare the association between categorical variables to intradialytic hypertension and hypotension. Binary logistic regression was used to find the effect of predictive variables to the presence or absence of intradialytic complications. Results Blood pressure data was collected from 47 hemodialysis patients for a total of 2616 hemodialysis sessions during the 6 months study period. Non-dialysable antihypertensives were predominantly used. Beta-blockers (68%) and calcium channel blockers (66%) were the commonly used drug classes. Intradialytic hypertension events were diagnosed in 49 (1.9%) hemodialysis sessions and intradialytic hypotension was diagnosed in 23 (0.9%) hemodialysis sessions. Chi-square test showed association of antihypertensive medication use to the occurrence of intradialytic hypertension; especially ARBs, and alpha-1 blockers. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers use were associated with decreased number of intradialytic hypertension events (p-value <0.05). Regression showed broad confidence intervals. On the other hand, antihypertensive medication use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension. Conclusions Even though antihypertensive medications showed varying occurance of intradialytic hypertension, the results are inconclusive due to large confidence intervals that could be due to the presence of colliniarity between the variables. Future studies are required in larger populations.

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment is a strategy commonly employed by indoor/vertical farms to improve crop yields. Artificially elevating the CO2 concentration within an enclosed growth space results in improved photosynthetic efficiency, and therefore improved crop growth rates and flavor profiles. Alcohol fermentation provides a steady stream of CO2 that is typically emitted to the atmosphere as a by-product. To evaluate the feasibility of using fermentation off-gas as a source for indoor CO2 enrichment, spinach plants were randomly assigned to 2 growth chambers. The control chamber was maintained under ambient CO2 concentrations, while the treatment chamber was piped onto a flow control system capable of delivering CO2 from a beer fermentation vessel to the growth chamber to maintain CO2 levels at a setpoint of 1200 parts-per-million (ppm). CO2 flow was diverted to the growth chamber when levels were below 1200 ppm, and to an external exhaust when chamber levels were above 1200 ppm, with the flow control device measuring internal CO2 concentrations and responding accordingly every 6 seconds. Standardized batches of beer were used to replenish the fermentation source to maintain continuous fermentation and CO2 off-gas production. The CO2 flow control device successfully maintained a strong oscillation of CO2 around the 1200 ppm setpoint within the treatment growth chamber for the duration of the 50-day growth period. Spinach plants grown in the treatment chamber produced significantly more fresh biomass (5.456 g vs. 2.888 g), dry biomass (0.5711 g vs. 0.271 g), and significantly longer leaf lengths (231.0 mm vs. 159.9 mm) than their control chamber counterparts, respectively. This represents an 89% increase in fresh spinach crop yield within a controlled indoor growth environment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-34/v1?src=rss">Regional Innovation System (RIS) as a means for development: Policies, opportunities and challenges in Ethiopia. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The successful execution of Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) policies is crucial for developing a strong Regional Innovation System (RIS) in Ethiopia, which is essential for promoting economic growth and enhancing competitiveness. Methods This study utilized a document review approach to critically analyze Ethiopia’s current STI policies and legal frameworks within the context of the Regional Innovation System (RIS). Results The findings indicate potential solutions to strengthen Ethiopia’s regional innovation system, including increasing funding for research and development (R&D), fostering better collaboration between universities and industries, and cultivating an entrepreneurial culture. The analysis reveals that Ethiopia possesses significant opportunities to enhance its STI capabilities due to its strategic location, abundant natural resources, and growing governmental and non-governmental support. However, it also highlights critical implementation gaps in STI policies, such as inadequate infrastructure, poor coordination among stakeholders, weak university-industry partnerships, and limited R&D investment. Conclusion Ethiopia’s STI policies and legal frameworks are essential for driving economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness by fostering an environment that encourages collaboration and technology transfer. Nevertheless, the country faces challenges in effectively implementing these comprehensive policies due to existing barriers like policy gaps and insufficient institutional support. To strengthen its National Innovation System and promote sustainable economic development, Ethiopia must assess current opportunities, address these obstacles, and explore alternative policies that can enhance its STI capabilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-837/v3?src=rss">Analysis of the dynamics of transition from non-colonization to colonization and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in hemodialysis patients using Markov models. [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of specific covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a tertiary care hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

                Invasive sino-orbital fungal infection is an uncommon, yet severe condition that is rare among immunocompetent individuals, with most cases typically occurring in those with compromised immune systems. In this study, we report the case of a 5-month-old immunocompetent infant who exhibited persistent dacryocystitis despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, the patient developed ethmoiditis, orbital subperiosteal abscess, and ulceration of the hard palate. Mycological and histological samples were collected from the affected area. The combination of microscopy and PCR amplification allowed for the identification of the fungal agent Candida tropicalis. The patient underwent sinus surgery and surgical debridement, along with antifungal therapy. The treatment was successful, and the follow-up was uneventful for up to 6 months. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of invasive sino-orbital candidiasis in an immunocompetent infant with dacryocystitis as the entry point. This study explores the clinical features, management approaches, and outcomes of this potentially fatal disease.

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media and web-based platforms were widely used to promote medicinal substances. To assess community perspectives on drug promotions on social media, we conducted qualitative research using three workshops. The workshops aimed to highlight the public understanding of drug advertising focusing on community perceptions of social media drug promotions, their risks and benefits. Discussions were conducted on the importance of adhering to national drug regulation policies and the World Health Organisation ethical criteria for promotion, advertisement, and publicity of medicines. Methods Participants for the workshops were purposively sampled from local community youth groups and healthcare facilities. Two workshops included ten young adults aged 18-35, while the third workshop involved three healthcare professionals and one traditional healer. Results The study participants’ highlighted the value of honesty and trust in the drug promotions. Gaps in the ethical conduct of advertising were observed and concerns were raised about the reliability of social media information and the omission of valuable details on the drug advertisements. Conclusion Individuals have a right to informed choices that ensure their health safety. This study has highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in pharmaceutical and complementary medicine marketing on social media. Collaboration is needed between regulatory bodies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers and community members, to make sure that drug advertising upholds ethical standards and public health.

                Background This article introduces the concept of fuzzy pseudo-TM subalgebra (FPTMSA) of pseudo-TM algebra (PTMA). This study explores the relationship between FPTMSAs and their level sets within the context of PTMA. It further investigates the homomorphic behavior of FPTMSAs under various algebraic operations, thereby providing a foundation for further exploration of the algebraic structure of fuzzy pseudo-ideals within PTMAs. Methods The concept of level sets for FPTMSAs is defined and examined, highlighting their role in characterizing these subalgebras within a PTMA. This study explores the behavior of FPTMSAs under homomorphisms, considering both homomorphic images (HI) and inverse images (II) of FPTMSAs in PTMAs. In addition, the composition of epimorphic images and inverse images of FPTMSAs is discussed. The study also considers the properties of FPTMSAs under Cartesian products (CPs), demonstrating that the Cartesian product of two FPTMSAs remains an FPTMSA. Results This study establishes several key properties of FPTMSAs in PTMAs, particularly focusing on their behavior under homomorphisms, epimorphisms, and Cartesian products. Specifically, this study demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two FPTMSAs results in another FPTMSA. Additionally, this study examines the relationships between the homomorphic image and inverse image of FPTMSAs and presents further algebraic results related to these concepts. Conclusions The article concludes by highlighting the significant role of FPTMSAs in the structure of PTMAs, particularly in their interaction with homomorphisms, epimorphisms, and Cartesian products. The results suggest that the FPTMSAs are robust under various algebraic operations. Future work will extend these concepts to intuitionistic fuzzy pseudo-TM subalgebra within PTMAs with the goal of uncovering new algebraic insights and results.

                Background The regulation of receptor expression is crucial for fine-tuned signal transduction. Notch signaling is a key signaling pathway involved in retinal development. Although the involvement of this signaling pathway in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells has been documented, less is known about its involvement in earlier stages of retinal progenitor cell differentiation. We aimed to clarify the timing of Notch receptor expression in undifferentiated retinal progenitor cells and elucidate the possible involvement of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of Notch receptor expressions. Methods We re-analyzed publicly available human fetal retina single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (GSE183684) using Seurat/Signac pipelines. Results On days 59, 74, and 78, we observed NOTCH1 mRNA expression in early retinal progenitor cells, which diminished at later stages of differentiation. Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin remodeling in part of the NOTCH1 locus was accompanied by transitions in its mRNA expression. Importantly, chromatin accessibility in the region upstream of NOTCH1 depended on the differentiated cell types. Conclusions These results suggest that chromatin remodeling may be involved in the differential expression of NOTCH1, although another type of Notch mRNA expression regulation may exist.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-30/v1?src=rss">Case Report : Successful live pregnancy following embryo transfer after isthmocele repair [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Isthmocele, or uterine niche, is a defect in the anterior wall of the uterine isthmus, often following a cesarean section. It can lead to complications such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, and pregnancy risks. This case report describes a successful live pregnancy after isthmocele repair and embryo transfer. A 28-year-old woman (para 1, living 1) presented with prolonged periods, dysmenorrhea, and secondary infertility. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a large isthmocele and intra-cavitary uterine fluid. The patient underwent ovarian stimulation using an antagonist protocol twice, retrieving oocytes and freezing nine embryos. She later had laparoscopic isthmocele repair at another facility. Upon returning for frozen embryo transfer, irregular bleeding and dysmenorrhea persisted. Repeat ultrasound showed a small cesarean defect (4x3 mm), fluid in the endometrial cavity, and hyperechoic endometrium. Fluid aspiration was performed, followed by the transfer of a grade AA embryo. Although conception occurred, it was a biochemical pregnancy with a βhCG level of 12.43 mIU/ml. Due to a persistent scar defect and endometrial cavity fluid, the patient underwent hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy, and minimal resection of the defect. Three months later, a frozen embryo transfer of a grade AB embryo was performed. This resulted in a viable pregnancy, confirmed by a βhCG level of 364 mIU/ml. The pregnancy progressed without complications, and at 36+3 weeks, the patient delivered a healthy baby via planned cesarean section. This case underscores the importance of diagnosing and managing isthmocele in infertility patients. Surgical repair can restore normal uterine anatomy and enhance the success of assisted reproductive techniques like embryo transfer.

                Introduction Burnout is a syndrome resulting from unsuccessful stress management in the workplace, and is characterized by three dimensions: energy depletion, reduced professional efficacy, and feelings of negativism. Background Studies have confirmed that burnout causes deterioration in teamwork and job satisfaction and negatively impacts and compromises services. Many studies have examined the impact of burnout on health. Aim This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the rate of burnout among hospital pharmacists working in Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. Method The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey for Medical Professionals was used to assess burnout. The survey measured three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal achievement. In addition, pharmacists were asked questions regarding their demographic years of practice and qualifications. The surveys were distributed to inpatients, discharge/emergency, outpatients, and clinical pharmacies. The data were collected over two weeks and analyzed. Results Sixty-eight of the 90 pharmacists participated in this study. The response rate was 75.5%. Seventeen pharmacists were considered to have high burnout as they had both high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization scores. Two pharmacists were considered to have moderate burnout, as they had moderate emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal achievement. Only 17 pharmacists reported a low level of burnout. Conclusion The study revealed that 25% of the pharmacists had high burnout rates. Although statistically insignificant (P > 0.05), all pharmacists with high burnout were female and working in different pharmacy settings. Moreover, an additional 25% experienced low burnout, and 3% had moderate burnout levels. The remaining items were difficult to classify because they did not fit the Maslach definition of high, moderate, or low burnout. Further investigation is needed to identify the levels and causes of burnout among Sheikh Khalifa Medical City pharmacists.

                Background Telekyanmar (Telehealth), one of the telemedicine services in Myanmar, was initiated a few months after the military coup and amidst the onset of the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The program aims to address the urgent requirement for accessible medical services for Myanmar’s vulnerable population. Given the critical importance of both clients’ and providers’ satisfaction in the success of telemedicine services, this study aims to evaluate clients’ and providers’ satisfaction regarding the telehealth services offered by the Telekyanmar project in Myanmar. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2023 to September 2023 by utilizing a quantitative research method. Data were collected online through a structured questionnaire. The clients who have received health care services and clinicians who are working at Telekyanmar clinics during the study period were included in the study. Data management and analysis were done by using R software (https://www.r-project.org/). Results A total of 306 clients and 79 clinicians were included in the assessment. The mean age of the clients and clinicians were 33.2±13.6 years and 35.6±6.8 years, respectively. Over 85% of the clients and 58.2% of clinicians were residing inside the country. Clients’ satisfaction on various aspects of Telekyanmar services were assessed, with the question regarding “health staff respect for privacy” receiving the highest proportion of “good” and “excellent” responses at 96.1%. Regarding overall treatment experience, 96.7% of clients reported being “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the Telekyanmar services. Overall satisfaction was reported by 88.6% of clinicians. Specifically, over 87% of clinicians reported their satisfaction on “communication with patients”, 79.7% satisfied with “quality of clinical consultation”, and 78.5% satisfied with “treatment prescription”. Conclusions The findings indicated that majority of the clients and clinicians expressed their satisfaction with the Telekyanmar services, which was established to address the healthcare needs of people in Myanmar after the military coup.

                <p>by Chuanmei Bi, Yong Shi, Junfeng Xia, Zhen Liang, Zhiqiang Wu, Kai Xu, Na Cheng</p>

Synonymous mutations, once considered neutral, are now understood to have significant implications for a variety of diseases, particularly cancer. It is indispensable to identify these driver synonymous mutations in human cancers, yet current methods are constrained by data limitations. In this study, we initially investigate the impact of sequence-based features, including DNA shape, physicochemical properties and one-hot encoding of nucleotides, and deep learning-derived features from pre-trained chemical molecule language models based on BERT. Subsequently, we propose EPEL, an effect predictor for synonymous mutations employing ensemble learning. EPEL combines five tree-based models and optimizes feature selection to enhance predictive accuracy. Notably, the incorporation of DNA shape features and deep learning-derived features from chemical molecule represents a pioneering effect in assessing the impact of synonymous mutations in cancer. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, EPEL demonstrates superior performance on independent test datasets. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a significant correlation between effect scores and patient outcomes across various cancer types. Interestingly, while deep learning methods have shown promise in other fields, their DNA sequence representations do not significantly enhance the identification of driver synonymous mutations in this study. Overall, we anticipate that EPEL will facilitate researchers to more precisely target driver synonymous mutations. EPEL is designed with flexibility, allowing users to retrain the prediction model and generate effect scores for synonymous mutations in human cancers. A user-friendly web server for EPEL is available at http://ahmu.EPEL.bio/.

T cells recognize a wide range of pathogens using surface receptors that interact directly with peptides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) encoded by the HLA loci in humans. Understanding the association between T cell receptors (TCR) and HLA alleles is an important step towards predicting TCR-antigen specificity from sequences. Here we analyze the TCR alpha and beta repertoires of large cohorts of HLA-typed donors to systematically infer such associations, by looking for overrepresentation of TCRs in individuals with a common allele.TCRs, associated with a specific HLA allele, exhibit sequence similarities that suggest prior antigen exposure. Immune repertoire sequencing has produced large numbers of datasets, however the HLA type of the corresponding donors is rarely available. Using our TCR-HLA associations, we trained a computational model to predict the HLA type of individuals from their TCR repertoire alone. We propose an iterative procedure to refine this model by using data from large cohorts of untyped individuals, by recursively typing them using the model itself. The resulting model shows good predictive performance, even for relatively rare HLA alleles.

                <p>by Francisco Páscoa dos Santos, Paul F. M. J. Verschure</p>

Although the primary function of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) homeostasis is the maintenance of mean firing rates, the conjugation of multiple homeostatic mechanisms is thought to be pivotal to ensuring edge-of-bifurcation dynamics in cortical circuits. However, computational studies on E-I homeostasis have focused solely on the plasticity of inhibition, neglecting the impact of different modes of E-I homeostasis on cortical dynamics. Therefore, we investigate how the diverse mechanisms of E-I homeostasis employed by cortical networks shape oscillations and edge-of-bifurcation dynamics. Using the Wilson-Cowan model, we explore how distinct modes of E-I homeostasis maintain stable firing rates in models with varying levels of input and how it affects circuit dynamics. Our results confirm that E-I homeostasis can be leveraged to control edge-of-bifurcation dynamics and that some modes of homeostasis maintain mean firing rates under higher levels of input by modulating the distance to the bifurcation. Additionally, relying on multiple modes of homeostasis ensures stable activity while keeping oscillation frequencies within a physiological range. Our findings tie relevant features of cortical networks, such as E-I balance, the generation of gamma oscillations, and edge-of-bifurcation dynamics, under the framework of firing-rate homeostasis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity in the distance to the bifurcation found across cortical areas. In addition, we reveal the functional benefits of relying upon different homeostatic mechanisms, providing a robust method to regulate network dynamics with minimal perturbation to the generation of gamma rhythms and explaining the correlation between inhibition and gamma frequencies found in cortical networks.

Humans can perform movements in various physical environments and positions (corresponding to different experienced gravity), requiring the interaction of the musculoskeletal system, the neural system and the external environment. The neural system is itself comprised of several interactive components, from the brain mainly conducting motor planning, to the spinal cord (SC) implementing its own motor control centres through sensory reflexes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether similar movements in various environmental dynamics necessitate adapting modulation at the brain level, correcting modulation at the spinal level, or both. Here, we addressed this question by focusing on upper limb motor control in various gravity conditions (magnitudes and directions) and using neuromusculoskeletal simulation tools. We integrated supraspinal sinusoidal commands with a modular SC model controlling a musculoskeletal model to reproduce various recorded arm trajectories (kinematics and EMGs) in different contexts. We first studied the role of various spinal pathways (such as stretch reflexes) in movement smoothness and robustness against perturbation. Then, we optimised the supraspinal sinusoidal commands without and with a fixed SC model including stretch reflexes to reproduce a target trajectory in various gravity conditions. Inversely, we fixed the supraspinal commands and optimised the spinal synaptic strengths in the different environments. In the first optimisation context, the presence of SC resulted in easier optimisation of the supraspinal commands (faster convergence, better performance). The main supraspinal commands modulation was found in the flexor sinusoid’s amplitude, resp. frequency, to adapt to different gravity magnitudes, resp. directions. In the second optimisation context, the modulation of the spinal synaptic strengths also remarkably reproduced the target trajectory for the mild gravity changes. We highlighted that both strategies of modulation of the supraspinal commands or spinal stretch pathways can be used to control movements in different gravity environments. Our results thus support that the SC can assist gravity compensation.

Sumoylation is a posttranslational modification essential for multiple cellular functions in eukaryotes. ULP-2 is a conserved SUMO protease required for embryonic development in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Here, we revealed that ULP-2 controls germline development by regulating the PHD-SET domain protein, SET-26. Specifically, loss of ULP-2 results in sterility and a progressive elevation of global protein sumoylation. In the germline of <i>ulp-2</i> null mutant, meiosis is arrested at the diplotene stage and the cells in the proximal germline acquire a somatic fate. Germline RNAseq analysis revealed the down-regulation of numerous germline genes in <i>ulp-2</i> mutants, whereas somatic gene expression is up-regulated. To determine the key factors that are regulated by ULP-2, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified the histone methylation reader, SET-26 as a ULP-2 interacting protein. Loss of SET-26 enhanced the sterility of <i>ulp-2</i> mutant animals. Consistently, SET-26 is sumoylated and its sumoylation levels are regulated by ULP-2. Moreover, we detected a reduction in H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) histone levels bound to SET-26 in the <i>ulp-2</i> mutant background suggesting a dependence of this histone reader on balanced sumoylation. Finally, a comparative proteomics screen between WT and <i>ulp-2</i> loss of activity identified the predicted methyltransferase SET-27 as a ULP-2-dependent SET-26-associated protein. SET-27 knockout genetically interacts with ULP-2 in the germline, but not with SET-26. Taken together, we revealed a SUMO protease/H3K4me3 histone reader axis which is required for the maintenance and regulation of germline development.

Throughout the animal kingdom, several members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family act as proneural genes during early steps of nervous system development. Roles of bHLH genes in specifying terminal differentiation of postmitotic neurons have been less extensively studied. We analyze here the function of 5 <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> bHLH genes, falling into 3 phylogenetically conserved subfamilies, which are continuously expressed in a very small number of postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. We show (a) that 2 orthologs of the vertebrate <i>bHLHe22/e23</i> genes, called <i>hlh-17</i> and <i>hlh-32</i>, function redundantly to specify the identity of a single head interneuron class (AUA), as well as an individual motor neuron (VB2); (b) that the <i>PTF1a</i> ortholog <i>hlh-13</i> acts as a terminal selector to control terminal differentiation and function of the sole octopaminergic neuron class in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, RIC; and (c) that the <i>NHLH1/2</i> ortholog <i>hlh-15</i> controls terminal differentiation and function of the peptidergic AVK head interneuron class, a known neuropeptidergic signaling hub in the animal. Strikingly, through null mutant analysis and cell-specific rescue experiments, we find that loss of <i>hlh-15/NHLH</i> in the peptidergic AVK neurons and the resulting abrogation of neuropeptide secretion from these neurons causes a substantially extended lifespan of the animal, which we propose to be akin to hypothalamic control of lifespan in vertebrates. Our functional analysis reveals themes of bHLH gene function during terminal differentiation that are complementary to the earlier lineage specification roles of other bHLH family members. However, such late functions are much more sparsely employed by members of the bHLH transcription factor family, compared to the function of the much more broadly employed homeodomain transcription factor family.

                <p>by Pankajam Thyagarajan, Hannah S. Mirshahi, Gregory O. Kothe, Nitish Kumar, Melissa Long, Bowofoluwa S. Abimbola, Alexis T. Weiner, Melissa M. Rolls</p>

Microtubule nucleation is important for microtubule organization in dendrites and for neuronal injury responses. The core nucleation protein, γTubulin (γTub), is localized to dendrite branch points in <i>Drosophila</i> sensory neurons by Wnt receptors and scaffolding proteins on endosomes. However, whether Wnt ligands are important is unknown. We found that Wnt secretion from epithelial cells was required for γTub localization to dendrite branch points. Using RNAi and mutant approaches, we demonstrated that Wnt4 and wntD both position γTub. Moreover, injury-induced increases in neuronal microtubule dynamics required Wnt secretion from epithelial cells. Overexpression of Wnts in epithelial cells increased microtubule dynamics to the same extent as axon injury indicating surrounding cells have an instructive role in neuronal nucleation. To determine how Wnt ligands concentrate microtubule nucleation at dendrite branch points, we tested whether endocytosis is restricted to specific regions of dendrites. Markers of clathrin-mediated endocytosis localized to puncta at branch points. Behavior of these puncta was sensitive to inhibition of endocytosis suggesting they represented endocytic sites. In addition to previously described colocalization of Wnt receptors and scaffolds with Rab5 endosomes, we identified a separate set of Wnt signaling puncta that colocalized with clathrin in dendrites. Moreover, γTub and Wnt scaffolding protein recruitment to branch points was reduced by clathrin RNAi, and injury-induced up-regulation of microtubule dynamics was sensitive to clathrin reduction. We propose that the localization of Wnt endocytic sites to dendrite branch points results in the local generation of microtubule nucleating endosomes.

                <p>by Xiumei Song, Han Zhou, Jingwen Wang</p>

The peritrophic matrix (PM) acts as a physical barrier that influences the vector competence of mosquitoes. We have previously shown that gut microbiota promotes PM formation in <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identify that the cell wall components of gut commensal bacteria contribute to PM formation. Oral administration of primary cell wall components from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, such as diaminopimelic acid-peptidoglycan (DAP-PGN), lysine-peptidoglycan (Lys-PGN), and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), to mosquitoes, after depleting their gut microbiota with antibiotics, restores the down-regulated expression of the <i>peritrophin1</i> (<i>Per1</i>) gene, which encodes a structural protein of the PM. Moreover, this administration rescues PM formation upon blood ingestion. PGN and LPS are well-known ligands of innate immune signaling pathways in animals. In mosquitoes, the Toll and IMD (immune deficiency) pathways are the 2 major innate immune signaling pathways. We next knocked down the expression of 2 receptors, <i>Pgrp-s1</i> and <i>Pgrp-lc</i>, as well as 2 transcription factors, <i>Rel1</i> and <i>Rel2</i>, which are involved in the Toll and IMD pathways, respectively. Double knockdown of <i>Pgrp-s1</i> and <i>Pgrp-lc</i>, or <i>Rel1</i> and <i>Rel2</i>, compromised <i>Per1</i> expression. Additionally, through dual-luciferase assays and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we identified a 15-bp binding motif (ATAGACACGAGCACC) for Rel1 and Rel2 in the <i>Per1</i> promoter region. To further explore the role of individual Toll and IMD pathways in the regulation of <i>Per1</i> expression, we specifically inhibited the activity of each pathway. While inhibition of the Toll pathway by knocking down <i>Pgrp-s1</i> or <i>Rel1</i> did not affect <i>Per1</i> expression, knockdown of <i>Pgrp-lc</i> or <i>Rel2</i> in the IMD pathway significantly down-regulated <i>Per1</i> expression. These findings suggest that the IMD pathway plays a major role in regulating <i>Per1</i> expression in <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i>. In summary, our study uncovers a novel role for bacterial cell wall components in regulating PM formation through activation of mosquito immune signaling pathways.

                <p>by Marie Raynaud, Paola Sanna, Julien Joseph, Julie Clément, Yukiko Imai, Jean-Jacques Lareyre, Audrey Laurent, Nicolas Galtier, Frédéric Baudat, Laurent Duret, Pierre-Alexandre Gagnaire, Bernard de Massy</p>

In many eukaryotes, meiotic recombination occurs preferentially at discrete sites, called recombination hotspots. In various lineages, recombination hotspots are located in regions with promoter-like features and are evolutionarily stable. Conversely, in some mammals, hotspots are driven by PRDM9 that targets recombination away from promoters. Paradoxically, PRDM9 induces the self-destruction of its targets and this triggers an ultra-fast evolution of mammalian hotspots. PRDM9 is ancestral to all animals, suggesting a critical importance for the meiotic program, but has been lost in many lineages with surprisingly little effect on meiosis success. However, it is unclear whether the function of PRDM9 described in mammals is shared by other species. To investigate this, we analyzed the recombination landscape of several salmonids, the genome of which harbors one full-length PRDM9 and several truncated paralogs. We identified recombination initiation sites in <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i> by mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We found that DSBs clustered at hotspots positioned away from promoters, enriched for the H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and the location of which depended on the genotype of full-length <i>Prdm9</i>. We observed a high level of polymorphism in the zinc finger domain of full-length <i>Prdm9</i>, indicating diversification driven by positive selection. Moreover, population-scaled recombination maps in <i>O</i>. <i>mykiss</i>, <i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i> and <i>Salmo salar</i> revealed a rapid turnover of recombination hotspots caused by PRDM9 target motif erosion. Our results imply that PRDM9 function is conserved across vertebrates and that the peculiar evolutionary runaway caused by PRDM9 has been active for several hundred million years.

                <p>by Mallory M. Rice, Shersingh Joseph Tumber-Dávila, Marcella D. Baiz, Susan J. Cheng, Kathy Darragh, Cesar O. Estien, J. W. Hammond, Danielle D. Ignace, Lily Khadempour, Kaitlyn M. Gaynor, Kirby L. Mills, Justine A. Smith, Alex C. Moore</p>

The discipline of ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) has long grappled with issues of inclusivity and representation, particularly for individuals with systematically excluded and marginalized backgrounds or identities. For example, significant representation disparities still persist that disproportionately affect women and gender minorities; Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC); individuals with disabilities; and people who are LGBTQIA+. Recent calls for action have urged the EEB community to directly address issues of representation, inclusion, justice, and equity. One aspect of this endeavor is to examine the use of EEB’s discipline-specific language and terminology, which may have the potential to perpetuate unjust systems and isolate marginalized groups. Through a mixed-methods survey, we examined how members of the EEB community perceive discipline-specific terminology, including how they believe it can be harmful and which terms they identified as problematic. Of the 795 survey respondents, we found that almost half agreed that there are harmful terms in EEB and that many individuals from marginalized groups responded that they have been harmed by such terminology. Most of the terms identified as harmful relate to race, ethnicity, and immigration; sex and gender; geopolitical hierarchies; and historical violence. Our findings suggest there is an urgent need for EEB to confront and critically reassess its discipline-specific terminology. By identifying harmful terms and their impacts, our study represents a crucial first step toward dismantling deeply rooted exclusionary structures in EEB. We encourage individuals, communities, and institutions to use these findings to reevaluate language used in disciplinary research, teaching and mentoring, manuscripts, and professional societies. Rectifying current harms in EEB will help promote a more just and inclusive discipline.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1318/v3?src=rss">Types of refractive errors in a sample of Iraqi children with Intermittent exotropia [version 3; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background One of the most common strabismus types in children is intermittent exotropia, which predominantly occurs in children between the ages of 2 to 4 years. It may affect visual development and often coexists with refractive errors. Unlike esotropia, which usually links to hyperopia, intermittent exotropia might have a different relationship with refractive errors and thus lead to myopia. This study will investigate the prevalence and distribution of refractive errors in children with intermittent exotropia, challenging the traditionally held relationship between strabismus and hyperopia and its possible contribution to the development of myopia. Methods In this cross-sectional retrospective study from August 2021 to December 2023, 179 patients diagnosed with intermittent exotropia were recruited via an outpatient clinic of Najah Al-Quraishi, Baghdad, Iraq. The refractive errors were compared by autorefractometry and retinoscopy after cycloplegic dilation. Data analysis was constructed under the use of IBM SPSS V.26 for the determination of emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia prevalence. Results Among the 179 patients, emmetropia was the most commonly observed refractive status, present in 68 patients (38%). Low hyperopia and low myopia were also common, with 64 and 40, respectively. A limited number of patients had moderate/high myopia and moderate/high hyperopia; in detail, the prevalence was following: 5% of patients had moderate myopia, while 0.5% of patients suffered from high myopia; symmetrically, 5% were moderate to high hyperopia. From the data collected, a trend emerged for a low refractive error and symmetric refractive error in both eyes. Conclusion Contrasted to prior conventional wisdom about refractive error in strabismus, it established the greater prevalence of emmetropia in patients with intermittent exotropia. The findings call for specific management strategies to be applied in this population.

                The study reported in this paper investigates the impact of the interaction between brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments and its impact on the development of informational concepts among cybersecurity students. The authors collected quantitative data by means of Information Concept Test to determine the levels of information concepts according to the Frayer model (1969). The research sample consists of 80 male and female undergraduate students in Qassim University. The authors classified the participants into four quasi-experimental groups according to their preferred patterns in the infographic. Quantitative analysis of findings from this study shows an effect for the interaction between the variables of brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments in the test scores of information concepts in the post-administration, where the significance level (.011) is less than the significance level (0.05). Findings also revealed that the repetition of information at increasing intervals of time using the infographics is effective to learning concepts in an organized manner and to improving short memory. Furthermore, the mental model’s strategy also helped to retain information. The study recommends encouraging the use of brain-based learning strategies and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments to explore the relationships between different scientific concepts, to expand students’ knowledge, and to discover inter-relationships between different subject elements. The study provides a platform for further research to employ different brain-based learning strategies within e-learning environments to acquire higher-order thinking skills and improve students’ memory and mental capacity with the use of modern technological techniques that achieve learning quality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1447/v2?src=rss">Strategic priorities and challenges in research software funding: Results from an international survey [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research software is increasingly recognized as critical infrastructure in contemporary science. It spans a broad spectrum, including source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows, and executables, all created for or during research. While research funders have developed programs, initiatives, and policies to bolster research software’s role, there has been no empirical study of how these funders prioritize support for research software. Understanding their priorities is essential to clarify where current support is concentrated and to identify strategic gaps. Methods We conducted an online mixed methods survey of international research funders (n=36) to explore their priorities in supporting research software. The survey gathered data on the specific outcomes funders emphasize in their programs and initiatives for research software. Results The survey revealed that funders place strong emphasis on developing skills, promoting software sustainability, embedding open science practices, building community and collaboration, advancing research software funding mechanisms, increasing software visibility and use, fostering innovation, and ensuring security. Conclusions The findings highlight opportunities to enhance research software’s role through increased funder attention on professional recognition for software contributions and the non-technical, social aspects of research software sustainability. Addressing these areas could lead to more effective support and development of research software, ultimately benefitting the entire research ecosystem.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with muscle pathology characterized by endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). We aimed to determine whether loss of TDP-43 splicing repression led to the production of “cryptic peptides” that could be detected in muscle biopsies as a useful biomarker for IBM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used an antisera against a neoepitope encoded by a TDP-43-dependent cryptic exon within hepatoma-derived growth factor-like protein 2 (<i>HDGFL2</i>) for immunohistochemical analysis on muscle biopsy samples of 122 patients with IBM, 181 disease controls, and 16 healthy controls without abnormal muscle pathology. In situ hybridization was also utilized to detect the localization of cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> transcripts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> peptides localized within myonuclei from muscle biopsies in 79 of 122 patients with IBM (65%), and this staining correlated with TDP-43 depletion. In contrast, cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> immunoreactivity was absent in 197 muscle biopsies from a variety of disease controls, except for 2 patients with vacuolar myopathies. Notably, we show that cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> transcripts are accompanied by the detection of cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> in muscle fibers of IBM without rimmed vacuoles and TDP-43 aggregates.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Together, our findings establish that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression occurs in myonuclei of IBM skeletal muscle and suggest that detection of cryptic peptides in muscle biopsies may be a useful biomarker. We suggest that a therapeutic strategy designed to restore TDP-43 function should be considered to attenuate the degeneration of skeletal muscle in this devastating disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97179">GnRH pulse generator activity in mouse models of polycystic ovary syndrome</a></h4>

              
                One in ten women in their reproductive age suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that, alongside subfertility and hyperandrogenism, typically presents with increased luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility. As such, it is suspected that the arcuate kisspeptin (ARN<sup>KISS</sup>) neurons that represent the GnRH pulse generator are dysfunctional in PCOS. We used here in vivo GCaMP fiber photometry and other approaches to examine the behavior of the GnRH pulse generator in two mouse models of PCOS. We began with the peripubertal androgen (PPA) mouse model of PCOS but found that it had a reduction in the frequency of ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron synchronization events (SEs) that drive LH pulses. Examining the prenatal androgen (PNA) model of PCOS, we observed highly variable patterns of pulse generator activity with no significant differences detected in ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron SEs, pulsatile LH secretion, or serum testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone concentrations. However, a machine learning approach identified that the ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons of acyclic PNA mice continued to exhibit cyclical patterns of activity similar to that of normal mice. The frequency of ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron SEs was significantly increased in algorithm-identified ‘diestrous stage’ PNA mice compared to controls. In addition, ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons exhibited reduced feedback suppression to progesterone in PNA mice and their gonadotrophs were also less sensitive to GnRH. These observations demonstrate the importance of understanding GnRH pulse generator activity in mouse models of PCOS. The existence of cyclical GnRH pulse generator activity in the acyclic PNA mouse indicates the presence of a complex phenotype with deficits at multiple levels of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96317">Aminoglycoside tolerance in Vibrio cholerae engages translational reprogramming associated with queuosine tRNA modification</a></h4>

              
                Tgt is the enzyme modifying the guanine (G) in tRNAs with GUN anticodon to queuosine (Q). <i>tgt</i> is required for optimal growth of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> in the presence of sub-lethal aminoglycoside concentrations. We further explored here the role of the Q34 in the efficiency of codon decoding upon tobramycin exposure. We characterized its impact on the overall bacterial proteome, and elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Q34 modification in antibiotic translational stress response. Using molecular reporters, we showed that Q34 impacts the efficiency of decoding at tyrosine TAT and TAC codons. Proteomics analyses revealed that the anti-SoxR factor RsxA is better translated in the absence of <i>tgt</i>. RsxA displays a codon bias toward tyrosine TAT and overabundance of RsxA leads to decreased expression of genes belonging to SoxR oxidative stress regulon. We also identified conditions that regulate <i>tgt</i> expression. We propose that regulation of Q34 modification in response to environmental cues leads to translational reprogramming of transcripts bearing a biased tyrosine codon usage. In silico analysis further identified candidate genes which could be subject to such translational regulation, among which DNA repair factors. Such transcripts, fitting the definition of modification tunable transcripts, are central in the bacterial response to antibiotics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91204">Plural molecular and cellular mechanisms of pore domain KCNQ2 encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                <i>KCNQ2</i> variants in children with neurodevelopmental impairment are difficult to assess due to their heterogeneity and unclear pathogenic mechanisms. We describe a child with neonatal-onset epilepsy, developmental impairment of intermediate severity, and <i>KCNQ2</i> G256W heterozygosity. Analyzing prior KCNQ2 channel cryoelectron microscopy models revealed G256 as a node of an arch-shaped non-covalent bond network linking S5, the pore turret, and the ion path. Co-expression with G256W dominantly suppressed conduction by wild-type subunits in heterologous cells. Ezogabine partly reversed this suppression. <i>Kcnq2</i><sup>G256W/+</sup> mice have epilepsy leading to premature deaths. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from G256W/+ brain slices showed hyperexcitability. G256W/+ pyramidal cell KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 immunolabeling was significantly shifted from axon initial segments to neuronal somata. Despite normal mRNA levels, G256W/+ mouse KCNQ2 protein levels were reduced by about 50%. Our findings indicate that G256W pathogenicity results from multiplicative effects, including reductions in intrinsic conduction, subcellular targeting, and protein stability. These studies provide evidence for an unexpected and novel role for the KCNQ2 pore turret and introduce a valid animal model of <i>KCNQ2</i> encephalopathy. Our results, spanning structure to behavior, may be broadly applicable because the majority of <i>KCNQ2</i> encephalopathy patients share variants near the selectivity filter.

">Does white matter structure relate to hemispheric language lateralisation? A systematic review</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between functional language lateralisation and diffusion MRI-based white matter metrics remains a subject of considerable interest and complexity. This systematic review aims to synthesise existing diffusion MRI studies examining white matter correlates of functional language dominance. Twenty-five studies were identified through searches of Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid MEDLINE (search period: inception to 16th March 2023) involving adults with epilepsy, tumours, or healthy controls. The results suggest that while the arcuate fasciculus, particularly its fractional anisotropy (FA), is commonly associated with language lateralisation in clinical populations, the findings in healthy individuals are more variable, often influenced by factors such as handedness. Other white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum and uncinate fasciculus, showed less consistent associations with language dominance across studies. Interestingly, temporal lobe regions, especially those involved in semantic processing, exhibited stronger correlations with diffusion measures compared to areas associated with phonological tasks. Methodological inconsistencies, such as variability in sample selection, task design, and analytical techniques, were identified as significant challenges in comparing findings across studies. Future research should aim for larger, more diverse sample sizes, whole-brain approaches, and a wider range of fMRI tasks to better elucidate the role of white matter in language lateralisation. If regions of interest (ROI)-based studies are utilised, a more standardised approach to tract segmentation should be adopted to ensure consistency and improve comparability across studies.

">Attention in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review of Affected Domains and Brain-Gut Axis Interactions</a></h4>

              
                Background: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Recent research suggests that attention may be affected in individuals with IBS, potentially influencing symptom perception and emotional distress. Objective: This systematic review aims to investigate the relationship between attention and IBS, focusing on the affected domains of attention and the interactions within the brain-gut axis. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including MEDLINE/PubMed, PsychINFO, and Scopus, from January 1990 to December 2024. Studies were included if they assessed attention in adult IBS patients and employed valid measurement tools. A total of 24 studies were selected for analysis, encompassing various methodologies, including neuroimaging and behavioral assessments. Results: The findings indicate that IBS patients exhibit significant attentional biases, particularly towards gastrointestinal-related stimuli, reflecting heightened sensitivity and hypervigilance. Specific domains of attention, including selective attention, sustained attention, and pre-attentional processing, were identified as being affected. The review highlights the role of psychological factors, such as anxiety and depression, in modulating attention in IBS. Neuroimaging studies revealed altered brain activation patterns in regions associated with attention and emotional processing, suggesting a complex interplay between cognitive function and the brain-gut axis. Conclusion: This systematic review underscores the multifaceted nature of attention in IBS, revealing specific attentional deficits and biases that may contribute to symptom exacerbation and emotional distress. The findings emphasize the need for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing attention in IBS patients.

">The superior colliculus gates dopamine responses to conditioned stimuli in visual classical conditioning</a></h4>

              
                In classical Pavlovian conditioning, it is well-established that midbrain dopamine neurons respond to conditioned stimuli (CS) that predict a reward. However, how the dopamine neurons associate a neutral CS to a reward remains unknown. Here, we show that the superior colliculus (SC) develops neuronal responses to a visual CS during conditioning, which in turn drive the responses of dopamine neurons. Visual responses in the SC were only potentiated when a behaviorally meaningful time interval separated the visual stimulus and reward. Potentiation also required the convergence of visual, dopamine and serotonin inputs to the SC. Importantly, blocking potentiation of the visual response was sufficient to suppress the dopamine responses following a CS. These results reveal a mechanism for how the brain forms associations between unconditioned stimuli and behaviorally meaningful visual information during classical conditioning.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The evolution of digital technology enhances the broadening of a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s intellectual growth. Research points out that implementing innovative applications of the digital world improves human social, cognitive, and metacognitive behavior. Artificial intelligence chatbots are yet another innovative human-made construct. These are forms of software that simulate human conversation, understand and process user input, and provide personalized responses. Executive function includes a set of higher mental processes necessary for formulating, planning, and achieving a goal. The present study aims to investigate executive function reinforcement through artificial intelligence chatbots, outlining potentials, limitations, and future research suggestions. Specifically, the study examined three research questions: the use of conversational chatbots in executive functioning training, their impact on executive-cognitive skills, and the duration of any improvements. Methods: The assessment of the existing literature was implemented using the systematic review method, according to the PRISMA 2020 Principles. The avalanche search method was employed to conduct a source search in the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and complementary Google Scholar. This systematic review included studies from 2021 to the present using experimental, observational, or mixed methods. It included studies using AI-based chatbots or conversationalists to support executive functions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, memory, attention, cognitive load, and behavioral changes. In addition, this study included general populations with specific neurological conditions, all peer-reviewed, written in English, and with full-text access. However, the study excluded studies before 2021, the literature reviews, systematic reviews, non-AI-based chatbots or conversationalists, studies not targeting the range of executive skills and abilities, studies not written in English, and studies without open access. The criteria aligned with the study objectives, ensuring a focus on AI chatbots and the impact of conversational agents on executive function. The initial collection totaled n = 115 articles; however, the eligibility requirements led to the final selection of n = 10 studies. Results: The findings of the studies suggested positive effects of using AI chatbots to enhance and improve executive skills. Although, several limitations were identified, making it still difficult to generalize and reproduce their effects. Conclusions: AI chatbots are an innovative artificial intelligence tool that can function as a digital assistant for learning and expanding executive skills, contributing to the cognitive, metacognitive, and social development of the individual. However, its use in executive skills training is at a primary stage. The findings highlighted the need for a unified framework for reference and future studies, better study designs, diverse populations, larger sample sizes of participants, and longitudinal studies that observe the long-term effects of their use.</p>

	<p>Background: In neuroscience research about functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), accurate inter-subject image registration is the basis for effective statistical analysis. Traditional fMRI registration methods are usually based on high-resolution structural MRI with clear anatomical structure features. However, this registration method based on structural information cannot achieve accurate functional consistency between subjects since the functional regions do not necessarily correspond to anatomical structures. In recent years, fMRI registration methods based on functional information have emerged, which usually ignore the importance of structural MRI information. Methods: In this study, we proposed a non-rigid cycle consistent bidirectional network with Transformer for unsupervised deformable functional MRI registration. The work achieves fMRI registration through structural MRI registration, and functional information is introduced to improve registration performance. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional registration network that implements forward and reverse registration between image pairs and apply Transformer in the registration network to establish remote spatial mapping between image voxels. Functional and structural information are integrated by introducing the local functional connectivity pattern, the local functional connectivity features of the whole brain are extracted as functional information. The proposed registration method was experimented on real fMRI datasets, and qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the quality of the registration method were implemented on the test dataset using relevant evaluation metrics. We implemented group ICA analysis in brain functional networks after registration. Functional consistency was evaluated on the resulting t-maps. Results: Compared with non-learning-based methods (Affine, Syn) and learning-based methods (Transmorph-tiny, Cyclemorph, VoxelMorph x2), our method improves the peak t-value of t-maps on DMN, VN, CEN, and SMN to 18.7, 16.5, 16.6, and 17.3 and the mean number of suprathreshold voxels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, t &amp;amp;gt; 5.01) on the four networks to 2596.25, and there is an average improvement in peak t-value of 23.79%, 12.74%, 12.27%, 7.32%, and 5.43%. Conclusions: The experimental results show that the registration method of this study improves the structural and functional consistency between fMRI with superior registration performance.</p>

	<p>BACKGROUND: Maximal safe resection is the objective of most neuro-oncological operations. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) may guide the surgeon to improve the extent of safe resection. There is limited evidence comparing the impact of iMRI on the rates of further resection between tumour types. AIM: To investigate the impact of iMRI on the rate of further resection following visualisation of residual tumour. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study identified all intracranial tumour operations performed in the 1.5 T iMRI machine of a single centre (2007&amp;amp;ndash;2023). Patients were identified using SurgiNet and were grouped according to their histopathological diagnosis in accordance with the WHO 2021 classification. The primary outcome was the rate of reoperation due to iMRI visualisation of residual tumours. RESULTS: A total of 574 cases were identified, including 152 low-grade gliomas (LGG), 108 high-grade gliomas (HGG), 194 pituitary neuroendocrine tumours (PitNETs), 15 metastases, and 6 meningiomas. Further resection following iMRI visualisation occurred in 45% of LGG cases, 47% of HGG cases, 29% of PitNET cases, and no meningioma or metastasis cases. Chi-square analysis showed that the rate of further resection after iMRI use across 2018&amp;amp;ndash;2023 was significantly higher than that across 2007&amp;amp;ndash;2012 (46% versus 33%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative MRI for guiding further resection was most useful in cases of LGG and HGG, possibly reflecting the difficulty of differentiating these tumour types from normal brain tissue. In addition, there was increased reliance on iMRI over time, which may represent our surgeons becoming accustomed to its use.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the depletion of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies highlight the gut-liver-brain (GLB) axis and its role in PD pathogenesis. The GLB axis forms a dynamic network facilitating bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and central nervous system. Dysregulation within this axis, encompassing gut dysbiosis and microbial metabolites, is emerging as a critical factor influencing PD progression. Our understanding of PD was traditionally centered on neurodegenerative processes within the brain. However, examining PD through the lens of the GLB axis provides new insights. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), kynurenine, serotonin, bile acids, indoles, and dopamine, which are integral to PD pathogenesis by modulation of the GLB axis. Our extensive research included a comprehensive literature review and database searches utilizing resources such as gutMGene and gutMDisorder. These databases have been instrumental in identifying specific microbes and their metabolites, shedding light on the intricate relationship between the GLB axis and PD. This review consolidates existing knowledge and underscores the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions based on the GLB axis and its components, which offer new avenues for future PD research and treatment strategies. While the GLB axis is not a novel concept, this review is the first to focus specifically on its role in PD, highlighting the importance of integrating the liver and microbial metabolites as central players in the PD puzzle.</p>

                Neuronal hyperexcitability in the cortex and hippocampus represents an early event in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a recent study, Blankenship and colleagues reported that in a mouse of AD, ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons are also hyperexcitable, and this hyperexcitability is due to casein kinase 2 (CK2)-dependent SK channel dysfunction, adding new insights into the underlying mechanisms of aberrant neuronal properties in AD.

                Erasure of the starting cell fate is a key process underlying direct neuronal conversion. Cates et al. reveal that microRNAs 9/9∗ and 124 induce a neuronal fate across multiple somatic cell types, identifying common gene networks repressed by these microRNAs that define non-neuronal identity.

	<p>Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent, chronic, and severe neuropsychiatric disorder that leads to illness-related disability. Despite the availability of several treatments, many OCD patients respond inadequately, because the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear, necessitating the establishment of many animal models, particularly mouse models, to elucidate disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies better. Although the development of animal models is ongoing, there remain many comprehensive summaries and updates in recent research, hampering efforts to develop novel treatments and enhance existing interventions. This review summarizes the phenotypes of several commonly used models and mechanistic insights from transgenic models of OCD, such as knockout mouse models. In addition, we present the advantages and limitations of these models and discuss their future in helping further understand the pathophysiology and advanced treatment. Here, we highlight current frontline treatment approaches for OCD, including neuromodulation and surgical interventions, and propose potential future directions. By studying gene mutations and observing phenotypes from available OCD animal models, researchers have classified the molecular signatures of each model reminiscent of changes in brain areas and neural pathways, with the hope of guiding the future selection of the most appropriate models for specific research in the OCD field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: There is growing interest in neuroscience-informed education, as well as neuroscience-derived strategies that maximise learning. Studies on neuroscience literacy and neuromyths, i.e., understandings or misconceptions about the brain, have primarily focused on their prevalence in educators, and few studies have examined their impact on students&amp;amp;rsquo; study habits or academic performance. Methods: To address this gap, we surveyed 576 university students in different academic programmes to investigate the relationship between neuromyths and academic outcomes in university students. In this quantitative, cross-sectional study design, we used a validated neuroscience knowledge survey and the Revised Two-factor Study Process (R-SPQ-2F) Questionnaire. We also inquired about students&amp;amp;rsquo; interest in, exposure to, and awareness of neuroscience, as well as their academic grades. Results: Students showed significant awareness of and interest in neuroscience; this was highest among students in health science programmes and lowest among students in computer and engineering programmes. The most common sources of general neuroscience knowledge were internet articles. Higher neuroscience literacy was associated with higher interest in neuroscience and having taken more neuroscience courses. Neuromyth scores were also better among those with higher neuroscience literacy scores. Higher neuroscience literacy scores were significantly associated with higher grades, higher surface strategy scores, and lower surface motive study habits. Conclusions: Our study sheds light on the variations in foundational neuroscience literacy among students in different academic programmes. It also provides insight into how this foundation affects academic performance and study habits. This insight may help guide educational policymakers to adopt neuroscience-based strategies that may be beneficial for learning.</p>

                <p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) are known to contribute to both protective and pronociceptive processes. However, their contribution to neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) needs further investigation. In a recent study utilizing TrkB<sup>F616A</sup> mice, it was shown that systemic pharmacogenetic inhibition of TrkB signaling with 1NM-PP1 (1NMP) immediately after SCI delayed the onset of pain hypersensitivity, implicating maladaptive TrkB signaling in pain after SCI. To examine potential neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral outcome, patch-clamp recording was performed in small-diameter dissociated thoracic (T) dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons to evaluate TrkB signaling in uninjured mice and after T10 contusion SCI. Bath-applied 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a selective TrkB agonist, induced a robust inward current in neurons from uninjured mice, which was attenuated by 1NMP treatment. SCI also decreased 7,8-DHF-induced current while increasing the latency to its peak amplitude. Western blot revealed a concomitant decrease in TrkB expression in DRGs adjacent to the spinal lesion. Analyses of cellular and membrane properties showed that SCI increased neuronal excitability, evident by an increase in resting membrane potential and the number of spiking neurons. However, SCI did not increase spontaneous firing in DRG neurons. These results suggest that SCI induced changes in TrkB activation in DRG neurons even though these alterations are likely not contributing to pain hypersensitivity by nociceptor hyperexcitability. Overall, this reveals complex interactions involving TrkB signaling and provides an opportunity to investigate other, presumably peripheral, mechanisms by which TrkB contributes to pain hypersensitivity after SCI.</p>

                <p>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a well-known antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke by inhibiting pyroptosis, a programmed cell death associated with inflammation. This study investigates the impact of HCQ on ischemic stroke pathology using both in vivo and in vitro models. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were treated with HCQ. Neurological deficits, infarct volume, and the expression of pyroptosis markers were evaluated. The results demonstrated that HCQ significantly improved motor function and reduced infarct volume in the MCAO mouse model. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and oxygen&ndash;glucose deprivation (OGD) were treated with HCQ. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that HCQ effectively suppressed the expression of pyroptosis markers GSDMD and NLRP3 in both in vivo and in vitro models. These findings suggest that HCQ mitigates ischemic stroke damage by inhibiting pyroptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HCQ exerts its neuroprotective effects, offering a promising new avenue for developing safe, cost-effective, and widely applicable stroke treatments. The potential of HCQ to modulate neuroinflammatory pathways presents a significant advancement in ischemic stroke therapy, emphasizing the importance of targeting pyroptosis in stroke management and the broader implications for treating neuroinflammatory conditions.</p>

                This paper presents a study of congruence relations on autometrized algebras. We demonstrate that in a normal autometrized algebra, which satisfies certain conditions, the set of all congruence relations forms a complete sublattice within the set of all equivalence relations. Furthermore, we investigate the property that a congruence-permutable autometrized algebra is also congruence-modular. We also explore several fundamental properties related to congruence relations. Additionally, we introduce the kernel of a homomorphism and establish that it is a congruence relation. Lastly, we examine the homomorphism, isomorphism, and correspondence theorems of autometrized algebra using the concept of congruence.

                Background Termites are a major insect pest affecting agricultural production and woody materials. They cause severe devastation in the ecosystem, and lead to bare soil. This phenomenon causes the soil to become difficult to plow, which in turn leads to a reduction in the productivity of crops. It can cause 100 % yield losses based on crop types, level of the damage, and size of its populations. To manage this pest, different management options have been evaluated in Ethiopia. While insecticide usage is the dominant option, less attention has been given to Entomopathogenic Nematode (EPN) based management options. Therefore, this research was initiated to screen locally collected EPN isolates and evaluate promising isolates under field conditions on maize crop. Methods 37 EPN isolates were screened under laboratory condition, while two isolates were evaluated at field condition. The screening of EPN isolates was laid out in a completely randomized design, and the field evaluation used a completely randomized block design, and treatments were replicated thrice. Mortality of insect, damaged root, stem, cob, damage severity, foraging termites, and yield of the crop data were collected. Results The study indicated that all screened EPN isolates caused mortality on termites under laboratory conditions. The isolates achieved complete mortality of the insect pest within 12 days of exposure. The finding indicated that AEH and S#50 were the more pathogenic and virulent isolates on termites under laboratory conditions and taken to field study. The S#50 isolate was most pathogenic and reduced the infestation and severity of the insect pest on the maize crop under field conditions. Conclusions This result showed that the entomopathogenic nematode isolates have the potential to manage subterranean termites in the maize field. Future studies should be based on collection of local isolates and develop a full package for the virulent isolates.

                Background The "birthday effect" refers to increased mortality around birthdays, although evidence remains mixed, with some studies even indicating reduced mortality. While the effect has a minimal impact on overall mortality, lacks prevention potential, and faces methodological challenges, it offers seminal insights into psychogenic health effects. Methods Major causes of death were analyzed using data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (1987-2022), excluding leap years and cases with imputed dates. The relationship between day of birth and death was assessed using a Poisson count model with overdispersion, and mortality rates (MRs) per 100,000 deaths per year were calculated for ±182 days around birthdays. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) compared these periods to a reference period. Cluster analyses explored mortality rate patterns across age and diagnostic groups. Age was not adjusted for in the Poisson model to avoid zero inflation, with bias from age-related mortality changes assessed separately through sensitivity analyses. Results In the analysis of 1,702,865 deaths over 27 years, an eight percent increase in birthday mortality was observed, equivalent to 22 additional deaths per 100,000 deaths per year. There were 889 excess deaths in the 28 days after the birthday compared to 206 in the 28 days before. Excess birthday mortality was particularly pronounced in men, unmarried individuals, and those with religious affiliations. In individuals aged 85 and older, a pre-birthday dip followed by post-birthday mortality excess was noted. Cardiovascular causes, suicides, and accidents had the highest birthday-related mortality, while diabetes, respiratory diseases, and other conditions showed varied pre- and post-birthday patterns. Conclusions Administrative and age-related biases were ruled out, suggesting the birthday effect is psychogenic. While behavior-linked causes like suicides and accidents had clear birthday patterns, other main causes of death also showed birthday-period effects. Further research, including psychometric and biomarker studies, is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

                <p>by Magnus Pirovino, Christian Iseli, Joseph A. Curran, Bernard Conrad</p>

Catalysis and specifically autocatalysis are the quintessential building blocks of life. Yet, although autocatalytic networks are necessary, they are not sufficient for the emergence of life-like properties, such as replication and adaptation. The ultimate and potentially fatal threat faced by molecular replicators is parasitism; if the polymerase error rate exceeds a critical threshold, even the fittest molecular species will disappear. Here we have developed an autocatalytic RNA early life mathematical network model based on enzyme kinetics, specifically the steady-state approximation. We confirm previous models showing that these second-order autocatalytic cycles are sustainable, provided there is a sufficient nucleotide pool. However, molecular parasites become untenable unless they sequentially degenerate to hyperparasites (i.e. parasites of parasites). Parasite resistance–a parasite-specific host response decreasing parasite fitness–is acquired gradually, and eventually involves an increased binding affinity of hyperparasites for parasites. Our model is supported at three levels; firstly, ribozyme polymerases display Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics and comply with the steady-state approximation. Secondly, ribozyme polymerases are capable of sustainable auto-amplification and of surmounting the fatal error threshold. Thirdly, with growing sequence divergence of host and parasite catalysts, the probability of self-binding is expected to increase and the trend towards cross-reactivity to diminish. Our model predicts that primordial host-RNA populations evolved via an arms race towards a host-parasite-hyperparasite catalyst trio that conferred parasite resistance within an RNA replicator niche. While molecular parasites have traditionally been viewed as a nuisance, our model argues for their integration into the host habitat rather than their separation. It adds another mechanism–with biochemical precision–by which parasitism can be tamed and offers an attractive explanation for the universal coexistence of catalyst trios within prokaryotes and the virosphere, heralding the birth of a primitive molecular immunity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Monoallelic variants in the transient receptor potential melastatin-related type 3 gene (<i>TRPM3</i>) have been associated with neurodevelopmental manifestations, but knowledge on the clinical manifestations and treatment options is limited. We characterized the clinical spectrum, highlighting particularly the epilepsy phenotype, and the effect of treatments.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed retrospectively the phenotypes and genotypes of 43 individuals with <i>TRPM3</i> variants, acquired from GeneMatcher and collaborations (n = 21), and through a systematic literature search (n = 22). We included all patients with a pathogenic <i>TRPM3</i> variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median age at the time of the study was 10 years, with a preponderance of girls (60%) versus boys (40%). Frequent findings were developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (93%), global or axial hypotonia (77%), ocular involvement (70%), musculoskeletal anomalies (65%), and dysmorphic features (58%). Epilepsy was diagnosed in 31 patients (72%), classified in all as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with or without spike wave activation in sleep (DEE/DEE-SWAS). Patients with the variant p.Val1002Met (n = 24) significantly more often had developmental delay and epilepsy. The most effective anti-seizure medication was primidone. All treated patients showed an improvement in seizure frequency, motor and speech development, and/or learning capability with this drug.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Developmental delay/intellectual disability and epilepsy are dominant phenotypic features in patients with <i>TRPM3</i> variants.

                Background Sonneratia caseolaris, has been widely utilized by the Indonesian. S. caseolaris leaves contain various active compounds, contributing to their popularity in the treatment of various diseases. Mangrove leaves are also known to exhibit very high antioxidant activity. This study aims to assess the antioxidant activity of S . caseolaris leaves extracted using different solvents. The resulting extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) techniques. Methods Analysis of total flavonoids, total phenols, identification of active compounds with Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and bioinformatics were also carried out to obtain temporary conclusions about the antioxidant activity of S. caseolaris leaf extract. Results The results indicated that S. caseolaris leaves extracted with methanol and distilled water exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The analysis of total flavonoids and total phenols yielded results consistent with the antioxidant activity tests. LC-HRMS results identified three compounds in all S. caseolaris leaf extracts with antioxidant activity, namely TEMPO, Choline, and Betaine. TEMPO demonstrated a higher antioxidant activity than Choline and Betaine, as indicated by the binding affinity values in the bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions It is evident that S. caseolaris leaf extracts has the potential to serve as an effective antioxidant agent. Further research is needed to confirm how the potential compounds in S. caseolaris leaf water extracts interact with the target protein Keap1. This research aims to utilize S. caseolaris as active components in food products, thereby enhancing antioxidant consumption among consumers.

                Background Neurodegeneration due to neurotoxicity is one of the phenomena in temporal lobe epilepsy. Experimentally, hippocampal excitotoxicity process can occur due to kainic acid exposure, especially in the CA3 area. Neuronal death, astrocyte reactivity and increased calcium also occur in hippocampal excitotoxicity, but few studies have investigated immediate effect after kainic acid exposure. The organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC) is a useful model for studying the neurodegeneration process, but there are still many protocol differences. In this study, minor modifications were made in the OHSC protocol. Methods OHSC was obtained from three healthy wild type Wistar rats aged P10. Healthy culture slices were obtained and lasted up to 10 days in vitro (DIV 10). Bath application of kainic acid for 48 hours in DIV 10 followed by observation of its initial effects on neurons, astrocytes, and calcium via the expression of MAP2, GFAP, and intracellular calcium imaging, subsequently. Results After 48 h of kainic acid administration, there was a significant increase in intracellular calcium intensity (p = 0.006 < α), accompanied by a significant decrease in MAP2 (p = 0.003 < α) and GFAP (p = 0.010 < α) expression. Conclusion These findings suggest early neuronal and astrocyte damage at the initial onset of hippocampal injury. This implies that astrocyte damage occurs early before an increase in GFAP that characterizes reactive astrogliosis found in other studies. Damage to neurons and astrocytes may be associated with increased intracellular calcium. It is necessary to develop further research regarding regulation of calcium, MAP2, and GFAP at a spatial time after exposure to kainic acid and strategies to reduce damage caused by excitotoxicity.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the healthcare ecosystem, but further research is needed to understand how it can enhance healthcare capabilities. This study analyzes the literature on AI and healthcare capability using the PRISMA approach, applying specific search keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The findings indicate that AI benefits the healthcare ecosystem, significantly influences health outcomes, and transforms medical practices. However, there is limited literature and a lack of understanding regarding how AI enhances healthcare capabilities. Most studies date from 2019, suggesting that COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of AI systems in healthcare. This research contributes theoretically by developing a framework that clarifies AI’s role in enhancing healthcare capabilities, serving as a foundational model for future studies. It identifies critical gaps in the literature, especially in the Global South, and encourages exploration in under-researched areas where healthcare professionals can benefit from AI. Additionally, it bridges the gap between AI and healthcare, enriching interdisciplinary dialogue relevant to emerging economies facing financial constraints. Practically, the study provides actionable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers in the Global South on leveraging AI to improve service delivery. It sets the stage for empirical research, promoting the testing and refinement of the proposed framework in resource-limited contexts, while raising awareness among healthcare staff, managers, and technology developers about AI’s role in healthcare.

                Background The work experience of seafarers differs significantly from other land-based occupations due to several factors, particularly remoteness and the restricted work environment. This study seeks to examine the impact of burnout and health impairment in the maritime industry, using the Job Demand-Resources theory as a framework. Methods To investigate these phenomena, an online questionnaire was sent to 239 Italian seafarers (94.6% men, Mage = 39.44, SD = 12.8). We tested a mediated Structural Equation Model (SEM) aimed at predicting negative health outcomes. Results The results show that burnout plays a mediating role between job demands (such as workload and cognitive strain) and resources (such as social support and transformational leadership), influencing variables related to health impairment (such as sleep quality and physical well-being). Furthermore, the findings highlight the direct influence of occupational resources on seafarers’ health. Conclusions The discussion highlights the urgent need for more research in the field of organisational psychology in the maritime industry and the discrepancies between these findings, which are consistent with the existing maritime literature, and other studies that do not include seafarers in their sample groups.

                Background and aim This quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a mixture of 0.5% deltamethrin, 0.75% S-bio-allethrin, and 10% piperonyl butoxide (DAP) in eliminating Aedes mosquitoes in 10 areas of a high-risk district for dengue fever. Methods Susceptibility tests for Aedes against deltamethrin (1:1.000) Aedes) were conducted between October 2022 and December 2022. Data analysis using descriptive statistics was presented with frequency percentage, average, standard deviation, median, at 25 and 75 percentiles, and inferential statistics to compare mean differences within and between groups using independent t-test statistics. Results The results showed that these isolates were susceptible to deltamethrin. The mortality difference rate between DAP indoors was significantly more effective than 0.5% deltamethrin at 0.05 (p-value=0.04). The mortality difference rate between the mortality rate of DAP outdoors was statistically significantly greater than 0.5% deltamethrin at a level of 0.05 (p-value<0.001). The mortality difference means of Aedes caused by DAP indoors and outdoors were statistically different at 0.05 (p-value<0.001), and it was found that the effectiveness of 0.5% deltamethrin in eliminating indoors was greater than outdoors by 70.1 (95% CI = 63.78-76.41). Conclusion Combining DAP effectively eliminated Aedes mosquitoes in indoor and outdoor environments.

                Background Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases worldwide. One of the most common therapy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), has a high failure rate. The failure rate can be significantly reduced by identifying the candidates most likely to benefit from ESWL, for example, by using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Decision tree analysis (DTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) represent a few of the machine learning approaches employed to forecast the stone-free outcome following ESWL. Methods 219 studies were searched through six electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, Proquest, SCOPUS). We employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and adhered to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD). To evaluate the potential bias in all the studies, we utilized the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Results 41,484 patients from 11 studies were included. The ML models highlight varying levels of diagnostic precision, with sensitivity spanning from 35-96%, and specificity ranging from 63-98.4%, and area under the curve falling between 0.49-0.96. It is shown in this study that the accuracy of RF and DTA in predicting stone-free status is superior than ANN. Conclusion ML is a comparable predictive method to statistical analysis in predicting stone-free status. Random forest method and DTA are superior MLs compared to ANN. Stone size, density, and 3D texture analysis are the most important variables to be considered in the ML models and should be included in the models to ensure accuracy of stone-free status prediction.

                Background Stunting still represents a major public health problem in Egypt, impacting around one-third of children under five and leading to a 2-3% drop in Gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, this study examined the trends in the prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among children aged 0-23 months, 24-59 months and 0-59 months in Egypt. Methods The study used combined data from the 2005, 2008, and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS), with a total sample of 39,857 children aged 0-59 months. A multilevel logistic regression that adjusts for sampling weights and clustering was performed to analyse the factors associated with stunting among children in Egypt. Results The prevalence of stunting was 24.8% in children aged 0-23 months, 24.3% in children aged 24-59 months, and 24.5 % in children aged 0-59 months. After controlling for potential confounders, the common factors associated with stunting in three age groups were mothers with primary education and mothers who did not have an antenatal care (ANC) visit during pregnancy. Maternal short stature (height < 155 cm) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in three age groups compared to mothers taller than 160 cm. Conclusion Addressing the causes of stunting in Egypt necessitates sectoral collaboration, including health, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, and social protection, with the implementation of targeted interventions focusing on children born to short mothers. Interventions must be accessible for families with low socioeconomic status, focusing on improved healthcare access, parent education, and infant and young child feeding practices. A systematic nutrition monitoring framework that enables routine data collection on nutritional outcomes to monitor and improve child health is recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88287">Why the brown ghost chirps at night</a></h4>

              
                Since the pioneering work by Moeller, Szabo, and Bullock, weakly electric fish have served as a valuable model for investigating spatial and social cognitive abilities in a vertebrate taxon usually less accessible than mammals or other terrestrial vertebrates. These fish, through their electric organ, generate low-intensity electric fields to navigate and interact with conspecifics, even in complete darkness. The brown ghost knifefish is appealing as a study subject due to a rich electric ‘vocabulary’, made by individually variable and sex-specific electric signals. These are mainly characterized by brief frequency modulations of the oscillating dipole moment continuously generated by their electric organ, and are known as chirps. Different types of chirps are believed to convey specific and behaviorally salient information, serving as behavioral readouts for different internal states during behavioral observations. Despite the success of this model in neuroethology over the past seven decades, the code to decipher their electric communication remains unknown. To this aim, in this study we re-evaluate the correlations between signals and behavior offering an alternative, and possibly complementary, explanation for why these freshwater bottom dwellers emit electric chirps. By uncovering correlations among chirping, electric field geometry, and detectability in enriched environments, we present evidence for a previously unexplored role of chirps as specialized self-directed signals, enhancing conspecific electrolocation during social encounters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91422">Diversity in Notch ligand-receptor signaling interactions</a></h4>

              
                The Notch signaling pathway uses families of ligands and receptors to transmit signals to nearby cells. These components are expressed in diverse combinations in different cell types, interact in a many-to-many fashion, both within the same cell (in cis) and between cells (in trans), and their interactions are modulated by Fringe glycosyltransferases. A fundamental question is how the strength of Notch signaling depends on which pathway components are expressed, at what levels, and in which cells. Here, we used a quantitative, bottom-up, cell-based approach to systematically characterize trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation signaling efficiencies across a range of ligand and Fringe expression levels in Chinese hamster and mouse cell lines. Each ligand (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) and receptor variant (Notch1 and Notch2) analyzed here exhibited a unique profile of interactions, Fringe dependence, and signaling outcomes. All four ligands were able to bind receptors in cis and in trans, and all ligands trans-activated both receptors, although Jag1-Notch1 signaling was substantially weaker than other ligand-receptor combinations. Cis-interactions were predominantly inhibitory, with the exception of the Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 pairs, which exhibited cis-activation stronger than trans-activation. Lfng strengthened Delta-mediated trans-activation and weakened Jagged-mediated trans-activation for both receptors. Finally, cis-ligands showed diverse cis-inhibition strengths, which depended on the identity of the trans-ligand as well as the receptor. The map of receptor-ligand-Fringe interaction outcomes revealed here should help guide rational perturbation and control of the Notch pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95267">Nicotine enhances the stemness and tumorigenicity in intestinal stem cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signal pathway</a></h4>

              
                Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.
