                arXiv:2511.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization across individuals remains a major challenge in electroencephalogram based imagined speech decoding due to substantial variability in neural activity patterns. This study examined how training dynamics and lightweight subject specific adaptation influence cross subject performance in a neural decoding framework. A cyclic inter subject training approach, involving shorter per subject training segments and frequent alternation among subjects, led to modest yet consistent improvements in decoding performance across unseen target data. Furthermore, under the subject calibrated leave one subject out scheme, incorporating only 10 % of the target subjects data for calibration achieved an accuracy of 0.781 and an AUC of 0.801, demonstrating the effectiveness of few shot adaptation. These findings suggest that integrating cyclic training with minimal calibration provides a simple and effective strategy for developing scalable, user adaptive brain computer interface systems that balance generalization and personalization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13899">A Disentangled Low-Rank RNN Framework for Uncovering Neural Connectivity and Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank recurrent neural networks (lrRNNs) are a class of models that uncover low-dimensional latent dynamics underlying neural population activity. Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.

                arXiv:2511.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human emotions are difficult to convey through words and are often abstracted in the process; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can offer a more direct lens into emotional brain activity. Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings. The source code is available at: https://github.com/nnilayy/RBTransformer.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14065">Intrinsic Resonance depends on Network Size of Coupled-Delayed Interacting Oscillators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective frequency that emerges from synchronized neuronal populations--the network resonance--shows a systematic relationship with brain size: whole-brain's large networks oscillate slowly, whereas finer parcellations of fixed volume exhibit faster rhythms. This resonance-size scaling has been reported in delayed neural mass models and human neuroimaging, yet the physical mechanism remained unresolved. Here we show that size-dependent resonance follows directly from propagation delays in delay-coupled phase oscillators. Starting from a Kuramoto model with heterogeneous delays, we linearize around the near-synchronous solution and obtain a closed-form approximation linking the resonance $\Omega$ to the mean delay and the effective coupling field. The analysis predicts a generic scaling law: $\Omega \approx (\sum_j c_{ij} \tau)^{-1}$, so resonance is delay-limited and therefore depends systematically on geometric size or parcellation density. We evaluate four growth scenarios--expanding geometry, fixed-volume parcellation, constant geometry, and an unphysical reference case--and show that only geometry-consistent scaling satisfies the analytical prediction. Numerical simulations with heterogeneous delays validate the law and quantify its error as a function of delay dispersion. These results identify a minimal physical mechanism for size-dependent cortical resonance and provide an analytical framework that unifies numeric simulation outputs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14188">A region-specific brain dysfunction underlies cognitive impairment in long COVID brain fog</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long COVID "brain fog" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14453">Multi-network Topology Underlying Individual Language Learning Success</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adult language learning varies greatly among individuals. Traditionally associated with frontotemporal language regions, this variability is increasingly seen as stemming from distributed brain networks. However, the role of these networks and their topological organization in explaining these differences remains unclear. We hypothesize that graph-theory-based network analysis of intrinsic multimodal connectivities across multiple networks explains overall and component-specific variations in language learning. We tested this in 101 healthy adults who underwent resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging before seven days of six artificial language training tasks. We identified one dominant general learning component shared across tasks and five task-specific ones. Cross-validated predictive models used multimodal multi-network graph-theoretic metrics to predict final learning outcomes (LO) and rates (LR). We significantly predicted the LO and LR of the general component, which were primarily contributed by dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Nodal local efficiency was the most consistent predictor, with additional contributions from node clustering coefficient and network centrality for LR, highlighting local robustness, mesoscale network segregation, and global influence in explaining individual differences. Only task-specific word learning LO was predictable, relying on default mode and frontoparietal hubs with high betweenness centrality and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that intrinsic network topologies underlie differences in language learning success, supporting a multiple-systems hypothesis in which attentional-control networks interact with default and subcortical systems to shape learning trajectories. This advances mechanistic understanding and paves the way for personalized language education.

                arXiv:2511.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the effects of dopamine neurotransmitter within the Cortico-Striatal-Thalamo-Cortical (CSTC) loop. Simulations confirmed dopamine facilitates movement via thalamic disinhibition. Analysis of its impact on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) revealed a complex, region-specific outcome: SNR increased in some regions (e.g., D2 Striatum: 3.41 dB to 6.25 dB), decreased in others (e.g., Thalamus VL: 6.24 dB to 3.93 dB), and remained stable elsewhere (e.g., M1: 3.16 dB to 3.13 dB). This heterogeneity stems from dopamine increasing the excitability of D1-receptor-expressing neurons, which amplifies channel conductance noise and reduces SNR in specific circuits. Thus, dopamine acts not as a uniform signal enhancer, but as a complex modulator that critically balances facilitation and noise within the CSTC loop.

                arXiv:2511.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is a flourishing non-invasive approach to brain modulation with wide-ranging applications in neuromedicine and cognitive neuroscience. However, progress in DecNef research remains constrained by subject-dependent learning variability, reliance on indirect measures to quantify progress, and the high cost and time demands of experimentation.
  We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning.
  We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation.
  In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13733">THD-BAR: Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling for EEG Generic Representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.13733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models hold significant potential for learning universal EEG representations. However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a "next-scale-time prediction" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Objective Accurate identification of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the early neonatal period is essential for initiating therapeutic hypothermia (TH) within 6 hours of birth to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes. We aimed to develop a simple decision-making tool for identifying term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) based on features of conventional electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded within 6 hours of birth. Methods EEG recordings from 100 full-term neonates with HIE were graded by pediatric neurologists for severity. Amplitude in slow frequency bands was analyzed, focusing on delta (0.5-4 Hz) spectral power. Temporal fluctuations of delta power characterized each HIE grade, with joint level and duration probability densities estimated for delta oscillation power. This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gouv (NCT05114070). Results These 2D EEG representations effectively distinguish mild HIE cases from those requiring hypothermia, achieving 98% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 99% positive predictive value, 94% negative predictive value, an F1 score of 99%, and a false alarm rate of only 6%. This system accurately discriminates mild from moderate or severe HIE, with only one mild case mistakenly identified as requiring hypothermia and one moderate case erroneously flagged for treatment. Conclusions Quantized probability densities of delta spectral features from early EEG (within 6 hours of birth) revealed significant differences between mild and moderate/severe HIE, enabling accurate discrimination of candidates for TH. Significance Simple, interpretable biomarkers from early EEG can provide an efficient visual clinical decision support tool to identify full-term neonates with HIE eligible for therapeutic hypothermia.

Abstract: This perspective explores various quantum models of consciousness from the viewpoint of quantum information science, offering potential ideas and insights. The models under consideration can be categorized into three distinct groups based on the level at which quantum mechanics might operate within the brain: those suggesting that consciousness arises from electron delocalization within microtubules inside neurons, those proposing it emerges from the electromagnetic field surrounding the entire neural network, and those positing it originates from the interactions between individual neurons governed by neurotransmitter molecules. Our focus is particularly on the Posner model of cognition, for which we provide preliminary calculations on the preservation of entanglement of phosphate molecules within the geometric structure of Posner clusters. These findings provide valuable insights into how quantum information theory can enhance our understanding of brain functions.

                arXiv:2511.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge detection with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has achieved remarkable prog\-ress but faces two major challenges. First, it requires pre-training on large-scale extra data and complex designs for prior knowledge, leading to high energy consumption. Second, the predicted edges perform poorly in crispness and heavily rely on post-processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as third generation neural networks, feature quantization and spike-driven computation mechanisms. They inherently provide a strong prior for edge detection in an energy-efficient manner, while its quantization mechanism helps suppress texture artifact interference around true edges, improving prediction crispness. However, the resulting quantization error inevitably introduces sparse edge discontinuities, compromising further enhancement of crispness. To address these challenges, we propose MS2Edge, the first SNN-based model for edge detection. At its core, we build a novel spiking backbone named MS2ResNet that integrates multi-scale residual learning to recover missing boundary lines and generate crisp edges, while combining I-LIF neurons with Membrane-based Deformed Shortcut (MDS) to mitigate quantization errors. The model is complemented by a Spiking Multi-Scale Upsample Block (SMSUB) for detail reconstruction during upsampling and a Membrane Average Decoding (MAD) method for effective integration of edge maps across multiple time steps. Experimental results demonstrate that MS2Edge outperforms ANN-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, PLDU, and PLDM datasets without pre-trained backbones, while maintaining ultralow energy consumption and generating crisp edge maps without post-processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14484">Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Reservoir Computing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reservoir computing, an input sequence is processed by a recurrent neural network, the reservoir, which transforms it into a spatial pattern that a shallow readout network can then exploit for tasks such as memorization and time-series prediction or classification. Echo state networks (ESN) are a model class in which the reservoir is a traditional artificial neural network. This class contains many model types, each with sets of hyperparameters. Selecting models and parameter settings for particular applications requires a theory for predicting and comparing performances. Here, we demonstrate that recent developments of perceptron theory can be used to predict the memory capacity and accuracy of a wide variety of ESN models, including reservoirs with linear neurons, sigmoid nonlinear neurons, different types of recurrent matrices, and different types of readout networks. Across thirty variants of ESNs, we show that empirical results consistently confirm the theory's predictions. As a practical demonstration, the theory is used to optimize memory capacity of an ESN in the entire joint parameter space. Further, guided by the theory, we propose a novel ESN model with a readout network that does not require training, and which outperforms earlier ESN models without training. Finally, we characterize the geometry of the readout networks in ESNs, which reveals that many ESN models exhibit a similar regular simplex geometry as has been observed in the output weights of deep neural networks.

                arXiv:2511.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\% and 78.08\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.

                arXiv:2511.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (150) using the Friedman test, significantly outperforming L-SHADE (229) and standard DE (305) in the dimension-variant trials. QUASAR also proves computationally efficient, with run times averaging $1.4 \text{x}$ faster than DE and $7.8 \text{x}$ faster than L-SHADE ($p \ll 0.001$) in the population-variant trials.
  Building upon Differential Evolution (DE), QUASAR introduces a highly stochastic architecture to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity.
  QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02906">Evolving Generalizable Parallel Algorithm Portfolios for Binary Optimization Problems via Domain-Agnostic Instance Generation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.02906v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization is the core objective when training optimizers from data. However, limited training instances often constrain the generalization capability of the trained optimizers. Co-evolutionary approaches address this challenge by simultaneously evolving a parallel algorithm portfolio (PAP) and an instance population to eventually obtain PAPs with good generalization. Yet, when applied to a specific problem class, these approaches have a major limitation. They require practitioners to provide instance generators specially tailored to the problem class, which is often non-trivial to design. This work proposes a general-purpose, off-the-shelf PAP construction approach, named domain-agnostic co-evolution of parameterized search (DACE), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. The key novelty of DACE lies in its neural network-based domain-agnostic instance representation and generation mechanism that eliminates the need for domain-specific instance generators. The strong generality of DACE is validated across three real-world binary optimization problems: the complementary influence maximization problem (CIMP), the compiler arguments optimization problem (CAOP), and the contamination control problem (CCP). Given only a small set of training instances from these problem classes, DACE, without requiring domain knowledge, constructs PAPs with even better generalization performance than existing approaches on all three classes, despite their use of domain-specific instance generators.

                arXiv:2511.13053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, "Pinnacle Sharpness," to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a "ridge of optimization," where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct "driving" force and an indirect "feedback" force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design.

                Background Endometrial malignancy in premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is rare but clinically challenging. Current diagnostic strategies rely on endometrial sampling, which is invasive and often unnecessary. This study aimed to develop and internally validate a novel risk prediction score for endometrial malignancy in premenopausal women with AUB. Methods A retrospective longitudinal analytical study was conducted over 8 years and 11 months (January 2016–November 2024) at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. Premenopausal women with AUB who underwent endometrial biopsy followed by hysterectomy were included. Comparative analyses, logistic regression, and ROC curve analysis were performed. Significant variables were weighted according to adjusted odds ratios to construct a risk prediction score. Results Among 209 patients, 13 (6.2%) had endometrial malignancy. Independent predictors of endometrial malignancy were: oral contraceptive use (OR 29.9, 95% CI 1.5–587.1, p = 0.025), endometrial thickness >9 mm (OR 25.3, 95% CI 4.3–147.6, p < 0.001), vascularization (OR 98.3, 95% CI 3.7–2594.8, p = 0.006). Protective factors included hemorrhage episode ≤1 (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08–0.52, p = 0.001) and lower bleeding abundance (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.65, p = 0.002). The final score allocated points as follows: endometrial thickness >9 mm (+3), oral contraceptive use (+3), vascularization (+4), hemorrhage episodes ≤1 (−2), and lower bleeding abundance (−1). A score ≥7 defined high risk. Model discrimination was excellent (AUC 0.901, 95% CI 0.825–0.976, p < 0.001). At a cutoff ≥7, sensitivity was 77%, specificity 90%, positive predictive value 34%, and negative predictive value 98%. Conclusions We developed and internally validated a novel risk prediction score for endometrial malignancy in premenopausal women with AUB. With strong diagnostic performance and high negative predictive value, this score may help clinicians better identify women who truly require invasive sampling.

                Road maintenance is essential for preserving the useful life of the roads. The evaluation methodology used in Ecuador is the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method. It is the most complete method based on the analysis of the functional and structural damages that the pavement presents, the same ones that depend on its class, severity, and quantity. The PCI methodology uses data based on experiments made in the United States, so when evaluating pavements in Ecuador using the said methodology, it is not a correct adaptation to our reality because of the differences in deterioration of climatic factors and construction aspects. The PCI methodology has a study of values deduced from each of the damages present on the road, which are very strict in their qualification because the pavement service index in the United States looks for roads with high-quality standards compared to the Ecuadorian reality, where economic factors such as restrictions on usual road maintenance. The research proposes to generate changes in the abacus that generate the deduced values of the PCI methodology and adapt them to our country. Resulting in a 20% variability in the Ecuadorian Pavement Serviceability Index (PSI), which was applied to the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method, commonly used for pavement evaluation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1279/v1?src=rss">Family and Community Dynamics of Substance Abuse Among Youths in Bushenyi District, Western Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Youth substance abuse is an escalating public health challenge in Uganda, undermining individual well-being, family stability, and community development. Understanding the influence of family and community dynamics is critical for designing effective prevention strategies. Aim This study investigated the relationship between family and community factors and substance abuse among youths in Bushenyi District, Western Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional study design was employed. Structured questionnaires were administered to 381 youths aged 18–30 years, collecting sociodemographic information and data on family and community influences (parental drug use, home rules, peer influence, and law enforcement). Descriptive statistics summarised the data, chi-square tests assessed associations, and logistic regression identified predictors at a 5% significance level. Results Early initiation of drug use was common, particularly in bars and among peer groups. Substance abuse was significantly associated with parental drug use (χ2 = 102.68, p < 0.001), living arrangements (χ2 = 21.46, p = 0.001), peer influence (χ2 = 13.40, p = 0.001), and weak law enforcement (χ2 = 12.95, p = 0.001). Regression analysis showed that strict home rules were protective (Exp(B) = 0.325, p < 0.001), while weak law enforcement increased the risk of substance abuse (Exp(B) = 0.357, p = 0.003). Conclusion Family and community dynamics, particularly parental behaviour, peer pressure, and ineffective institutional regulation, are central drivers of youth substance abuse. Strengthening parental involvement, enforcing household rules, and improving law enforcement and community-based interventions are important in reducing the burden of substance use. The study highlights the need for multisectoral action involving families, schools, religious institutions, and law enforcement, while providing evidence to inform prevention strategies and future research on contextual risk pathways.

                Background Rapid development and adoption of digital technologies across all research disciplines underlines the need for accessible and reusable computational data and code. Methods An anonymous, multidisciplinary survey covering open science, data publishing and reuse, as well as code publishing and reuse was conducted to gather insights into researchers’ practices, needs, and barriers. Results A total of 254 people initiated the survey, with 133 complete responses (mostly from Europe, equally distributed among scientific fields). Survey revealed that registered reports, replication studies and pre-registration are the least applied practices (52%, 38% and 42%), while open software and OA publishing demonstrated widespread adoption (83% and 69%) of the respondents, respectively. Data sharing is hindered mostly by lack of time (60%) and sufficient funding (44%). Among the predefined obstacles of code sharing, again, the lack of time to build proper documentation (65%), pressure to publish (51%), and the insufficient funding (42%) are the most mentioned reasons. On the other hand, most stimulating factors are the requirement of journals to share data/codes (score: 482), followed by incentives and rewards by institutions (score: 439). The survey showed that 28% of researchers never tried to reproduce a study, and when replication was attempted, researchers often found that open data (70%), open code (71%), and metadata (86%) were missing or incomplete. The analysis of open-ended responses highlighted the need for training, career-stage guidelines, and basic programming skills for researchers. Conclusions Although the likely low response rate may limit its representativeness, this study provides an up-to-date snapshot. A recurrent theme throughout the responses is the need for structural incentives and institutional support. Researchers claim that making work reproducible requires time, resources, and expertise; however, these efforts are rarely rewarded in conventional academic evaluation systems, highlighting the need for a systemic cultural shift.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1277/v1?src=rss">BISCUIT: An Open-Source Platform for Visual Comparison of Segmentation Models in Bioimage Analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Segmentation in microscopy images is a critical task in bioimage analysis, with many deep learning models available (e.g., Cellpose, Omnipose, StarDist, SAM-based models). However, researchers often face challenges in choosing the most suitable model for their data, as quantitative metrics do not always reflect the biological relevance of segmentation results. Methods We developed BISCUIT (BioImage Segmentation Comparison Utility and Interactive Tool), an open-source platform that enables users to run multiple state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on the same images and visually compare their outputs side-by-side. BISCUIT is implemented as an interactive Jupyter Notebook pipeline, leveraging existing segmentation libraries, and can be executed either via a zero-installation cloud environment (Google Colab) or on local high-performance computing resources. Results Using BISCUIT, we demonstrate how visual inspection of segmentation outputs can reveal qualitative differences between algorithms that may be overlooked by abstract performance metrics. For example, in a fluorescence microscopy image dataset, BISCUIT allowed direct comparison of segmentations from Cellpose, Omnipose, and StarDist, highlighting differences in how each algorithm delineated cell boundaries. This visual approach helped identify the model that produced the most biologically plausible segmentation for the dataset. Conclusions BISCUIT provides an intuitive platform for bioimage analysts and life scientists to evaluate and “see what really works” on their data. The platform is openly available and extensible, lowering the barrier for researchers to perform rapid, interactive benchmarking of segmentation models on their own microscopy data.

                Emotion Recognition (ER) with Electroencephalography (EEG) has become a major area of focus in affective computing due to its direct measurement of the activity of the brain. ER based on EEG has also advanced with the popularity of Deep Learning (DL) and its advancements related to classification accuracy and model efficiency. This systematic review is conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and aims to provide an overview of DL-based EEG emotion recognition approaches. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across five major databases covering the publications from 2020 to 2025. The studies with EEG signals for ER using DL architectures were included in the present review. Finally, a total of 233 articles were considered after eligibility screening. To enhance the diversity of investigation, we assessed the public datasets utilized for ER based on EEG in terms of their stimulation procedures and emotional representation. Further, the provided analysis attempts to direct future research toward EEG-based emotion identification systems that are more interpretable, generalizable, and data-efficient. This systematic review aims to provide a roadmap for developing EEG-driven ER, guiding researchers toward more reliable, scalable, and practically useful systems.

                Background High-dimensional microarray data complicates reliable cancer classification. Compact, informative gene panels are needed to maintain predictive power while improving interpretability and cost. Methods We propose a two-stage feature-selection pipeline. Stage 1 ranks genes via an ensemble of filters—ReliefF, chi-square, and Kullback–Leibler divergence—tempered by minimum redundancy–maximum relevance to promote diversity. Stage 2 performs wrapper-based subset search using a Particle Marine Predator Optimizer that fuses Marine Predators Algorithm for global exploration with Particle Swarm Optimization for local refinement. The objective maximizes cross-validated SVM accuracy while penalizing subset size. Results Across seven benchmarks (Breast, CNS, Leukemia, Leukemia-3c, Leukemia-4c, Lymphoma, Ovarian), we compare against Bat Algorithm, Grey Wolf Optimizer, Marine Predators Algorithm, White Shark Optimizer, and recent representatives using accuracy, F1, precision, sensitivity, Matthews correlation coefficient, selected-gene count, and convergence behavior. The method frequently matches or exceeds alternatives while selecting few genes, achieving perfect accuracy on several datasets (Leukemia, Leukemia-3c, Lymphoma, Ovarian) and stable, strong performance on the remainder. Typical subset sizes are 2–5 genes for Leukemia variants, 7–8 for CNS, and ~20 for Breast. Optimization traces show rapid, steady improvement. Conclusions The pipeline achieves an effective exploration–exploitation balance, yielding compact gene panels without sacrificing classification performance. Its modular design supports straightforward extension to larger cohorts and other omics modalities.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013706">An evolutionary approach to predict the orientation of CRISPR arrays</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Axel Fehrenbach, Alexander Mitrofanov, Omer S. Alkhnbashi, Rolf Backofen, Franz Baumdicker</p>

CRISPR-Cas is a defense system of bacteria and archaea against phages. Parts of the foreign DNA, called spacers, are incorporated into the CRISPR array which constitutes the immune memory. The orientation of CRISPR arrays is crucial for analyzing and understanding the functionality of CRISPR systems and their targets. Several methods have been developed to identify the orientation of a CRISPR array. To predict the orientation, different methods use different features such as the repeat sequences between the spacers, the location of the leader sequence, the Cas genes, or PAMs. However, those features are often not sufficient to predict the orientation with certainty, or different methods disagree.
Remarkably, almost all CRISPR systems have been found to insert spacers in a polarized manner at the leader end of the array. We introduce <i>CRISPR-evOr</i>, a method that leverages the resulting patterns to predict the acquisition orientation for (a group of) CRISPR arrays by reconstructing and comparing the likelihood of their evolutionary history with respect to both possible acquisition orientations. The new method is independent of Cas type, leader existence and location, and transcription orientation.
<i>CRISPR-evOr</i> is thus particularly useful for arrays that other CRISPR orientation tools cannot predict confidently and to verify or resolve conflicting predictions from existing tools. <i>CRISPR-evOr</i> currently confidently predicts the orientation of 28.3% of the arrays in the considered subset of CRISPRCasdb, which other tools like CRISPRDirection and CRISPRstrand cannot reliably orient. As our tool leverages evolutionary information we expect this percentage to grow in the future when more closely related arrays will be available. Additionally, <i>CRISPR-evOr</i> provides confident decisions for rare subtypes of CRISPR arrays, where knowledge about repeats and leaders and their orientation is limited.

                <p>by Rebecca M. Crossley, Philip K. Maini</p>

Supervising a short-term research project at undergraduate or master’s level is a rewarding yet complex responsibility that extends far beyond subject expertise. It offers supervisors the opportunity to inspire the next generation of scientists, while providing students with a crucial platform to develop research skills, academic identity, and resilience. However, short-term research projects often come with challenges, including varying levels of student motivation, limited time frames, and the need for intensive skill development. Effective supervision can enhance student learning, foster independent thinking, and improve both the quality and impact of student work, while also contributing to a positive and inclusive research culture. In this article, we present ten simple rules to guide supervisors, particularly those with limited supervision experience, such as early-career researchers, in supporting undergraduate and master’s students through their research journeys. These rules emphasise balancing project requirements with student interests, managing scope, fostering community integration, promoting open science practices, and providing structured yet flexible guidance. By adopting these practical strategies, supervisors can create a more productive, supportive, and enriching research experience for both students and themselves.

                <p>by Qian Dong, Edel Alvarez-Ochoa, Phuong-Khanh Nguyen, Paul Orih, Natasha Fahey-Lozano, Hina Kosakamoto, Fumiaki Obata, Cyrille Alexandre, Louise Y. Cheng</p>

Tumors adapt their metabolism to sustain increased proliferation, rendering them particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in nutrient availability. However, the role of the tumor microenvironment in modulating sensitivity to nutrient restriction (NR) remains poorly understood. Using a <i>Drosophila</i> brain dedifferentiation neural stem cell (NSC) tumor model induced by Prospero (Pros) inhibition, we show that tumor sensitivity to NR is governed by the blood–brain barrier (BBB) glia. We found that the SLC36 amino acid transporter Pathetic (Path) regulates brain branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) levels. Under NR, while wild-type buffers against low nutrient levels by upregulating Path, tumor glia down-regulate Path. Furthermore, Path is specifically required by the tumor (but not wildtype) BBB; its downregulation causes reduced cell cycle progression of BBB glial cells and, in turn, restricts NSC tumor growth. Path influences BBB glial cell cycle via the BCAA-mTor-S6K pathway, and its expression is controlled by Ilp6 levels and the Insulin/PI3K pathway. Overexpression of Path is sufficient to counteract the inhibitory effects of NR on tumor growth. These findings suggest that Path levels at the glial niche BBB play a key role in determining tumor sensitivity to NR.

                <p>by Matthew Ainsworth, Juan M. Galeazzi, Carlos Pedreira, Mark G. Stokes, Mark J. Buckley</p>

Frontopolar cortex (FPC) contains area 10, an anterior sub-region of prefrontal cortex exclusive to humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs) which is thought to support monitoring the value of switching between alternative goals. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this function are unclear. Here, we used multielectrode arrays to record the local field potentials (LFPs) in the FPC of two macaques performing a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analogue and found that bursts of gamma and beta in FPC tracked counterfactual not current rule value. Moreover, we show that brief high-frequency microstimulation to a single trial causally affects both LFP activity in FPC, as well as rule-guided decision-making across successive trials. Following stimulation of FPC, we observed reduced exploration of the counterfactual rule prerule-change, as well as a delayed adaptation to the newly relevant rule postrule-change. A similar, multi-trial time-course disturbance to beta and gamma activity within FPC was also induced following single-trial microstimulation. These findings link neuronal activity in FPC with behavioral monitoring of the value of counterfactual rules and provide neural mechanistic insights into how FPC supports rule-based decision-making.

                <p>by Yiyang Wu, Xiangbin Teng, Yi Du</p>

Auditory-motor synchronization, the alignment of body movements with rhythmic patterns in music, is a universal human behavior, yet its full scope remains incompletely understood. Through four experiments with 123 young nonmusicians, integrating eye-tracking, neurophysiological recordings, white matter structural imaging, and behavioral analysis, we reveal a previously unrecognized form of synchronization: spontaneous eye blinks synchronize with musical beats. Blinks robustly synchronized with beats across a range of tempi and independently of melodic cues. Electroencephalogram recordings revealed a dynamic correspondence between blink timing and neural beat tracking. Blink synchronization performance was linked to white matter microstructure variation in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, a key sensorimotor pathway. Additionally, the strength of blink synchronization reflected the modulation of dynamic auditory attention. These findings establish blink synchronization as a novel behavioral paradigm, expanding the auditory-motor synchronization repertoire and highlighting the intricate interplay between music rhythms and oculomotor activity. This discovery underscores a cross-modal active sensing mechanism, offering new insights into embodied music perception, rhythm processing, and their potential clinical applications.

                Background This study analyzes Saudi Arabia’s 2022–2023 reforms to the Commercial Agency Law through legal, economic, and comparative lenses. The pre-reform regime—marked by rigid nationality limits, procedural burdens, and litigation-prone termination rules—constrained market entry and investor confidence. Methods Using a doctrinal approach to statutes and implementing regulations, triangulated with Saudi judicial practice and policy instruments, we benchmark Saudi reforms against the UAE and UK. A Shariah lens clarifies how gharar (uncertainty), fasakh (rescission), and unjust enrichment (akl al-māl bil-bāṭil) shape agency disputes. Results Key changes include more flexible nationality rules, end-to-end digital registration and renewal, clearer termination/compensation standards, and formal recognition of arbitration (including SCCA). Together these measures enhance contractual predictability and lower compliance frictions, with early indications of improved market transparency and investor sentiment. Conclusions The reforms signal a hybrid model—liberalization aligned with global practice while preserving a Shariah-grounded identity. Remaining priorities include consistent judicial application, practitioner training, clearer guidance, and GCC coordination. We propose thematically grouped policy steps to consolidate gains and support Vision 2030’s diversification agenda.

                Community-Based Learning (CBL) situates learning with and within communities to build capabilities that extend beyond classrooms. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effectiveness of CBL for personal, social, and vocational empowerment. Following PRISMA 2020, we searched Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC, ProQuest, and Google Scholar (2010–2025) and conducted thematic synthesis complemented by bibliometric mapping. Of 8,395 records identified, 122 studies met inclusion criteria. Findings show consistent, positive effects on personal outcomes (e.g., self-confidence, agency, self-regulation) and social outcomes (e.g., teamwork, leadership, civic engagement), with vocational outcomes (e.g., employability, entrepreneurship, financial capability) also positive but more contingent on program design and market linkages. Effectiveness is strengthened by co-design with communities, cultural relevance, facilitator capability, cross-sector partnerships, and inclusive digital mediation; it is hindered by short funding cycles, heterogenous indicators, uneven governance, and equity/reporting gaps. The review integrates global evidence with local practices and SDG priorities (4, 8, 11) and proposes a unifying indicator logic to improve comparability across settings. We conclude that CBL functions as a systems intervention: when pedagogy is aligned with culture, governance, digital infrastructure, and labor-market connections, empowerment effects are stronger and more durable. Materials and extraction sheets are openly available on Zenodo to support transparency and reuse.

                Purpose Exercise is shown to be effective in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), but there is still controversy over which type of exercise is most effective. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of High-intensity interval training (HIIT) versus aerobic training in motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. Materials and Methods A literature search was performed since February 2024 to July 2025 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Discovery @Bolton, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, PubMed, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus. Data extracted by a single reviewer and cross checked by another. The risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk of bias tool, and quality of reporting was assessed using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TiDieR) checklist. Results The search yielded 9 studies involving a total of 263 people with PD in the early stages. The results from the risk of bias showed that 88.8% of studies were judged to be of moderate to high quality. The completeness of intervention reporting showed overall moderate (66.1%) quality of reporting. Conclusion HIIT showed improvement in physiological, cognitive, and overall quality of life (QoL) outcomes when compared to aerobic exercise. HIIT also showed significant improvement in cognitive function. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42023478541, 02 November 2023.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1272/v1?src=rss">Does the Home-death Rate Reflect Medically Attended Community Deaths in Japan? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The home-death rate is widely used in Japan as an indicator of community-based end-of-life care; however, this rate includes deaths without professional involvement. This study examines whether the home-death rate reflects medically attended home-based deaths across municipalities. Methods An ecological panel study was conducted using data from 1,741 municipalities obtained in 2017, 2020, and 2023 (5,222 municipality-year observations). National datasets from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare include data on medical institutions, home-visit nursing services, and clinic-certified home deaths. The dependent variable was the proportion of deaths occurring at home. Explanatory variables included home deaths certified by home-care support clinics and general clinics as well as deaths under home-visit nursing reimbursed by medical or long-term care insurance. Fixed-effects panel regression models with municipality and year effects were applied, using cluster-robust standard errors. Finally, correlations between the model residuals and prefectural rates of coroner-investigated deaths were examined to explore the influence of non-medical deaths. Results Home deaths certified by general clinics and deaths under medical-insurance-reimbursed visiting nursing were significantly associated with higher home-death rates (β=4.06, 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 1.28–6.85; β=31.75, 95%CI 8.14–55.37, respectively). The associations between home-care support clinics and long-term care insurance-reimbursed visiting nursing were not significant. No correlation was found between residuals and prefectural rates of coroner-investigated deaths (r=0.09, 95%CI, –0.20–0.37). Conclusions Japan’s home-death rate partly reflects medically attended home deaths, particularly those involving general clinics and medical-insurance-reimbursed visiting nursing. However, because this rate also includes deaths without professional care, it should be interpreted as a contextual rather than a quality indicator of end-of-life care and complemented by measures capturing care involvement and coordination.

                Background A pressing challenge in science education is that visually impaired students continue to lack access to appropriate instructional media, making it difficult for them to engage with abstract concepts and resulting in limited opportunities for equitable education. Responding to this challenge, the present study investigates the design and implementation of hands-on, multisensory instructional strategies aimed at improving conceptual understanding of magnetism among elementary students with visual impairments. Method The research involved four elementary school students with varying degrees of visual acuity. Employing the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) framework, the research was divided into 3 stages: needs analysis (A) using explanatory case study, design and develop (DD) instructional media and validate using Aiken’s V, implement and evaluate (IE) the media into classroom activity using evaluative case study. Result The findings indicate that tactile models, auditory explanations, and adapted activity kits significantly improved students’ engagement and comprehension of key magnetism concepts such as magnetic properties, forces, and polarity. Through an evaluative case study, the research demonstrates that instructional materials tailored to the sensory and cognitive profiles of visually impaired learners not only foster deeper conceptual understanding but also promote greater participation and confidence in science learning. Conclusions Multisensory science kits help students access abstract science material so that it can be felt and helps achieve conceptual understanding. Moreover, the results may inform teachers, curriculum designers, and science education professionals on how to design and adapt science content in ways that are both accessible and pedagogically sound.

                Plant pan-genomes, which aggregate genomic sequences and annotations from multiple individuals of a species, have emerged as transformative tools for understanding genetic diversity, adaptation, and evolutionary dynamics. Super-pan-genomes, extending across species boundaries, further enable comparative analyses of clades or genera, bridging breeding applications with evolutionary insights (Shang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a). However, the absence of standardized practices for data generation, analysis, and sharing hinders reproducibility and interoperability. This white paper presents a harmonized framework developed by the ELIXIR E-PAN consortium, addressing nomenclature, quality control (QC), data formats, visualization, and community practices. By adopting these guidelines, researchers can enhance FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) compliance, foster collaboration, and accelerate translational applications in crop improvement and evolutionary biology.

                Background This study aimed to document the occurrence of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus in King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve (KSRNR), Hail region, Saudi Arabia, where its presence had not previously been confirmed. Methods Field surveys were conducted in the Hail region, and direct observations were documented using photographic and video evidence. The colony was visually counted in the field during a single daytime visit from an estimated distance of 15 meters. Results More than 50 individuals, including adults and juveniles, were observed roosting in a rock crevice. The photographic documentation confirms the presence of a colony of R. aegyptiacus in this area, extending the known distribution of the species into a previously unrecorded region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions These findings provide the first photographic record of R. aegyptiacus in KSRNR and highlight the species’ ecological use of arid rock crevices. The results emphasize the need for targeted surveys and long-term monitoring to better understand the distribution and conservation of this species in desert environments.

                Background A diverse spectrum of long COVID symptoms (LCS) have the scope of physical rehabilitation. Due to limited resources, very little is known about the physiotherapy and rehabilitation interventions for LCS and their clinical application. This study aims to enlist the physiotherapy and rehabilitation interventions in the management of musculoskeletal, neurological, cognitive, cardiorespiratory, mental health, and functional impairments of LCS. Methods The study was a scoping review of the literature published between April 2020 and July 2022. Results 87 records were extracted followed by a standard process of The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) extension for Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The included records had a 3223 LCS population. All types of primary and secondary evidences were retrieved except for qualitative studies. The evidence was evaluated by an appraisal scoring tool followed by the guidelines of the “Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) network”. The included papers had a mean appraisal score of 0.7807 on a 0 to 1 scale (SD 0.08), the minimum score was for study protocols (0.5870), and the maximum score was for Cohort studies (.8977). Sixty seven (67) evidence-based interventions were documented from 17 clinical categories. The most weighted interventions were treating underlying symptoms of long COVID (Adjusted score 1/1), management of fatigue (Adjusted score 0.963/1), aerobic exercise and balance training (Adjusted score 0.951/1), multidisciplinary rehabilitation (Adjusted score 0.926/1), and low resistance training and aerobic exercise (Adjusted score 0.889/1). Conclusion We recommend Long COVID rehabilitation in a multidisciplinary approach by treating the individual symptoms, especially fatigue. Physiotherapy interventions include were exercise, modalities, patient education, respiratory rehabilitation, and telerehabilitation. Scoping reviews do not require protocol registration from PROSPERO.

                Neurons are highly polarised and compartmentalised cells with organelles that are specialised to support their spatial and functional demands. This includes lysosomes, which are single-membrane-bound organelles enveloping acidic contents enriched with hydrolytic enzymes. While classically thought to be localised at the soma where they degrade waste, lysosomes have a range of dynamic nondegradative functions throughout neurons. Here, we review lysosomal dynamics and non-canonical functions in neurons, including axonal mRNA transport, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Ca2+ signalling, neuronal remodelling, and interorganellar contact sites. We synthesise work across a range of model systems and species, providing insights from neurological diseases, where previous lysosomal research has focussed on proteostatic failure. This perspective highlights the need to better define lysosomal heterogeneity, compartmentalisation and specialisation in neurons.

                Zhou et al. identify a pro-inflammatory C5aR1⁺ microglial subtype enriched in human cerebral edema tissues after TBI and ICH. C5aR1⁺ microglia amplify neuroinflammation, promote neurotoxic astrocyte polarization via LGALS9-CD44, and recruit neutrophils via CCL3/CCL5. Pharmacological C5aR1 inhibition reduces cerebral edema, highlighting a potential therapeutic target.

                Zhuo et al. find that glycogen metabolism in white adipose tissue is involved in thermogenesis and hypermetabolism after burn injury. Suppression of glycogen synthesis elevates UDPG, which interacts with JAK2 and blocks interleukin-6 signaling. Inhibition of glycogen synthesis by a small chemical inhibitor alleviates hypermetabolism and improves survival after burn.

                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators in disease, but their role in subnuclear structure and mitosis remains unclear. This study reveals that lncRNA MIAT directs the helicase DHX9 to the nucleolus, driving smooth muscle cell proliferation and vascular disease. Knockdown of MIAT or DHX9 disrupts nucleolar homeostasis and mitotic progression. The MIAT-DHX9 axis also contributes to neuroblastoma pathogenesis, offering a therapeutic target for treating hyperproliferative disorders.

                Crystal structures and deep mutational scanning experiments by Alpsoy et al. reveal how the transcriptional coactivators POU2F3 and OCA-T form a DNA-dependent complex required for tuft cell lineage specification. Protein features essential for the function of this complex are identified, uncovering a structural vulnerability in tuft cell-like lung cancers.

Here, by combining a YIG film with a ZnO acoustic resonator, Künstle and coauthors achieve magnetic field tuneable magnon-polarons in a virtually infinite magnetic film, and succeed in observing Rabi-like oscillations in the time domain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104275">Phenotypic impact of individual conserved neuronal microexons and their master regulators in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Microexons exhibit striking evolutionary conservation and are subject to precise, switch-like regulation in neurons, orchestrated by the splicing factors <i>Srrm3</i> and <i>Srrm4</i>. Disruption of these regulators in mice leads to severe neurological phenotypes, and their misregulation is linked to human disease. However, the specific microexons involved in these phenotypes and the effects of individual microexon deletions on neurodevelopment, physiology, and behavior remain poorly understood. To explore this, we generated zebrafish lines with deletions of 18 individual microexons, alongside <i>srrm3</i> and <i>srrm4</i> mutant lines, and conducted comprehensive phenotypic analyses. We discovered that while loss of <i>srrm3</i>, alone or together with <i>srrm4</i>, resulted in significant alterations in neuritogenesis, locomotion, and social behavior, individual microexon deletions typically produced mild or no noticeable effects. Nonetheless, we identified specific microexons associated with defects in neuritogenesis (<i>evi5b</i>, <i>vav2</i>, <i>itsn1</i>, <i>src</i>) and social behavior (<i>vti1a</i>, <i>kif1b</i>). Additionally, most microexon deletions triggered coordinated transcriptomic changes in neural pathways, suggesting the presence of molecular compensatory mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the severe phenotypes caused by <i>Srrm3/4</i> depletion arise from the combined effects of multiple subtle disruptions across various cellular pathways, which are individually well-tolerated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101790">Removal of developmentally regulated microexons has a minimal impact on larval zebrafish brain morphology and function</a></h4>

              
                Microexon splicing is a vertebrate-conserved process through which small, often in-frame, exons are differentially included during brain development and across neuron types. Although the protein sequences encoded by these exons are highly conserved and can mediate interactions, the neurobiological functions of only a small number have been characterized. To establish a more generalized understanding of their roles in brain development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to remove 45 microexons in zebrafish and assessed larval brain activity, morphology, and behavior. Most mutants had minimal or no phenotypes at this developmental stage. Among previously studied microexons, we uncovered baseline and stimulus-driven phenotypes for two microexons (meA and meB) in <i>ptprd</i> and reduced activity in the telencephalon in the <i>tenm3</i> B<sub>0</sub> isoform. Although mild neural phenotypes were discovered for several microexons that have not been previously characterized, including in <i>ppp6r3</i>, <i>sptan1</i>, <i>dop1a</i>, <i>rapgef2</i>, <i>dctn4</i>, <i>vti1a</i>, and <i>meaf6</i>. This study establishes a general approach for investigating conserved alternative splicing events and prioritizes microexons for downstream analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107718">Smed-pou4-2 regulates mechanosensory neuron regeneration and function in planarians</a></h4>

              
                POU4 homologs are involved in the development of sensory cell types across diverse species, including cnidarians, ascidians, and mammals. Whether these developmental regulators are redeployed during adult tissue maintenance and regeneration remains an open question in regenerative biology. Here, we investigated the role of the <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> BRN3/POU4 homolog, <i>Smed-pou4-2</i> (<i>pou4-2</i>), in the regeneration of mechanosensory neurons. We found that <i>pou4-2</i> is regulated by the SoxB1 homolog <i>soxB1-2</i> and is expressed in a distinct population of ciliated sensory cells that detect water flow. Transcriptomic analysis of <i>pou4-2</i>-deficient planarians revealed enrichment for conserved genes associated with human auditory and vestibular function, suggesting that planarian rheosensory neurons share molecular features with mammalian inner ear hair cells. Expression of these conserved genes was significantly reduced following RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>pou4-2</i>. To determine whether these transcriptional changes had functional consequences, we assessed the impact of <i>pou4-2</i> knockdown on sensory function. <i>pou4-2</i> RNAi resulted in impaired mechanosensation in both uninjured and regenerating planarians. Together with the loss of terminal differentiation markers in mechanosensory neurons, these findings identify <i>Smed-pou4-2</i> as a key regulator of mechanosensory neuron identity in planarians and support the idea that conserved sensory specification programs are redeployed during adult tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107214">Extrusion-modulated DnaA activity oscillations coordinate DNA replication with biomass growth</a></h4>

              
                Robust control of DNA replication is fundamental to bacterial proliferation. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, replication initiation is thought to be regulated by oscillations in DnaA activity, driven by DnaA-chromosome interactions that differ among leading models. However, direct evidence linking these oscillations to replication initiation has been lacking, and existing models fail to explain the observed decoupling of replication initiation from <i>dnaA</i> expression. Here, we establish a direct link between DnaA activity and replication initiation by demonstrating robust oscillations in DnaA activity, which peak precisely at replication initiation across diverse growth conditions and genetic perturbations. Notably, these oscillations persist even when <i>dnaA</i> transcription remains constant, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that modulates DnaA activity independently of its expression. Additionally, we propose an extrusion model in which DNA-binding proteins sense biomass-DNA imbalance and extrude DnaA from the chromosome to trigger replication, overcoming limitations of existing models. Consistent with this model, perturbation of the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS modulates DnaA activity and replication timing, supporting its mechanistic validity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101111">A deep learning approach for the analysis of birdsong</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning tools for behavior analysis have enabled important insights and discoveries in neuroscience. Yet, they often compromise interpretability and generalizability for performance, making quantitative comparisons across datasets difficult. We developed a novel deep learning-based behavior analysis pipeline, Avian Vocalization Network (AVN), for zebra finch learned vocalizations - the most widely studied vocal learning model species. AVN annotates songs with high accuracy, generalizing across multiple animal colonies without re-training, and generates a comprehensive set of interpretable features describing song syntax, timing, and acoustic properties. We use this feature set to compare song phenotypes across research groups and experiments and to predict a bird’s stage in song development. Additionally, we have developed a novel method to measure song imitation that requires no training data for new comparisons and outperforms existing similarity scoring methods in its sensitivity and agreement with expert human judgements. These tools are available through the open-source AVN python package and graphical application, making them accessible to researchers without prior coding experience. Altogether, this behavior analysis toolkit stands to accelerate the study of vocal behavior by standardizing phenotype and learning outcome mapping, thus helping scientists better link behavior to the underlying neural processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106818">Fifteenth century CE Bolivian maize reveals genetic affinities with ancient Peruvian maize</a></h4>

              
                Previous archaeological and anthropological studies have demonstrated the myriad of ways that cultural and political systems shape access to food and food preferences. However, few studies have conducted a biocultural analysis linking specific genotypic/phenotypic traits as evidence of cultural selection in ancient contexts. Here, we provide insight into this topic through ancient genome data from Bolivian maize dating to ~500–600 BP, included as an offering with the mummified remains of a young girl. These data are compared to 16 previously published archaeological maize samples spanning at least 5000 years of evolution, and 226 modern maize samples. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the archaeological Bolivian maize (aBM) has the closest genetic distance to the archaeological maize from ancient Peru, which in turn shared the most similarities with archaeological Peruvian maize. During the period of interaction between the Inca state and local polities in the central Andes and consequent interactions with local agricultural traditions, the genetic diversity of maize increased. Ovule development in modern maize was selected and compared to those in archaeological specimens, revealing evidence of targeted breeding strategies aimed at improving seed quality and yield. While the cultural origin of the maize – either Inca or local Aymara – is uncertain, we demonstrate that the samples are most similar to Peruvian maize and potential targeted selection strategies for enhanced growth were well established by the 15<sup>th</sup> century.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103017">Mother-child dyadic interactions shape the developing social brain and Theory of Mind in young children</a></h4>

              
                Social cognition develops through a complex interplay between neural maturation and environmental factors, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm, we investigated the effects of age and parental caregiving on social brain development and Theory of Mind (ToM) in 34 mother-child dyads. The functional maturity of social brain networks was positively associated with age, while mother-child neural synchronization during movie viewing was related to dyadic relationship quality. Crucially, parenting and child factors interactively shaped social cognition outcomes, mediated by ToM abilities. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of neurocognitive development and interpersonal synchrony in early childhood social cognition, and provide novel evidence for neurodevelopmental plasticity and reciprocal determinism. This integrative approach, bridging brain, behavior, and parenting environment, advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms shaping social cognition. The insights gained can inform personalized interventions promoting social competence, emphasizing the critical importance of nurturing parental relationships in facilitating healthy social development.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control the latent activity of a circuit would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. We simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. The fields of classical and optimal control offer a range of methods to choose from for controlling dynamics on the neural manifold, which differ in performance, computational cost, and ease of implementation. Here, we focus on two commonly used control methods: proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC). PID is a computationally lightweight controller that is simple to implement. In contrast, MPC is a model-based, anticipatory controller with a much higher computational cost and engineering overhead. We evaluate both methods on trajectory-following tasks in latent space, under partial observability and in the presence of unknown noise. While both controllers in some cases were able to successfully control the latent dynamics on the neural manifold, MPC consistently produced more accurate control and required less hyperparameter tuning. These results demonstrate how MPC can be applied on the neural manifold using data-driven dynamics models and provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and external stimuli.</span>

Here, we propose a new planning framework that integrates Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with active inference objectives to systematically reduce epistemic uncertainty while pursuing extrinsic rewards. Our key insight is that MCTS, already renowned for its search efficiency, can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the cross-entropy method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both stand-alone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.</span>

">Neural mechanisms of handedness for precision drawing: hand-dependent engagement of cortical networks for bimanual control and tool use</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms of handedness remain poorly understood, particularly for lateralized movements such as precision drawing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined how healthy adults and individuals with peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in their dominant hand performed a visually guided drawing task with each hand. We hypothesized that the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) supports drawing with either hand, and that individuals with PNI would recruit the same mechanisms as healthy adults. Methods: 33 Right-handed adults (23 healthy adults, 10 patients) underwent fMRI while performing a precision drawing task, alternating between the right hand (RH) and left hand (LH). LH>RH effects were examined across 20 regions of interest (12 a priori, 8 post hoc) using two approaches: (1) BOLD magnitude, and (2) functional connectivity (FC) modulation, assessed via generalized psychophysiological interaction. Results: All effects describe LH drawing > RH drawing. Right primary motor cortex (M1) had lower magnitude and greater FC with two networks, both of which exhibited equal-or-greater magnitude: a left hemisphere M1-dorsal premotor circuit, and an intrahemispheric parieto-temporal circuit. Right M1 (also had reduced interhemispheric FC with inferior parietal lobule, which exhibited lower magnitude. Patient group had no effect on magnitude or FC. Conclusions: Three neural mechanisms differentiate LH from RH drawing in right handed adults. First, a left hemisphere system for bimanual control, which engages intrahemispherically (directly) during RH drawing but interhemispherically (indirectly) during LH drawing. Second, LH drawing increases engagement of a contralateral system that may reflect increased task demands. Third, RH drawing increases engagement of an interhemispheric circuit for tool use. The first and third systems may explain performance asymmetries associated with handedness. Patients with PNI use the same mechanisms as healthy adults, highlighting these mechanisms' potential as a neuromodulatory target to enhance LH performance after RH impairment.

">Whole-Brain Millisecond-Scale Effective Connectivity Atlas of Auditory and Visual Naming</a></h4>

              
                Neurobiological models suggest that speech relies on interactions among distant cortical regions interconnected by white matter pathways. Prior studies have shown that speech-related functional coactivation--simultaneous high-gamma augmentation across distributed regions--reflects underlying neural interactions, as validated by electrical stimulation mapping. However, it remains unclear at the whole-brain level when, for how long, and in which directions cortical regions transmit information, and how dynamic information flows contribute to speech. Here, we investigated the causal roles of directional neural information flow during auditory and visual naming using intracranial EEG from 9,526 artifact-free nonepileptic sites across 127 patients. Information flow, estimated by transfer entropy-based effective connectivity, was classified as excitatory when high-gamma acceleration in one region predicted subsequent acceleration in another, and inhibitory when deceleration predicted downstream deceleration. Following stimulus onset, excitatory flows emerged from modality-specific sensory cortices and propagated to higher-order regions, later becoming bidirectional as functional coactivation developed. Each excitatory flow event was transient (<500 ms), typically followed by inhibitory flows and decreased coactivation, during which excitatory flows often emerged along new pathways. During auditory naming, faster response times were associated with stronger excitatory flows in left perisylvian regions; during visual naming, faster responses were linked to stronger flows in bilateral basal temporal cortices. Stronger excitatory flows at specific time points predicted a higher probability of stimulation-induced symptoms (Spearman's rho: 0.54 - 0.81; p<0.00001), whereas associations with inhibitory flows peaked later. Excitatory flows near visual naming response onset were particularly associated with stimulation-induced speech arrest and face sensorimotor symptoms, whereas functional coactivation alone failed to reveal comparable associations. These findings demonstrate that transient acceleration of directional neural interactions through white matter supports successive stages of speech processing. As activity within one pathway decelerates, excitatory flow accelerates along another, enabling functional transitions critical for naming. By establishing the causal contribution of temporally precise, anatomically specific white matter pathways, this study substantiates and extends existing neurobiological models of speech. To facilitate replication and dynamic whole-brain visualization, we provide open access to the full dataset (62.15 GB) and analysis code.

                Neuronal metabolism is fundamental to brain functions and diseases, yet its spatial and temporal dynamics and interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce a tandem deep-learning approach integrated with bioorthogonal chemical imaging using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. This method achieves high-speed and quantitative metabolic profiling in live neuronal co-cultures. Our deep-learning framework consists of a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) that enables high-resolution 3D imaging with minimal photodamage and a U-Net segmentation model for cell-type-specific metabolic analysis. Using deuterium-labeled metabolites, we demonstrate the ability to trace lipid, protein, glucose, and D2O metabolism in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes under physiological and pathological conditions, including NMDA receptor activation, proteasome inhibition, and Huntington's disease. Our findings reveal distinct metabolic adaptations among neuronal cell types and underscore the importance of non-invasive metabolic profiling for understanding neuronal interactions and disease mechanisms. This platform significantly advances live-cell dynamic imaging with broad applications in neuroscience, disease modeling, and therapeutic screening.

                How astrocytes achieve their diverse roles in the brain at the molecular level is poorly understood. In this study, we leverage mouse models, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, behavioral assays, and bioinformatic approaches to demonstrate that astrocyte activity and astrocyte-mediated mouse behavior depends on the highly conserved and selective RNA turnover pathway-nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). Conditional deletion of the core NMD gene, Upf2, in mature astrocytes leads to enhanced basal Ca2+ signaling coupled with synapse dysfunction and elevated anxiety. Restoring basal Ca2+ signaling in NMD-deficient astrocytes rescued synaptic transmission and minimized anxiety-associated behavior. Molecular bioinformatic analysis identified specific NMD target transcripts in astrocytes as candidates influencing calcium signaling pathways and neuro-glia interactions that support brain function. Our study is the first to demonstrate functional roles for NMD in astrocytes.

">Auditory Cortical Gradients Integrate Bottom-Up and Top-Down Structure During Natural Sound Categorisation</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain organises natural categories is a central challenge in neuroscience. While prior work has shown that categories can be decoded from distributed activity patterns in auditory cortex, it remains unclear how these categories are globally arranged relative to one another, and how low-level acoustic and higher-level semantic structure jointly shape this organisation. Here, we addressed these questions by deriving low-dimensional functional gradients from high-depth functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (three participants, ~4.7 hours each) acquired during a category-specific one-back task. These gradients captured the principal axes of population activity in auditory cortex. Gradient-based models of the auditory cortex explained category structure more accurately than region-of-interest or whole-brain approaches, revealing that category information is distributed across multiple continuous axes rather than aligned with any single organisational dimension. Projecting acoustic (gammatone filter-bank) and behavioural similarity spaces directly into a shared framework with the fMRI functional axes showed that both contribute to the brain's category geometry, with acoustic structure exerting a somewhat stronger influence. However, representational relationships varied across category pairs: some reflected primarily acoustic similarity, others semantic distinctions, and many a combination of both. This pairwise heterogeneity shows how auditory cortex may integrate multiple representational dimensions that define higher-level categories.

">Perceiving Instability: How Expectations Bias Sensorimotor Processing in Balance Control</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining balance requires rapid integration of sensory input with top-down sensorimotor predictions. Predictive coding frameworks posit that mismatches between the two (prediction errors) drive perceptual inference. Although these frameworks have helped explain perception in unisensory domains (e.g., vision, touch), it remains unclear whether such mechanisms govern perception in fast-acting sensorimotor systems like human balance. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and discrete postural perturbations, we independently manipulated expectations and sensory input by priming healthy adult participants to expect either small or large perturbations, while occasionally delivering expectancy-violating perturbations (i.e., perturbations were smaller or larger than expected). Subjective perception of instability was shaped by expectation alone, regardless of actual sensory input (i.e., perturbation magnitude). Similarly, both anticipatory pre-perturbation beta-band suppression and post-perturbation sensorimotor gamma increases were sensitive to expected perturbation magnitude. In contrast, both the balance N1 (a well-established stimulus-evoked cortical potential) and the objective postural responses of instability tracked actual perturbation magnitude alone. Crucially, neither perception, nor any of these early (commonly analysed) neural or behavioural markers, encoded prediction errors. These findings suggest that two distinct systems exist: one that is sensitive to top-down expectations and another that is driven by sensory input, independent of expectation or mismatches. These findings challenge the centrality of prediction error as a driver of perception in fast sensorimotor systems such as postural control, and offer insight into conditions marked by distorted bodily awareness during balance.

">Machine-Learning Classification of Motor Unit Types in the Adult Mouse</a></h4>

              
                The diversity of motor units arises from differences in the contractile properties of muscle fibers and the intrinsic electrical properties of their motoneurons. In mice, however, this relationship has not been quantitatively defined, and conventional classification often relies on subjective thresholds. Here, we combined in vivo intracellular recordings with supervised and unsupervised machine-learning methods to test whether motoneuron electrophysiology can predict the physiological identity of mouse motor units. Unbiased clustering identified four groups corresponding to slow (S), fast fatigue-resistant (FR), intermediate (FI), and fast fatigable (FF) types. A multinomial logistic regression model performed well, with most errors occurring between FI and FF types, which showed substantial overlap. Reducing the task to three classes improved accuracy. Feature selection revealed that four electrophysiological properties (input conductance, rheobase, AHP duration, maximal frequency) were sufficient for high predictive performance. Overall, this study provides a quantitative description of mouse motor-unit properties and a framework for incorporating motor-unit diversity into future investigations of neuromuscular physiology and disease.

">Sex Differences in B2 SINE RNA Expression and its Role in Hippocampal Development</a></h4>

              
                Once dismissed as "junk", transposable elements (TE) have recently gained recognition for their regulatory roles, notably in the brain and in development. The brain is hormone-responsive and the hippocampus in particular is sensitive to circulating gonadal hormones. While transcriptionally active, TE function remains poorly understood, especially in the brain. We and others have shown that one particular TE RNA, B2 SINE ncRNA, is a regulator in the rodent hippocampus, especially after a psychologically stressful event like acute restraint stress. It is unknown, however, if B2 SINE ncRNA is necessary for the proper development of hippocampal neurons, and furthermore, if there is a sex difference in this development. This work investigates the difference in expression of B2 SINE RNA across sexes and its role in the development of primary hippocampal neurons. We utilized pooled locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeRs to knock down the expression of B2 SINE RNA and treated primary hippocampal neurons with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to test if there is a difference in dendritic complexity. We used Sholl analysis to quantify the branching, number of tips, and Sholl mean. We found a sex difference in both B2 SINE, higher in males compared to females, and B-actin, lower in males compared to females. Additionally, knocking down B2 SINE RNA results in a reduction of dendritic complexity in male but not in female neurons. Taken together, this work suggests that B2 SINE RNA is expressed differentially and plays an important role in the proper development of hippocampal neurons in a sex dependent manner. Our findings support the identification of a sex-specific biomarker that may enable individualized treatment of conditions influenced by sex. This is the first evidence of the role a transposable element's RNA has in the regulation of the development of neurons and the first to show that differential regulation by sex.

">Separable neurocomputational mechanisms underlying multisensory learning</a></h4>

              
                Efficient control of behavior requires multisensory learning from information distributed across senses. However, most neurocomputational studies have focused on unisensory signals. Here, we identify distinct but interacting neurocomputational mechanisms that support learning of multisensory associations. We designed a task in which behaviorally relevant information was available only from combinations of visual cues with either auditory or tactile cues. In 58 participants undergoing fMRI, we dissociated three processes: multisensory statistical learning (SL), modeled as stimulus-locked Shannon surprise; reinforcement learning (RL), modeled as feedback-locked signed reward prediction errors (RPEs); and feedback-locked unsigned RPEs (uRPEs), reflecting surprise about reward outcomes. Behaviorally, response times scaled with Shannon surprise (SL) while accuracy improved with feedback (RL). Model-based fMRI revealed dissociable but complementary networks: RPEs engaged ventral striatum, vmPFC, and left angular gyrus; surprise recruited bilateral angular gyrus, dlPFC, and precuneus; and uRPEs involved insula, dorsomedial prefrontal, and lateral frontoparietal cortices. Several of these regions are not typically implicated in unisensory studies, suggesting specialization for multisensory learning. All three networks were modality-general, i.e., they showed comparable strength for audiovisual and visuotactile learning. Notably, left angular gyrus tracked both Shannon surprise and RPE, identifying it as a potential hub for integrating structural and value information. These findings reveal that the brain engages distinct but complementary systems for structure-based, reward-based, and outcome-surprise computations. By combining behavioral modeling and fMRI with a novel task design, we provide a principled framework for dissecting the neurocomputational architecture of multisensory learning.

">A dopamine circuit regulates locomotor initiation and persistence in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Decisions to initiate or terminate locomotion reflect the commitment of an animal to expend energy and thus must be appropriately regulated. Dopaminergic system has been implicated in locomotor regulation but how it controls these decisions remains unclear. Here we show that a dopamine circuit in Drosophila mushroom body regulates cue-induced locomotor initiation and termination by integrating locomotor history and current motivation. This circuit consists of the locomotor-initiator mushroom body output neurons, MBON09, and the locomotor-terminator MBON21. Previous locomotor initiation by default suppresses the propensity of future initiation through depression of MBON09 activity by locomotion-sensitive dopamine afferents, preventing redundant action. Locomotor persistence is promoted through combined inhibition of MBON21 by MBON09 and by distinct dopamine afferents that receive fluctuating motivational signals. Persistent locomotion under high motivational state, in turn, causes dopamine-dependent MBON09 facilitation, reinvigorating locomotor initiation program. Our results revealed a dopaminergic mechanism to transform recent behavior and current motivation into a moment-by-moment internal state that in turn regulates locomotor decisions.

">CUSP: Complex Spike Sorting from Multi-electrode Array Recordings with U-net Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction</a></h4>

              
                Background: Complex spikes (CSs) in cerebellar Purkinje cells convey unique signals complementary to Simple spike (SS) action potentials, but are infrequent and variable in waveform. Their variability and low spike counts, combined with recording artifacts such as electrode drift, make automated detection challenging. New Method: We introduce CUSP (CS sorting via U-net Sequence Prediction), a fully automated deep learning framework for CS sorting in high-density multi-electrode array recordings. CUSP uses a U-Net architecture with hybrid self-attention inception blocks to integrate local field potential and action potential signals and outputs CS event probabilities in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Detected events are clustered and paired with concurrently detected SSs to reconstruct the complete Purkinje cell activity. Results: Trained on cerebellar neuropixels recordings in rhesus macaques, CUSP achieves human-expert performance (F1 = 0.83 +/- 0.03) and even captures valid CS events overlooked during manual annotation. Comparison with Existing Methods: CUSP outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art CS and SS sorting algorithms on CS detection. It remains robust to waveform variability, spikelet composition, and electrode drift, enabling accurate CS tracking in long-term recordings. In contrast, existing methods often show false-positive biases or degrade under drift. Conclusions: CUSP provides a scalable, robust framework for analyzing burst-like or dynamically complex spike patterns. Its generalizability makes it valuable for large-scale cerebellar datasets and other neural systems, such as hippocampal pyramidal cells, where complex bursts are critical for computation. By combining expert-level accuracy with automation, CUSP offers a broadly applicable solution for studying information coding across circuits.

">Neural Dynamics of Multiattribute Decision Making Under Choice Overload</a></h4>

              
                The present study examines the neural mechanisms of value-based multiattribute decision making through the lens of choice overload during consumer choice. Two behavioral experiments established that choice sets of a moderate size with nine options were perceived as most optimal compared to choice sets with three and 24 options, and options chosen from the largest set size were judged to be the least satisfying. A functional MRI study then examined how the brain responds to choice sets varying in size and complexity by manipulating the number of options presented as well as the presence of asymmetrically dominated decoy alternatives during a simulated online shopping task. Results showed that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity followed an inverse U-shape as a function of choice set size, peaking for moderately sized choice sets. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) exhibited a linear trend with choice set size. Trials containing decoy options elicited greater activation of the anterior insula (AIns) and DLPFC. Computational modeling of choice behavior revealed a greater tendency to utilize a simplifying lexicographic decision strategy as decision difficulty increased, and individual differences in decision strategies were reflected in activity of the ACC and AIns. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates effort, control, and strategy during complex value-based decisions.

">A Reversible Mitochondrial ROS Probe for Monitoring Mitophagy Dynamics: Development and Application of MitoFlare</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction and defective mitophagy are defining features of numerous neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, yet existing tools provide limited ability to quantify mitophagy dynamics in real time within living, post-mitotic cells. Here we present MitoFlare, a mitochondria-targeted, reversible mtROS-responsive fluorogenic probe that enables continuous, non-genetic visualization of mitochondrial oxidative activation and turnover. MitoFlare incorporates dual TEMPO nitroxide quenchers into a long-wavelength rhodamine scaffold, producing >95% basal quenching and rapid, fully reversible fluorescence activation in response to mitochondrial superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, lipid-derived peroxyl species, and peroxynitrite. When combined with LysoTracker Green, MitoFlare forms a dual-probe imaging platform that resolves the entire mitophagy cascade with high spatial and temporal fidelity in intact PC12 neuronal cells. Using this platform, we established a quantitative framework comprising three mechanistically distinct metrics: (i) a proximity index that reports early mitochondrial engagement with lysosomes, (ii) Mander's M1 coefficient that captures mid-stage mitochondria-lysosome fusion and mitophagosome formation, and (iii) a quenching/swelling index that resolves terminal lysosomal degradation. Nutrient deprivation induced a complete, temporally ordered mitophagy program, including mtROS priming, Parkin-OPTN-associated fusion, and efficient acidification-dependent cargo degradation. In contrast, inhibition of v-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 arrested mitophagy at the fusion stage, resulting in persistent redox-active mitochondrial cargo that failed to undergo lysosomal digestion. Importantly, MitoFlare's reversible redox chemistry uniquely revealed accumulation of undegraded, oxidatively active mitochondrial remnants within non-acidified vesicles-pathological intermediates that are undetectable using irreversible ROS dyes or genetically encoded reporters. These findings demonstrate that mitophagy proceeds through discrete, redox-regulated and lysosome-dependent phases that can be quantitatively mapped in real time. By enabling synchronized measurement of oxidative activation, organelle trafficking, fusion, and degradation, the MitoFlare-LysoTracker system establishes a new benchmark for dynamic mitophagy analysis in physiologically relevant models. This platform provides a powerful foundation for mechanistic interrogation of mitochondrial quality control and for accelerating the discovery of therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring mitophagic fidelity in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.

">Cell-autonomous mitochondrial calcium flux governs oligodendrocyte regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells drive central nervous system remyelination, yet the intrinsic mechanisms that define their regenerative potential remain unclear. We identify spontaneous, cell-autonomous intracellular Ca2+ signaling as a critical mechanism regulating OL regeneration following demyelination. Longitudinal in vivo imaging and ex vivo recordings reveal that Ca2+ signaling arises intrinsically within OL lineage cells after demyelination, and occurs independently from neuronal or behavioral activity. Mechanistically, mitochondrial Ca2+ flux sustains intracellular Ca2+ signals in oligodendroglia, and its in vivo disruption impairs oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation, differentiation, and repopulation at the lesion site. Conversely, enhancing oligodendroglial Ca2+ signaling in vivo using chemogenetics stimulates lineage expansion and differentiation. In primary human OPC cultures, modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ flux similarly reduces proliferation, indicating a conserved role for this pathway across species. These findings identify mitochondrial Ca2+ flux as a central driver of the oligodendroglial regeneration and a potential therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases.

">Injury-induced nuclear export of RNA-binding proteins drives mRNA stabilization and translation to promote dendrite regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Dendrite regeneration is critical for restoring neuronal connectivity after injury, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using C. elegans as a model and through a forward genetic screen, we identified the conserved insulin degrading enzyme idr-1 and the RNA-binding protein rbm-42 as key regulators of dendrite regeneration, where idr-1 functions upstream of rbm-42. We further show that ced-7, one of the core components of the phagocytosis pathway, acting downstream of rbm-42, while other components of this pathway don't play significant roles in dendrite regeneration. In addition, we demonstrate that upon injury IDR-1 can promote RBM-42 nuclear export following injury, enabling its dendritic localization. RBM-42, in turn, promotes the translation of ced-7 and facilitates microtubule assembly. In conclusion, our findings define a novel conserved signaling cascade coupling injury-induced nuclear export of RNA binding proteins to local regulation and dendrite regeneration, providing new mechanistic insight into neuronal repair.

">Tau oligomers can occur in human brains within days of a single traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD), yet the early molecular events linking the two remain unclear. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a hallmark of AD, are observed in individuals with a history of single or repetitive head injury. Animal studies show that tau oligomers, the toxic species preceding the NFTs, appear shortly after TBI, but corresponding human data are lacking. Here, we investigated tau changes in the brains of individuals who died shortly after TBI compared to those surviving long-term. We report abnormal tau oligomers in the brain of short-term survivors whereas NFTs were the main feature in long-term survivors. These findings support a model where TBI triggers early tau oligomers formation that spread through a prion-like mechanism, seeding tau pathology and contributing to late-onset AD. The novel identification of tau oligomers in acute TBI reveals potential early disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets for AD prevention.

">Fast and Easy Whole-Brain Network Model Parameter Estimation with Automatic Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Personalized brain modeling at clinically relevant scales requires integrating biophysical models with empirical neuroimaging data, yet high-dimensional parameter estimation in whole-brain network models remains computationally prohibitive. We present TVB-Optim, an open-source Python library providing a general and extensible framework for gradient-based optimization of brain network models build on JAX. Leveraging automatic differentiation, we demonstrate direct optimization of thousands of parameters, from global coupling (N=2) to regional dynamics (N=168) to full structural connectivity matrices (N=14,028), across functional MRI and magnetoencephalography data. Forward simulations achieve 10x CPU speedup over reference implementations and scale efficiently to GPU and multi-device configurations. We establish best practices through documented workflows that combine coarse parameter space exploration with gradient refinement, often yielding superior solutions faster than gradient methods alone. By bridging mechanistic neuroscience with modern machine learning infrastructure, TVB-Optim enables large-scale personalized brain models, bringing computational neuroscience closer to clinical translation.

">Scopolamine induced learning deficit in marmosets</a></h4>

              
                In monkeys, the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine is known to broadly disrupt learned behaviors, though the precise nature of the cognitive deficits has been questioned. Experimentally observable deficits in memory can be ascribed to poor attentional focusing, human interference as well as age, sex, and dosing regimen. Stress and social isolation can also play a role during behavioral testing, particularly in small nonhuman social primates like marmosets that have been used widely. In this study, we examine the effects of scopolamine in marmosets under conditions of reduced stress, attentional distraction, and human interference. Using a custom designed home-cage touchscreen-based testing system, we investigated the influence of scopolamine on the performance on a visual associative learning task. During self-paced, voluntary testing, monkeys learned to discriminate pairs of complex visual patterns through trial and error by touching the stimulus associated with reward. Using this approach, we demonstrated over 75% discrimination accuracy in the eight marmosets tested (male and female) within three days of home-cage testing. Although the averaged data revealed no impact of acute or chronic scopolamine injections on learning, modeling the choice data with trial-level analysis revealed both age- and sex-specific deficits. The results demonstrate the value of home-cage testing combined with trial-level analysis to reveal subtle behavioral changes, such as those brought about by scopolamine.

">Opioid receptor distribution in the claustrum-dorsal endopiriform complex</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum and dorsal endopiriform regions form a thin subcortical sheet reciprocally connected to the neocortex that is enriched in opioid receptors. The precise cellular distribution of opioid receptors within this region remains unclear. Using multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) and hierarchical cluster analysis, we mapped the expression of mu (Oprm), delta (Oprd), kappa (Oprk), and ORL1 (Oprl) opioid receptor genes at single-cell resolution in the mouse claustrum-dorsal endopiriform. Among 2,269 neurons analyzed, six transcriptional clusters were identified: three excitatory (CLA, CLA/OPRK, cortical excitatory) and three inhibitory (SST, PVALB, broad inhibitory). Oprk expression was uniquely restricted to excitatory claustrum neurons and particularly enriched in the CLA/OPRK cluster which was comprised largely of Synpr+ claustrum core projection cells. In contrast, Oprd, Oprm, and Oprl genes were more broadly distributed across both excitatory and inhibitory populations, with Oprd enriched in parvalbumin (Pvalb) inhibitory neurons and Oprl in somatostatin (Sst) inhibitory neurons. Spatial mapping confirmed that Oprk expressing cells were concentrated within the claustrum core, whereas other receptor subtypes extended across the entire claustrum and into adjacent cortical regions. A comparable distribution of opioid receptors was observed in the neighbouring dorsal endopiriform. Analysis of a publicly available single cell sequencing dataset of the macaque claustrum also revealed a similar receptor distribution, where Oprk expression was enriched within a subset of excitatory projection neurons, and Oprm,Oprd, and Oprl expressed widely in both inhibitory and excitatory cells. Together, these findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved, cell-type-specific organization of opioid receptor expression in the claustrum-dorsal endopiriform. These results indicate that kappa opioid receptor expression is a defining molecular feature of excitatory claustrum projection neurons and suggest distinct roles for other opioid receptors in modulating inhibitory and cortical circuits.

                Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are central to cortical network stability and psychiatric vulnerability. Here, we identify DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) as a key epigenetic regulator linking PV interneuron function to glial and extracellular matrix remodeling. Conditional PV-specific Dnmt1 deletion combined with single-cell RNA-seq, in vivo electrophysiology, histology, and behavioral analyses revealed that loss of DNMT1 increases PV spiking activity but reduces inhibitory efficacy, leading to network desynchronization and depression- and anxiety-like behavior in mice. These physiological alterations were accompanied by broad, non-cell-autonomous transcriptional changes in astrocytes and oligodendroglial populations, prominently affecting pathways involved in perineuronal-net (PNN) organization and neuron-glia communication. Cell-cell interaction analyses revealed disrupted NRXN-NLGN, TNR-integrin, and semaphoring signaling, consistent with weakened perisomatic adhesion and PNN integrity. Together, our findings demonstrate that DNMT1 maintains inhibitory circuit stability through cell-autonomous regulation of PV interneuron function, which secondarily shapes glial transcriptional states and extracellular scaffolds to preserve cortical network synchronization and emotional behavior.

                Biallelic AAGGG expansions in RFC1 are associated with CANVAS and are increasingly recognised as a cause of adult-onset ataxia and sensory neuropathy. However, the disease-causing mechanisms remain unclear. Here we leveraged in vitro assays, post-mortem brain tissue, patient-derived cell lines and a neuronal RFC1 Drosophila model to demonstrate that AAGGG expansions are associated with tissue-specific reductions in the expression of RFC1 transcript, along with impaired RFC1 function and increased sensitivity to DNA damage from platin drugs. CRISPR/Cas9 excision of the AAGGG repeat and flanking AluSx3 element normalized RFC1 expression in iPSC neurons and rescued the DNA damage response, providing a framework for future therapeutic strategies. We also show that these biological findings are clinically relevant in heterozygous AAGGG expansion carriers, who display an increased risk and severity of neuropathy with platinum-based chemotherapy.

">Nrg1 regulates cortical wiring and motor recovery upon traumatic injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability, yet molecular mechanisms supporting cortical repair remain poorly defined. While Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) is essential for cortical development, its role in traumatic cortical injury in adults is unclear. To circumvent developmental confounds, we used an inducible conditional Nrg1 knockout in the adult mouse and subjected it to controlled cortical damage (CCD) in the motor cortex. We combined high-resolution adeno-associated viral tracing of callosal projections with comprehensive behavioral, histological, and molecular analyses. Nrg1 deletion led to significant impairments in structural connectivity and long-term motor recovery, which were markedly exacerbated in aged mice, indicating a critical role for Nrg1 in adult cortical repair. Mechanistically, our data indicated that Nrg1 promoted this plasticity through its intracellular domain (ICD) signaling, acting cell-autonomously to enhance axonal outgrowth. Furthermore, loss of Nrg1 was associated with altered structure of perineuronal-nets (PNN) and increased neuroinflammation at the lesion site. Our findings identify endogenous Nrg1 as a key regulator of structural preservation and functional recovery, highlighting the Nrg1 signaling as a potential target to enhance cortical plasticity after trauma.

">A painless nerve growth factor variant uncouples nociceptive and neurotrophic TrkA signaling</a></h4>

              
                Nerve growth factor (NGF) binding to the receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA, drives neurotrophic signaling essential for neuronal development and survival. This interaction simultaneously drives peripheral pain, making this pathway an attractive but complicated therapeutic target for chronic pain. By integrating single-molecule microscopy, structural and electrophysiology analyses, with a human NGF variant, NGFpainless, which retains neurotrophic effects but abolishes pain, we delineate the molecular mechanisms that bias TrkA signaling towards neurotrophic functions without triggering nociception. We show that, unlike wild-type NGF, NGFpainless fails to sensitize TRPV1 channels to capsaicin, thus disengaging TrkA from the nociceptive pathway. We further show that this selective loss of nociceptive TrkA signaling by NGFpainless results from its reduced ability to activate PLC{gamma}1 and trigger calcium release compared to NGF, while still preserving the ERK and AKT signaling essential for neurotrophic functions. This biased signaling arises from reduced electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless complex interface, which shortens the lifetime of this functional complex on native membranes. Mutations in TrkA that restore the electrostatic complementarity at the TrkA:NGFpainless interface eliminate biased signaling. This mechanistic understanding of TrkA binding by NGFpainless, and how it differs from NGF, will spur the development of two therapeutic classes of molecules - one that selectively suppresses nociceptive signaling while preserving neurotrophic functions in chronic pain, and another that enhances neurotrophic activity without evoking peripheral pain in neurodegenerative conditions.

">Local differences in baseline sodium shape astrocytic potassium uptake by the NKA</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are vital for the maintenance of ion and transmitter homeostasis in the extracellular space, with the inward Na gradient playing a pivotal role in these processes. Earlier studies not only reported a low baseline Na+ concentration ([Na+]) in astrocytes, but also suggested an equilibration of [Na+] within the gap-junction-coupled syncytium. This is consistent with the view that the basic homeostatic properties of astrocytes are largely identical due to their critical role in brain function. Here, we used multi-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging for a quantitative determination of astrocytic [Na+] in mouse forebrain tissue slices and in vivo. Contrary to the prevailing notion of a rather uniform Na distribution, we detected a previously unobserved subcellular and cellular heterogeneity in astrocytic [Na+], accompanied by differences in the capacity for Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA)-mediated uptake of extracellular K+. Biophysical modelling showed that this heterogeneity can be replicated by the reported differential expression of NKA isoforms in astrocytes together with a different strength of Na+ influx over the plasma membranes. Altogether, our results thus suggest the existence of functionally distinct astrocytes and astrocyte subdomains in which Na+ homeostasis is locally adapted to the specific requirements of surrounding neural networks.

                Parkinsons disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, is characterised by pervasive deposition of alpha-synuclein (-Syn) aggregates and the death of dopaminergic neurons. Fc gamma receptor IIb (Fc{gamma}RIIb or CD32b), the sole inhibitory Fc{gamma}R in humans (h) and mice (m), serves as a molecular conduit for intercellular -Syn transmission in-vitro. Here, we demonstrate that Fc{gamma}RIIb facilitates -Syn propagation and neurotoxicity in-vivo using the pre-formed fibril (PFF) -Syn model in mice. Genetic ablation of mFc{gamma}RII attenuated PFF -Syn-induced Lewy pathology, dampened associated neuroinflammatory responses, and preserved nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of hFc{gamma}RIIb using clinically-related monoclonal antibodies mitigated acute-phase -Syn pathology in hFc{gamma}RIIb-transgenic mice following PFF challenge. Collectively, our results indicate that Fc{gamma}RIIb is a mediator of -Syn propagation in-vivo and highlight it as a tractable therapeutic target against -synucleinopathies like PD.

                Understanding how the brain represents information is a central challenge in neuroscience and a practical bottleneck for brain-computer interfaces. Existing analytical tools cannot identify neural representations directly from neural activity data. We introduce MultiPEC, a data-driven method that discovers neural representations by quantifying how sets of signals jointly reduce context prediction error. Applied to artificial neural networks, MultiPEC uncovered class-specific subnetworks whose targeted ablation disproportionately impaired performance, demonstrating their causal role in feature recognition. Applied to EEG recordings from 24 participants, MultiPEC revealed functional signatures of auditory and visual processing. Classification analyses showed that MultiPEC captured fine-grained stimulus submodalities (levels of stimulus meaningfulness) more effectively than broad stimulus domains, highlighting the context-sensitive nature of neural representations. Together, these results establish MultiPEC as a scalable approach for identifying data driven (natural) representations in both biological and artificial systems, with potential applications in adaptive neurotechnology, clinical diagnostics and cognitive neuroscience.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social interaction. While most assessments of ASD remain individual-centric, dyad-level evaluation may reveal features not apparent in individual profiling. We examined dyadic coordination in a non-human primate ASD model under experimentally controlled yet naturalistic conditions. Markerless pose estimation was used to quantify frame-by-frame gaze behavior and inter-individual distance during first encounters between unfamiliar common marmosets. Dyads with a prenatal valproic acid-exposed animal and an unexposed partner (VPA-UE) were compared with unexposed controls (UE-UE). VPA-UE pairs showed a higher proportion and greater number of mutual gaze episodes, whereas overall gaze shift was similar across groups. VPA marmosets made fewer unreciprocated looks; however, when the partner looked at them, they more often returned the look within 1 s, indicating heightened gaze reactivity. VPA-UE dyads maintained shorter inter-individual distances, and the closer proximity destabilized mutual gaze more strongly than in UE-UE dyads. These findings indicate a distinct dyadic-coordination pattern in VPA-UE pairs: rapid responsiveness combined with reduced tolerance for close spacing, consistent with distance-dependent differences rather than a global deficit in social motivation. This dyad-centric markerless framework provides scalable, ecologically grounded measures and intervention targets that leverage intact responsiveness while accommodating altered spatial coordination.

">Brain endothelial PRMT5-ANGPTL4 axis regulates cerebellar inhibitory synaptogenesis and motor coordination</a></h4>

              
                Brain vasculature is essential for central nervous system function, but its specific roles in synaptic development and motor function regulation are poorly understood. In this study, we identify a cerebrovascular signaling axis wherein endothelial PRMT5 critically regulates inhibitory synaptogenesis and motor coordination. Cerebrovascular-speci[fi]c deletion of Prmt5 gene leads to excessive inhibitory synaptic input onto Purkinje cells and progressive motor deficits in mice. Mechanistically, PRMT5 deficiency epigenetically upregulates the expression of the secreted factor ANGPTL4 through reduced symmetric dimethylation of H3R8 and H4R3, along with increased H3K9 acetylation at the Angptl4 promoter, thereby driving excessive inhibitory synaptogenesis onto Purkinje cells. Importantly, Angptl4 deletion in brain endothelium normalizes inhibitory synaptic input onto Purkinje cells and restores motor coordination in PRMT5-deficient mice. Together, these findings define the endothelial PRMT5-ANGPTL4 axis as a key regulator of cerebellar inhibitory circuitry and motor function, highlighting cerebrovascular mechanisms as potential therapeutic targets for motor coordination disorders.

">Cognitive and brain function enhancement in Gen X group after personalized, AI supervised EEG-neurofeedback training</a></h4>

              
                Background: Interventions supporting medical care and enhancing quality of life in neurodegenerative or age-related cognitive decline are strongly needed. Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback can enable users to modulate their brain activity through real-time feedback. However, evidence for its clinical effectiveness remains inconclusive, partly due to limited personalization and insufficient task relevance in existing protocols. Objective: We tested whether personalized EEG neurofeedback supervised by deep neural networks (DNNs) can enhance cognitive performance in older adults. Methods: Fifty-seven healthy adults aged 41 to 64 (31 women), including a sham-feedback control group, completed a personalized neurofeedback protocol with DNNs fine-tuned to individual EEG patterns. The procedure included pre- and post-training assessments using a transitive reasoning task, three diagnostic sessions to adapt the DNN to each participant, and 10 neurofeedback sessions based on a gamified delayed-match-to-sample paradigm. Results: The training group showed robust gains across all three variants of the reasoning task (each p < .01), whereas the sham group improved only on the easiest variant. Groups did not differ at pretest; however, at posttest the training group outperformed the sham group on all task conditions (each p < .03), showing also a larger neural effort (lower alpha band power) and increased beta and gamma band connectivity (higher phase lag index). Conclusion: Personalized, task-oriented neurofeedback guided by individually fine-tuned DNNs can produce cognitive enhancement after relatively few sessions. The proposed Task-Pretrained, Subject-Finetuned Neurofeedback (TPSF-NF) framework is scalable to other cognitive domains in future research.

">Explainable 3D CNNs link regional and network level disruption in early Parkinson's MRIs to symptom progression</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population over 65. Clinical diagnosis typically depends on tracking gradually developing motor symptoms as the disease progresses, underscoring the need for early detection methods to aid intervention while symptoms are still minor. Inexpensive and widely available imaging modalities such as T1-weighted MRI (T1w MRI) have potential for early PD diagnosis but lack established systematic biomarkers of PD pathology. In this study, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) was trained on 100 predominately early-state PD and 100 control T1w MRIs from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), achieving a classification accuracy of 84.5%. Misclassified subjects were majority unmedicated and particularly early PD (< 3 years since first symptoms). To interrogate the biological basis behind the model's decisions, novel explainability methods were applied to generate regional saliency maps from both PD and control classifications. Regional saliency across subjects correlated best with cognitive and motor scores in nigrostriatal and other subcortical regions, as well as in temporal and insular cortices, indicating changes in these areas were best connected with symptom progression. The model was also sensitive to changes in the left frontal cortex across many subjects, which exhibited the greatest raw saliency magnitude. Pairwise saliency correlation was most pronounced between areas within the same functional network, suggesting the CNN was sensitive to network level changes in structural MRI. These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable 3D CNNs to identify network and regional biomarkers of early PD from T1w MRI.

                Background Heart failure (HF) is progressive, with high morbidity and mortality. Salivary biomarkers are being explored as non-invasive tools for HF monitoring. This study examined salivary NT-proBNP and hs-cTn alongside serum levels to distinguish HF patients from healthy controls and to assess diagnostic potential and cross-matrix concordance. Method In a two-center, prospective case-control study (Nov 2024–Apr 2025), 100 HF patients and 100 healthy controls were enrolled. HF diagnoses followed European Society of Cardiology criteria, supported by labs and echocardiography. Serum and saliva NT-proBNP and hs-cTn were measured using sandwich ELISA kits. Results Heart failure patients had higher serum NT-proBNP (317.71 ± 18.16 ng/L) and saliva NT-proBNP (24.54 ± 1.27 ng/L) than controls (88.86 ± 6.26 ng/L; 17.93 ± 0.86 ng/L; both p < 0.001). Serum hs-cTn tended to be higher in HF (93.39 ± 7.15 pg/mL) vs controls (75.48 ± 6.68 pg/mL; p = 0.070); saliva hs-cTn was significantly higher in HF (24.58 ± 4.37 pg/mL) than controls (6.97 ± 0.94 pg/mL; p < 0.001). Saliva NT-proBNP correlated moderately with serum NT-proBNP (r = 0.317; p = 0.003). ROC analysis: serum NT-proBNP showed excellent discrimination (AUC 0.97; 95% CI 0.94–1.00; p < 0.001). Saliva NT-proBNP showed good discrimination (AUC 0.77; 95% CI 0.67–0.87; p < 0.001). Serum hs-cTn had modest discrimination (AUC 0.60; 95% CI 0.48–0.73; p = 0.080), while saliva hs-cTn showed strong discrimination (AUC 0.88; 95% CI 0.82–0.95; p < 0.001). Saliva creatinine and uric acid correlated with serum markers, supporting saliva’s reflection of systemic status. Conclusion Saliva NT-proBNP and hs-cTn show diagnostic potential and concordance with serum measurements, suggesting saliva could complement serum tests for non-invasive HF monitoring. Serum NT-proBNP remained the strongest discriminator. Standardization and cross-population validation are needed, but saliva offers a practical adjunct when venipuncture is undesirable.

                Little is known about the success of alcohol reduction attempts made outside of an experimental setting, and the association between brief alcohol interventions and other evidence-based support and the success of these attempts. This study aimed to answer these questions among risky drinkers using observational data (baseline and 6-month follow-up surveys) from England between 2014 and 2016 (n=3,129). Around one third (31.4%, 95% CI=29.8-33.0) of risky drinkers reported making an alcohol reduction attempt between baseline and 6-month follow-up. Of those making an attempt, nearly two-thirds (64.1%, 95% CI=61.1-67.1) self-reported their attempt was successful. Those who received a brief alcohol intervention in primary care were 3-times more likely to report their attempt was successful (ORadj=3.01, 95% CI=1.87-4.82). No association was detected between using evidence-based support during an attempt and self-reported success (ORadj=0.87, 95% CI=0.47-1.66). A different pattern of results was found when using AUDIT score at 6-month follow-up (adjusted for baseline) as the outcome: receiving (vs. not receiving) a brief alcohol intervention in primary care (Badj=3.56, 95% CI=2.78-4.35) and using (vs. not using) evidence-based support during an alcohol reduction attempt (Badj=1.89, 95% CI=0.72-3.06) was associated with higher AUDIT scores. These findings were not robust to sensitivity analyses, highlighting the importance of using measures focused on more recent alcohol consumption in this type of study design. Further research is needed to unpick these findings and to capture the potential heterogeneity in goals for alcohol reduction attempts.

                Background Mortality rates after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain higher in resource-limited areas compared to developed countries. In low-income settings, children often begin ART with higher viral loads and lower CD4 counts. Ethiopia’s national ART guidelines, introduced in 2014 based on WHO recommendations, advocate for universal ART for children to reduce mortality and improve health outcomes. However, there is limited data on mortality rates and their predictors since these guidelines were implemented. Therefore, this study was aimed to figure out these issues. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 612 children undergoing ART in Comprehensive Specialized Hospitals in the Amhara region of Ethiopia from January 1, 2015, to December 30, 2024. Participants were selected through simple random sampling. Data were processed using EPi Info 7 and analyzed in STATA-17, employing actuarial life table analysis to estimate mortality rates and Kaplan-Meier analysis for comparing time to death across groups. Cox proportional-hazard regression was applied to identify mortality predictors, using a significance level of P < 0.05. Results Of 602 included children initiated on ART during the follow-up period, 45(7.5%) died. The overall median (IQR) follow-up time was 47 (26-60) months. The overall death rate was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.6-2.8) per 100 person-years of follow-up. The predictors of mortality among children initiated ART were; Baseline CD4 count below the threshold [AHR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2-5.8], opportunistic infections [AHR: 3.7; 95% CI: 1.7-7.9], Poor adherence to treatment [AHR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.4-5.7] and child caregiver with no formal education [AHR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.1-11.6]. Conclusion The observed mortality rate exceeded the expected rate of under 5%. Key factors for higher mortality include low baseline CD4 counts, opportunistic infections, poor treatment adherence, and uneducated caregivers. Enhancing caregiver education, early detection of infections, and prompt ART initiation can help reduce mortality in these children.

                Background Chemicals can perturb gene functions to affect chronic human diseases, and a significant amount of biological knowledge involved in environmental health is available in public databases. Combining information across resources can assist in the discovery of novel testable hypotheses related to how chemical exposures influence human diseases, such as autism. Methods The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public resource that provides curated content for chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases, and exposures. The AOP-Wiki is a repository of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) that provide defined biological frameworks describing disease processes. Here, we intersect CTD toxicogenomic content with the AOP-Wiki to identify environmental chemicals that could potentially modulate key steps in autism. Results We identify numerous chemical stressors that intersect with the individual events of the autism AOP, including bisphenol compounds, per/polyfluoroalkyl substances, pesticides, metals, and air pollutants, suggesting a wide range of environmental factors that could synergize to potentially affect autism. By integrating additional CTD curated content for three autism-associated chemicals (bisphenol A, particulate matter, and valproic acid), we discover other mechanisms, including specific genes (e.g., SLC1A1, GSTP1, CNTNAP2) and phenotypes (e.g., lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, social behavior) that can be used to help refine or expand this AOP or create an entirely new pathway for autism. Furthermore, related diseases are identified to build interconnected networks, mechanistically linking autism to fatty liver disease, intellectual disability, and cancer. Conclusions We demonstrate the value of integrating content from different resources to address environmental health questions related to autism etiology and co-morbidities. Importantly, our methodology is easily adapted for any AOP in the AOP-Wiki to identify potential environmental influences on the disease process and help support or refine AOPs. This analysis underscores the importance of standardizing public databases to make them efficiently interoperable for enhanced shared utility across the numerous bioknowledge digital landscapes.

                Introduction Early-onset neonatal bacterial infections (EONBI) are a major public health issue, causing significant neonatal mortality, especially in preterm infants. The clinical diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, while the bacteriological profile is shifting with increasing multidrug-resistant strains. Objective This study aimed to analyze microbiological data from EONBI cases and identify predictive factors for infections caused by resistant pathogens. Methods A retrospective study was conducted from January 2022 to December 2023 at the neonatal unit of Habib Bougatfa Maternity Center, Tunisia. Newborns with microbiologically confirmed EONBI within 48 hours of admission were included. Maternal and neonatal data were collected and analyzed, with antibiotic resistance determined by antibiogram results. Results Among 5,342 live births, 135 EONBI cases were confirmed (incidence: 25.27 per 1,000 live births). Gram-negative bacilli predominated (96.3%), notably Serratia marcescens (37.78%) and Escherichia coli (27.41%). Resistant pathogens were present in 46.66% of cases. Significant predictive factors for resistance included positive maternal screening for resistant bacteria, third trimester hospitalization, and other maternal infections. Resistant EONBI cases required longer antibiotic courses and hospital stays and were more frequently linked to complications. Conclusion The high prevalence of resistant bacterial strains in EONBI underscores the need for enhanced maternal screening and tailored antibiotic protocols to improve neonatal outcomes.

                Background The surge in non-performing loans (NPLs) critically threatens the stability of commercial banks, especially in developing economies. Corporate governance is widely seen as a key mitigating factor. However, the specific mechanisms and causal pathways through which governance attributes such as shareholders’ rights influence NPL levels remain inadequately understood, particularly within the unique institutional context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods This investigation employed a cross-sectional, mixed-methods design focusing on commercial banks in Western Uganda. Quantitative data were collected from 195 bank employees and board members using structured questionnaires, with participants selected via stratified, purposive, and simple random sampling techniques. This data was analyzed with SPSS version 28, applying descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and simple linear regression. Concurrently, qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with six senior bank officials and analyzed thematically using NVivo software to provide contextual depth and nuance. Results The quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant, strong positive relationship between board accountability and the reduction of NPLs (r = .779, p < .05). In contrast, a significant positive relationship was also found between shareholders’ rights and the perceived level of NPLs (β = .718, p < .05), suggesting a complex and potentially counterproductive role. Qualitative findings triangulated these results, identifying two key mechanisms: the reduction of improper board interference in loan approval processes and proactive board engagement in NPL resolution. Conclusions The study concludes that robust shareholders’ right is a critical determinant for mitigating NPLs, whereas the effect of shareholders’ rights is ambiguous and potentially negative. A well-functioning, accountable board that aligns management actions with long-term bank stability is paramount. The findings underscore the necessity of implementing holistic governance reforms that balance empowered shareholders with strong ethical safeguards to ensure prudent credit risk management.

Burst firing is an important property of neuronal activity, thought to enhance sensory encoding. While previous studies show significant differences in burst firing between <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> conditions, how burst firing contributes to neural coding <i>in vivo</i> and how it is modulated by underlying biophysical mechanisms when neurons are under active synaptic bombardments remains poorly understood. Here, we combined intracellular recordings and computational modeling to investigate how cellular and synaptic mechanisms can explain the <i>in vivo</i> firing activity of electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal cells in <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>. We developed a biophysically detailed compartmental model incorporating voltage-gated currents, NMDA receptor-mediated calcium (Ca<sup>2 + </sup>) influx, Ca<sup>2 + </sup>-activated SK channels, Ca<sup>2 + </sup> mobilization, and stochastic synaptic inputs to reproduce <i>in vivo</i> firing activities of ELL pyramidal cells. Specifically, using bifurcation analysis, we identified dynamical transitions between quiescent, tonic, and bursting regimes, governed by interactions among SK conductance, NMDA receptor activation, and applied current. Model parameters were optimized against <i>in vivo</i> data, accurately reproducing action potential waveforms and temporal dynamics, including characteristic bimodal interspike interval distributions reflecting intra- and inter-burst intervals. We further developed a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model incorporating dual adaptation variables and stochastic noise. This simplified phenomenological model successfully captured burst firing comparable to that observed in the biophysical model and recorded data, while replicating diverse firing patterns observed across the population. Finally, parameter sensitivity analysis revealed slow adaptation dynamics and noise intensity as key determinants of spiking variability within cells. Overall, our modeling results demonstrate that <i>in vivo</i> bursting arises from synergistic interactions between intrinsic conductances (e.g., NMDA-SK coupling), Ca<sup>2 + </sup> mobilization, and synaptic stochasticity, offering a potential reconciliation for discrepancies with <i>in vitro</i> firing activity. The models provide mechanistic insights into how background synaptic activity modulates burst firing.

In high-dimensional gene co-expression network analysis, capturing the temporal changes of gene associations is crucial for unveiling dynamic regulatory mechanisms inherent in biological systems. Examining how these interactions change over time offers valuable insights into the developmental and adaptive processes that drive an organism’s lifecycle. Moreover, incorporating structural prior information can substantially enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the estimated sparse dynamic gene network. Methods previously proposed in the literature cannot simultaneously model sparse time-varying co-expression network structure and have the power-law degree distribution. Additionally, there is a demand of time-efficient, memory-light software implementations and possibility to utilize repeated measures at each time-point (if available). In this paper, we introduce the time-varying scale-free graphical lasso (tvsfglasso), a novel scalable framework for estimating high-dimensional time-varying gene co-expression networks under the assumption that these networks simultaneously exhibit sparse and a scale-free structure. We utilize fast algorithms developed for the graphical lasso (glasso), which makes tvsfglasso a scalable tool for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate the performance of tvsfglasso using both simulated and real-world dynamic gene expression time series datasets, demonstrating its capability to detect temporal changes in gene associations. Our results highlight the potential of tvsfglasso to advance the understanding of dynamic gene networks, making this estimator useful for more accurate modeling of complex biological processes.

                <p>by Ari E. Kahn, Dani S. Bassett, Nathaniel D. Daw</p>

Decisions in humans and other organisms depend, in part, on learning and using models that capture the statistical structure of the world, including the long-run expected outcomes of our actions. One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD(λ>0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD(<i>λ</i>) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD(<i>λ</i>) alongside an additional predictive model of recency. The relatively large <i>λ</i> we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions.

Physics-based simulation generate movement patterns based on a neuro-musculoskeletal model without relying on experimental movement data, offering a powerful approach to study how neuro-musculoskeletal properties shape locomotion. Yet, simulated gait patterns and metabolic powers do not always agree with experiments, pointing to modeling errors reflecting gaps in our understanding. Here, we systematically evaluated the predictive capability of simulations based on a 3D musculoskeletal model to predict gait mechanics, muscle activity, and metabolic power across gait conditions. We simulated the effect of adding mass to body segments, variations in walking speed, inclined walking, and crouched walking. We chose tasks that are relatively straightforward to model to limit the contribution of errors in modeling the task to prediction errors. The simulations predicted stride frequency and walking kinematics with reasonable accuracy but underestimated variation in metabolic power across conditions. In particular, simulations underestimated changes in metabolic power with respect to level walking in tasks requiring substantial positive mechanical work, such as incline walking (27% underestimation). We identified two possible errors in simulated metabolic power. First, the phenomenological metabolic power model produced high maximal mechanical efficiency (average 0.58) during concentric contractions, compared to the observed 0.2–0.3 in laboratory experiments. Second, when we multiplied the mechanical work with more realistic estimates of mechanical efficiency (i.e., 0.25), simulations overestimated the metabolic power by 84%. This suggests that positive work by muscle fibers was overestimated in the simulations. This overestimation may be caused by several assumptions and errors in (the parameters of) the musculoskeletal model including its interaction with the environment or in the cost function. This study highlights the need for more accurate models of musculoskeletal mechanics, energetics, passive elastic structures, and neural control (e.g., optimality criteria) to improve the realism of human movement simulations. Validating simulations across a broad range of conditions is important to pinpoint shortcomings in model-based simulations.

Down syndrome, caused by an extra copy of Chromosome 21, causes lifelong problems. One of the most common phenotypes among people with Down syndrome is premature aging, including early tissue decline, neurodegeneration, and shortened life span. Yet the reasons for premature systemic aging are a mystery and difficult to study in humans. Here we show that chromosome amplification in wild yeast also produces premature aging and shortens life span. Chromosome duplication disrupts nutrient-induced cell-cycle arrest, entry into quiescence, and cellular health during chronological aging, across genetic background and independent of which chromosome is amplified. Using a genomic screen, we discovered that these defects are due in part to aneuploidy-induced dysfunction in Ribosome Quality Control (RQC). We show that aneuploids entering quiescence display aberrant ribosome profiles, accumulate RQC intermediates, and harbor an increased load of protein aggregates compared to euploid cells. Although they maintain proteasome activity, aneuploids also show signs of ubiquitin dysregulation and sequestration into foci. Remarkably, inducing ribosome stalling in euploids produces similar aging phenotypes, while up-regulating limiting RQC subunits or poly-ubiquitin alleviates many of the aneuploid defects. We propose that the increased translational load caused by having too many mRNAs accelerates a decline in translational fidelity, contributing to premature aging.

Single-cell (SC) sequencing enables detailed characterization of transcriptional heterogeneity but lacks spatial context, while spatial transcriptomics (ST) preserves tissue organization yet is limited by resolution and incomplete gene capture. To bridge these gaps, we developed Cell2Spatial, a computational framework that segments spatial spots at single-cell resolution, even when SC and ST datasets are not fully matched in cell types. The method integrates information-theoretic gene selection, spatially weighted likelihood modeling, and spatial hotspot detection to improve signal fidelity. A corrected saturation model calibrates library size against gene complexity, ensuring accurate cell count estimation in low-resolution ST. To enhance scalability and spatial coherence, Cell2Spatial incorporates neural-network-guided clustering and a cost-minimizing assignment algorithm that balances transcriptional similarity with spatial proximity. Evaluations on synthetic data demonstrated that Cell2Spatial consistently outperforms existing tools in reconstructing tissue architectures and cellular compositions, with particular strength in handling unmatched datasets. Applications to 10× Visium data across mouse brain, human thymus, mouse kidney, and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex revealed detailed anatomical structures and developmental trajectories. Moreover, for high-resolution platforms including Xenium In Situ, Visium HD, and Slide-seqV2, Cell2Spatial remained robust despite reduced transcript capture, effectively delineating fine-scale spatial patterns in complex tissues. Collectively, these results highlight Cell2Spatial as a versatile framework that expands the analytical scope of ST and provides a powerful tool for uncovering the spatial organization of cellular function and tissue architecture.

                Entrepreneurship worldwide faces persistent challenges such as unequal access to resources, institutional disparities, and inconsistent policy frameworks. Higher education institutions (HEIs) face the critical challenge of fostering sustainable entrepreneurial intentions among students, particularly in developing economies where institutional and resource constraints limit entrepreneurship’s potential to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study investigates the influence of universities, sustainable business values, and key antecedents of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) on sustainable entrepreneurial intentions among students in Indian higher education institutions. Employing a cross-sectional design, data were gathered through a structured questionnaire administered to students enrolled in entrepreneurship education programs. The analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to explore path relationships and test the hypothesized model. This study provides a theoretical contribution to the field of sustainable entrepreneurship education and sustainable entrepreneurial intention by offering valuable insights into the impact of behavioral factors on EI development among students in higher education institutions. These insights emphasize the need for integrating comprehensive, sustainability-focused content into entrepreneurship curricula to equip future entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills essential for addressing environmental, social, and economic challenges. The practical implications of this research are twofold. First, it provides universities and policymakers with actionable insights to design and implement more effective and sustainability-centered entrepreneurship programs. Second, by fostering sustainable entrepreneurial mindsets, the study contributes to the promotion of responsible business practices and the stimulation of new venture creation, thereby supporting broader economic development goals in emerging economies.

                Background Sustainable Entrepreneurship (SE) has grown as an emerging theory from the conceptual roots of entrepreneurship and sustainability. While its relevance is increasingly acknowledged in both scholarship and practice, SE remains theoretically young, particularly in how it accounts for the real-world emergence of SE ventures across diverse and underrepresented contexts. This study addresses that gap through a qualitative multiple-case analysis of hydroponic ventures in the urban agriculture sector of Jakarta Metropolitan Area (Jabodetabek), Indonesia. Methods Guided by a constructivist paradigm, we collected data through in-depth interviews, field observations, and document analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted across four analytical levels: individual, process, firm, and contextual environment. Results This study identifies eight key themes that reflect the ‘how’ and ‘why’ SE emerges in the lived experiences of the hydroponic entrepreneurs. Engagement with existing theories leads to three conceptual propositions that contribute to a grounded understanding of SE emergence. Our findings reveal an alternative path to SE that departs from the intention-led models dominant in the extant literature. Rather than beginning with strategic sustainability goals for the broader society, SE in these cases is triggered by personally meaningful concerns and evolves through insurgent, organic growth, and effectuation logic. Conclusion Based on these insights, we develop a multi-level pathway model that illustrates two SE emergence pathways, whether intentional or reflexive. We offer an alternative to prevailing models that assume predefined sustainable entrepreneurial intention.

<p>Visceral and somatic motor neurons (MNs) of the lumbosacral (L6–S1) spinal cord control the genitourinary organs and pelvic striated muscles. We produced a three-dimensional (3D) MN atlas of the lumbosacral spinal cord using whole-mount immunostaining, tissue clearing, and advanced 3D microscopy in male and female rats. In so doing, we identified novel axon projections and sexually dimorphic features of MN populations, in addition to providing a definitive online open-access resource for 3D visualization of visceral and somatic MNs within intact lumbosacral cord.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The sexually dimorphic genitourinary organs and specialized striated muscles in the pelvis are controlled by a spinal cord motor neuron (MN) subsystem that produces reflexogenic and psychogenic (conscious) visceral and somatic motor activity during urinary continence and voiding, scent marking (in some species), defecation, reproduction, and sexual activity. To produce a three-dimensional (3D) atlas of the pelvic MN system, we performed whole-mount immunostaining and advanced 3D microscopy on the caudal spinal cord of adult female and male rats. We used choline acetyltransferase immunolabeling to study the macroscopic topology of visceral (autonomic preganglionic; VMN) and somatic MN (SMN) subcolumns and retrograde neural tracing from major pelvic ganglia to locate preganglionic neurons required for pelvic organ regulation. This identified parasympathetic VMNs in the sacral intermediolateral nucleus of segments L6–S1 and pelvic sympathetic preganglionic neurons that were mostly found in the medial dorsal commissural nucleus of segments L1–L2. Retrogradely labeled SMNs were also identified in lumbosacral nuclei containing the urinary rhabdosphincter, cremaster, and levator ani motor pools, suggesting that pelvic MNs project through both the pelvic and pudendal nerves. Evidence of sexual dimorphism was provided by VMN counts and measurements of their dendritic arborizations, and the volume of the dorsolateral and dorsomedial SMN columns. Three-dimensional visualization also revealed areas of overlap between pelvic VMNs and rhabdosphincter SMNs in dendritic bundles, suggesting a possible functional role in coordinating urinary activity. The datasets are available as an open resource (sparc.science) to support 3D visualization of the pelvic motor system in the intact rat spinal cord.</p>

                Schiereck et al. find that expert rats update subjective beliefs to infer hidden task states, a process they show is impaired by inactivation of OFC. Rats naive to hidden states passively adapt to reward statistics. Neural activity in OFC reflected the use of distinct strategies, identifying neural correlates of inference.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106308">The role of co-infection in the pathogenesis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of post-acute sequelae: A perspective</a></h4>

              
                A major health challenge resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is the manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). PASC (or long COVID) is a collective term used for clinical symptoms, various pathologies, and life-quality-changing functional impairment that persist for months to years after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms underlying PASC are not understood, although advances have been made in identifying factors that may contribute to long-term pathology. Recent data have emerged, showing an association between SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence and non-SARS-CoV-2 infections (pre-existing, viral reactivation, or new infections) in facilitating or mediating PASC. However, the heterogeneous nature and timing of co-infections have made it challenging to understand, interpret, and contextualize their contribution to PASC. Here, we summarize the impact of potential viral, bacterial, and fungal infections on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, with a focus on their possible roles in the development of PASC. We also provide a framework to understand the mechanisms of PASC and inform basic, translational, and clinical research initiatives, including RECOVER, a large and ongoing research initiative to understand, treat, and prevent long COVID.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97274">Local, calcium- and reward-based synaptic learning rule that enhances dendritic nonlinearities can solve the nonlinear feature binding problem</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the computational potential of single striatal projection neurons (SPNs), emphasizing dendritic nonlinearities and their crucial role in solving complex integration problems. Utilizing a biophysically detailed multicompartmental model of an SPN, we introduce a calcium-based, local synaptic learning rule dependent on dendritic plateau potentials. According to what is known about excitatory corticostriatal synapses, the learning rule is governed by local calcium dynamics from NMDA and L-type calcium channels and dopaminergic reward signals. In order to devise a self-adjusting learning rule, which ensures stability for individual synaptic weights, metaplasticity is also used. We demonstrate that this rule allows single neurons with sufficiently nonlinear dendrites to solve the nonlinear feature binding problem, a task traditionally attributed to neuronal networks. We also detail an inhibitory plasticity mechanism that contributes to dendritic compartmentalization, further enhancing computational efficiency in dendrites. This in silico study highlights the computational potential of single neurons, providing deeper insights into neuronal information processing and the mechanisms by which the brain executes complex computations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106601">The denitrosylase SCoR2 controls cardioprotective metabolic reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and therapeutic options remain limited. Endogenously generated nitric oxide (NO) is highly cardioprotective, but protection is not replicated by nitroso-vasodilators (e.g., nitrates, nitroprusside) used in clinical practice, highlighting specificity in NO-based signaling and untapped therapeutic potential. Signaling by NO is mediated largely by <i>S</i>-nitrosylation, entailing specific enzymes that form and degrade <i>S</i>-nitrosothiols in proteins (SNO-proteins), termed nitrosylases and denitrosylases, respectively. SNO-CoA Reductase 2 (SCoR2; product of the <i>Akr1a1</i> gene) is a recently discovered protein denitrosylase. Genetic variants in SCoR2 have been associated with cardiovascular disease, but its function is unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking SCoR2/AKR1A1 exhibit robust protection in an animal model of MI. SCoR2 regulates ketolytic energy availability, antioxidant levels, and polyol homeostasis via <i>S</i>-nitrosylation of key metabolic effectors. Human cardiomyopathy shows reduced SCoR2 expression and an <i>S</i>-nitrosylation signature of metabolic reprogramming, mirroring SCoR2<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Deletion of SCoR2 thus coordinately reprograms multiple metabolic pathways—ketone body utilization, glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt, and polyol metabolism—to limit infarct size, establishing SCoR2 as a novel regulator in the injured myocardium and a potential drug target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101584">Causal associations between human plasma proteins and prostate cancer identified by proteome-wide Mendelian randomization</a></h4>

              
                Prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis is hampered by the limited specificity of current methods, necessitating more reliable biomarkers. To identify causal protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets in humans, we conducted a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study. We first performed a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association studies, including 94,397 individuals with PCa and 192,372 controls, which identified five possible susceptibility loci (JAZF1, PDILM5, WDPCP, EEFSEC, TNS3) for PCa. Subsequently, MR and colocalization analyses were performed using genetic instruments for 4907 plasma proteins from deCODE Genetics (N=35,559) and 2940 plasma proteins from UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) (N=54,219). Among 3722 human proteins analyzed, 193 were associated with PCa risk, with 20 high-risk proteins (including KLK3) validated across both cohorts. Functional annotation implicated immune and inflammatory responses and cell–cell interaction pathways. Druggability analyses nominated several potential drug targets for PCa, such as HSPB1, RRM2B, and PSCA. Our findings reveal novel risk loci and candidate protein biomarkers, providing new etiological insights and potential avenues for PCa early detection and therapy.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sharing personal life stories fosters close relationships and enhances mental wellbeing. When recalling negative experiences, individuals often engage in counterfactual reconstruction—imagining how events could have unfolded differently (eg “<span style="font-style:italic;">If only…</span>”). This study used fNIRS hyperscanning to examine how different storytelling modes influence interpersonal neural synchronization (INS). Dyads (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 114) took turns speaking and listening while recounting negative experiences either factually (Real-Memory retelling, RM) or counterfactually (Counterfactual Reconstruction, CF). Participants were assigned to a no-feedback (monologue) or feedback (interactive dialogue) condition. In the no-feedback group, RM elicited stronger INS than CF between the speaker's right dlPFC (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex) and the listener's left dlPFC/FPC (frontopolar cortex)—regions involved in executive control—whereas CF elicited stronger INS than RM from the speaker's left temporal parietal junction (TPJ) (mentalizing) to the listener's left dlPFC. In the feedback group, CF elicited weaker INS than RM from the speaker's left TPJ to the listener's left dlPFC. Additionally, INS during CF was positively correlated with the emotional empathy scores of the more empathic partner in each dyad. These results suggest that INS patterns reflect distinct cognitive and social demands of factual vs. counterfactual storytelling and are modulated by empathy. We propose that such neural alignment underpins a shared workspace supporting interpersonal communication.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Perceiving specific emotions from others’ faces is a crucial ability for flexible and adaptive interaction, but the role of emotion concepts and categories in this perception has been controversial. The present study aims to investigate the precise time course of emotion concepts and categories involved in facial emotion perception. We conducted a behavioral task of conceptual similarity rating for emotional words, and emotion categorization tasks for emotional words and faces while recording electroencephalographic signals. We also performed a representational similarity analysis to assess the degree of correspondence between the representations of emotion concepts and categories with emotional faces over time. The results showed that the behavioral representations of emotion categories and concepts were successively correlated with the neural representations of the late processing stage for emotional faces at ~ 600–800 ms and ~800–1,000 ms, respectively. Furthermore, the representation of visual features of emotional faces was correlated with the neural representation of the early processing stage for faces (120–160 ms). Together, these results suggest that there is a temporal hierarchy in facial emotion perception that proceeds from visual to emotionally categorial to conceptual feature processing, providing electrophysiological evidence in support of basic emotion theory.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We investigated the role of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmissions within the rostral-posterior insular cortex (rpIC) and caudal-posterior IC (cpIC) subregions of the posterior IC (pIC) in cardiovascular responses and local neuronal activation evoked by acute restraint stress in male rats. We identified that treatment of the rpIC with a cocktail containing the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 and the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP35348 enhanced restraint-evoked tachycardia, whereas the same pharmacological approach in the cpIC decreased this response. Treatment of the rpIC with the nonselective ionotropic glutamate receptors antagonist kynurenic acid decreased the drop in tail skin temperature, and GABA receptor antagonism caused an opposite effect. Restraint increased Fos-positive cells in rpIC and cpIC, and local treatment with the glutamate receptor antagonism decreased this effect in both subregions. These data suggest a site-specific control of stress-evoked tachycardia by GABAergic mechanisms in the pIC.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study investigates how attention modulates internal representations in working memory (WM), focusing on the distinct and overlapping neural effects of retrospective and reflective attention using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants performed cue-variant WM tasks with retro-cue, refresh-cue, and no-cue trials. The cues instructed participants to either refocus or refresh one of the memorized stimuli (a face or a scene) during the retention interval. Univariate, multivariate, and functional connectivity analyses revealed that retro and refresh cues engaged overlapping brain regions but also exhibited distinct activation patterns. Whole-brain analyses showed overlapping activations and decoding patterns in the ventral occipitotemporal and posterior brain regions. Region-of-interest analyses confirmed the selective modulation of category-specific visual areas by both cues. Functional connectivity analyses further revealed inter-regional correlations between the prefrontal cortex and visual areas for both cues. Importantly, the multivariate pattern analysis revealed distinct effects in the prefrontal and parietal cortices (PFC and PPC): retro cues exerted a greater influence on representational patterns in the PFC, whereas refresh cues had a greater impact on patterns within the PPC. Taken together, this study provides direct evidence that refocusing and refreshing rely on both distinct and overlapping neural mechanisms to support WM maintenance.</span>

<p>The study investigated the spatial distribution and myelination status of dopaminergic fibers coursing through the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) in a rodent depression model (Flinders Sensitive Line, FSL) and Control animals, in males and females. All dopaminergic fibers examined were small diameter, unmyelinated and mainly restricted to the dorsolateral quadrant on the mfb's anterior–posterior (AP) axis. Fiber densities were similar, except at segment AP −2.8 mm: here FSL males had significantly fewer DA fibers vs. Control males, and vs. FSL females. Divergence in phenotype and stimulation-evoked responses reported previously could be due to differences in the recruited DAergic fibers.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that the rapid/long-lasting antidepressant action observed following medial forebrain bundle DBS in clinical trials of Treatment-Resistant Depression patients could partially be driven by modulation of the midbrain-to-forebrain dopaminergic fibers. The study investigated the spatial distribution and myelination status of dopaminergic fibers within the rodent equivalent structure in a preclinical depression model, the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL). Fixed, sliced brain sections were double stained with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase/anti-dopamine-β-hydroxylase antibodies to distinguish dopaminergic from noradrenergic fibers, and with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase/anti-myelin antibodies to specifically investigate myelination. Quantification was done at six predefined segments. The dopaminergic fibers coursing through the medial forebrain bundle were small diameter, unmyelinated and mainly restricted to the dorsolateral quadrant on the AP axis. Analyses across six predefined planes revealed significantly fewer dopaminergic fibers in FSL males (vs control males, and vs. FSL females) at AP −2.8 mm, the segment corresponding to the medial forebrain bundle DBS target in the rat. No differences were observed elsewhere along the medial forebrain bundle. Previously reported differences in stimulation-evoked dopamine release in the FSLs could be due to differences in the numbers of recruited dopaminergic fibers.</p>

                Background Head and neck cancer (HNCs) is a major health issue worldwide, and India has contributed to approximately 2.4 lakh new cases in 2022. Definitive chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced disease but carries a risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) that add to morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and possible delay in treatment. The increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has also contributed to management burden. This study aimed to assess the microbiological profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiation. Methods Patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and who developed LRTIs were included in the study. Sputum and tracheostomy suction tip cultures were obtained and processed using standard microbiological techniques such as Gram staining, biochemical tests, and VITEK-2 automated systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and EUCAST recommendations. Clinical and treatment-related factors were documented and compared using SPSS version 23.0, with descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression models. Results Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen (35.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%). The pathogens were strongly resistant to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins but were susceptible to carbapenems and aminoglycosides in the majority of isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups and chemotherapy regimens (p<0.001). Conclusion LRTIs in patients with HNC treated with chemoradiation were mainly caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance patterns are crucial for directing empirical antibiotic therapy, minimizing treatment delays, and enhancing clinical outcomes.

                The increasing prevalence of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus (WNV) highlights the critical need for predictive modeling tools that can guide public health decision-making, particularly given the absence of effective vaccines. We developed a modular computational framework that simulates and analyzes WNV transmission dynamics through compartmental models capturing the intricate ecological interactions among avian hosts, mosquito vectors, and human populations. Our system integrates epidemiological parameters with customizable intervention mechanisms, facilitating the assessment of scenario-specific mitigation approaches. Distinguishing itself from conventional static models, this framework enables users to model dynamic, time-sensitive interventions including targeted mosquito control and strategic bird population management—the two principal containment strategies currently employed against WNV. Using simulations that reflect realistic outbreak scenarios, we evaluated how varying intervention intensities and implementation timings affect epi- demic progression. Our findings reveal that early implemented, dual-target strategies addressing both vector populations and avian reservoirs can substantially reduce transmission dynamics and minimize human exposure risk. This framework serves as a comprehensive decision-support platform for policymakers and vector control agencies, delivering mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions against zoonotic pathogens within complex ecological systems. The tool’s modular design and scenario-testing capabilities make it particularly valuable for proactive outbreak preparedness and evidence-based intervention planning.

                Background Antibiotic resistance in oral pathogens such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococcus faecalis necessitates alternative antimicrobial strategies. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising approach that utilizes a photosensitizer (PS), light, and oxygen to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. This study evaluated the efficacy of two natural photosensitizers, curcumin and chlorophyll (from Medicago sativa L.), for the photodynamic inactivation of these bacteria. Methods Planktonic cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis were subjected to PDI using a 405 nm diode laser at various energy densities. The bacteria were treated with either curcumin (1.6 mg/mL) or chlorophyll (1.6 mg/mL) prior to laser irradiation. Bacterial viability was assessed using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Groups without PS and without light served as controls. Results At an energy density of 1.59 J/cm2, laser irradiation resulted in a reduction of 35.8% and 36.7% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis, respectively. The addition of chlorophyll significantly enhanced bacterial reduction to 64.4% and 69.3%. Curcumin demonstrated superior efficacy, achieving bacterial reduction of 89.8% and 89.4% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis, respectively. The differences between the PS groups and the control groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions Curcumin is a significantly more effective natural photosensitizer than chlorophyll from Medicago sativa L. for the photodynamic inactivation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis. These findings point to the prospect of curcumin-based PDI as a potent therapeutic alternative for combating resistant oral infections.

                Background Frozen shoulder (FS) is a common musculoskeletal condition characterized by inflammatory contracture of the glenohumeral joint capsule, leading to restricted active and passive range of motion, particularly in external rotation. Eccentric control exercises have demonstrated effectiveness in managing various upper limb disorders, including subacromial impingement, tennis elbow, and rotator cuff tendinopathy. However, there is limited evidence on their efficacy in individuals with frozen shoulder. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of eccentric control exercises on pain, functional disability, range of motion, psychosocial outcomes, and patient satisfaction in individuals with FS and mild to moderate disability. Methods A single-group pre-post design was used. Twenty patients with clinically diagnosed FS and mild to moderate disability participated. All underwent 20 sessions of supervised eccentric control exercises over four weeks. Outcome measures included the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), shoulder range of motion (flexion, abduction, hand-behind-back, and external rotation), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks), and follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. A 6-point Likert scale was used to measure patient satisfaction post-intervention. Data were analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA. Results All outcome measures showed statistically significant improvement post-intervention (p < 0.05), with the benefits maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Effect size indices at 4 weeks demonstrated a large treatment effect across all variables, suggesting strong clinical relevance. Conclusions Eccentric control exercises significantly improved pain, functional disability, range of motion, kinesiophobia, pain self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction in individuals with frozen shoulder and mild to moderate disability. These findings support the incorporation of eccentric training in rehabilitation programs for frozen shoulder.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-278/v2?src=rss">Understanding networking behaviors among Indian startups: A qualitative study [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Networking plays a pivotal role in achieving business success and mitigating startup failures. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the networking experience of startup entrepreneurs for the growth of their businesses. Methods A qualitative semi-structured interview was conducted mainly in Bangalore and the Delhi regions of India. Using a cluster sampling method, interviews were held with 36 startup entrepreneurs. These startup owners were mainly from Bangalore and Delhi. The age group, gender, demographic profile, and popular startup sector of these startup owners have also been analyzed in this study. The data were analyzed using Atlas. Ti software. Results The qualitative findings revealed four overall themes related to networking, namely, the “role of networking for the success of the startups”, “supportive environment for networking”, “crucial stages of networking” and “role of past working experience of entrepreneurs”. It was found that most entrepreneurs leverage prior work experience to interact effectively in business, utilizing skills such as communication, leadership, and market intelligence. Conclusion Entrepreneurs mainly prefer networking with colleagues and their ex-bosses in building and creating formal networking. During crises, network members provide expert advice, moral support, and connections to specialists, which helps them solve problems and access new opportunities. Networking is crucial mainly in the early stage of a startup, where connections and relationship structures are needed for navigating upcoming challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1256/v1?src=rss">Psychological Drivers and Behavioral Outcomes of Fast Fashion Consumption: A Meta-Analytic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study employs a meta-analytic approach to synthesize empirical evidence on the psychological and behavioral determinants of fast fashion consumption. Integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with brand-related constructs—perceived scarcity, perceived quality, and self-congruity—this research examines how these factors shape consumer attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, consumption intentions, brand loyalty, and word-of-mouth. Using studies published between 2004 and 2024, a random-effects meta-analysis reveals that brand attitude is the strongest predictor of purchase intention, while self-congruity with fashion brands significantly enhances all TPB components. Perceived quality exerts a cross-cutting influence on both cognitive and social evaluations, reinforcing the multidimensional nature of consumer judgments. The findings extend the TPB framework by embedding symbolic and perceptual brand dimensions, offering a more comprehensive explanatory model of fashion consumption. From a managerial perspective, the results suggest that marketing strategies emphasizing authentic scarcity cues and alignment with consumers’ self-identity can strengthen emotional attachment, perceived control, and loyalty. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for designing culturally sensitive and identity-driven branding strategies in the fast fashion sector.
