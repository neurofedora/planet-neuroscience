                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Determining the impact that the <I>KIAA0319</I> gene has on primate brain morphology can provide insight into the evolution of human cognition and language systems. Here, we tested whether polymorphisms in <I>KIAA0319</I> in chimpanzees account for gray matter volumetric variation in brain regions implicated in language and communication (particularly within the posterior superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus). First, we identified the nature and frequencies of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in <I>KIAA0319</I> in a sample of unrelated chimpanzees (<I>Pan troglodytes</I> spp.). Next, we genotyped a subset of SNVs (those important for gene regulation or likely to alter protein structure/function) in a sample of chimpanzees for which <I>in vivo</I> T1-structural magnetic resonance imaging scans had been obtained. We then used source-based morphometry (SBM) to test for whole-brain gray matter covariation differences between chimpanzees with different <I>KIAA0319</I> alleles. Finally, using histologic sections of 15 postmortem chimpanzee brains, we analyzed microstructural variation related to <I>KIAA0319</I> polymorphisms in the posterior superior temporal cortex. We found that the SNVs were associated with variation in gray matter within several brain regions, including the posterior superior temporal gyrus (a region associated with language comprehension and production in humans). The microstructure analysis further revealed hemispheric differences in neuropil fraction, indicating that <I>KIAA0319</I> expression may be involved in regulation of processes related to the formation and maintenance of synapses, dendrites, or axons within regions associated with communication.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Water restriction is commonly used to motivate rodents to perform behavioral tasks; however, its effects on hydration and stress hormone levels are unknown. Here, we report daily body weight and bi-weekly packed red blood cell volume and corticosterone (CORT) in adult male rats across 80 days for three commonly used water restriction schedules. We also assessed renal adaptation to water restriction using postmortem histologic evaluation of renal medulla. A control group received <I>ad libitum</I> water. After one week of water restriction, rats on all restriction schedules resumed similar levels of growth relative to the control group. Normal hydration was observed, and water restriction did not drive renal adaptation. An intermittent restriction schedule was associated with an increase in CORT relative to the control group. However, intermittent restriction evokes a stress response which could affect behavioral and neurobiological results. Our results also suggest that stable motivation in behavioral tasks may only be achieved after one week of restriction.</p>

                Background: Cytokine storm has been widely known to contribute to the development of the critical condition in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and studies had been conducted to assess the potential aspect of cytokine storm elimination by performing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). However, contradictory findings were observed. The objective of this study was to assess the association between TPE and the reduction of mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted by collecting data from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Data on the mortality rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with TPE plus standard of care and that of patients treated with standard of care alone were analyzed using a Z test. Results: We included a total of four papers assessing the association between TPE and the risk of mortality among critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggested that critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with TPE had lower risk of mortality compared to those without TPE treatment. Conclusion: Our study has identified the potential benefits of TPE in reducing the risk of mortality among critically ill COVID-19 patients.

<p>The picture illustrates a boar fetus 2 weeks before birth and its highly gyrated brain. A representative coronal section through one hemisphere indicates regions of interest for assessing, in the laminar compartments, the changes in morphology and cell density. Microglia cells reach adult-like cell density and morphology well before birth. Cells interact with neuronal somata and axon initial segments by late midgestation. Depending on the laminar compartment, microglia cells represent 7–12% of all cortical cells.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Knowledge on cortical development is based mainly on rodents besides primates and carnivores, all being altricial. Here, we analyzed a precocial animal, the pig, looking at dorsoparietal cortex from E45 to P90. At E45, most ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1-positive (Iba1+) cells had a macrophage-like morphology and resided in meninges and choroid plexus. Only a few cells were scattered in the ventricular and subventricular zone (VZ and SVZ). At E60/E70, all laminar compartments displayed microglia cells at a low-to-moderate density, being highest in VZ and SVZ followed by intermediate zone/white matter (IZ/WM). The cortical plate and marginal zone displayed only a few Iba1+ cells. Cells were intensely labeled, but still had poorly arborized somata and many resembled ameboid, macrophage-like microglia. Concurrent with a massive increase in cortical volume, microglia cell density increased until E85, and further until E100/E110 (birth at E114) to densities that resemble those seen postnatally. A fraction of microglia colabeled with Ki67 suggesting proliferation in all laminar compartments. Cell-to-cell distance decreased substantially during this time, and the fraction of microglia to all nuclei and to neurons increases in the laminar compartments. Eventually, of all cortical DAPI+ nuclei 7–12% were Iba1+ microglia. From E70 onwards, more and more cells with ramified processes were present in MZ down to IZ/WM, showing, for instance, a close association with NeuN+, NPY+, and GAD65/67+ somata and axon initial segments. These results suggested that the development of microglia cell density and morphology proceeds rapidly from mid-gestation onwards reaching near-adult status already before birth.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vocal learning in songbirds is mediated by cortico-basal ganglia circuits that govern diverse functions during different stages of development. We investigated developmental changes in axonal projections to and from motor cortical regions that underlie learned vocal behavior in juvenile zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>). Neurons in LMAN-core project to RA, a motor cortical region that drives vocal output; these RA-projecting neurons send a transient collateral projection to AId, a region adjacent to RA, during early vocal development. Both RA and AId project to a region of dorsal thalamus (DLM), which forms a feedback pathway to cortico-basal ganglia circuitry. These projections provide pathways conveying efference copy and a means by which information about vocal motor output could be reintegrated into cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, potentially aiding in the refinement of juvenile vocalizations during learning. We used tract-tracing techniques to label the projections of LMAN-core to AId and of RA to DLM in juvenile songbirds. The volume and density of terminal label in the LMAN-core→AId projection declined substantially during early stages of sensorimotor learning. In contrast, the RA→DLM projection showed no developmental change. The retraction of LMAN-core→AId axon collaterals indicates a loss of efference copy to AId and suggests that projections that are present only during early stages of sensorimotor learning mediate unique, temporally restricted processes of goal-directed learning. Conversely, the persistence of the RA→DLM projection may serve to convey motor information forward to the thalamus to facilitate song production during both learning and maintenance of vocalizations.</p>

                Particulate matter (PM), an air pollutant that is detrimental to breathing, is either emitted or formed ambiently. The exposure of respiratory system towards PM2.5, the fine particles of 2.5 micrometres diameter, causes complication for health. Thus, developing pollution control strategies requires the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations. Advancement of technology and computer science knowledge, machine learning (ML) algorithms are used for highly accurate prediction of air pollutant concentrations. Recently, air quality in Smart Cities of Malaysia has been getting worse due to industrialization, emissions from private motor vehicles, and transboundary haze pollution. Therefore, the forecasting of PM2.5 emissions to ensure they are within the statutory limits becomes necessary. Several machine learning methods have been implemented in existing research to predict air pollution concentrations in comparison to PM2.5. However, very few studies have used ML techniques to predict air quality in Malaysia when compared with global studies. Hence, to create awareness on the ML techniques and promote further research in this area, this study reviews and highlights most of the existing ML techniques for the prediction of PM2.5.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How the value of the environment controls persistence in visual search</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael R. Traner, Ethan S. Bromberg-Martin, Ilya E. Monosov</p>

Classic foraging theory predicts that humans and animals aim to gain maximum reward per unit time. However, in standard instrumental conditioning tasks individuals adopt an apparently suboptimal strategy: they respond slowly when the expected value is low. This reward-related bias is often explained as reduced motivation in response to low rewards. Here we present evidence this behavior is associated with a complementary <i>increased</i> motivation to search the environment for alternatives. We trained monkeys to search for reward-related visual targets in environments with different values. We found that the reward-related bias scaled with environment value, was consistent with persistent searching after the target was already found, and was associated with increased exploratory gaze to objects in the environment. A novel computational model of foraging suggests that this search strategy could be adaptive in naturalistic settings where both environments and the objects within them provide partial information about hidden, uncertain rewards.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying proximal RNA interactions from cDNA-encoded crosslinks with ShapeJumper</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas W. Christy, Catherine A. Giannetti, Alain Laederach, Kevin M. Weeks</p>

SHAPE-JuMP is a concise strategy for identifying close-in-space interactions in RNA molecules. Nucleotides in close three-dimensional proximity are crosslinked with a bi-reactive reagent that covalently links the 2’-hydroxyl groups of the ribose moieties. The identities of crosslinked nucleotides are determined using an engineered reverse transcriptase that jumps across crosslinked sites, resulting in a deletion in the cDNA that is detected using massively parallel sequencing. Here we introduce ShapeJumper, a bioinformatics pipeline to process SHAPE-JuMP sequencing data and to accurately identify through-space interactions, as observed in complex JuMP datasets. ShapeJumper identifies proximal interactions with near-nucleotide resolution using an alignment strategy that is optimized to tolerate the unique non-templated reverse-transcription profile of the engineered crosslink-traversing reverse-transcriptase. JuMP-inspired strategies are now poised to replace adapter-ligation for detecting RNA-RNA interactions in most crosslinking experiments.

                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new type of respiratory infection that first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study aims to determine the association of SNP CRP rs1800947 gene in suspected COVID-19 patients to length of stay at Al Ihsan Hospital, and Banten Hospital in June-November 2020. This study used data from 60 patients, all patients were suspect COVID-19. The subject was  29 COVID-19 people were confirmed, whereas 31 people were not. A statistics analysis due to pearson correlation and linear multi regretion. This study found a significant assosiation between the subject. The results of this study were the relationship between SNP rs1800947 and outcome, a fairly strong association level relationship was found in the SNP rs1800947 (p-value= 0.045, association= 0.537). The association between length of stay and CRP levels has a low level of association (p-value=0.015, association=0.378). The SNP genotype rs1800947 G had a longer treatment duration of 0.14778 days compared to the SNPrs1800947 C genotype. CRP levels showed that higher CRP levels increased the length of treatment compared to normal CRP levels. Where high CRP levels are at risk of 0.6330 days longer than normal CRP while very high CRP is at risk of 2.9561 days longer than Normal CRP levels. In general, the gene SNP rs1800947 and CRP levels, together affect the outcome of patients with suspected COVID-19.

                Background: The objective of this study was to test the validity of automated audiometry as a method of hearing examination in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Methods: This was a cross-sectional comparative study with a retrospective approach, using patient medical records. Patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were recruited based-on medical records that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria at the Pulmonology outpatient unit, then referred to the Otorhinolaryngology outpatient unit of the Dr. Soetomo Academic Medical Center. The subjects’ hearing function was measured with two different devices (automated audiometer and conventional audiometer) before being given anti-tuberculosis drug therapy (aminoglycoside injection) as ototoxicity monitoring from July to December 2019 period. Sensitivity and specificity analysis was used to assess the validity of the test. Results: A total of 36 patients (72 ears) were included. The comparison test results using the Mann-Whitney test showed that there were significant differences between automated audiometry and conventional audiometry in both ears. Analysis values were: sensitivity 80-97%, specificity 37-96%, positive predictive value 74-98%, and negative predictive value 59-96%. Conclusions: Automated audiometry is valid for use as a method of hearing examination and monitoring in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

                Background: Multicollinearity greatly affects the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) efficiency in both the linear regression model and the generalized linear model. Alternative estimators to the MLE include the ridge estimator, the Liu estimator and the Kibria-Lukman (KL) estimator, though literature shows that the KL estimator is preferred. Therefore, this study sought to modify the KL estimator to mitigate the Poisson Regression Model with multicollinearity. Methods: A simulation study and a real-life study was carried out and the performance of the new estimator was compared with some of the existing estimators. Results: The simulation result showed the new estimator performed more efficiently than the MLE, Poisson Ridge Regression Estimator (PRE), Poisson Liu Estimator (PLE) and the Poisson KL (PKL) estimators. The real-life application also agreed with the simulation result. Conclusions: In general, the new estimator performed more efficiently than the MLE, PRE, PLE and the PKL when multicollinearity was present.

<p>Dysfunction observed in astrocytes when treated with WT and A30P/A53T monomeric and aggregated α-synuclein.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Serving as a source of glutathione and up-taking and metabolizing glutamate are the primary supportive role of astrocytes for the adjacent neurons. Despite the clear physical association between astrocytes and α-synuclein, the effect of extracellular α-synuclein on these astrocytic functions has not yet been elucidated. Hence, we aim to assess the effect of various forms of α-synuclein on antioxidant mechanism and glutamate metabolism. Wild-type and A53T/A30P double-mutant α-synuclein, both in monomeric and aggregated forms, were added extracellularly to media of midbrain rat astrocyte culture, with their survival, oxidative, and nitrative stress, glutathione and glutamate content, expression of enzymes associated with oxidative stress and glutamate metabolism, glutamate and glutathione transporters being assessed along with the association/engulfment of these peptides by astrocytes. A30P/A53T peptide associated more with astrocytes, and low-extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration showed prominent reduction in the engulfment of the monomeric forms, suggesting that the association of the aggregated forms was greater with the membrane. The peptide-associated astrocytes showed lower survival and increased oxidative stress generation, owing to the decrease in nuclear localization of Nrf2 and increase in <i>iNOS</i>, and further aggravated by the decrease in glutathione content and related enzymes like <i>glutathione synthetase, glutathione peroxidase,</i> and <i>glutathione reductase</i>. Glutamate uptake increased in aggregate-treated cells due to the increase in GLAST1 expression, <i>de novo</i> synthesis of glutamate by <i>pyruvate carboxylase</i>, and/or <i>glutamine synthase</i>, bolstered by the differential glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme activity. We thus show for the first time that extracellular α-synuclein exposure leads to astrocytic dysfunction with respect to the antioxidant mechanism and glutamate metabolic profile. The impact was higher in the case of the aggregated and mutated peptide, with the highest dysfunction for the mutant aggregated α-synuclein treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">“Exclusivity” and quantifier float in bakari [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents a descriptive study that analyzes the semantic meaning of Toritate focus particle bakari. Previous studies reported that, although bakari expresses exclusivity, it is characterized by the fact that it permits non-applicable cases, thereby drawing the conclusion that the meaning of bakari is not exclusivity. This paper argues that bakari does indeed denote “exclusivity” as bakari is supported by the phenomenon that non-applicable cases are unacceptable when bakari co-occurs with floating quantifiers. Considering existing research on this subject, the following was observed. Even though the subjective set, as established by the speaker’s past experiences to interpret the meaning of bakari, may not be consistent with the real world, the number of events that form the said set match the number of real-world events when bakari co-occurs with floating quantifiers due to the characteristics of floating quantifiers. In such cases, bakari does not permit non-applicable cases. The interpretation that permits non-applicable cases applies to situations where the set established by the speaker is fixed at a narrower range than the real world, and the non-applicable cases exist outside the set. We thus conclude that bakari denotes “exclusivity” that does not permit non-applicable cases.

                Suboptimal decision-making strategies have been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of addiction. Decision-making, however, arises from a collection of computational components that can independently influence behavior. Disruptions in these different components can lead to decision-making deficits that appear similar behaviorally, but differ at the computational, and likely the neurobiological, level. Here, we discuss recent studies that have used computational approaches to investigate the decision-making processes underlying addiction.

This effect is mediated by activation of the integrins CD11a and CD11c. In addition to identifying additional pro-phagocytic receptors on macrophages, these data suggest that inflammation enhances anti-tumor immunity by promoting phagocytosis.

Accordingly, disrupted GH signaling in aging mice prevents accumulated DNA damage.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Distinct molecular pathways govern presynaptic homeostatic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synapses counteract neurotransmitter receptor perturbations by homeostatic neurotransmitter release potentiation. Homeostatic compensation is thought to be triggered by impaired receptor function, and to involve a stereotypic signaling pathway. Nair et al. here show that different glutamate receptor antagonists trigger distinct homeostatic signaling pathways at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Cholinergic feedback to bipolar cells contributes to motion detection in the mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Moving objects are sensed by the retina, which depends on neural circuits for visual motion detection. Hellmer et al. demonstrate that specific second-order retinal bipolar cells receive cholinergic feedback via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which enhances directional signaling of postsynaptic neurons in motion detection circuits.

                Yokoi et al. tackle the question of how much protein function needs to be restored in loss-of-function genetic diseases. Developing hypomorphic mouse models, they estimate minimal levels of a key determinant of epilepsy phenotypes. They propose that biogenesis pathways of the determinant protein could be promising anti-epilepsy drug targets.

High-resolution fMRI reveals robust parvocellular deficits of the geniculostriate pathway and both loss and enhancement of the corticotectal pathway. These findings challenge the consensus that amblyopia affects mainly cortical functions and provides the neural basis for vision deficits of amblyopia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell transcriptome analysis identifies a unique tumor cell type producing multiple hormones in ectopic ACTH and CRH secreting pheochromocytoma</a></h4>

              
                Ectopic Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH&CRH-secreting by pheochromocytoma is extremely rare and can be fatal if not properly diagnosed. It remains unclear whether a unique cell type is responsible for multiple hormones secreting. In this work, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to 3 different anatomic tumor tissues and 1 peritumoral tissue based on a rare case with ectopic ACTH&CRH-secreting pheochromocytoma. And in addition to that, 3 adrenal tumor specimens from common pheochromocytoma and adrenocortical adenomas were also involved in the comparison of tumor cellular heterogeneity. A total of 16 cell types in the tumor microenvironment were identified by unbiased cell clustering of single-cell transcriptomic profiles from all specimens. Notably, we identified a novel multi-functionally chromaffin-like cell type with high expression of both POMC (the precursor of ACTH) and CRH, called ACTH+&CRH+ pheochromocyte. We hypothesized that the molecular mechanism of the rare case harbor Cushing's syndrome is due to the identified novel tumor cell type, that is, the secretion of ACTH had a direct effect on the adrenal gland to produce cortisol, while the secretion of CRH can indirectly stimulate the secretion of ACTH from the anterior pituitary. Besides, a new potential marker (GAL) co-expressed with ACTH and CRH might be involved in the regulation of ACTH secretion. The immunohistochemistry results confirmed its multi-functionally chromaffin-like properties with positive staining for CRH, POMC, ACTH, GAL, TH and CgA. Our findings also proved to some extent the heterogeneity of endothelial and immune microenvironment in different adrenal tumor subtypes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allosteric mechanism of signal transduction in the two-component system histidine kinase PhoQ</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane signaling proteins couple extracytosolic sensors to cytosolic effectors. Here, we examine how binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the sensor domain of an <i>E. coli</i> two component histidine kinase (HK), PhoQ, modulates its cytoplasmic kinase domain. We use cysteine-crosslinking and reporter-gene assays to simultaneously and independently probe the signaling state of PhoQ's sensor and autokinase domains in a set of over 30 mutants. Strikingly, conservative single-site mutations distant from the sensor or catalytic site strongly influence PhoQ's ligand-sensitivity as well as the magnitude and direction of the signal. Data from 35 mutants are explained by a semi-empirical three-domain model in which the sensor, intervening HAMP, and catalytic domains can adopt kinase-promoting or inhibiting conformations that are in allosteric communication. The catalytic and sensor domains intrinsically favor a constitutively 'kinase-on' conformation, while the HAMP domain favors the 'off' state; when coupled, they create a bistable system responsive to physiological concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Mutations alter signaling by locally modulating domain intrinsic equilibrium constants and interdomain couplings. Our model suggests signals transmit via interdomain allostery rather than propagation of a single concerted conformational change, explaining the diversity of signaling structural transitions observed in individual HK domains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Respiration aligns perception with neural excitability</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies from the field of interoception have highlighted the link between bodily and neural rhythms during action, perception, and cognition. The mechanisms underlying functional body-brain coupling, however, are poorly understood, as are the ways in which they modulate behaviour. We acquired respiration and human magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from a near-threshold spatial detection task to investigate the trivariate relationship between respiration, neural excitability, and performance. Respiration was found to significantly modulate perceptual sensitivity as well as posterior alpha power (8 - 13 Hz), a well-established proxy of cortical excitability. In turn, alpha suppression prior to detected vs undetected targets underscored the behavioural benefits of heightened excitability. Notably, respiration-locked excitability changes were maximised at a respiration phase lag of around -30° and thus temporally preceded performance changes. In line with interoceptive inference accounts, these results suggest that respiration actively aligns sampling of sensory information with transient cycles of heightened excitability to facilitate performance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">V-ATPase V0a1 promotes Weibel–Palade body biogenesis through the regulation of membrane fission</a></h4>

              
                Membrane fission, the division of a membrane-bound structure into two discrete compartments, is essential for diverse cellular events, such as endocytosis and vesicle/granule biogenesis; however, the process remains unclear. The hemostatic protein von Willebrand factor is produced in vascular endothelial cells and packaged into specialized secretory granules, Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) at the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN). Here, we reported that V0a1, a V-ATPase component, is required for the membrane fission of WPBs. We identified two V0a isoforms in distinct populations of WPBs in cultured endothelial cells, V0a1 and V0a2, on mature and nascent WPBs, respectively. Although WPB buds were formed, WPBs could not separate from the TGN in the absence of V0a1. Screening using dominant-negative forms of known membrane fission regulators revealed protein kinase D (PKD) as an essential factor in biogenesis of WPBs. Further, we showed that the induction of wild-type PKDs in V0a1-depleted cells does not support the segregation of WPBs from the TGN; suggesting a primary role of V0a1 in the membrane fission of WPBs. The identification of V0a1 as a new membrane fission regulator should facilitate the understanding of molecular events that enable membrane fission.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spike initiation properties in the axon support high-fidelity signal transmission</a></h4>

              
                The axon initial segment (AIS) converts graded depolarization into all-or-none spikes that are transmitted by the axon to downstream neurons. Analog-to-digital transduction and digital signal transmission call for distinct spike initiation properties (filters) and those filters should, therefore, differ between the AIS and distal axon. Here we show that unlike the AIS, which spikes repetitively during sustained depolarization, the axon spikes transiently and only if depolarization reaches threshold before KV1 channels activate. Rate of depolarization is critical. This was shown by optogenetically evoking spikes in the distal axon of CA1 pyramidal neurons using different photostimulus waveforms and pharmacological conditions while recording antidromically propagated spikes at the soma, thus circumventing the prohibitive difficulty of patching intact axons. Computational modeling shows that KV1 channels in the axon implement a high-pass filter that is matched to the axial current waveform associated with spike propagation, thus maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio to ensure high-fidelity transmission of spike-based signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An intrinsic endothelial dysfunction causes cerebral small vessel disease</a></h4>

              
                Small Vessel Disease (SVD) is the leading cause of vascular dementia, causes a quarter of strokes, and worsens stroke outcomes(1, 2). The disease is characterised by cerebral small vessel and white matter pathology, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Classically, the microvascular and tissue damage has been considered secondary to extrinsic factors, such as hypertension, consisting of microvessel stiffening, impaired vasoreactivity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction identified in human sporadic SVDs. However, increasing evidence points to an underlying vulnerability to SVD-related brain damage, not just extrinsic factors. Here, in a novel normotensive transgenic rat model where the phospholipase flippase Atp11b is deleted, we show pathological, imaging and behavioural changes typical of those in human sporadic SVD, but that occur without hypertension. These changes are due to an intrinsic endothelial cell dysfunction, identified in vessels of the brain white matter and the retina, with pathological evidence of vasoreactivity and blood-brain barrier deficits, which precipitate a secondary maturation block in oligodendroglia and myelin disruption around the small vessels. This highlights that an intrinsic endothelial dysfunction may underlie vulnerability to human sporadic SVD, providing alternative therapeutic targets to prevent a major cause of stroke and dementia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Angle-Tuned Coils: Enabling Building Blocks for High Performance and Multisite TMS Systems</a></h4>

              
                Objective: A novel angle-tuned ring coil is proposed for improving the depth-spread performance of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) coils and serve as the building blocks for high-performance composite coils and multisite TMS systems. Approach: Improving depth-spread performance by reducing field divergence through creating a more elliptical emitted field distribution from the coil. To accomplish that, instead of enriching the Fourier components along the planarized (x-y) directions, which requires different arrays to occupy large brain surface areas, we worked along the radial (z) direction by using tilted coil angles and stacking coil numbers to reduce the divergence of the emitted near field without occupying large head surface areas. The emitted electric field distributions were theoretically simulated in spherical and real human head models to analyze the depth-spread performance of proposed coils and compare with existing figure-8 coils. The results were then experimentally validated with field probes and in-vivo animal tests. Main Results: The proposed "angle-tuning" concept improves the depth-spread performance of individual coils with a significantly smaller footprint than existing and proposed coils. For composite structures, using the proposed coils as basic building blocks simplifies the design and manufacturing process and helps accomplish a leading depth-spread performance. In addition, the footprint of the proposed system is intrinsically small, making them suitable for multisite stimulations of inter and intra-hemispheric brain regions with an improved spread and less electric field divergence. Significance: Few brain functions are operated by isolated single brain regions but rather by coordinated networks involving multiple brain regions. Simultaneous or sequential multisite stimulations may provide tools for mechanistic studies of brain functions and the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The proposed AT coil goes beyond the traditional depth-spread tradeoff rule of TMS coils, which provides the possibility of building new composite structures and new multisite TMS tools.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A library for fMRI real-time processing systems in python (RTPSpy) with comprehensive online noise reduction, fast and accurate anatomical image processing, and online processing simulation</a></h4>

              
                We introduce a python library for real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) data processing systems, Real-Time Processing System in python (RTPSpy), to provide building blocks for a custom rtfMRI application with extensive and advanced functionalities. RTPSpy is a library package including 1) a fast, comprehensive, and flexible online fMRI denoising pipeline comparable to offline processing, 2) utilities for fast and accurate anatomical image processing to define a target region on-site, 3) a simulation system of online fMRI processing to optimize a pipeline and target signal calculation, 4) interface to an external application for feedback presentation, and 5) a boilerplate graphical user interface (GUI) integrating operations with RTPSpy library. Since online fMRI data processing cannot be equivalent to offline, we discussed the limitations of online analysis and their solutions in the RTPSpy implementation. We developed a fast and accurate anatomical image processing script with fast tissue segmentation (FastSeg), image alignment, and spatial normalization, utilizing the FastSurfer, AFNI, and ANTs. We confirmed that the FastSeg output was comparable with FreeSurfer, and could complete all the anatomical image processing in a few minutes. Thanks to its highly modular architecture, RTPSpy can easily be used for a simulation analysis to optimize a processing pipeline and target signal calculation. We present a sample script for building a real-time processing pipeline and running a simulation using RTPSpy. The library also offers a simple signal exchange mechanism with an external application. An external application can receive a real-time neurofeedback signal from RTPSpy in a background thread with a few lines of script. While the main components of the RTPSpy are the library modules, we also provide a GUI class for easy access to the RTPSpy functions. The boilerplate GUI application provided with the package allows users to develop a customized rtfMRI application with minimum scripting labor. Finally, we discussed the limitations of the package regarding environment-specific implementations. We believe that RTPSpy is an attractive option for developing rtfMRI applications highly optimized for individual purposes. The package is available from GitHub (https://github.com/mamisaki/RTPSpy) with GPL3 license.

                LKB1 is known as a master kinase for 14 kinases related to the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Two of them (SIK3 and AMPKa;) have previously been implicated in sleep regulation. We generated loss-of-function (LOF) mutants for Lkb1 in both Drosophila and mice. Sleep was reduced in Lkb1-mutant flies and in flies with neuronal deletion of Lkb1. Sleep was reduced in mice after virally mediated reduction of Lkb1 in the brain. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis showed that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and sleep need were both reduced in Lkb1-mutant mice. These results indicate that LKB1 plays a physiological role in sleep regulation conserved from flies to mice.

                The traditional view of neural computation in the cerebral cortex holds that sensory neurons are specialized, i.e., selective for certain dimensions of sensory stimuli. This view was challenged by evidence of contextual interactions between stimulus dimensions in which a neuron's response to one dimension strongly depends on other dimensions. Here we use methods of mathematical modeling, psychophysics, and electrophysiology to address shortcomings of the traditional view. Using a model of a generic cortical circuit, we begin with the simple demonstration that cortical responses are always distributed among neurons, forming characteristic waveforms, which we call neural waves. When stimulated by patterned stimuli, circuit responses arise by interference of neural waves. Resulting patterns of interference depend on interaction between stimulus dimensions. Comparison of these modeled responses with responses of biological vision makes it clear that the framework of neural wave interference provides a useful alternative to the standard concept of neural computation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying long-range synaptic inputs using genetically encoded labels and volume electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Enzymes that facilitate the local deposition of electron dense reaction products have been widely used as labels in electron microscopy (EM). Peroxidases, in particular, can efficiently metabolize 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride hydrate (DAB) to produce precipitates with high contrast under EM following heavy metal staining, and can be genetically encoded to facilitate the labeling of specific cell-types or organelles. Nevertheless, the peroxidase/DAB method has so far not been reported to work in combination with 3D volume EM techniques (e.g. Serial blockface electron microscopy, SBEM; Focused ion beam electron microscopy, FIBSEM) because the surfactant treatment needed for efficient reagent penetration disrupts tissue ultrastructure and because these methods require the deposition of large amounts of heavy metals that can obscure DAB precipitates. However, a recently described peroxidase with enhanced enzymatic activity (dAPEX2) appears to successfully deposit EM-visible DAB products in thick tissue without surfactant treatment. Here we demonstrate that multiplexed dAPEX2/DAB tagging is compatible with both FIBSEM and SBEM volume EM approaches and use them to map long-range genetically identified synaptic inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex to the periaqueductal gray in the mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neuron, microglia, and astrocyte triple coculture model to study Alzheimer disease</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells are essential to understand Alzheimer disease (AD) progression, given their role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. There is a need for reliable and easy to manipulate models that allow studying the mechanisms behind neuron and glia communication. Currently available models such as co-cultures require complex methodologies and/or might not be affordable for all laboratories. With this in mind, we aimed to establish a straightforward in vitro setting with neurons and glial cells to study AD. We generated a triple co-culture with neurons, microglia and astrocytes. Immunofluorescence, western blot and ELISA techniques were used to characterize the effects of oligomeric A{beta} (oA{beta}) in this model. We found that, in the triple co-culture, microglia increased the expression of anti-inflammatory markers Arginase I and TGF-{beta}1, and reduced pro-inflammatory iNOS and IL-1{beta}, compared with microglia alone. Astrocytes reduced expression of pro-inflammatory A1 markers AMIGO2 and C3, and displayed a ramified morphology resembling physiological conditions. Lastly, neurons increased post-synaptic markers, and developed more and longer branches than in individual primary cultures. Addition of oA{beta} in the triple co-culture reduced synaptic markers and increased microglial activation, which are hallmarks of AD. Consequently, we developed a reliable model, where cells better resemble physiological conditions: microglia are less inflammatory, astrocytes are less reactive and neurons display a more mature morphology than in individual primary cultures. Moreover, we were able to recapitulate A{beta}-induced synaptic loss and inflammation. This model emerges as a powerful tool to study neurodegeneration and inflammation in the context of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tissue Optimisation Strategies for High Quality Ex Vivo Diffusion Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Ex vivo diffusion imaging can be used to study healthy and pathological tissue microstructure in the rodent brain with microscopic resolution, providing a link between in vivo MRI and ex vivo microscopy techniques. A major challenge for the successful acquisition of ex vivo diffusion imaging data however are changes in the relaxivity and diffusivity of brain tissue following perfusion fixation. In this study we address this question by examining the combined effects of tissue preparation factors that influence image quality, including tissue rehydration time, fixative concentration and contrast agent concentration. We present an optimisation strategy combining these factors to manipulate the T1 and T2 of fixed tissue and maximise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. Applying this strategy in the rat brain resulted in a doubling of SNR and an increase in SNR per unit time by 135% in grey matter and 88% in white matter. This enabled the acquisition of excellent quality high-resolution (78 m isotropic voxel size) diffusion data in less than 4 days, with a b-value of 4000 s/mm2, 30 diffusion directions and a field of view of 40 x 13 x 18 mm, using a 9.4 Tesla scanner with a standard 39 mm volume coil and a 660 mT/m 114 mm gradient insert. It was also possible to achieve comparable data quality for a standard resolution (150 m) diffusion dataset in 21/4 hours. In conclusion, the optimisation strategy presented here may be used to improve signal quality, increase spatial resolution and/or allow faster acquisitions in preclinical ex vivo diffusion MRI experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuroimaging signature associated with symptom exacerbation in early-stage psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Recent reports have indicated that the occurrence of symptom exacerbation in early-stage psychosis could result in brain changes, which are likely to underlie the poorer disease outcome. Thus, it is important to identify neuroimaging signature associated with symptom exacerbation in early-stage psychosis. We studied 85 patients with psychosis within two years after onset and 94 healthy controls (HC). The patient group was subdivided into two groups: 54 patients who did not experience major symptom exacerbation between the onset and study enrollment (P1), and 31 patients who experienced major symptom exacerbation (P2). We analyzed three brain imaging measures derived from resting-state functional MRI, such as global efficiency, nodal efficiency, and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). After excluding some brain imaging measures that were potentially affected by clinical variables, we conducted a comparison between overall patient group and HC group as well as comparsions between HC, P1, and P2 groups for these three types of brain imaging measures, respectively. By integrating the information, we pinned down the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus as key hubs in the context of several large-scale brain networks associated with symptom exacerbations in early-stage psychosis. Our study implies the importance of considering neural mechanism associated with symptom exacerbations in early stages of psychotic disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired dynamics of prefrontal beta-band networks during cognitive action control in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Among the cognitive symptoms that are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), alterations in cognitive action control (CAC) are commonly reported in patients. CAC enables the suppression of an automatic action, in favor of a goal-directed one. The implementation of CAC is time-resolved and arguably associated with dynamic changes in functional brain networks. However, the electrophysiological functional networks involved, their dynamic changes, and how these changes are affected by PD, still remain unknown. In this study, to address this gap of knowledge, 21 PD patients and 10 healthy controls (HC) underwent a Simon task while high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) was recorded. Source-level dynamic connectivity matrices were estimated using the phase-locking value in the beta (12-25 Hz) and gamma (30-45 Hz) frequency bands. Temporal independent component analyses were used as a dimension reduction tool to isolate the group-specific brain network states that were dominant during the task. Typical microstate metrics were quantified to investigate the presence of these states at the subject-level. Our results first confirmed that PD patients experienced difficulties in inhibiting automatic responses during the task. At the group-level, HC displayed a significant functional network state that involved typical CAC-related prefrontal and cingulate nodes (e.g., inferior frontal cortex). Both group- and subject-level analyses showed that this network was less present in PD to the benefit of other networks involving lateralized temporal and insular components. The presence of this prefrontal network was associated with decreased reaction time. In the gamma band, two networks (fronto-cingulate and fronto-temporal) followed one another in HC, while 3 partially overlapping networks that included fronto-temporal, fronto-occipital and cross-hemispheric temporal connections were found in PD. At the subject-level, differences between PD and HC were less marked. Altogether, this study showed that the functional brain networks observed during CAC and their temporal changes were different in PD patients as compared to HC, and that these differences partially relate to behavioral changes. This study also highlights that task-based dynamic functional connectivity is a promising approach in understanding the cognitive dysfunctions observed in PD and beyond.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">biPACT: a method for three-dimensional visualization of mouse spinal cord circuits of long segments with high resolution</a></h4>

              
                Background: The spatial complexity of neuronal circuits in the central nervous system is an hurdle in understanding and treating brain and spinal cord injuries. Although several methods have recently been developed to render the spinal cord transparent and label specific neural circuits, three-dimensional visualization of long segments of spinal cord with high resolution remains challenging. New Method: We have established a method that combines tissue staining of neuronal tracts traced with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and a modified passive clarity clearing protocol. Results: BDA was injected into the unilateral sensorimotor cortex of a mouse model of thoracic spinal cord contusional injury. Ten days later, the spinal cord was removed and immersed first in staining solution and then in hydrogel solution. The spinal cord was then sealed with a syringe and underwent gelation process, followed by clearing with clearing solution and observation solution. Staining and clearing took a total of two weeks. The samples were observed with a lightsheet microscope, and three-dimensional reconstruction was performed with ImageJ software. With the lightsheet microscope, high resolution-images comparable with tissue sections were obtained continuously and circumferentially. By tiling, it was possible to obtain high-resolution images of long segments of the spinal cord, in which each fiber could be traced. The tissue could be easily re-stained in case of fading. Comparison with Existing Methods: The present method does not require special equipment, can label specific circuits without genetic technology, and re-staining rounds can be easily implemented. It enables to visualize specific neural circuit of long spinal cord segments with high resolution up to individual nerve fiber. Conclusions: By using simple neural labeling, staining, and transparency methods, it was possible to acquire a wide range of high-resolution three-dimensional images of the spinal cord.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Virtual reality-based sensorimotor adaptation shapes subsequent spontaneous and naturalistic stimulus-driven brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Our everyday life summons numerous novel sensorimotor experiences, to which our brain needs to adapt in order to function properly. However, tracking plasticity of naturalistic behaviour and associated brain modulations is challenging. Here we tackled this question implementing a prism adaptation training in virtual reality (VRPA) in combination with functional neuroimaging. Three groups of healthy participants (N=45) underwent VRPA (with a spatial shift either to the left/right side, or with no shift), and performed fMRI sessions before and after training. To capture modulations in free-flowing, task-free brain activity, the fMRI sessions included resting state and free viewing of naturalistic videos. We found significant decreases in spontaneous functional connectivity between large-scale cortical networks, namely attentional and default mode/fronto-parietal networks, only for adaptation groups. Additionally, VRPA was found to bias visual representations of naturalistic videos, as following rightward adaptation, we found upregulation of visual response in an area in the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) in the right hemisphere. Notably, the extent of POS upregulation correlated with the size of the VRPA induced after-effect measured in behavioural tests. This study demonstrates that a brief VRPA exposure is able to change large-scale cortical connectivity and correspondingly bias the representation of naturalistic sensory inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling Synaptic Effects of Anesthesia and its Cortical Cholinergic Reversal</a></h4>

              
                General anesthetics work through a variety of molecular mechanisms while resulting in the common end point of sedation and loss of consciousness. Generally, the administration of common inhalation anesthetics induces decreases in synaptic excitation while promoting synaptic inhibition. Animal studies have shown that, during anesthesia, exogenously induced increases in acetylcholine-mediated effects in the brain can elicit wakeful-like behavior despite the continued presence of the anesthetic. Less investigated, however, is the question of whether the brain's electrophysiological activity is also restored to pre-anesthetic levels and quality by such interventions. Here we apply a computational model of a network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to simulate the network effects of changes in synaptic inhibition and excitation due to anesthesia and its reversal by muscarinic receptor-mediated cholinergic effects. We use a differential evolution algorithm to fit model parameters to match measures of spiking activity, neuronal connectivity, and network dynamics recorded in the visual cortex of rodents during anesthesia with desflurane in vivo. We find that facilitating muscarinic receptor effects of acetylcholine on top of anesthetic-induced synaptic changes predicts reversal of the neurons spiking activity, functional connectivity, as well as pairwise and population interactions. Thus, our model results predict a possible neuronal mechanism for the induced reversal of the effects of anesthesia on post synaptic potentials, consistent with experimental behavioral observations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain injury environment critically influences the connectivity of transplanted neurons</a></h4>

              
                Cell transplantation is a promising approach for the reconstruction of neuronal circuits after brain damage. Transplanted neurons integrate with remarkable specificity into circuitries of the mouse cerebral cortex affected by neuronal ablation. However, it remains unclear how neurons perform in a local environment undergoing reactive gliosis, inflammation, macrophage infiltration and scar formation, as in traumatic brain injury (TBI). To elucidate this, we transplanted cells from the embryonic mouse cerebral cortex into TBI-injured, inflamed-only, or intact cortex of adult mice. Brain-wide quantitative connectomics unraveled graft inputs from correct regions across the brain in all conditions, with pronounced quantitative differences: scarce in intact and inflamed brain, versus exuberant after trauma. In the latter, excessive synapse pruning follows the initial overshoot of connectivity resulting in only a few connections left. Proteomic profiling identifies candidate molecules involved in the synaptic yield, a pivotal parameter to tailor for functional restoration of neuronal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Arousal elevation drives the development of oscillatory vocal output</a></h4>

              
                Adult behaviors, such as vocal production, often exhibit temporal regularity. In contrast, their immature forms are more irregular. We ask whether the coupling of motor behaviors with arousal changes give rise to temporal regularity and drive the transition from variable to regular motor output over the course of development. We used marmoset monkey vocal production to explore this putative influence of arousal on the nonlinear changes in their developing vocal output patterns. Based on a detailed analysis of vocal and arousal dynamics in marmosets, we put forth a general model incorporating arousal and auditory-feedback loops for spontaneous vocal production. Using this model, we show that a stable oscillation can emerge as the baseline arousal increases, predicting the transition from stochastic to periodic oscillations occurring in marmoset vocal development. We further provide a solution for how this model can explain vocal development as the joint consequence of energetic growth and social feedback. Together, our model offers a plausible mechanism for the development of arousal-mediated adaptive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing the Behavioral and Neuroendocrine Features of Susceptibility and Resilience to Social Stress</a></h4>

              
                Evaluating and coping with stressful social events as they unfold is a critical strategy in overcoming them without long-lasting detrimental effects. Individuals display a wide range of responses to stress, which can manifest in a variety of outcomes for the brain as well as subsequent behavior. Chronic Social Defeat Stress (CSDS) in mice has been widely used to model individual variation following a social stressor. Following a course of repeated intermittent psychological and physical stress, mice diverge into separate populations of social reactivity: resilient (socially interactive) and susceptible (socially avoidant) animals. A rich body of work reveals distinct neurobiological and behavioral consequences of this experience that map onto the resilient and susceptible groups. However, the range of factors that emerge over the course of defeat have not been fully described. Therefore, in the current study, we focused on characterizing behavioral, physiological, and neuroendocrine profiles of mice in three separate phases: before, during, and following CSDS. We found that following CSDS, traditional read-outs of anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors do not map on to the resilient and susceptible groups. By contrast, behavioral coping strategies used during the initial social stress encounter better predict which mice will eventually become resilient or susceptible. In particular, mice that will emerge as susceptible display greater escape behavior on Day 1 of social defeat than those that will emerge as resilient, indicating early differences in coping mechanisms used between the two groups. We further show that the social avoidance phenotype in susceptible mice is specific to the aggressor strain and does not generalize to conspecifics or other strains, indicating that there may be features of threat discrimination that are specific to the susceptible mice. Our findings suggest that there are costs and benefits to both the resilient and susceptible outcomes, reflected in their ability to cope and adapt to the social stressor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporally precise movement-based predictions in the mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Many of the sensations experienced by an organism are caused by their own actions, and accurately anticipating both the sensory features and timing of self-generated stimuli is crucial to a variety of behaviors. In the auditory cortex, neural responses to self-generated sounds exhibit frequency-specific suppression, suggesting that movement-based predictions may be implemented early in sensory processing. Yet it remains unknown whether this modulation results from a behaviorally specific and temporally precise prediction, nor is it known whether corresponding expectation signals are present locally in the auditory cortex. To address these questions, we trained mice to expect the precisely timed acoustic outcome of a forelimb movement using a closed-loop sound-generating lever. Dense neuronal recordings in the auditory cortex revealed suppression of responses to self-generated sounds that was specific to the expected acoustic features, specific to a precise time within the movement, and specific to the movement that was coupled to sound during training. Predictive suppression was concentrated in L2/3 and L5, where deviations from expectation also recruited a population of prediction-error neurons that was otherwise unresponsive. Recording in the absence of sound revealed abundant movement signals in deep layers that were biased toward neurons tuned to the expected sound, as well as temporal expectation signals that were present throughout the cortex and peaked at the time of expected auditory feedback. Together, these findings reveal that predictive processing in the mouse auditory cortex is consistent with a learned internal model linking a specific action to its temporally precise acoustic outcome, while identifying distinct populations of neurons that anticipate expected stimuli and differentially process expected versus unexpected outcomes.

	<p>Image segmentation still represents an active area of research since no universal solution can be identified. Traditional image segmentation algorithms are problem-specific and limited in scope. On the other hand, machine learning offers an alternative paradigm where predefined features are combined into different classifiers, providing pixel-level classification and segmentation. However, machine learning only can not address the question as to which features are appropriate for a certain classification problem. The article presents an automated image segmentation and classification platform, called Active Segmentation, which is based on ImageJ. The platform integrates expert domain knowledge, providing partial ground truth, with geometrical feature extraction based on multi-scale signal processing combined with machine learning. The approach in image segmentation is exemplified on the ISBI 2012 image segmentation challenge data set. As a second application we demonstrate whole image classification functionality based on the same principles. The approach is exemplified using the HeLa and HEp-2 data sets. Obtained results indicate that feature space enrichment properly balanced with feature selection functionality can achieve performance comparable to deep learning approaches. In summary, differential geometry can substantially improve the outcome of machine learning since it can enrich the underlying feature space with new geometrical invariant objects.</p>

	<p>Severe sensorineural hearing loss can be a symptom of the benign tumor vestibular schwannoma (VS). The treatment of VS with non-invasive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers a high local tumor control rate and an innovative possibility of sequential hearing rehabilitation with cochlear implantation. This study evaluated the feasibility, complications, and auditory outcomes of such a therapeutic approach. Three males and one female (mean age 65.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.4 years) scheduled for cochlear implantation and diagnosed with sporadic VS classified as T1 or T2 (according to Samii) were enrolled in this study. All patients had progressive hearing loss qualifying them for cochlear implantation. First, the tumor was treated using CyberKnife SRS. Next, sequential auditory rehabilitation with a cochlear implant (CI) was performed. Clinical outcomes and surgical feasibility were analyzed, and audiological results were evaluated using pure tone audiometry and speech recognition tests. All patients exhibited open-set speech understanding. The mean word recognition score (at 65 dB SPL, Freiburg Monosyllabic Test, FMT) improved after cochlear implantation in all four patients from 5.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10% (with hearing aid) preoperatively to 60.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 22.7% six months postoperatively. Our results suggest that in patients with profound hearing loss caused by sporadic vestibular schwannoma, the tumor removal with SRS followed by cochlear implantation is an effective method of auditory rehabilitation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reframing organizations in the digital age: A qualitative study exploring institutional social media adoption involving emergency physicians and other researchers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social media is changing the modern academic landscape; this study sought to explore how organizational structures support or inhibit the harnessing of social media use in academic contexts and knowledge translation. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using framework analysis based on the Bolman and Deal’s Four-Frame Model—structural, human resources, political and symbolic. The research team used the snowball sampling technique to recruit participants following the completion of each participant’s semi-structured interview. A member check was completed to ensure rigour. Results: 16 social media educators and experts from several countries participated in the study. Study findings showed that within the Structural Frame, participants’ organizations were reported to have with diverse hierarchical structures, ranging hospital-based (strict), education institutional-based and online only groups (malleable). The Human Resources Frame revealed that most participants’ social media organizations operated on unpaid volunteer staff. The training of these staff was primarily via role-modeling and mentorship. Regarding the Political Frame, social media helped participants accumulate scholarly currency and influence within their field of practice. The Symbolic Frame showed a wide range of traditional to non-traditional organizational supports, which interacted with both intrinsic to extrinsic motivation. Conclusions: Bolman and Deal’s Four-Frame Model framework may serve as an effective guideline for academic leaders who wish to strategically implement or enhance social media use into their organizations. The key insights that we have gained from our participants are how new emerging forms of scholarly pursuits can be more effectively enabled or hindered by the attributes of the organization within which these are occurring.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Biological performance of a bioabsorbable Poly (L-Lactic Acid) produced in polymerization unit: in vivo studies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The biomaterials engineering goal is to manufacture a biocompatible scaffold that adequately supports or improves tissue regeneration after implantation of the biomaterial in the injured area. Many requirements are demanded for a biomaterial, such as biocompatibility, elasticity, degradation time, and a very important factor is its cost of importation or synthesis, making its application inaccessible to some countries. Studies about biomaterials market show that Polylactic acid (PLLA) is one of the most used polymers, but expensive to produce. It becomes important to prove the biocompatibility of the new PLLA and to find strategies to produce biocompatible biopolymers at an acceptable production cost. Methods: In this work, the polylactic acid biomaterial was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization. The polymer was submitted to initial in vivo biocompatibility studies in 12 New Zealand female rabbits, assigned to two groups: (1) Lesion and PLLA group (n = 6), (2) Lesion No PLLA group (n = 6). Each group was divided into two subgroups at six and nine months post-surgical time. Before euthanasia clinical and biochemical studies were performed and after that tomographic (CT), histological (Hematoxylin and Eosin and Masson's trichrome) and histomorphometric analyses were performed to evaluate the injury site and prove biocompatibility. The final cost of this polymer was analyzed. Results: The statistical studies of hemogram and hepatocyte enzymes, showed that there were no significant differences between the groups for any of the times studied, in any of the variables considered and the results of CT and histology showed that there was an important process of neoregeneration. The cost analysis showed the biopolymer synthesis is between R$3,06 - R$5,49 cheaper than the import cost. Conclusions: It was possible to synthesize the PLLA biopolymer by cyclic ring opening, which proved to be biocompatible, potential osteoregenerative and cheaper than other imported biopolymers.

                Background: Customer churn is a term that refers to the rate at which customers leave the business. Churn could be due to various factors, including switching to a competitor, cancelling their subscription because of poor customer service, or discontinuing all contact with a brand due to insufficient touchpoints. Long-term relationships with customers are more effective than trying to attract new customers. A rise of 5% in customer satisfaction is followed by a 95% increase in sales. By analysing past behaviour, companies can anticipate future revenue. This article will look at which variables in the Net Promoter Score (NPS) dataset influence customer churn in Malaysia's telecommunications industry.  The aim of This study was to identify the factors behind customer churn and propose a churn prediction framework currently lacking in the telecommunications industry.   Methods: This study applied data mining techniques to the NPS dataset from a Malaysian telecommunications company in September 2019 and September 2020, analysing 7776 records with 30 fields to determine which variables were significant for the churn prediction model. We developed a propensity for customer churn using the Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine using 33 variables.   Results: Customer churn is elevated for customers with a low NPS. However, an immediate helpdesk can act as a neutral party to ensure that the customer needs are met and to determine an employee's ability to obtain customer satisfaction.   Conclusions: It can be concluded that CART has the most accurate churn prediction (98%). However, the research is prohibited from accessing personal customer information under Malaysia's data protection policy. Results are expected for other businesses to measure potential customer churn using NPS scores to gather customer feedback.

                Background: Eating habits are formed from childhood and develop into adulthood. Unhealthy eating habits will persist into adulthood and can lead  to various diseases. Healthy eating and behaviour should be taught using  engaging tools. The study aims to pilot nutrition education using the game-based learning approach, implementing a specially designed learning board game entitled "Gastronot". Methods: A mixed-method study was used in two stages. The first stage was an FGD with 14 informants and in-depth interviews with six informants to develop the game. The second stage was the game's development, and a pre and post-test were conducted on 88 children to evaluate the game—the study was conducted from August 2019 to July 2020. Results: Results showed almost half the children (49%) never heard about Balanced Nutrition Diet Pyramid. There was a significant difference between respondents' knowledge before and after playing the game with a p-value of 0.021. The game was able to engage participants in the active learning process. Conclusions: We concluded that the game-based learning utilizing the Gastronot board game demonstrated good results as a method for teaching primary school students about food and healthy eating habits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: A data-driven prioritization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fuminari Miura, Ka Yin Leung, Don Klinkenberg, Kylie E. C. Ainslie, Jacco Wallinga</p>

For the control of COVID-19, vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution. The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible allocation schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest. We use an approximation method to reconstruct the age-specific transmission intensity (the next generation matrix), and express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. This approach to allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Roles of mTOR in thoracic aortopathy understood by complex intracellular signaling interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ana C. Estrada, Linda Irons, Bruno V. Rego, Guangxin Li, George Tellides, Jay D. Humphrey</p>

Thoracic aortopathy–aneurysm, dissection, and rupture–is increasingly responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Advances in medical genetics and imaging have improved diagnosis and thus enabled earlier prophylactic surgical intervention in many cases. There remains a pressing need, however, to understand better the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms with the hope of finding robust pharmacotherapies. Diverse studies in patients and mouse models of aortopathy have revealed critical changes in multiple smooth muscle cell signaling pathways that associate with disease, yet integrating information across studies and models has remained challenging. We present a new quantitative network model that includes many of the key smooth muscle cell signaling pathways and validate the model using a detailed data set that focuses on hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and its inhibition using rapamycin. We show that the model can be parameterized to capture the primary experimental findings both qualitatively and quantitatively. We further show that simulating a population of cells by varying receptor reaction weights leads to distinct proteomic clusters within the population, and that these clusters emerge due to a bistable switch driven by positive feedback in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epitope profiling using computational structural modelling demonstrated on coronavirus-binding antibodies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah A. Robinson, Matthew I. J. Raybould, Constantin Schneider, Wing Ki Wong, Claire Marks, Charlotte M. Deane</p>

Identifying the epitope of an antibody is a key step in understanding its function and its potential as a therapeutic. Sequence-based clonal clustering can identify antibodies with similar epitope complementarity, however, antibodies from markedly different lineages but with similar structures can engage the same epitope. We describe a novel computational method for epitope profiling based on structural modelling and clustering. Using the method, we demonstrate that sequence dissimilar but functionally similar antibodies can be found across the Coronavirus Antibody Database, with high accuracy (92% of antibodies in multiple-occupancy structural clusters bind to consistent domains). Our approach functionally links antibodies with distinct genetic lineages, species origins, and coronavirus specificities. This indicates greater convergence exists in the immune responses to coronaviruses than is suggested by sequence-based approaches. Our results show that applying structural analytics to large class-specific antibody databases will enable high confidence structure-function relationships to be drawn, yielding new opportunities to identify functional convergence hitherto missed by sequence-only analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CoRE-ATAC: A deep learning model for the functional classification of regulatory elements from single cell and bulk ATAC-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Asa Thibodeau, Shubham Khetan, Alper Eroglu, Ryan Tewhey, Michael L. Stitzel, Duygu Ucar</p>

<i>Cis</i>-Regulatory elements (<i>cis</i>-REs) include promoters, enhancers, and insulators that regulate gene expression programs <i>via</i> binding of transcription factors. ATAC-seq technology effectively identifies active <i>cis</i>-REs in a given cell type (including from single cells) by mapping accessible chromatin at base-pair resolution. However, these maps are not immediately useful for inferring specific functions of <i>cis</i>-REs. For this purpose, we developed a deep learning framework (CoRE-ATAC) with novel data encoders that integrate DNA sequence (reference or personal genotypes) with ATAC-seq cut sites and read pileups. CoRE-ATAC was trained on 4 cell types (n = 6 samples/replicates) and accurately predicted known <i>cis</i>-RE functions from 7 cell types (n = 40 samples) that were not used in model training (mean average precision = 0.80, mean F1 score = 0.70). CoRE-ATAC enhancer predictions from 19 human islet samples coincided with genetically modulated gain/loss of enhancer activity, which was confirmed by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Finally, CoRE-ATAC effectively inferred <i>cis</i>-RE function from aggregate single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC) data from human blood-derived immune cells that overlapped with known functional annotations in sorted immune cells, which established the efficacy of these models to study <i>cis</i>-RE functions of rare cellswithout the need for cell sorting. ATAC-seq maps from primary human cells reveal individual- and cell-specific variation in <i>cis</i>-RE activity. CoRE-ATAC increases the functional resolution of these maps, a critical step for studying regulatory disruptions behind diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Viral surface geometry shapes influenza and coronavirus spike evolution through antibody pressure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Assaf Amitai</p>

The evolution of circulating viruses is shaped by their need to evade antibody response, which mainly targets the viral spike. Because of the high density of spikes on the viral surface, not all antigenic sites are targeted equally by antibodies. We offer here a geometry-based approach to predict and rank the probability of surface residues of SARS spike (S protein) and influenza H1N1 spike (hemagglutinin) to acquire antibody-escaping mutations utilizing in-silico models of viral structure. We used coarse-grained MD simulations to estimate the on-rate (targeting) of an antibody model to surface residues of the spike protein. Analyzing publicly available sequences, we found that spike surface sequence diversity of the pre-pandemic seasonal influenza H1N1 and the sarbecovirus subgenus highly correlates with our model prediction of antibody targeting. In particular, we identified an antibody-targeting gradient, which matches a mutability gradient along the main axis of the spike. This identifies the role of viral surface geometry in shaping the evolution of circulating viruses. For the 2009 H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, a mutability gradient along the main axis of the spike was not observed. Our model further allowed us to identify key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike at which antibody escape mutations have now occurred. Therefore, it can inform of the likely functional role of observed mutations and predict at which residues antibody-escaping mutation might arise.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From decision to action: Detailed modelling of frog tadpoles reveals neuronal mechanisms of decision-making and reproduces unpredictable swimming movements in response to sensory signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrea Ferrario, Andrey Palyanov, Stella Koutsikou, Wenchang Li, Steve Soffe, Alan Roberts, Roman Borisyuk</p>

How does the brain process sensory stimuli, and decide whether to initiate locomotor behaviour? To investigate this question we develop two whole body computer models of a tadpole. The “<i>Central Nervous System</i>” (<i>CNS</i>) model uses evidence from whole-cell recording to define 2000 neurons in 12 classes to study how sensory signals from the skin initiate and stop swimming. In response to skin stimulation, it generates realistic sensory pathway spiking and shows how hindbrain sensory memory populations on each side can compete to initiate reticulospinal neuron firing and start swimming. The 3-D “<i>Virtual Tadpo</i>le” (<i>VT</i>) biomechanical model with realistic muscle innervation, body flexion, body-water interaction, and movement is then used to evaluate if motor nerve outputs from the <i>CNS model</i> can produce swimming-like movements in a volume of “water”. We find that the whole tadpole <i>VT model</i> generates reliable and realistic swimming. Combining these two models opens new perspectives for experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Graphical integrity issues in open access publications: Detection and patterns of proportional ink violations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Han Zhuang, Tzu-Yang Huang, Daniel E. Acuna</p>

Academic graphs are essential for communicating complex scientific ideas and results. To ensure that these graphs truthfully reflect underlying data and relationships, visualization researchers have proposed several principles to guide the graph creation process. However, the extent of violations of these principles in academic publications is unknown. In this work, we develop a deep learning-based method to accurately measure violations of the proportional ink principle (AUC = 0.917), which states that the size of shaded areas in graphs should be consistent with their corresponding quantities. We apply our method to analyze a large sample of bar charts contained in 300K figures from open access publications. Our results estimate that 5% of bar charts contain proportional ink violations. Further analysis reveals that these graphical integrity issues are significantly more prevalent in some research fields, such as psychology and computer science, and some regions of the globe. Additionally, we find no temporal and seniority trends in violations. Finally, apart from openly releasing our large annotated dataset and method, we discuss how computational research integrity could be part of peer-review and the publication processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic optimization reveals alveolar epithelial cells as key mediators of host defense in invasive aspergillosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jan Ewald, Flora Rivieccio, Lukáš Radosa, Stefan Schuster, Axel A. Brakhage, Christoph Kaleta</p>

<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is an important human fungal pathogen and its conidia are constantly inhaled by humans. In immunocompromised individuals, conidia can grow out as hyphae that damage lung epithelium. The resulting invasive aspergillosis is associated with devastating mortality rates. Since infection is a race between the innate immune system and the outgrowth of <i>A. fumigatus</i> conidia, we use dynamic optimization to obtain insight into the recruitment and depletion of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Using this model, we obtain key insights into major determinants of infection outcome on host and pathogen side. On the pathogen side, we predict <i>in silico</i> and confirm <i>in vitro</i> that germination speed is an important virulence trait of fungal pathogens due to the vulnerability of conidia against host defense. On the host side, we found that epithelial cells, which have been underappreciated, play a role in fungal clearance and are potent mediators of cytokine release. Both predictions were confirmed by <i>in vitro</i> experiments on established cell lines as well as primary lung cells. Further, our model affirms the importance of neutrophils in invasive aspergillosis and underlines that the role of macrophages remains elusive. We expect that our model will contribute to improvement of treatment protocols by focusing on the critical components of immune response to fungi but also fungal virulence traits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Non-synaptic interactions between olfactory receptor neurons, a possible key feature of odor processing in flies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mario Pannunzi, Thomas Nowotny</p>

When flies explore their environment, they encounter odors in complex, highly intermittent plumes. To navigate a plume and, for example, find food, they must solve several challenges, including reliably identifying mixtures of odorants and their intensities, and discriminating odorant mixtures emanating from a single source from odorants emitted from separate sources and just mixing in the air. Lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe is commonly understood to help solving these challenges. With a computational model of the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system, we analyze the utility of an alternative mechanism for solving them: Non-synaptic (“ephaptic”) interactions (NSIs) between olfactory receptor neurons that are stereotypically co-housed in the same sensilla.
We find that NSIs improve mixture ratio detection and plume structure sensing and do so more efficiently than the traditionally considered mechanism of lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe. The best performance is achieved when both mechanisms work in synergy. However, we also found that NSIs <i>decrease</i> the dynamic range of co-housed ORNs, especially when they have similar sensitivity to an odorant. These results shed light, from a functional perspective, on the role of NSIs, which are normally avoided between neurons, for instance by myelination.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Poststroke dendritic arbor regrowth requires the actin nucleator Cobl</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuanyuan Ji, Dennis Koch, Jule González Delgado, Madlen Günther, Otto W. Witte, Michael M. Kessels, Christiane Frahm, Britta Qualmann</p>

Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and long-term disability. We demonstrate that middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice leads to a strong decline in dendritic arborization of penumbral neurons. These defects were subsequently repaired by an ipsilateral recovery process requiring the actin nucleator Cobl. Ischemic stroke and excitotoxicity, caused by calpain-mediated proteolysis, significantly reduced Cobl levels. In an apparently unique manner among excitotoxicity-affected proteins, this Cobl decline was rapidly restored by increased mRNA expression and Cobl then played a pivotal role in poststroke dendritic arbor repair in peri-infarct areas. In <i>Cobl</i> knockout (KO) mice, the dendritic repair window determined to span day 2 to 4 poststroke in wild type (WT) strikingly passed without any dendritic regrowth. Instead, Cobl KO penumbral neurons of the primary motor cortex continued to show the dendritic impairments caused by stroke. Our results thereby highlight a powerful poststroke recovery process and identified causal molecular mechanisms critical during poststroke repair.

                Background: Millennials are exposed to many investment opportunities, and they have shown their interest in gaining more income via investments. One popular investment avenue is unit trusts. However, analysing unit trusts’ financial data and gaining valuable insights may not be as simple because not everyone has the required financial knowledge and adequate time to perform in-depth analytics on the numerous financial data. Furthermore, it is not easy to compile the performance of each unit trust available in Malaysia. The primary objective of this research is to identify unit trust funds that provide higher returns than their average peers via performance profiling.  Methods: This research proposed a performance profiling on Malaysia unit trust funds using the two data mining techniques, i.e., Expectation Maximisation (EM) and Apriori, to assist amateur retail investors to choose the right unit trust based on their risk tolerance. EM clustered the unit trust funds in Malaysia into several groups based on their annual financial performances. This was then followed by finding the rules associated with each cluster by applying Apriori. The resulted rules shall serve the purpose of profiling the clustered unit trust funds. Retail investors can then select their preferred unit trust funds based on the performance profile of the clusters.  Results: The yearly average total return of the financial year 2018 and 2019 was used to evaluate unit trust funds’ performance in the clusters. The evaluation results indicated that the profiling could provide valuable and insightful information to retail investors with varying risk appetites.   Conclusions: This research has demonstrated that the financial performance profiling of unit trust funds could be acquired via data mining approaches. This valuable information is crucial to unit trust investors for selecting suitable funds in investment.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the hippocampal circuit: taming complexity</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus uses the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) to coordinate neuronal circuit activity while simultaneously influencing the function of non-neuronal cell types. The α7 nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) subtype is highly expressed throughout the hippocampus, has the highest calcium permeability compared with other subtypes of nAChRs, and is of high therapeutic interest due to its association with a variety of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The impact of stress on the hippocampal spatial code</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal function is severely compromised by prolonged, uncontrollable stress. However, how stress alters neural representations of our surroundings and events that occur within them remains less clear. We review hippocampal place cell studies that examine how spatial coding is affected by acute and chronic stress, as well as by stress accompanying fear conditioning. Emerging data suggest that chronic stress disrupts the acuity and specificity of CA1 spatial coding, both in familiar and novel contexts, and alters hippocampal oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Learning and attention increase visual response selectivity through distinct mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Learning and attention can enhance sensory processing in cortical circuits at longer and shorter timescales. By tracking the same excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex across learning and during attention switching, Poort et al. demonstrate that distinct mechanisms underlie the enhancement of sensory processing due to learning and attention.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nonlinear transient amplification in recurrent neural networks with short-term plasticity</a></h4>

              
                To rapidly process information, neural circuits have to amplify specific activity patterns transiently. How the brain performs this nonlinear operation remains elusive. Hebbian assemblies are one possibility whereby strong recurrent excitatory connections boost neuronal activity. However, such Hebbian amplification is often associated with dynamical slowing of network dynamics, non-transient attractor states, and pathological run-away activity. Feedback inhibition can alleviate these effects but typically linearizes responses and reduces amplification gain. Here we study nonlinear transient amplification (NTA), a plausible alternative mechanism that reconciles strong recurrent excitation with rapid amplification while avoiding the above issues. NTA has two distinct temporal phases. Initially, positive feedback excitation selectively amplifies inputs that exceed a critical threshold. Subsequently, short-term plasticity quenches the run-away dynamics into an inhibition-stabilized network state. By characterizing NTA in supralinear network models, we establish that the resulting onset transients are stimulus selective and well-suited for speedy information processing. Further, we find that excitatory-inhibitory co-tuning widens the parameter regime in which NTA is possible in the absence of persistent activity. In summary, NTA provides a parsimonious explanation for how excitatory-inhibitory co-tuning and short-term plasticity collaborate in recurrent networks to achieve transient amplification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rpl24Bst mutation suppresses colorectal cancer by promoting eEF2 phosphorylation via eEF2K</a></h4>

              
                Increased protein synthesis supports the rapid cell proliferation associated with cancer. The <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutant mouse reduces the expression of the ribosomal protein RPL24 and has been used to suppress translation and limit tumorigenesis in multiple mouse models of cancer. Here, we show that <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> also suppresses tumorigenesis and proliferation in a model of colorectal cancer (CRC) with two common patient mutations, <i>Apc</i> and <i>Kras</i>. In contrast to previous reports, <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutation has no effect on ribosomal subunit abundance but suppresses translation elongation through phosphorylation of eEF2, reducing protein synthesis by 40% in tumour cells. Ablating eEF2 phosphorylation in <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutant mice by inactivating its kinase, eEF2K, completely restores the rates of elongation and protein synthesis. Furthermore, eEF2K activity is required for the <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutant to suppress tumorigenesis. This work demonstrates that elevation of eEF2 phosphorylation is an effective means to suppress colorectal tumorigenesis with two driver mutations. This positions translation elongation as a therapeutic target in CRC, as well as in other cancers where the <i>Rpl24<sup>Bst</sup></i> mutation has a tumour suppressive effect in mouse models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diverse mating phenotypes impact the spread of wtf meiotic drivers in Schizosaccharomyces pombe</a></h4>

              
                Meiotic drivers are genetic elements that break Mendel's law of segregation to be transmitted into more than half of the offspring produced by a heterozygote. The success of a driver relies on outcrossing (mating between individuals from distinct lineages) because drivers gain their advantage in heterozygotes. It is, therefore, curious that <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, a species reported to rarely outcross, harbors many meiotic drivers. To address this paradox, we measured mating phenotypes in <i>S. pombe</i> natural isolates. We found that the propensity for cells from distinct clonal lineages to mate varies between natural isolates and can be affected both by cell density and by the available sexual partners. Additionally, we found that the observed levels of preferential mating between cells from the same clonal lineage can slow, but not prevent, the spread of a <i>wtf</i> meiotic driver in the absence of additional fitness costs linked to the driver. These analyses reveal parameters critical to understanding the evolution of <i>S. pombe</i> and help explain the success of meiotic drivers in this species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The landscape of regulatory genes in brain-wide neuronal phenotypes of a vertebrate brain</a></h4>

              
                Multidimensional landscapes of regulatory genes in neuronal phenotypes at whole-brain levels in the vertebrate remain elusive. We generated single-cell transcriptomes of ~67,000 region- and glutamatergic/neuromodulator-identifiable cells from larval zebrafish brains. Hierarchical clustering based on effector gene profiles ('terminal features') distinguished major brain cell types. Sister clusters at hierarchical termini displayed similar terminal features. It was further verified by a population-level statistical method. Intriguingly, glutamatergic/GABAergic sister clusters mostly expressed distinct transcriptional factor (TF) profiles ('convergent pattern'), whereas neuromodulator-type sister clusters predominantly expressed the same TF profiles ('matched pattern'). Interestingly, glutamatergic/GABAergic clusters with similar TF profiles could also display different terminal features ('divergent pattern'). It led us to identify a library of RNA-binding proteins that differentially marked divergent pair clusters, suggesting the post-transcriptional regulation of neuron diversification. Thus, our findings reveal multidimensional landscapes of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators in whole-brain neuronal phenotypes in the zebrafish brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Assembly status transition offers an avenue for activity modulation of a supramolecular enzyme</a></h4>

              
                Nature has evolved many supramolecular proteins assembled in certain, sometimes even seemingly oversophisticated, morphological manners. The rationale behind such evolutionary efforts is often poorly understood. Here, we provide atomic-resolution insights into how the dynamic building of a structurally complex enzyme with higher order symmetry offers amenability to intricate regulation. We have established the functional coupling between enzymatic activity and protein morphological states of glutamine synthetase (GS), an old multi-subunit enzyme essential for cellular nitrogen metabolism. Cryo-EM structure determination of GS in both the catalytically active and inactive assembly states allows us to reveal an unanticipated self-assembly-induced disorder-order transition paradigm, in which the remote interactions between two subcomplex entities significantly rigidify the otherwise structurally fluctuating active sites, thereby regulating activity. We further show in vivo evidences that how the enzyme morphology transitions could be modulated by cellular factors on demand. Collectively, our data present an example of how assembly status transition offers an avenue for activity modulation, and sharpens our mechanistic understanding of the complex functional and regulatory properties of supramolecular enzymes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The sleep-wake distribution contributes to the peripheral rhythms in PERIOD-2</a></h4>

              
                In the mouse, <i>Period-2</i> (<i>Per2</i>) expression in tissues peripheral to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) increases during sleep deprivation and at times of the day when animals are predominantly awake spontaneously, suggesting that the circadian sleep-wake distribution directly contributes to the daily rhythms in <i>Per2</i>. We found support for this hypothesis by recording sleep-wake state alongside PER2 bioluminescence in freely behaving mice, demonstrating that PER2 bioluminescence increases during spontaneous waking and decreases during sleep. The temporary reinstatement of PER2-bioluminescence rhythmicity in behaviorally arrhythmic SCN-lesioned mice submitted to daily recurring sleep deprivations substantiates our hypothesis. Mathematical modelling revealed that PER2 dynamics can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator driven by two forces: a sleep-wake-dependent force and a SCN-independent circadian force. Our work underscores the notion that in peripheral tissues the clock gene circuitry integrates sleep-wake information and could thereby contribute to behavioral adaptability to respond to homeostatic requirements.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of positive and negative selection and TCR signaling during thymic T cell development by capicua</a></h4>

              
                Central tolerance is achieved through positive and negative selection of thymocytes mediated by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling strength. Thus, dysregulation of the thymic selection process often leads to autoimmunity. Here, we show that Capicua (CIC), a transcriptional repressor that suppresses autoimmunity, controls the thymic selection process. Loss of CIC prior to T-cell lineage commitment impairs both positive and negative selection of thymocytes. CIC deficiency attenuated TCR signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) cells, as evidenced by a decrease in CD5 and phospho-ERK levels and calcium flux. We identified <i>Spry4</i>, <i>Dusp4</i>, <i>Dusp6,</i> and <i>Spred1</i> as CIC target genes that could inhibit TCR signaling in DP cells. Furthermore, impaired positive selection and TCR signaling were partially rescued in <i>Cic</i> and <i>Spry4</i> double mutant mice. Our findings indicate that CIC is a transcription factor required for thymic T cell development and suggests that CIC acts at multiple stages of T cell development and differentiation to prevent autoimmunity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9-POLD3 fusion</a></h4>

              
                Precision CRISPR gene editing relies on the cellular homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) to introduce custom DNA sequences to target sites. The HDR editing efficiency varies between cell types and genomic sites, and the sources of this variation are incompletely understood. Here, we have studied the effect of 450 DNA repair protein - Cas9 fusions on CRISPR genome editing outcomes. We find the majority of fusions to improve precision genome editing only modestly in a locus- and cell-type specific manner. We identify Cas9-POLD3 fusion that enhances editing by speeding up the initiation of DNA repair. We conclude that while DNA repair protein fusions to Cas9 can improve HDR CRISPR editing, most need to be optimized to the cell type and genomic site, highlighting the diversity of factors contributing to locus-specific genome editing outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Progressive alterations of striatal polysomal architecture in a mouse model of Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on a precise spatial and temporal control of protein synthesis due to their highly polarized morphology and their functional singularities. Consequently, alterations in protein translation have been widely related to the development and progression of various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease. Here we explored the architecture of polysomes in their native brain context by performing 3D electron tomography of striatal tissue derived from a knock-in mouse model of the disease. Results showed a progressive remodelling towards a polysomal compacted architecture that parallels in time the emergence and progression of symptoms in the mouse model. The aberrant architecture is compatible with ribosome stalling phenomena and, in fact, we detected an increase in the expression of the stalling release factor eIF5A2. Polysomal sedimentation gradients showed significant excess in the accumulation of free 40S ribosomal subunits in heterozygous striatal samples. Overall the results indicate that changes in the architecture of the protein synthesis machinery might be at the basis of translational alterations associated to Huntington's disease and open new avenues for understanding disease progression.

                Astrocytes play important roles in the function and survival of neuronal cells. Dysfunctions of astrocytes are associated with numerous disorders and diseases of the nervous system, including motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based approaches are becoming increasingly important for the study of the mechanisms underlying the involvement of astrocytes in non-cell autonomous processes of motor neuron degeneration in ALS. These studies must account for the molecular and functional diversity among astrocytes in different regions of the brain and spinal cord. It is essential that the most pathologically-relevant astrocyte preparations are used when investigating non-cell autonomous mechanisms of either upper or lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS. In this context, the main aim of this study was to establish conditions enabling rapid and robust generation of physiologically-relevant ventral spinal cord-like astrocytes that would provide an enhanced experimental model for the study of lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Neural progenitor cells with validated caudal and ventral features were derived from human iPSCs and differentiated into astrocytes, which were then characterized by examining morphology, markers of ventral spinal cord astrocytes, spontaneous and induced calcium transients, and astrogliosis markers. Efficient and streamlined generation of human iPSC-derived astrocytes with molecular and biological properties similar to physiological astrocytes in the ventral spinal cord was achieved. These induced astrocytes express markers of mature ventral spinal cord astrocytes, exhibit spontaneous and ATP-induced calcium transients, and lack signs of overt activation. Human iPSC-derived astrocytes with ventral spinal features offer advantages over more generic astrocyte preparations for the study of both ventral spinal cord astrocyte biology and the involvement of astrocytes in mechanisms of lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

                Probing the external world is essential for eukaryotes to distinguish beneficial from pathogenic microorganisms. If it is clear that this task falls to the immune cells, recent work shows that neurons can also detect microbes, although the molecules and mechanisms involved are less characterized. In Drosophila, detection of bacteria-derived peptidoglycan by pattern recognition receptor (PRR) of the PGRP family expressed in immune cells, triggers NF-kB/IMD dependent signaling. We show here that one PGRP protein, called PGRP-LB, is expressed in some proboscis's bitter taste neurons. In vivo calcium imaging reveals that the PGRP/IMD pathway is cell-autonomously required in these neurons to transduce the PGN signal. We finally show that NF-kB/IMD pathway activation in bitter neurons influences fly behavior. This demonstrates that flies use the same bacterial elicitor and signaling module to sense bacterial presence via the peripheral nervous system and trigger an anti-bacterial response in immune-competent cells.

                While it is well-established that bone responds dynamically to mechanical loading, the effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) on cranial bone composition are unclear. We hypothesized that repeated mTBI (rmTBI) would change the microstructure of cranial bones, without gross skull fractures. To address this, young adult female Piebald Viral Glaxo rats received sham, 1x, 2x or 3x closed-head mTBIs delivered at 24h intervals, using a weight drop device custom built for reproducible impact. Skull bones were collected at 2 or 10 weeks after the final injury/sham procedure, imaged by micro computed tomography and analyzed at predetermined regions of interest. In the interparietal bone, proximal to the injury site, modest increases in bone thickness was observed at 2 weeks, particularly following 3x mTBI. By 10 weeks, 2x mTBI induced a robust increase in the volume and thickness of the interparietal bone, alongside a corresponding decrease in the volume of marrow cavities in the diploe region. In contrast, neither parietal nor frontal skull samples were affected by rmTBI. Our findings demonstrate time- and location-dependent effects of rmTBI on cranial bone structure, highlighting a need to consider microstructural alterations to cranial bone when assessing the consequences of rmTBI.

                Ultrasonic vocalizations in mice have recently been widely investigated as social behavior; however, using existing sound localization systems in home cages, which allow observations of more undisturbed behavior expressions, is challenging. We introduce a novel system, named USVCAM, that uses a phased microphone array and demonstrate novel vocal interactions under a resident-intruder paradigm. The extended applicability and usability of USVCAM may facilitate investigations of social behaviors and underlying physiological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Continual reelin signaling by the prime neurogenic niche of the adult brain</a></h4>

              
                During development reelin sets the pace of neocortical neurogenesis enabling in turn newborn neurons to migrate, but whether and, if so, how reelin signaling affects the adult neurogenic niches remains uncertain. We show that reelin signaling, resulting in Dab1 phosphorylation, occurs in the ependymal-subependymal zone (EZ/SEZ) of the lateral ventricles where, along with its associated rostral migratory stream (RMS), the highest density of functional ApoER2 accumulates. Mice deficient for reelin, ApoER2 or Dab1 exhibit enlarged ventricles and dysplastic RMS. Moreover, while the conditional ablation of Dab1 in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) enlarges the ventricles and impairs neuroblasts clearance from the SEZ, the transgenic misexpression of reelin in NPCs of reelin-deficient mice normalizes the ventricular lumen and the density of ependymal cilia, ameliorating in turn neuroblasts migration; consistently, intraventricular infusion of reelin reroutes neuroblasts. These results demonstrate that reelin signaling persists sustaining the germinal niche of the lateral ventricles and influencing neuroblasts migration in the adult brain.
