              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14957">POCO: Scalable Neural Forecasting through Population Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15190">Learning Task-Agnostic Skill Bases to Uncover Motor Primitives in Animal Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.15190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01183">Inverted Inference and Recursive Bootstrapping: A Primal-Dual Theory of Structured Cognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.01183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unifying framework that links the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) with optimal transport (OT) via primal-dual inference. We propose that cognitive representations are not static encodings but active dual constraints that shape feasible manifolds for learning and inference. Cognition is formalized as the dynamic alignment of high-entropy contexts with low-entropy content, implemented through cycle-consistent inference that minimizes conditional entropy. Central to this framework is the concept of inverted inference: a goal-driven mechanism that reverses the direction of conditioning to simulate latent trajectories consistent with internal goals. This asymmetric inference cycle closes the duality gap in constrained optimization, aligning context (primal variables) with content (dual constraints), and reframing inference as structure-constrained entropy minimization. Temporally, we introduce recursive bootstrapping, where each inference cycle sharpens the structural manifold for the next, forming memory chains that support path-dependent optimization and hierarchical goal decomposition. Spatially, we extend the model via hierarchical spatial bootstrapping, connecting to Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs to enable sublinear retrieval of goal-consistent latent states. Altogether, this framework provides a computational theory of cognition in which dynamic alignment across time and space supports efficient generalization, abstraction, and adaptive planning. CCUP emerges as a scalable principle for both slow, recursive reasoning and fast, structure-aware recognition through layered primal-dual cycles.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22893">The global communication pathways of the human brain transcend the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar division</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how cortex, subcortex and cerebellum integrate is a major challenge for neuroscience, however, studies of the brain's structural connectivity have mostly focused on cortico-cortical links. Here, we used diffusion imaging to construct the structural connectome of the entire human brain including 360 cortical, 233 subcortical, and 125 cerebellar regions of interest (ROIs). We found that the brain forms a modular and hierarchical network architecture, organized into modules of mixed cortical, subcortical and/or cerebellar regions, and whose cross-modular pathways are centralized through highly connected hub ROIs (a `rich-club'). This global rich-club is subcortically dominated and, surprisingly, composed of hub ROIs from all subcortical structures rather than one region like the thalamus, centralizing the communication pathways. This study improves our understanding of the human brain's organization. It provides structural evidence to question the prevalent cortico-centric notion by revealing a connectome centered at the subcortex but made of transversal pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12187">Characterizing Neural Manifolds' Properties and Curvatures using Normalizing Flows</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.12187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuronal activity is found to lie on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional neuron space. Variants of principal component analysis are frequently employed to assess these manifolds. These methods are, however, limited by assuming a Gaussian data distribution and a flat manifold. In this study, we introduce a method designed to satisfy three core objectives: (1) extract coordinated activity across neurons, described either statistically as correlations or geometrically as manifolds; (2) identify a small number of latent variables capturing these structures; and (3) offer an analytical and interpretable framework characterizing statistical properties by a characteristic function and describing manifold geometry through a collection of charts.
  To this end, we employ Normalizing Flows (NFs), which learn an underlying probability distribution of data by an invertible mapping between data and latent space. Their simplicity and ability to compute exact likelihoods distinguish them from other generative networks. We adjust the NF's training objective to distinguish between relevant (in manifold) and noise dimensions (out of manifold). Additionally, we find that different behavioral states align with the components of the latent Gaussian mixture model, enabling their treatment as distinct curved manifolds. Subsequently, we approximate the network for each mixture component with a quadratic mapping, allowing us to characterize both neural manifold curvature and non-Gaussian correlations among recording channels.
  Applying the method to recordings in macaque visual cortex, we demonstrate that state-dependent manifolds are curved and exhibit complex statistical dependencies. Our approach thus enables an expressive description of neural population activity, uncovering non-linear interactions among groups of neurons.

                arXiv:2503.09980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Landauer's principle sets a fundamental energy limit for irreversible digital computation, we show that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented on analog physical substrates can operate under markedly different thermodynamic constraints. We distinguish between two classes of analog systems: dynamic and quasi-static. In dynamic systems, energy dissipation arises from neuron resets, with a lower bound governed by Landauer's principle. To analyse a quasi-static analog platform, we construct an explicit mapping of a generic feedforward DNN onto a physical system described by a model Hamiltonian. In this framework, inference can proceed reversibly, with no minimum free energy cost imposed by thermodynamics. We further analyze the training process in quasi-static analog networks and derive a fundamental lower bound on its energy cost, rooted in the interplay between thermal and statistical noise. Our results suggest that while analog implementations can outperform digital ones during inference, the thermodynamic cost of training scales similarly in both paradigms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07481">Decoding Saccadic Eye Movements from Brain Signals Using an Endovascular Neural Interface</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.07481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.

                arXiv:2506.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do, synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15222">The Pitfalls and Potentials of Adding Gene-invariance to Optimal Mixing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal Mixing (OM) is a variation operator that integrates local search with genetic recombination. EAs with OM are capable of state-of-the-art optimization in discrete spaces, offering significant advantages over classic recombination-based EAs. This success is partly due to high selection pressure that drives rapid convergence. However, this can also negatively impact population diversity, complicating the solving of hierarchical problems, which feature multiple layers of complexity. While there have been attempts to address this issue, these solutions are often complicated and prone to bias. To overcome this, we propose a solution inspired by the Gene Invariant Genetic Algorithm (GIGA), which preserves gene frequencies in the population throughout the process. This technique is tailored to and integrated with the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA), resulting in GI-GOMEA. The simple, yet elegant changes are found to have striking potential: GI-GOMEA outperforms GOMEA on a range of well-known problems, even when these problems are adjusted for pitfalls - biases in much-used benchmark problems that can be easily exploited by maintaining gene invariance. Perhaps even more notably, GI-GOMEA is also found to be effective at solving hierarchical problems, including newly introduced asymmetric hierarchical trap functions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15602">Estimate Hitting Time by Hitting Probability for Elitist Evolutionary Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drift analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing the time complexity of evolutionary algorithms. However, it requires manual construction of drift functions to bound hitting time for each specific algorithm and problem. To address this limitation, general linear drift functions were introduced for elitist evolutionary algorithms. But calculating linear bound coefficients effectively remains a problem. This paper proposes a new method called drift analysis of hitting probability to compute these coefficients. Each coefficient is interpreted as a bound on the hitting probability of a fitness level, transforming the task of estimating hitting time into estimating hitting probability. A novel drift analysis method is then developed to estimate hitting probability, where paths are introduced to handle multimodal fitness landscapes. Explicit expressions are constructed to compute hitting probability, significantly simplifying the estimation process. One advantage of the proposed method is its ability to estimate both the lower and upper bounds of hitting time and to compare the performance of two algorithms in terms of hitting time. To demonstrate this application, two algorithms for the knapsack problem, each incorporating feasibility rules and greedy repair respectively, are compared. The analysis indicates that neither constraint handling technique consistently outperforms the other.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14951">Flat Channels to Infinity in Neural Loss Landscapes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.14951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

                arXiv:2506.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

                arXiv:2506.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335">Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this by fitting together linear pieces perfectly via the Kuhn triangulation, and we introduce a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03943">Oscillatory State-Space Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k.

                arXiv:2503.01325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detailed scheduling has traditionally been optimized for the reduction of makespan and manufacturing costs. However, growing awareness of environmental concerns and increasingly stringent regulations are pushing manufacturing towards reducing the carbon footprint of its operations. Scope 2 emissions, which are the indirect emissions related to the production and consumption of grid electricity, are in fact estimated to be responsible for more than one-third of the global GHG emissions. In this context, carbon-aware scheduling can serve as a powerful way to reduce manufacturing's carbon footprint by considering the time-dependent carbon intensity of the grid and the availability of on-site renewable electricity.
  This study introduces a carbon-aware permutation flow-shop scheduling model designed to reduce scope 2 emissions. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem, taking into account the forecasted grid generation mix and available on-site renewable electricity, along with the set of jobs to be scheduled and their corresponding power requirements. The objective is to find an optimal day-ahead schedule that minimizes scope 2 emissions. The problem is addressed using a dedicated memetic algorithm, combining evolutionary strategy and local search.
  Results from computational experiments confirm that by considering the dynamic carbon intensity of the grid and on-site renewable electricity availability, substantial reductions in carbon emissions can be achieved.

                arXiv:2503.15576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring is a key tool for biodiversity conservation, but the large volumes of unsupervised audio it generates present major challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning offers promising solutions. BirdNET, a widely used bird identification model, has shown success in many study systems but is limited at local scale due to biases in its training data, which focus on specific locations and target sounds rather than entire soundscapes. A key challenge in bird species identification is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations, complicating automatic identification. To address these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a wetland of high conservation concern. We deployed AudioMoth recorders in three main habitats across nine locations and manually annotated 461 minutes of audio, resulting in 3749 labeled segments spanning 34 classes. We first applied a Bird Song Detector to isolate bird vocalizations using spectrogram-based image processing. Then, species were classified using custom models trained at the local scale. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of detector and fine-tuned BirdNET outperformed the baseline without detection. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with local classification models. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools to specific ecological challenges. Automatically detecting bird species helps track the health of this threatened ecosystem, given birds sensitivity to environmental change, and supports conservation planning to reduce biodiversity loss.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Decision-making is typically influenced by past choices. Previous studies have shown that the activity of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is involved in reward value coding, can be modulated by the reward values of previously chosen options. To further explore how the OFC processes the history of choice-related factors (HCF) from past choices, we analyzed the neuronal activity recorded in the monkey OFC during a decision-making task in which the monkeys could choose between two options based on their reward values. We found that the activity of over 70% of neurons was better explained by models that incorporated HCF than by models without it. The activity of these neurons during current choice was influenced by HCF in the previous trial. Additionally, some types of HCF were represented in these neurons between trials, suggesting that this information was maintained in the OFC and used to guide future decisions. Furthermore, a significant difference was observed in the choice reaction times between trials sorted by HCF. Pharmacological inactivation of the OFC by muscimol infusion eliminated such behavioral differences. These results indicate that HCF-modulated OFC activity contributes to the behavioral bias during current decision-making.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study explores how the morphology of the left occipito-temporal sulcus and anterior cingulate cortex relates to reading and writing abilities. The occipito-temporal sulcus, which houses the visual word form area (VWFA), and the anterior cingulate cortex, involved in cognitive control, are key regions for literacy. Structural MRI scans from 38 children (aged 8 to 11) and 23 adults (aged 20 to 40) were analyzed to identify their sulcal patterns. Reading and writing (spelling and graphomotor) performance was assessed using standardized tests indexing both accuracy and speed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the left posterior occipito-temporal sulcus was associated with reading scores in both children and adults, and with graphomotor scores in children only. The anterior occipito-temporal sulcus and right hemisphere occipito-temporal sulcus also contributed to reading and writing outcomes. Anterior cingulate cortex asymmetry was linked to graphomotor performance in both age groups, highlighting its role in writing development. Since sulcal patterns are established prenatally and remain stable over time, the findings suggest that differences in literacy may partly originate from early brain development, alongside the neuroplastic effects of education and socioeconomic factors. This research underscores the interplay between early brain development, literacy, and the neuroplasticity shaped by learning experiences throughout life.</span>

                <p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the central circadian clock in mammals, coordinating daily rhythms in both behavior and physiology. In the SCN, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-producing neurons (GRPNs) are predominantly located in the core region, suggesting their possible involvement in photic entrainment. However, the specific contribution of GRPNs to the regulation of circadian rhythms remains poorly understood. This study utilized a Cre-driver mouse line, <I>Grp-iCre</I> knock-in (KI) mice, in which Cre recombinase is exclusively expressed in GRPNs, allowing the selective manipulation of SCN GRPNs to investigate their characteristics and functional roles in circadian regulation. All experiments were conducted in adult male mice. Anatomical tracing revealed that SCN GRPNs primarily project to the thalamus and hypothalamus, whereas input mapping demonstrated that SCN GRPNs receive most synaptic inputs from within the SCN. Behavioral analyses revealed that neither GRP deficiency nor ablation of SCN GRPNs significantly affected circadian locomotor activity rhythms or photic entrainment. However, chemogenetic stimulation of the SCN GRPNs is sufficient to induce phase shifts in behavioral rhythms. Additionally, calcium imaging with fiber photometry indicated that SCN GRPNs quickly responded to photic stimulation, with increased neural activity following retinal exposure to white light. These findings suggest that SCN GRPNs play a role in photic entrainment, albeit potentially redundant with other neuronal populations such as vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing neurons.</p>

                <p>Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are intermittent, fast synchronous oscillations that play a pivotal role in memory formation. It has been well established that SWRs occur during "consummatory behaviors," e.g., eating or drinking a reward for correct action. However, most of typical behavioral experiments using freely moving rodents have not rigorously distinguished between the act of eating/drinking (regardless of consummation or consumption) from stopping locomotion (immobility). Therefore, in this study, we investigated the occurrence of SWRs during a reward-seeking action and subsequent consummatory reward licking in constantly immobile rats (male and female) maintained under head fixation and body covering. Immobile rats performed a pedal hold&ndash;release action that was rewarded with water every other time (false and true consummation). Unexpectedly, the SWRs remarkably decreased during reward licking as well as pedal release action. Untrained rats also showed a similar SWR decrease during water licking. Conversely, SWRs gradually increased during the pedal hold period, which was enhanced by reward expectation. A cluster of hippocampal neurons responded to cue/pedal release and reward, as previously shown. Some other clusters exhibited spike activity changes similar to the SWR occurrence, i.e., decreasing during the pedal release action and reward licking, and enhanced by reward expectation during pedal hold period. These task event-responsive neurons and SWR-like neurons displayed stronger spiking synchrony with SWRs than task-unrelated neurons. These findings suggest that the hippocampus generates SWRs, which may associate action with outcome, in "relative immobility" (action pauses) rather than specific consummation or consumption.</p>

                <p>Dynorphin (DYN)/-opioid receptor (KOR) activation contributes to aversion, dysphoria, sedation, depression, and enhanced psychostimulant-rewarding effects by inhibiting dopamine (DA) release. The precise neuronal mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear, limiting the use of KOR agonists in treating mood and substance use disorders. DYN fibers form synapses with DA terminals that express KOR and dopamine transporter (DAT), which is crucial for regulating DA dynamics and related behaviors. Previously, we demonstrated that KOR agonists upregulate DAT activity via ERK1/2 signaling involving phospho-Thr53 DAT (pT53-DAT). However, it remains unclear whether pT53-DAT is involved in KOR-mediated DAT regulation in vivo and whether such a phenomenon contributes to the behavioral effects of KOR agonism. In this study, we utilized male DAT-Ala53 knock-in mice with nonphosphorylatable Ala at position 53 to investigate the role of pT53-DAT in KOR-mediated DAT regulation and its behavioral effects. KOR agonist U69593 increased KOR antagonist-sensitive DAT activity, DAT <I>V</I><SUB>max</SUB>, pT53-DAT, and surface expression in WT but not in DAT-Ala53 mice. KOR agonists caused locomotor suppression, conditioned place aversion (CPA), and enhanced cocaine preference [conditioned place preference (CPP)] in WT but not in DAT-Ala53 mice. Conversely, both WT and DAT-Ala53 mice exhibited similar lithium chloride-induced CPA and morphine-induced CPP. These findings provide the first causal evidence that KOR-mediated locomotor suppression, aversive response, and enhancement of cocaine reward manifest through the modulation of DAT activity via DAT-Thr53 phosphorylation. This suggests that targeting specific DAT-regulatory motif(s) may help develop new KOR-directed therapeutic strategies devoid of adverse effects.</p>

                <p>Spatial frequency (SF) selectivity serves as a fundamental building block within the visual system, determining what we can and cannot see. Attention is theorized to augment the visibility of items in our environment by changing how we process SFs. However, the specific neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear, particularly in humans. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure voxel-wise population SF tuning (pSFT), which allowed us to examine how attention alters the SF response profiles of neural populations in the early visual cortex (V1&ndash;V3). In the scanner, participants (five female, three male) were cued to covertly attend to one of two spatially competing letter streams, each defined by low or high SF content. This task promoted feature-based attention directed to a particular SF, as well as the suppression of the irrelevant stream's SF. Concurrently, we measured pSFT in a task-irrelevant hemifield to examine how the known spatial spread of feature-based attention influenced the SF tuning properties of neurons sampled within a voxel. We discovered that attention elicited attractive shifts in SF preference, toward the attended SF. This suggests that attention can profoundly influence populations of SF preference across the visual field, depending on task goals and native neural preferences.</p>

                <p>While animal studies have found that arousal states modulate visual responses, direct evidence for effects of arousal on human vision remains limited. Here, we used fMRI to examine effects of cognitive arousal on the gain of contrast response functions (CRFs) in human visual cortex. To measure CRFs, we measured BOLD responses in early visual cortex (V1&ndash;V3) while participants (<I>n</I> = 20, 14 females and 6 males) viewed stimuli that parametrically varied in contrast. To induce different cognitive arousal states, participants solved auditory arithmetic problems categorized as either Easy (low arousal) or Hard (high arousal). We found diversity in the modulatory effects across individuals: some individuals exhibited enhanced neural response with increased arousal, whereas others exhibited the opposite effect&mdash;a decrease in response with increased arousal. The pattern of overall BOLD modulation showed within-individual stability and was correlated with the degree of arousal-driven change in pupil size. Individuals who exhibited larger increases in pupil size with the arousal manipulation tended to show greater arousal-related decreases in visuocortical responses. We speculate that the polarity of the modulatory effect by cognitive arousal may relate to individual differences in cognitive effort expended in the high-difficulty condition, with individuals reaching different points on an underlying non-monotonic function.</p>

                <p>Neuronal activity in the olfactory bulb (OB) drives coordinated activity in the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network during early development. Inhibiting OB output in neonatal mice disrupts functional development of the hippocampal formation as well as cognitive abilities. These impairments manifest early in life and resemble dysfunctions of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex that have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, we investigated OB activity during early development in a disease mouse model and asked whether activity disruptions might contribute to the dysfunctional development of the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network. We addressed this question by combining in vivo electrophysiology with behavioral assessment of immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice of both sexes that mimic the dual genetic&ndash;environmental etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. In wild-type mice, we found high DISC1 expression levels in OB projection neurons during development. Furthermore, neuronal and network activity in the OB and the drive from the bulb to the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network were reduced in immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice during early development. This early deficit did not affect odor-evoked activity and odor perception but resulted in impaired long-term odor memory. We propose that reduced spontaneous activity in the developing OB might contribute to altered maturation of the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network, leading to memory impairment in immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice.</p>

                <p>Rats quickly learn to fear a stimulus (e.g., a light) that signals brief but painful footshock. The consolidation of this first-order conditioned fear requires transcription and translation of specific genes in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Rats also learn to fear the associates of first-order conditioned stimuli, such as a sound paired with the already-conditioned light. The consolidation of this second-order conditioned fear also requires transcriptional processes in the BLA, but unlike consolidation of first-order fear, it is unaffected by BLA infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Accordingly, this study sought to identify genes/pathways that regulate second-order conditioned fear in male rats. It focused on the involvement of immediate early genes, as these can be transcribed in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. In Experiment 1, we used a principal components analysis of PCR data and found that second-order fear conditioning involves region- and time-specific changes in a network of genes including the immediate early genes <I>bdnf</I> and <I>egr1</I>. In Experiments 2&ndash;4, we used BLA infusions of antisense oligonucleotides and found that <I>bdnf</I> is required for consolidation of both first- and second-order fears but is not required for reconsolidation of either and <I>egr1</I> is not required for consolidation of first-order fear but is required for acquisition of second-order fear and reconsolidation of both types of fear. Hence, <I>bdnf</I> and <I>egr1</I> regulate different aspects of first- and second-order fear conditioning in the BLA. These findings are discussed with respect to novel forms of information processing in the mammalian brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e1447242025?rss=1">The Functional Anatomy of Nociception: Effective Connectivity in Chronic Pain and Placebo Response</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic pain presents a widespread and complex clinical puzzle, necessitating theoretical approaches. This study expands upon our evolving comprehension of the brain&rsquo;s top-down information processing, encompassing functions such as prediction, expectation, and attention. These processes are believed to play a substantial role in shaping both chronic pain and placebo responses. To examine hierarchical cortical processing in pain, we define a minimal cortical pain network comprising the lateral frontal pole, the primary somatosensory cortex, and posterior insula. Using spectral dynamic causal modeling on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we compare effective connectivity among these regions in chronic osteoarthritic patients (<I>n</I> = 54) and healthy controls (<I>n</I> = 18), and further analyze differences in placebo responders and non-responders within the patient group. Our findings reveal distinct patterns of altered top-down, bottom-up, and recurrent (i.e., intrinsic)  effective connectivity within the network in chronic pain and placebo response. Specifically, recurrent connectivity within the lateral frontal pole becomes more inhibitory, while backward connectivity (higher-to-lower cortical regions) decreases in both pain perceivers and placebo responders. Conversely, forward connections show opposite patterns: nociception is associated with more excitatory (disinhibited) connections, whereas placebo responses correspond to more inhibitory forward connections. The associated effect sizes were sufficiently large to survive a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis of predictive validity. The observed alterations are consistent with predictive processing accounts of placebo effects and chronic pain. Overall, effective extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity among cortical regions involved in pain processing emerge as potentially valuable and quantifiable markers of pain perception and placebo response.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e1488242025?rss=1">Complex Impact of Stimulus Envelope on Motor Synchronization to Sound</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human brain tracks temporal regularities in acoustic signals faithfully. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown complex modulations of synchronized neural activities to the shape of stimulus envelopes. How to connect neural responses to different envelope shapes with listeners&rsquo; perceptual ability to synchronize to acoustic rhythms requires further characterization. Here, we examine motor and sensory synchronization to noise stimuli with periodic amplitude modulations (AM) in human participants (14 females, 10 males). We used three envelope shapes that varied in the sharpness of amplitude onset. In a synchronous motor finger-tapping task, we show that participants more consistently align their taps to the same phase of stimulus envelope when listening to stimuli with sharp onsets than to those with gradual onsets. This effect is replicated in a sensory synchronization task, suggesting a sensory basis for the facilitated phase alignment to sharp-onset stimuli. Surprisingly, despite less consistent tap alignments to the envelope of gradual-onset stimuli, participants are equally effective in extracting the rate of amplitude modulation from both sharp and gradual-onset stimuli, and they tapped consistently at that rate alongside the acoustic input. This result demonstrates that robust tracking of the rate of acoustic periodicity is achievable without the presence of sharp acoustic edges or consistent phase alignment to stimulus envelope. Our findings are consistent with assuming distinct processes for phase and rate tracking during sensorimotor synchronization. These processes are most likely underpinned by different neural mechanisms whose relative strengths are modulated by specific temporal dynamics of stimulus envelope characteristics.</p>

                <p>Reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in the human brain has been inferred through somatic retroinsertion/retrotransposition events; however, actual endogenous enzymatic activities and sources remain unclear. L1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons bicistronically express ORF2, containing RT and endonuclease (EN) domains, and RNA-binding protein ORF1, together enabling L1 retrotransposition and contributing to somatic genomic mosaicism. Here, we assessed endogenous RT activities and L1 mRNA diversity from cerebral cortex samples of 31 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and nondiseased (ND) brains (both sexes) using enzymatic functional assays, targeted PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, and quantitative spatial transcriptomics. Expected bicistronic, full-length L1 transcripts were absent from most samples, constituting &lt;0.01% of L1 sequences, of which &gt;80% were noncoding. Monocistronic ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts were identified across all samples, consistent with quantitative spatial transcriptomics that identified discordant ORF2 and ORF1 expression in neurons. All brains had RT activity, with AD samples showing less activity, consistent with neuronal loss of terminal AD versus aged ND donors. Brain RT activity was higher in the gray matter and correlated with increased neuronal ORF2 expression, further supporting neuronal contributions. Remarkably, &gt;550 protein-encoding, poly(A<sup>+</sup>) ORF2 sequence variants were identified, over two times more than identified in the human reference genome (hg38). Experimental overexpression of full-length and truncated ORF2 variants revealed ~50-fold RT and ~1.3-fold EN activity ranges, supporting endogenous functional capacity of monocistronic ORF2 variants in the human brain. The vast sequence diversity of monocistronic ORF2 mRNAs could underlie functional differences in RT-mediated somatic gene recombination/retroinsertion and resulting genomic mosaicism in the normal and diseased brain.</p>

                <p>This study examined how amyloid burden affects structural and functional brain network topology in subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a risk condition for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Functional and structural brain networks were analyzed in 100 individuals with SCD and 86 normal controls (NC; both sexes included) using resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging. Topological properties of brain networks were evaluated as indicators of information exchange efficiency and network robustness. Amyloid burden in 55 SCD participants was measured using amyloid PET imaging and a frequency-based staging method, which defined global and regional amyloid burden for four anatomical stages. Compared with NC, individuals with SCD exhibited increased functional nodal efficiency and structural nodal betweenness in the left anterior and median cingulate gyri, with no differences in network-level properties. Amyloid staging revealed four cortical divisions: Stage 1, fusiform and lateral temporal gyri; Stage 2, occipital areas; Stage 3, default mode network (DMN), midline brain, and lateral frontotemporal areas; and Stage 4, the remaining cortex. The global and regional amyloid burdens of each cortical stage were positively associated with the node-level properties of a set of DMN hubs, with the left anterior and posterior cingulate gyri being congruently associated with all amyloid stages. These findings suggest that amyloid burden continuously influences network adaptations through DMN hubs, irrespective of local proximity to pathology. Increased nodal properties in cortical hubs may reflect heightened information-processing demands during early amyloid deposition in this population at risk for AD.</p>

                <p>Self-related representation can enhance perception and memory&mdash;a phenomenon known as the self-referential effect (SRE). While SRE has been linked to the activation of the default mode network (DMN), including the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (Pcu/PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the underlying neurochemical processes of DMN activations remain unclear. The balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) within brain circuits is crucial for cognition and may play a role in the SRE. We examine whether the ratio of glutamate/glutamine (Glx) to -aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations, measured by <sup>1</sup>H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) as a proxy measure for E/I balance, is associated with DMN neural processes involved in self-referential encoding. Fifty-four healthy participants aged 7&ndash;35 (25 female) underwent MRS to measure levels of Glx and GABA in Pcu/PCC and completed an fMRI scan during an encoding task that involved self-referential and semantic judgments. We found that the self-related condition led to better subsequent memory and greater activation in the Pcu/PCC compared with the semantic condition. Activations in the Pcu/PCC were positively correlated with the Glx/GABA+ ratio. Task-dependent functional connectivity analysis revealed that connectivity between the Pcu/PCC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was positively associated with both the Glx/GABA+ ratio and the SRE effect on recollection accuracy. Furthermore, mediation analysis showed that a higher Glx/GABA+ ratio correlated with better SRE on memory recollection through increased Pcu/PCC&ndash;mPFC connectivity. Our study provides valuable insights into how neurochemical activity is associated with self-related cognition via functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks.</p>

                <p>Glymphatic transport in rodents has primarily been studied using cisterna magna cannulation (CMC), a minimally invasive method for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracers infusion. However, CMC is suboptimal due to the lack of bony structures to stabilize the cannula, leading to potential movement artifacts. Here, we present an alternative approach involving chronic cannulation of the lateral ventricles of mice for CSF tracer delivery. A direct comparison demonstrated that intraventricular cannulation (IVC) reproduces CMC results in vivo, including perivascular labeling of the middle cerebral artery, which was further confirmed by ex vivo analysis. IVC enables tracer infusion in awake mice, facilitating glymphatic transport studies in conjunction with behavioral assessments that were previously unattainable. Additionally, IVC supports repeated infusions in awake animals, offering the potential to reduce the number of experimental animals required. This study establishes IVC as a robust alternative for studying glymphatic transport and associated physiological processes.</p>

Vaccination against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) generates an antibody response that shows large inter-individual variability. This variability complicates the use of antibody levels as a correlate of protection and the evaluation of population- and individual-level infection risk without access to broad serological testing. Here, we applied a mathematical model of antibody kinetics to capture individual anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody trajectories and to identify factors driving the humoral immune response. Subsequently, we evaluated model predictions and inferred the corresponding duration of protection for new individuals based on a single antibody measurement, assuming sparse access to serological testing. We observe a reduced antibody response in older and in male individuals, and in individuals with autoimmune diseases, diabetes and immunosuppression, using data from a longitudinal cohort study conducted in healthcare workers at Sheba Medical Center, Israel, following primary vaccination with the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Our results further suggest that model predictions of an individual’s antibody response to vaccination can be used to predict the duration of protection when serological data is limited, highlighting the potential of our approach to estimate infection risk over time on both the population and individual level to support public health decision-making in future pandemics.

                <p>by Matteo Priorelli, Ivilin Peev Stoianov, Giovanni Pezzulo</p>

Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This <i>decide-then-act</i> perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions—called <i>embodied decisions</i>—that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to “change mind” between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference—a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings – namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.

                <p>by Amit Yaron, Tomoyo Shiramatsu-Isoguchi, Felix B. Kern, Kenichi Ohki, Hirokazu Takahashi, Zenas C. Chao</p>

Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability—key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.

The evolution of sexual secondary characteristics necessitates regulatory factors that confer sexual identity to differentiating tissues and cells. In <i>Colias eurytheme</i> butterflies, males exhibit two specialized wing scale types—ultraviolet-iridescent (UVI) and spatulate scales—which are absent in females and likely integral to male courtship behavior. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms and single-nucleus transcriptomics underlying these two sexually dimorphic cell types during wing development. We show that <i>Doublesex</i> (<i>Dsx</i>) expression is itself dimorphic and required to repress the UVI cell state in females, while unexpectedly, UVI activation in males is independent from <i>Dsx</i>. In the melanic marginal band, <i>Dsx</i> is required in each sex to enforce the presence of spatulate scales in males, and their absence in females. Single-nucleus RNAseq reveals that UVI and spatulate scale cell precursors each show distinctive gene expression profiles at 40% of pupal development, with marker genes that include regulators of transcription, cell signaling, cytoskeletal patterning, and chitin secretion. Both male-specific cell types share a low expression of the <i>Bric-a-brac</i> (<i>Bab</i>) transcription factor, a key repressor of the UVI fate. Bab ChIP-seq profiling suggests that Bab binds the <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions of gene markers associated to UVI fate, including potential effector genes involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal processes and chitin secretion, and loci showing signatures of recent selective sweeps in a UVI-polymorphic population. These findings open new avenues for exploring wing patterning and scale development, shedding light on the mechanisms driving the specification of sex-specific cell states and the differentiation of specialized cell ultrastructures.

The calcium surge that starts embryogenesis varies across species and is elusive in many. A new study in PLOS Biology shows that zebrafish eggs self-activate, initiating a protease-activated receptor calcium wave and uncovering a novel pathway in egg activation.

The calcium surge that starts embryogenesis varies across species. A new study in PLOS Biology presents a novel mechanism of egg activation in zebrafish, wherein protease-activated receptors mediate a calcium signal that initiates egg activation before sperm entry.

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by α-synuclein aggregation in neurons. Recent advances suggest α-synuclein aggregates could serve as a biomarker for PD and related synucleinopathies. This study used surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) to measure α-synuclein aggregates in urine. Patients with PD and isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a precursor to PD, had elevated concentrations compared with healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were 83% and 65% for PD versus controls and 89% and 62% for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder versus controls. The findings highlight sFIDA's potential for diagnosing synucleinopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:147–151</p>

                <p>Self-limited epilepsies of childhood are common and were considered benign. We aim to determine whether cognitive function in young adults who experienced epilepsy as children and are subsequently seizure-free and unmedicated differ from the general population. We report on a cross-sectional population-based study including 2,124,871 men and women aged 16–19 years. Participants &gt; 5 years following the last seizure and &gt; 2 years without anti-seizure medication (n = 3,452) had an odds ratio (OR) of having low cognitive function of 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24–1.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) using a multinominal regression model. Our results underscore the need to avoid the term “benign” in the classification of childhood epilepsies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:62–66</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Investigate the immune system's role in cluster headache by analyzing cytokines in people with cluster headache and headache-free controls, and explore if certain cytokines could predict a specific phenotype.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured 45 cytokines in adult participants from the Danish Cluster Headache Biobank in a prospective case–control setup. People with cluster headache were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders third-edition. Controls were matched for age and sex.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 412 were analyzed deriving from 99 with chronic cluster headache, 108 with episodic cluster headache (ECH) in bout, 105 with ECH in remission, and 100 successfully matched controls. Compared with controls, 13 cytokines were altered for ECH in bout (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), 3 in remission (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and 10 for chronic cluster headache (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Oncostatin m was significantly elevated in all 3 disease states compared with controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Overall, the investigated cytokines showed distinct patterns of alterations between chronic cluster headache and episodic cluster headache in bout and, interestingly, IL-1β was significantly associated with having chronic cluster headache rather than episodic in bout in a logistic regression model adjusting for potential confounders (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Findings show that the immune system is altered in all 3 states of cluster headache compared with controls. Oncostatin m was elevated, constituting a promising target for future studies. The distinct alterations between episodic and chronic cluster headache are striking and urges further research of the immune system in cluster headache to better understand its potential role in prediction of disease activity and treatment response.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We analyzed the genotypic and phenotypic features of patients with psychosis of epilepsy (POE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with POE recruited to an epilepsy genetics research program underwent phenotyping and genetic analysis. The latter included screening for rare pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes, and polygenic risk score (PRS) calculation for common risk variants associated with schizophrenia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred twenty-two individuals with POE were identified. Eighty-six of 122 of the individuals (70%) had interictal psychosis, with schizophrenia the most common interictal phenotype (36/86, 42%). Twenty-eight of 122 of the individuals (23%) had postictal psychosis (PIP), 2 of 122 of the individuals (2%) had antiseizure medication-induced psychosis, and 6 of 122 of the individuals (5%) had substance-induced psychosis. Focal epilepsies were more frequently associated with PIP (24/28, 86%) compared to interictal psychosis (39/86, 45%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twenty-nine percent of the patients with POE with genetic data had a rare pathogenic variant: 19 in an epilepsy gene (<i>PCDH19</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>KCNT1</i>, <i>CHD2</i>, <i>SLC2A1</i>, <i>NPRL3</i>, <i>CLN3</i>, <i>NPRL3</i>, <i>ATP1A3</i>, and <i>CACNA1A</i>) and 4 had a chromosomal anomaly. Fifty-seven percent of the patients with a rare pathogenic variant had interictal schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder rather than PIP (9%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). PRSs showed that schizophrenia-related common risk variants were enriched in patients with POE compared to population controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0007), however, among the POE phenotypes, a raised PRS was only observed in interictal schizophrenia (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and not in those with PIP or other interictal POEs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Interictal POE is threefold more common than PIP, and more likely to be associated with both rare pathogenic variants for epilepsy and common risk variants for schizophrenia. Distinguishing between different POE phenotypes enhances clinical practice and our understanding of etiology, paving the way for precision medicine. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:35–47</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the association between computed tomography perfusion (CTP) parameters and outcomes in basilar artery occlusion (BAO), and to select patients with BAO who may benefit from thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post-hoc analysis of patients from the ATTENTION trial with available admission CTP data. CTP parameters evaluated included time to maximum (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub>) &gt;6 s/8 s/10 s, relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) &lt;20%/30%/34%/38%/50%, Critical Area Perfusion Score (CAPS), and CTP-posterior circulation acute stroke prognosis early computed tomography score (CTP-pc-ASPECTS), pons-midbrain-thalamus (PMT) hypoperfusion. Multivariable Firth logistic regression was used to analyze associations between CTP parameters and outcomes and to explore treatment interactions. The primary outcome was favorable outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0–3, at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 109 patients (70 thrombectomy, 39 control). Multivariable analysis showed that lower CAPS, smaller rCBF &lt;34% volume, and higher CTP-pc-ASPECTS were associated with favorable outcome. Patients who underwent thrombectomy had a higher likelihood of favorable outcome with increasing CAPS (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt; 6 s) compared to control (<i>P</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.048 for continuous variable). When CAPS (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt; 6 s) was treated as a categorical variable, the interaction remained significant (<i>P</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.03). Similarly, the treatment effect was also modified by PMT hypoperfusion (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s) (<i>P</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.03). In patients with CAPS (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s) &gt;3 or with PMT hypoperfusion (<i>T</i>
<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s), thrombectomy was associated with favorable outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher CAPS correlated with a decrease in the rate of favorable outcomes. However, patients with higher CAPS were more likely to benefit from thrombectomy compared to medical management alone, suggesting that severe hypoperfusion should not preclude endovascular treatment.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Rapid advances in transcriptomics have driven efforts to identify deregulated pathways in multiple sclerosis (MS) tissues, though many detected differentially expressed genes are likely false positives, with only a small fraction reflecting actual pathological events. Robust, integrative methods are essential for accurately understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying MS pathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a gene prioritization analysis of MS white matter pathology transcriptomic studies. Articles were sought in Scopus and PubMed up to July 31, 2024. Potentially eligible publications were those that provided either transcriptomics datasets (deposited in GEO) or lists of differentially expressed genes comparing MS white matter to control white matter.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Applying a vote-count strategy to search for the intersection of genes reported in multiple independent studies with a consistent fold-change direction, followed by a Monte Carlo simulation, we identified 528 highly significant differentially expressed multi-study genes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; 10,000 simulations). Functional enrichment analysis revealed deregulation of the folate pathway in MS normal-appearing white matter, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related and complement-related pathways in active and chronic active lesions, respectively. Network analysis identified 6 key signaling hubs: PTPRC, HLA-B, MYC, MMP2, COL11A2, MAG. The major nodes identified revealed mechanistic concordance with published in vivo MS models, supporting their value as potential therapeutic targets.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our strategy provides a robust framework for integrating gene expression data, effectively identifying the intricate pathways altered in human diseased tissues. This method holds potential for translating findings into drug development strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:67–79</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27217?af=R">Cyclic Alternating Pattern Dynamics in Individuals at Risk for Developing Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) metrics, a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep physiological rhythm, among recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and individuals at high and low risk for developing PD based on genetic and prodromal risk.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cross-sectional exploratory study, participants underwent clinical, cognitive, and motor evaluation to compute risk based on the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) prodromal criteria and a standard overnight polysomnography. CAP rate, CAP index, A index subtypes, number of CAP sequences, and CAP sequence duration were computed from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 30 patients with early PD (mean age = 62.80 ± 7.69, disease duration = 1.10 ± 1.09), 26 participants at risk for PD (age = 64.88 ± 10.09), and 36 participants with low risk for PD (age = 56.83 ± 7.41). Despite comparable macrosleep architecture, most CAP measures were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with the low-risk group, whereas the at-risk group showed transitional values between PD and the low-risk group. The A2 index was significantly lower in both the at-risk and PD groups from the low-risk group (at risk = 7.59 ± 4.59; PD = 7.71 ± 5.83; and low risk = 12.85 ± 8.63; <i>p</i> = 0.010). Lower CAP rate and lower CAP index were associated with greater disease severity (<i>r</i> = −0.23 and − 0.24, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with early clinical PD exhibit alterations in CAP dynamics despite having comparable macrosleep architecture. Alterations of the NREM microsleep structure may occur early in the neurodegenerative process and the A2 index may be an early event in the evolution of the disease with the potential to serve as an early marker for disease progression.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Ofatumumab presents a potentially promising alternative to current second-line immunotherapy for refractory anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor autoimmune encephalitis (NMDAR-AE). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab as a novel second-line immunotherapy for NMDAR-AE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, multicenter, nested cohort study compared patients with NMDAR-AE from the CHina Autoimmune encephalitiS outcomE study registry (CHASE) recruited between October 2011 and February 2024, treated with and without ofatumumab. The primary outcome was the proportion reaching a favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≤2) at the last follow-up. Secondary outcomes included mRS scores and Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE) scores over the first 24-month follow-up and the proportion with further mRS score improvement after ofatumumab initiation. A propensity score matching was performed to balance major confounders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 715 patients with AE were screened. Fifty-eight propensity score-matched patients with NMDAR-AE each in the ofatumumab group and non-ofatumumab group were analyzed. Fifty-four patients (93.1%) in the ofatumumab group achieved further mRS score improvement with a median time of 14 days from ofatumumab initiation, and 53 (91.4%) reached a favorable functional outcome at the last follow-up. For those who failed first-line immunotherapy, the ofatumumab group demonstrated a faster mRS score and CASE score improvement and more frequently reached a favorable functional outcome at the last follow-up compared with the non-ofatumumab group (87.9% vs. 64.7%, odds ratio [OR] 3.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–13.94; <i>p</i> = 0.026). No serious adverse events associated with ofatumumab treatment were reported.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Ofatumumab showed substantial efficacy and safety, particularly in patients who failed first-line immunotherapy, warranting its consideration in NMDAR-AE management. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:80–92</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27222?af=R">Blood DDIT4 and TRIM13 Transcript Levels Mark the Early Stages of Machado–Joseph Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>An abundance of select transcripts and proteins has been found to be dysregulated in blood samples of Machado–Joseph disease (MJD) carriers. Here, we aimed to: (1) identify blood transcriptional changes as potential biomarkers of MJD; (2) correlate levels of differentially expressed blood transcripts with MJD carriers features; and (3) evaluate whether the identified differential abundance of blood transcripts in MJD patients is preserved in MJD brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used unbiased RNA microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assess transcript levels in blood and brain samples, and western blot analysis to evaluate the abundance of specific proteins in brain samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed consistent dysregulation of <i>DDIT4</i>, <i>TRIM13</i>, and <i>P2RY13</i> transcriptional levels in the blood of MJD patients from preclinical to symptomatic stages in Azorean and Brazilian cohorts. Combined blood <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcriptional levels show a very high accuracy to discriminate MJD carriers from matched controls (AUC ≥0.90). Levels of <i>P2RY13</i> transcripts correlate with age at onset, and an abundance of <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcripts correlate with the expanded CAG repeat size in combined Azorean and Brazilian patients; and levels of <i>TRIM13</i> transcripts correlate with age at onset of early-stage Azorean patients. Moreover, the abundance of TRIM13 protein is increased in the cerebral cortex of MJD patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, blood <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcript levels are potential biomarkers of MJD. Cellular processes involving <i>DDIT4</i>, <i>TRIM13</i>, and <i>P2RY13</i> appear to be commonly dysregulated in the blood and brain of MJD patients, indicating the involvement of these genes in MJD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27223?af=R">Dopamine Transporter Imaging as Objective Monitoring Biomarker in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging is a valuable diagnostic biomarker, few studies have investigated its utility in objectively monitoring disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no study has established a longitudinal relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom increase, potentially due to neglected factors such as brain regions, disease laterality, and symptom subtypes, which this study addresses.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study included participants who met the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for PD, with longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative Database. Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom severity increase over time. We hypothesized that a decline in putaminal DaT availability in the less affected hemisphere would be associated with increasing contralateral motor symptoms, measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Additional models explored the effects of different brain regions (caudate and putamen), symptom categories (MDS UPDRSIII score with and without tremor items), and disease onset laterality (left or right hemisphere).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 719 participants (443 male patients and 276 female patients; mean age = 62.2 ± 9.5 years) with 1,981 available data points. As hypothesized, we observed a significant association between the decrease in the less affected putaminal DaT signal and motor symptom increase in the contralateral body side, independent of including or excluding tremor scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings support the use of repetitive DaT imaging for objectively monitoring PD progression. This could facilitate personalized disease tracking, subtyping, and intervention testing in the future. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:120–135</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27224?af=R">Network Localization of Pediatric Lesion‐Induced Dystonia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dystonia is a movement disorder defined by involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures or twisting and repetitive movements. Classically dystonia has been thought of as a disorder of the basal ganglia, but newer results in idiopathic dystonia and lesion-induced dystonia in adults point to broader motor network dysfunction spanning the basal ganglia, cerebellum, premotor cortex, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal regions. It is unclear whether a similar network is shared between different etiologies of pediatric lesion-induced dystonia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three cohorts of pediatric patients with lesion-induced dystonia were identified. The lesion etiologies included hypoxia, kernicterus, and stroke versus comparison subjects with acquired lesions not associated with dystonia. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and lesion network mapping were used to evaluate the anatomy and networks associated with dystonia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping showed that lesions of the putamen and globus pallidus were associated with dystonia (<i>r</i> = 0.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Lesion network mapping using normative connectome data from healthy children demonstrated that these regional findings occurred within a common brain-wide network that involves the basal ganglia, anterior and medial cerebellum, and cortical regions that overlap the cingulo-opercular action-mode and somato-cognitive-action networks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We interpret these findings as novel evidence for a unified dystonia brain network that involves the somato-cognitive-action network, which is implicated in the coordination of movement. Elucidation of this network gives insight into the functional origins of dystonia and provides novel targets to investigate for therapeutic intervention.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal was to examine the effect of sociodemographic variables, Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical stages and pathology on brain metabolism in Down syndrome (DS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD. Hypometabolism is more tightly related to CSF NfL levels than to core AD biomarkers. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:163–173</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel-aspirin versus aspirin alone in patients after ischemic stroke by glycemic status using data from the Intensive Statin and Antiplatelet Therapy for Acute High-risk Intracranial or Extracranial Atherosclerosis (INSPIRES) trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with mild ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) were randomized to clopidogrel-aspirin or aspirin alone. They were categorized into 3 subgroups according to glycemic status based on medical history and diagnosis by a clinician during hospitalization: without type 2 diabetes mellitus, with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were new stroke and moderate-to-severe bleeding risk within 90-day follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 6,100 patients were enrolled (3,050 in each arm), with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range [IQR], 57–71) and 2,185 female (35.8%). Clopidogrel-aspirin treatment was associated with a reduction in recurrent stroke compared with aspirin alone in patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (6.3% vs 8.4%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59–0.94; <i>p</i> = 0.01) and those with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (5.8% vs 13.0%; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14–0.66; <i>p</i> = 0.002), but not in those with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (10.0% vs 9.9%; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72–1.33; <i>p</i> = 0.88) (<i>p</i> for interaction = 0.03). Moderate-to-severe bleeding events did not differ significantly by treatment across glycemic subgroups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the INSPIRES trial, patients without or with type 2 diabetes mellitus derived greater benefit from clopidogrel-aspirin than those with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus after mild ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by altered metabolome and energy homeostasis, manifesting with body mass index changes and hypermetabolism—both prognostic of disease progression and survival. The cross-sectional ALS metabolome has been characterized, but longitudinal correlations to functional decline are lacking.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally evaluated metabolomes from ALS plasma and terminal postmortem spinal cord and brain motor cortex tissue. We constructed 3 plasma models. A linear mixed effects model correlated all metabolite levels across all timepoints to their corresponding functional scores. An interaction model predicted a longitudinal change in function from baseline metabolites, whereas a progression model identified metabolites linked to a 20% or 50% drop in function. In postmortem samples, differential metabolites in onset versus second spinal cord segments served as a surrogate of disease progression. Mendelian randomization assessed potential causality from metabolites.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In plasma, all models primarily selected lipid metabolites and sub-pathways, in addition to amino acids, xenobiotics, and various less frequently selected pathways. Among lipids, fatty acids and sphingomyelins were predominant, along with plasmalogens, phosphatidylcholines, and lysophospholipids. Sex interaction findings were nominal. In the spinal cord, sphingomyelin and long-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the onset segment tissue, whereas phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were less abundant. Mendelian randomization suggested that impaired carnitine and short chain acylcarnitine metabolism may be genetically determined in ALS, along with various antioxidant derivatives.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest metabolomic changes primarily involving different lipid classes and carnitine metabolism may underscore ALS severity and progression. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:19–34</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in <i>KCNT1</i> encoding for potassium channels are associated with different epilepsy phenotypes, including epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), other early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, and focal epilepsy. Fluoxetine blocks currents from both wild-type (WT) and mutant KCNT1 channels with GoF in vitro features. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with fluoxetine might improve clinical outcome in patients with EIMFS carrying GoF variants in KCNT1 channels showing in vitro sensitivity to fluoxetine blockade.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled three pediatric patients carring de novo KCNT1 genetic variants linked to EIMFS. Functional and pharmacological studies to assess fluoxetine's ability to counteract in vitro variant-induced functional effects were performed with patch-clamp electrophysiology on heterologous channel expression in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. Neuropsychological assessment, electroencephalogram and seizure diary were evaluated at baseline and every 3 months during the study. Electrocardiography and blood levels of medications were monitored for safety.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All 3 <i>KCNT1</i> variants displayed GoF effects in vitro. Exposure to fluoxetine (10μM) blocked both WT and mutant KCNT1 channels, therefore, counteracting variant-induced functional effects. Treatment with fluoxetine caused a variable reduction of seizure frequency (25–75%). Improvement in visual attention, participation, and muscle tone was also reported. No adverse events were reported except for transient dyskinesia in 1 patient, which was probably related to an increase in fluoxetine plasma level.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fluoxetine may be a potential targeted medication in EIMFS caused by <i>KCNT1</i> GoF variants. Further research is needed to assess its long-term efficacy and safety. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:48–61</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common cause of arboviral disease in the United States. Approximately 1% of infections involve the nervous system, most commonly resulting in West Nile encephalitis (WNE), West Nile meningitis (WNM), or acute flaccid paralysis (AFP).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this systematic review, we characterized comprehensively the diagnostic and clinical features of WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND) in the United States, as well as the evidence regarding prognostic factors and long-term outcomes of WNND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 47 relevant studies reporting data on acute or longitudinal features of WNND. Across studies, the most common presenting symptoms were fever (88%), nausea/vomiting (58%), and fatigue (50%) coupled neurologically with headache (50%), altered mental status (39%), and focal weakness (32%). Pooled mortality was 9.2%, and 42.1% of reported cases required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In meta-analyses, chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR] = 5.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.71–13.23), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.54–3.84), and hypertension (OR = 4.01, 95% CI = 2.39–6.72) were associated with an increased risk of mortality. Multidomain neurocognitive impairment was reported in several studies at post-hospitalization follow-up, although with marked heterogeneity between study methodology. Subjective neurocognitive impairment, most notably fatigue (37–75%), memory concerns (11–57%), concentration deficits (17–48%), and depression (17–38%), were also common at post-hospitalization follow-up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings underscore the significant mortality and morbidity of WNND in the acute and long-term setting. Our findings may additionally provide utility for risk stratification of hospitalized patients with WNND and suggest the need for further evaluation of novel therapeutics to prevent substantial disease-associated acute and long-term disability.

                Clusterin (CLU) is a recognized genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. In this issue of Neuron, Lish et al. found that lower CLU levels in astrocytes, caused by the CLU risk allele, heightened inflammation and reduced synaptic functions, potentially increasing risk for cognitive decline.

                Saleme et al. show that cancer’s stress resistance is driven by translation of hyperacute response proteins from m6A-tagged mRNAs within minutes of various stresses (metabolic stress, radiation, oxidative stress, or chemotherapy). Translation is mediated by cytosolic FTO activation by MARK4 on specialized γ-tubulin-associated ribosomes. FTO and MARK4 inhibitors are therapeutic targets for cancer’s resistance to stress.

This ‘prediction error’ is key to reinforcement learning. It emerges that dopamine neurons differ in their timescales for temporal discounting, enabling the brain to implement sophisticated reinforcement-learning algorithms along multiple timescales.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 18 June 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60513-x">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-60513-x</a></p>While switch-like expression (“on” in some individuals and “off” in others) has been linked to biological variation and disease susceptibility, a systematic analysis across tissues is lacking. Here, we analyze genomes, transcriptomes, and methylomes from 943 individuals across 27 tissues, identifying 473 switch-like genes. The identified switch-like genes are enriched for associations with cancers and immune, metabolic, and skin diseases. Only 40 (8.5%) switch-like genes show genetically hardwired on-versus-off expression in all tissues analyzed, i.e., universally switch-like expression. The remaining switch-like genes show on versus off expression only in specific tissues. Methylation analysis suggests that genetically driven epigenetic silencing explains the universal pattern, whereas hormone-driven epigenetic modification may underlie tissue-specific switch-like gene expression. Notably, tissue-specific switch-like genes tend to be switched on or off in unison within individuals, driven by tissue-specific master regulators. In the vagina, we identified seven concordantly switched off genes linked to vaginal atrophy. Experimental analysis of vaginal tissues shows that low estrogen levels lead to a decreased epithelial thickness and ALOX12 expression. We propose a model wherein switched off driver genes in basal and parabasal epithelia suppress cell proliferation, leading to epithelial thinning and vaginal atrophy. Our findings underscore the implications of switch-like genes for diagnostic and personalized therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99825">Stimulatory and inhibitory G-protein signaling relays drive cAMP accumulation for timely metamorphosis in the chordate Ciona</a></h4>

              
                Larvae of the ascidian <i>Ciona</i> initiate metamorphosis tens of minutes after adhesion to a substratum via their adhesive organ. The gap between adhesion and metamorphosis initiation is suggested to ensure the rigidity of adhesion, allowing <i>Ciona</i> to maintain settlement after losing locomotive activity through metamorphosis. The mechanism producing the gap is unknown. Here, by combining gene functional analyses, pharmacological analyses, and live imaging, we propose that the gap represents the time required for sufficient cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation to trigger metamorphosis. Not only the Gs pathway but also the Gi and Gq pathways are involved in the initiation of metamorphosis in the downstream signaling cascade of the neurotransmitter GABA, the known initiator of <i>Ciona</i> metamorphosis. The mutual crosstalk of stimulatory and inhibitory G-proteins functions as the accelerator and brake for cAMP production, ensuring the faithful initiation of metamorphosis at an appropriate time and in the right situation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96152">In mice, discrete odors can selectively promote the neurogenesis of sensory neuron subtypes that they stimulate</a></h4>

              
                In mammals, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are born throughout life, ostensibly solely to replace neurons lost <i>via</i> turnover or injury. This assumption follows from the hypothesis that olfactory neurogenesis is stochastic with respect to neuron subtype, as defined by the single odorant receptor that each neural precursor stochastically chooses out of hundreds of possibilities. This assumption is challenged, however, by recent findings that the birthrates of a fraction of OSN subtypes are selectively reduced by olfactory deprivation. These findings raise questions about how, and why, olfactory stimuli are required to accelerate the neurogenesis rates of some subtypes, including whether the stimuli are specific (e.g. discrete odorants) or generic (e.g. broadly activating odors or mechanical stimuli). Based on previous findings that the exposure of mice to sex-specific odors can increase the representations of subtypes responsive to those odors, we hypothesized that the neurogenic stimuli comprise discrete odorants that selectively stimulate OSNs of the same subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated. In support of this, we have found, using scRNA-seq and subtype-specific OSN birthdating, that exposure to male and exogenous musk odors can accelerate the birthrates of subtypes responsive to those odors. These findings reveal that certain odor experiences can selectively ‘amplify’ specific OSN subtypes and suggest that persistent OSN neurogenesis serves, in part, an adaptive function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100530">A causal role of the NMDA receptor in recurrent processing during perceptual integration</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual inference requires the integration of visual features through recurrent processing, the dynamic exchange of information between higher- and lower-level cortical regions. While animal research has demonstrated a crucial role of NMDA receptors in recurrent processing, establishing a causal link between NMDA receptors and recurrent processing in humans has remained challenging. Here, we report two pharmacological studies with randomized, double-blind, crossover designs in which we administered the NMDA antagonist memantine, while collecting human electroencephalography (EEG). We trained and tested EEG classifiers to reflect the processing of specific stimulus features with increasing levels of complexity, namely differences in stimulus contrast, collinearity between local line elements, and illusory surfaces of a Kanizsa triangle. In two experiments involving different participants and visual tasks, we found that memantine selectively improved decoding of the Kanizsa illusion, known to depend on recurrent processing, while leaving decoding of contrast and collinearity largely unaffected. Interestingly, the results from an attentional blink (experiment 1) and task-relevance manipulation (experiment 2) showed that memantine was only effective when the stimulus was attended and consciously accessed. These findings suggest that NMDA inhibition through memantine enhances recurrent processing, especially for attended objects, and thereby provide a crucial step toward bridging animal and human research, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underpinning perceptual inference and conscious perception.

                In the past, immune memory was considered an exclusive feature of the adaptive immune system. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the innate immune system, the most primitive and fundamental component of immunity, can mount more robust responses to non-specific stimuli following prior exposure to different types of initial stimuli, a phenomenon known as trained immunity. Trained immunity has been extensively studied in diverse disease contexts, including infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Notably, significant advancements have been made in recent years in understanding the roles and therapeutic potential of trained immunity in oncology. This review aims to explore the multifaceted roles of trained immunity across different cancer types, providing a comprehensive summary of the pertinent stimuli and associated molecular mechanisms. Additionally, we evaluate the clinical applications of various trained immunity stimuli in cancer therapy and offer perspectives on future directions for integrating trained immunity into cancer treatment strategies.

                Radiotherapy resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a major cause of recurrence and metastasis. Identifying radiotherapy-related biomarkers is crucial for improving patient survival outcomes. This study developed the nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy sensitivity score (NPC-RSS) to predict radiotherapy response. By evaluating 113 machine learning algorithm combinations, the glmBoost+NaiveBayes model was selected to construct the NPC-RSS based on 18 key genes, which demonstrated good predictive performance in both public and in-house datasets. The study found that NPC-RSS is closely associated with immune features, including chemokine factors and their receptor families and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Gene functional analysis revealed that NPC-RSS influences key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, JAK-STAT, NF-κB, and T cell receptors. Cell line validation confirmed that SMARCA2 and CD9 gene expression is consistent with NPC-RSS. Single-cell analysis revealed that the radiotherapy-sensitive group exhibited richer immune infiltration and activation states. NPC-RSS can serve as a predictive tool for radiotherapy sensitivity in NPC, offering new insights for precise screening of patients who may benefit from radiotherapy.

">Gas-sensing neurons prime mitochondrial fitness to offset metabolic stress</a></h4>

              
                Animals integrate environmental and internal cues to maintain homeostasis and health. The mitochondrial stress response is an essential cytoprotective mechanism, and priming its activation provides a survival advantage. Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans receptor guanylyl cyclase GCY-9 regulates neuropeptide signalling from carbon dioxide sensing neurons to govern a non-canonical mitochondrial stress response in the intestine. This stress response induces atypical mitochondrial chaperone transcription, confers mitochondrial stress resistance, and increases mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration. GCY-9 loss disrupts pathogen avoidance, leading to indiscriminate feeding. We show that starvation decreases GCY-9 expression and propose that the resultant cytoprotective program is launched to offset risks associated with this behaviour. Thus, environmental sensing by peripheral neurons can pre-emptively enhance systemic mitochondrial function in response to metabolic uncertainty.

">Internal Resonance Dynamics in a Delayed van der Pol Oscillator Modeling Basal Ganglia Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Movement disorders, like Parkinson's disease, happen because of unusual patterns in the connections between the cortex and basal ganglia, often caused by timing issues in feedback pathways. This study uses a two-delay nonlinear dynamic model, based on the delayed the van der Pol oscillator, to examine how delays in the feedback loops of the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways lead to unusual movement patterns and resonance. A thorough analysis of resonance looks at how the ratios of delays and the time it takes to respond affect the system's frequency, showing when internal resonance occurs and how frequency stabilizes under different conditions. We examine how stable the system is by looking at changes in its behavior and measuring the Lyapunov exponent across distinct types of nonlinear feedback setups. Simulations demonstrate transitions from stable oscillations to chaos with varying delays and saturation strength. Our results reproduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as resting tremor, dyskinesia, and freezing, demonstrating how delayed inhibition or hyperactivity destabilizes motor function. The discussion supports these findings, indicating that early problems start in the striatum, with complex effects in the globus pallidus that worsen motor symptoms. This model explains the temporal evolution of Parkinson's disease symptoms and highlights the timing of feedback and saturation as key therapeutic targets. Overall, this research offers a biological explanation for motor problems caused by delays and supports novel approaches for brain stimulation using flexible methods.

">Population-specific brain charts reveal Chinese-Western differences in neurodevelopmental trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Human brain charts provide unprecedented opportunities for decoding neurodevelopmental milestones and establishing clinical benchmarks for precision brain medicine. However, current lifespan brain charts are primarily derived from European and North American cohorts, with Asian populations severely underrepresented. Here, we present the first population-specific brain charts for China, developed through the Chinese Lifespan Brain Mapping Consortium (Phase I) using neuroimaging data from 43,037 participants (aged 0-100 years) across 384 sites nationwide. We establish the lifespan normative trajectories for 296 structural brain phenotypes, encompassing global, subcortical, and cortical measures. Cross-population comparisons with Western brain charts (based on data from 56,339 participants aged 0-100 years) reveal distinct neurodevelopmental patterns in the Chinese population, including prolonged cortical and subcortical maturation, accelerated cerebellar growth, and earlier development of sensorimotor regions relative to paralimbic regions. Crucially, these Chinese-specific charts outperform Western-derived models in predicting healthy brain phenotypes and detecting pathological deviations in Chinese clinical cohorts. These findings highlight the urgent need for diverse, population-representative brain charts to advance equitable precision neuroscience and improve clinical validity across populations.

">JiSuJi, a virtual muscle for small animal simulations, accurately predicts force from naturalistic spike trains</a></h4>

              
                Physics based simulators for neuromechanical control of virtual animals have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of intricate structure-function relationships in neuromuscular systems, their neural activity and motor control. However, a key challenge is the accurate prediction of the forces that muscle fibers produce based on their complex patterns of electrical activity ('spike trains') while preserving model simplicity for broader applicability. In this study, we present a chemomechanical, three dimensional finite element muscle model JiSuJi (Fast Muscle Simulator) - that efficiently and accurately predicts muscle forces from naturalistic spike trains. The model's performance is validated against songbird vocal muscles, a particularly fast and therefore challenging muscle type. Our results demonstrate that JiSuJi accurately predicts both isometric and non-isometric muscle forces across a variety of naturalistic neural activity patterns. JiSuJi furthermore outperforms state-of-the-art muscle simulators for accuracy, while maintaining computational efficiency. Simulating muscle behavior offers a promising approach for investigating the underlying mechanisms of neuro-muscular interactions and precise motor control, especially in the fast-contracting muscles of animal model systems.

                <p>In frequency tagging, visual stimulation at a frequency (F) of ~10&nbsp;Hz has long been known to generate the highest-amplitude response at<I> F </I>in the frequency domain over the human occipital cortex with electroencephalogram and other high temporal-resolution methods. Brain responses are indeed commonly assessed simply at<I> F</I> (i.e., the first harmonic = 1<I>F</I>), under the assumption that the response is represented at a single frequency, i.e., "steady-state" or approximately sinusoidal in terms of amplitude over time. This condition is met at stimulus presentation frequencies above ~4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz in the visual modality; consequently, frequency tagging has often been limited to F above this "floor." Here, we support a less-common perspective, that frequency-tagged responses do not need to be steady-state, such that slower F are valid. In this case, it has been shown that is not appropriate to measure nonsinusoidal responses at only <I>F</I> but that nonsinusoidal responses can still be analyzed simply and advantageously in the frequency domain through baseline-corrected amplitude summation across harmonics (<I>F</I> <I>+</I> 2<I>F</I> <I>+</I> 3<I>F</I>... = <I>F</I><SUB>s</SUB>). Critically, we demonstrate that although the highest-amplitude <I>F</I> response occurs at F = 10&nbsp;Hz, the highest-amplitude <I>F</I><SUB>s</SUB> response occurs at approximately F &lt; 4&nbsp;Hz. We use this example toward understanding the effect of stimulation frequency on response amplitude and discuss its caveats and limitations. We address what defines an "optimal" stimulation frequency (note: it may not always be the F yielding the highest-amplitude response) and reflect on considerations when choosing a stimulation frequency in different contexts.</p>

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a targeted manipulation of brain circuitry to treat neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Optimal DBS lead placement is essential for treatment efficacy. Current targeting practice is based on preoperative and intraoperative brain imaging, intraoperative electrophysiology, and stimulation mapping. Electrophysiological mapping using extracellular microelectrode recordings aids in identifying functional subdomains, anatomical boundaries, and disease-correlated physiology. The shape of single-unit action potentials may differ due to different biophysical properties between cell-types and brain regions. Here, we describe a technique to parameterize the structure and duration of sorted spike units using a novel algorithmic approach based on canonical response parameterization, and illustrate how it may be used on DBS microelectrode recordings. Isolated spike shapes are parameterized then compared using a spike similarity metric and grouped by hierarchical clustering. When spike morphology is associated with anatomy, we find regional clustering in the human globus pallidus. This method is widely applicable for spike removal and single-unit characterization and could be integrated into intraoperative array-based technologies to enhance targeting and clinical outcomes in DBS lead placement.

                <p>by Christine M. Lim, Michele Vendruscolo</p>

The protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network maintains the proteome in a functional state. Although this network has been comprehensively mapped, its perturbations in disease remain incompletely characterised. To address this problem, here we define the proteostasis signatures, which represent the characteristic patterns of change in the proteostasis network associated with disease. We performed a large-scale, pan-disease analysis across 32 human diseases spanning 7 disease types. We first identified unique proteostasis perturbations in specific disease states. We then uncovered distinctive signatures differentiating disease types, pointing to a range of proteostasis mechanisms in disease development. Next, we tracked the temporal evolution of proteostasis signatures, revealing shifts in proteostasis disruption over the course of disease progression. Finally, we demonstrated how smoking, a major risk factor for many diseases, impairs proteostasis in a manner similar to disease, potentially creating a predisposed environment for disease onset. These results illustrate the opportunities offered by the study of human diseases from the perspective of proteostasis signatures.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013135">The role of learned song in the evolution and speciation of Eastern and Spotted towhees</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ximena León Du’Mottuchi, Nicole Creanza</p>

Oscine songbirds learn vocalizations that function in mate attraction and territory defense; sexual selection pressures on these learned songs could thus accelerate speciation. The Eastern and Spotted towhees are recently diverged sister species that now have partially overlapping ranges with evidence of some hybridization. Widespread community-science recordings of these species, including songs within their zone of overlap and from potential hybrids, enable us to investigate whether song differentiation might facilitate their reproductive isolation. Here, we quantify 16 song features to analyze geographic variation in Spotted and Eastern towhee songs and assess species-level differences. We then use several machine learning models to measure how accurately their songs can be classified by species. While no single song feature reliably distinguishes the two species, machine learning models classified songs with relatively high accuracy (random forest: 89.5%, deep learning: 90%, gradient boosting machine: 88%, convolutional neural network: 88%); interestingly, species classification was less accurate in their zone of overlap. Finally, our analysis of the limited publicly available genetic data from each species supports the hypothesis that the species are reproductively isolated. Together, our results suggest that small variations in multiple features may contribute to these sister species’ ability to recognize their species-specific songs.

                <p>by Michael Satchell, Edith Butel-Fry, Zahraa Noureddine, Alexis Simmons, Nicolette N. Ognjanovski, Sara J. Aton, Michal R. Zochowski</p>

Across vertebrate species, sleep consists of repeating cycles of NREM followed by REM. However, their respective functions, and their stereotypic cycling pattern are not well understood. Using a simplified biophysical network model, we investigate the potential role of cholinergic modulation, acting via the muscarinic receptors, on network dynamics and memory consolidation. We show that low and high cholinergic levels associated with NREM and REM sleep, respectively, may play critical, sequential roles in memory consolidation. The network dynamics that facilitate these roles arise through alteration of neural excitability and changes to network-wide excitatory/inhibitory balance. At low acetylcholine (ACh) levels, reduced activation of inhibitory neurons leads to network-wide disinhibition and bursts of synchronized activity led by engram neurons, driving recruitment of additional excitatory neurons into the engram. In contrast, at high ACh levels, increased network inhibition suppresses firing in all but the most strongly recruited excitatory neurons, pruning the expanded engram population. Together, these results provide a testable hypothesis regarding the role of sleep state-specific cholinergic modulation in the process of memory consolidation.

                <p>by Hakim Benkirane, Maria Vakalopoulou, David Planchard, Julien Adam, Ken Olaussen, Stefan Michiels, Paul-Henry Cournède</p>

Characterizing cancer presents a delicate challenge as it involves deciphering complex biological interactions within the tumor’s microenvironment. Clinical trials often provide histology images and molecular profiling of tumors, which can help understand these interactions. Despite recent advances in representing multimodal data for weakly supervised tasks in the medical domain, achieving a coherent and interpretable fusion of whole slide images and multi-omics data is still a challenge. Each modality operates at distinct biological levels, introducing substantial correlations between and within data sources. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel deep-learning-based approach designed to represent multi-omics & histopathology data for precision medicine in a readily interpretable manner. While our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple test cases, it also deals with incomplete and missing data in a robust manner. It extracts various scores characterizing the activity of each modality and their interactions at the pathway and gene levels. The strength of our method lies in its capacity to unravel pathway activation through multimodal relationships and to extend enrichment analysis to spatial data for supervised tasks. We showcase its predictive capacity and interpretation scores by extensively exploring multiple TCGA datasets and validation cohorts. The method opens new perspectives in understanding the complex relationships between multimodal pathological genomic data in different cancer types and is publicly available on Github.

                <p>by Jiajia Ma, Tom J. Carney</p>

Successful initiation of animal development requires activation of the egg immediately prior to fusion of gamete pronuclei. In all taxa, this is initiated by waves of calcium transients which transverse across the egg. Calcium waves also occur at cleavage furrows during later blastula cytokinesis. Calcium is released from the endoplasmic reticulum through activation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors. Only a subset of the mechanisms employed to generate IP<sub>3</sub> during vertebrate egg activation are defined, with strong evidence that other critical mechanisms exist. Serine proteases have been long implicated in egg activation and fertilization. Here, we report that treatment of zebrafish eggs with serine protease inhibitors leads to defective calcium wave propagation and failed egg activation. We further show that mutation of zebrafish Protease-activated receptor 2a (Par2a) also results in severe disruption of egg activation, leading to failed chorion elevation and ooplasmic segregation. Milder <i>par2a</i> mutants progress further, but then show abnormal blastomere cleavage. We observed that <i>par2a</i> mutants show decreased amplitude and duration of calcium transients. Restoring Ca<sup>++</sup> or direct injection of IP<sub>3</sub> ligand rescues egg activation aborted by either serine protease inhibitor treatment or by mutation of Par2a. We thus show that serine protease activity is a critical regulator of IP<sub>3</sub> and subsequent calcium wave amplification during zebrafish egg activation, and link this to intracellular calcium release via the protease receptor, Par2a. This constitutes a novel signaling pathway critical for successful fertilization.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the diagnostic accuracy of metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for central nervous system (CNS) infections.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were derived from three prospective cohort studies in the Netherlands. All studies included adults suspected of a CNS infection who underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Metabolomics was performed on CSF using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry on a discovery and validation cohort. Metabolite quantification was the index test; a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis was the reference standard.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 343 episodes were included, of whom 170 (50%) had a CNS infections and 173 (50%) episodes had other diagnoses. CNS infections included bacterial meningitis in 88 (26%), viral meningoencephalitis in 50 (15%), and other CNS infections in 32 (9%) episodes. Other diagnoses consisted of CNS autoimmune disorders in 21 (6%), other neurological diseases in 84 (24%), and systemic infections in 68 (20%) episodes. A distinct metabolomic profile was observed in CSF of CNS infections, particularly bacterial meningitis. Glucose, glycerate, 1.3-diphosphoglyceric acid, pyruvate, lactate, taurine, and alpha-ketoglutarate had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve 0.87 to 0.95). Combinations further improved diagnostic accuracy, resulting in models that outperformed both individual metabolites and CSF leukocytes. Episodes with CSF leukocytes between 5 and 1,000 cells per mm<sup>3</sup> showed similar results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CSF metabolites demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy for CNS infections, particularly bacterial meningitis. Combinations further improve the diagnostic performance, exceeding that of CSF leukocytes alone. These findings highlight the potential of cerebrospinal fluid metabolites to improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="Canonical Proprioceptors Are Largely Absent in the Intrinsic Laryngeal Muscles of the Rat Larynx"/>
<p>Canonical proprioceptive organs (muscles spindles and Golgi tendon organs) are rarely expressed in the rat larynx, by studying the expression pattern of VGLUT1. There are the presence of other sensory innervation and structures, which may contribute to an alternative proprioceptive circuitry, which requires further study.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Proprioception plays a crucial role in laryngeal function for voicing and swallowing. Despite this, the physiology of laryngeal proprioception is not well-understood, and controversy remains over whether canonical proprioceptive organs, like muscle spindles, even exist in the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. This study's primary aim is to determine whether the intrinsic laryngeal muscles contain muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs using VGLUT1, a marker for proprioceptors. This is a novel approach, as prior studies have relied on morphology and myosin composition to study this question. Larynges of 62 Sprague-Dawley rats distributed across five age groups were immunostained with VGLUT1 and other neuromarkers. Muscle spindles were identified in the lateral thyroarytenoid muscles of just three P8 rats, and no Golgi tendon organs were noted. VGLUT1-positive intramuscular receptor-like entities and flower spray-like endings were found in the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, and mucosal formations were observed clustered at the medial surfaces of the arytenoid and aryepiglottic folds. Employing VGLUT1 immunostaining, this study shows that rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles rarely contain muscle spindles and do not possess Golgi tendon organs. This suggests the possibility that the larynx exhibits a unique proprioceptive apparatus. VGLUT1-positive intramuscular and mucosal structures provide candidates for an alternative system. Further defining the role of these structures will increase our understanding of vocal fold function and ultimately lead to better treatment of vocal fold disorders.</p>

                Dai et al. show that hyperexpanded CD8+ T cell clones emerge at alopecia areata onset and are sufficient to induce disease. Using single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing, they establish a causal link between clonal expansion and pathogenicity and demonstrate that depleting dominant clones prevents disease in a mouse model.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00649-7?rss=yes">Extensive natural variation in bacterial ribosomal drug-binding sites</a></h4>

              
                Ribosome-targeting drugs are widely used in basic research and medicine, yet the conservation of their binding residues in bacterial ribosomes remains unknown. Here, Ekemezie et al. reveal extensive sequence divergence in ribosomal drug-binding sites across bacterial lineages, offering a resource for more optimized applications of ribosome-targeting drugs.
