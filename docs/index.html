	<p>Background/Objectives: Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder, with onset typically occurring in late adolescence or early adulthood. Early identification of psychotic symptoms, especially those occurring before age 12, has been linked to better long-term outcomes. This study aims to assess the presence of psychotic spectrum symptoms before the age of 12 in adult schizophrenia patients and explore their clinical implications for early detection and intervention. Methods: This retrospective, observational study included 170 adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, confirmed by the SCID-5. Patients were recruited from the University of Siena Medical Center and completed the modified lifetime version of the Psychotic Spectrum Self-Report (PSY-SR) questionnaire, which assessed the onset of specific psychotic symptoms before and after age 12. Symptom severity was evaluated using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). This study also examined the impact of the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) on symptom severity. Results: In our cohort, 21% of patients exhibited prodromal symptoms before age 12 (95% CI: 15&amp;amp;ndash;27%). Prodromal symptoms were linked to a 9.53-point increase in the BPRS scores (p = 0.0478) and a 0.50-point increase in the CGI scores (p = 0.0347). The age of symptom onset negatively correlated with the BPRS scores (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), with each year of delay resulting in a 1.33-point decrease. The DUP correlated significantly with both the BPRS (&amp;amp;rho; = 0.97) and CGI scores (&amp;amp;rho; = 0.94). The multivariate analysis revealed that a longer DUP was associated with significant increases in both scores: a 27.16-point increase in the BPRS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) for a moderate DUP and a 67.51-point increase (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) for a severe DUP. The CGI scores increased by 1.11 points with a moderate DUP and 3.17 points with a severe DUP (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). However, the interaction between the DUP and prodromal symptoms at age 12 was not significant, indicating similar impacts of the DUP regardless of early symptom onset. Conclusions: The results support the critical importance of early detection and intervention in schizophrenia. Early psychotic spectrum symptoms, particularly those occurring before age 12, are significant predictors of later severity and functional impairment. This study underscores the value of screening tools like the PSY-SR for identifying prodromal symptoms and facilitating timely intervention. Our findings highlight the need for the early identification of psychotic symptoms, particularly in at-risk populations, to improve long-term outcomes. Intervening before the onset of full-blown psychosis may reduce the severity of schizophrenia and promote better clinical outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Olfactory decline is common in normal aging and frequent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Therefore, it has been suggested as a marker for the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) progression to AD. Although suggested, the relationship between olfactory deficits and cerebral atrophy in MCI conversion to AD is still debated. This study aims at investigating the olfaction-related morphological and behavioural alterations in MCI in order to understand whether they can predict the progression to AD. Methods: Twenty-seven MCI patients and thirty-five healthy controls (HCs) took part in the study, with follow-up showing conversion to AD in thirteen patients (converter-MCI, cMCI). The Burgarth Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks Tests (threshold&amp;amp;mdash;TT, discrimination&amp;amp;mdash;DT, identification&amp;amp;mdash;IT) assessed the olfactory capacities. The Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis investigated the atrophic patterns. Results: The Receiving Operating Characteristics analyses demonstrated that DT and IT could distinguish HC from MCI (DT Area Under Curve&amp;amp;mdash;AUC = 0.8; IT AUC = 0.8), as well as cMCI from sMCI (stable) patients (DT AUC = 0.7; IT AUC = 0.6), similarly to memory and executive functions tests. Olfactory performance positively correlated with memory tests in sMCI (all rhos &amp;amp;ge; 0.8, all ps &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), whereas it positively correlated with executive functions in cMCI (all rhos &amp;amp;ge; 0.6, all ps &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). VBM results revealed distinct atrophic patterns in cMCI, especially in the olfactory cortex, that were already present at the MCI diagnosis, before AD conversion. A larger volume of the olfactory cortex was associated with better memory and executive functions. Conclusions: Quantitative olfactory and morphological patterns represent non-invasive, predictive biomarkers of the MCI progression to AD; thus, their assessments at MCI onset allows earlier interventions for MCI patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0017-25.2025?rss=1">Heroin Regulates the Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Auxiliary Subunit, SCN1b, to Modulate Nucleus Accumbens Medium Spiny Neuron Intrinsic Excitability and Cue-Induced Heroin Seeking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Self-administration of addictive substances like heroin can couple the rewarding/euphoric effects of the drug with drug-associated cues, and opioid cue reactivity contributes to relapse vulnerability in abstinent individuals recovering from an opioid use disorder (OUD). Opioids are reported to alter the intrinsic excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region linked to drug seeking, but how opioids alter NAc MSN neuronal excitability and the impact of altered MSN excitability on relapse-like opioid seeking remain unclear. Here, we discovered that self-administered, but not experimenter-administered, heroin reduced NAc protein levels of the voltage-gated sodium channel auxiliary subunit, SCN1b, in male and female rats. Viral-mediated reduction of NAc SCN1b increased the intrinsic excitability of MSNs, but without altering glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission. While reducing NAc SCN1b levels had no effect on acquisition of heroin self-administration or extinction learning, we observed a significant increase in cue-reinstated heroin seeking, suggesting that NAc SCN1b normally limits cue-reinstated heroin seeking. We also observed that NAc SCN1b protein levels returned to baseline following heroin self-administration, home-cage abstinence, and extinction training, suggesting that the noted reduction of NAc SCN1b during acquisition of heroin self-administration likely enhances MSN excitability and the strength of heroin&ndash;cue associations formed during active heroin use. As such, enhancing NAc SCN1b function might mitigate opioid cue reactivity and a return to active drug use in individuals suffering from OUD.</p>

                <p>The striatum is the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia, integrating a dense plexus of inputs from the cerebral cortex and thalamus to regulate action selection and learning. Neuroanatomical mapping of the striatum and its subcompartments has been carried out extensively in rats and mice, nonhuman primates, and cats allowing comparative neuroanatomy studies to derive heuristics about striatal composition and function. Here, we systematically map corticostriatal topography from motor, somatosensory, auditory, and visual cortices as well as thalamostriatal parafascicular (PfN) inputs in the Mongolian gerbil. We also map a pathway reported in mice from medial vestibular nucleus to the PfN that could convey vestibular information to the striatum. Our findings align with those of similar studies in other rodents, indicating homologous neuroanatomical connectivity patterns within the corticostriatal projectome across Rodentia. We observed corticostriatal peaks of dense labeling for each input with a diffuse projection throughout striatal subregions from each cortical region, suggesting a global integration of all cortical information by the striatum. Thalamostriatal projections from PfN covered most of the striatum with a peak of PfN-specific compartmentalized labeling similar to other sensory and motor systems. We also confirm the connection from the medial vestibular nucleus to PfN thalamus, indicating that vestibular information may be widely integrated throughout the striatum. The findings build upon our body of knowledge on striatal connectivity across mammalian species and provide a foundation for striatal research focusing on vestibulothalamostriatal circuits in Rodentia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0278-23.2025?rss=1">Phosphorylation of NLGN4X Regulates Spinogenesis and Synaptic Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroligins (NLGNs) are a family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules that bind to their presynaptic partners, neurexins, facilitating the formation and maintenance of synapses. In humans, there are five genes encoding NLGNs (<I>NLGN1-3</I>, <I>NLGN4X</I>, and <I>NLGN4Y</I>), with <I>NLGN1-3</I> having highly conserved counterparts in rodents, allowing these genes to be studied with high confidence of translational validity in mouse models. Human NLGN4X and 4Y were often assumed to serve similar functions because they share a 97% sequence homology, whereas mouse NLGN4-like is quite divergent. Many NLGN-mediated synaptic effects are modulated through post-translation modifications, which exert temporal and spatial control. In this report, we characterize a conserved phosphorylation site, serine 712, on NLGN4X and 4Y. Despite serine 712 being located in a highly conserved region between NLGN4X and 4Y, we observed kinase specificity. PKA exclusively phosphorylates NLGN4X S712, whereas Cdk5 phosphorylates S712 on both NLGN4X and 4Y. NLGN4X S712 phosphorylation regulated spine density, with phosphorylation reducing mature mushroom spines and unphosphorylated S712 increasing spines and enhancing miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency.</p>

                <p>Central sensitization plays a critical role in bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC). Electroacupuncture (EA) nerve stimulation therapy has been broadly acknowledged as an effective means of alleviating chronic pathological pain. However, it remains to be explored whether EA is effective in mitigating pain-sensitive symptoms of BPS/IC and the mechanisms involved. This study aims to investigate the analgesic effect and mechanism of EA therapy. We employed several techniques: mechanical pain threshold tests to assess pain sensitivity, urodynamic studies to evaluate bladder function, western blotting for protein analysis, immunofluorescence for visualizing, and transcriptomics. A rat cystitis model was established through a systemic intraperitoneal injection with cyclophosphamide (CYP). EA therapy was executed by stimulating the deep part of the hypochondriac point. EA treatment was observed to effectively reduce mechanical allodynia, enhance urinary function, suppress the activation of microglial cells, and alleviate neuroinflammation. Additionally, EA demonstrated the capability to downregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)&ndash;tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) signal transduction in the spinal dorsal horn. Transcriptome sequencing has indicated that EA therapy potentially inhibits excitatory neural transmission and modulates several pathways related to longevity. Furthermore, EA therapy has shown efficacy in treating conditions such as Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases. In conclusion, by regulating the BDNF&ndash;TrkB signaling, EA nerve stimulation can effectively alleviate bladder dysfunction and mechanical allodynia in the CYP-induced cystitis model. Our research elucidates the underlying mechanisms of EA therapy in treating bladder dysfunction and offers new theoretical insights for addressing painful sensitization in BPS.</p>

Neurons in the primary visual cortex respond to binocular disparity in random dot patterns, even when the contrast is inverted between eyes (false depth cue). In contrast, neurons in the ventral stream largely cease to respond to false depth cues. This study evaluated whether GABAergic inhibition is involved in suppressing false depth cues in the human ventral visual cortex. We compared GABAergic inhibition (GABA+) and glutamatergic excitation (Glx) during the viewing of correlated and anticorrelated binocular disparity in 18 participants using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were taken from the early visual cortex (EVC) and the lateral occipital cortex (LO). Three visual conditions were presented per voxel location: correlated binocular disparity, anticorrelated binocular disparity, or a blank gray screen with a fixation cross. To identify differences in neurochemistry, GABA+ or Glx levels were compared across viewing conditions. In EVC, correlated disparity increased Glx over anticorrelated and rest conditions, also mirrored in the Glx/GABA+ ratio. In LO, anticorrelated disparity decreased GABA+ and increased Glx. The Glx/GABA+ ratio showed increased excitatory over inhibitory drive to anticorrelated disparity in LO. Glx during viewing of anticorrelation in LO was predictive of object-selective BOLD activity in the same region. We provide evidence that early and ventral visual cortices change GABA+ and Glx concentrations during presentation of correlated and anticorrelated disparity, suggesting a contribution of cortical excitation and inhibition to disparity selectivity.</p>

                <p>Impulsivity is often considered a risk factor for drug addiction; however, not all evidence supports this view. In the present study, we used a food reward delay-discounting task (DDT) to categorize rats as low-, middle-, and high-impulsive but failed to find any difference among these groups in the acquisition and maintenance of cocaine self-administration (SA), regardless of electrical footshock punishment. Additionally, there were no group differences in locomotor responses to acute cocaine in rats with or without a history of cocaine SA. Unexpectedly, chronic cocaine SA selectively increased impulsive choice in low-impulsive rats. Resting-state fMRI analysis revealed a positive correlation between impulsivity and cerebral blood volume in the midbrain, thalamus, and auditory cortex. Using these three regions as seeds, we observed a negative correlation between impulsivity and functional connectivity between the midbrain and frontal cortex, as well as between the thalamus and frontal cortex (including the orbitofrontal, primary, and parietal cortices) in low-impulsive rats. These correlations were attenuated following chronic cocaine SA. RNAscope in situ hybridization assays revealed a significant reduction in dopamine (DA) D<SUB>1</SUB>, D<SUB>2</SUB>, and D<SUB>3</SUB> receptor mRNA expression in the corticostriatal regions of low-impulsive rats after cocaine SA. Our findings challenge the widely held view that impulsivity is a vulnerability factor for cocaine use disorder. Instead, chronic cocaine use appears to selectively increase impulsive choice decision-making in normally low-impulsive rats, associated with reduced functional connectivity and DA receptor expression in the mesocorticolimbic DA network.</p>

                <p>Human brain banks are essential for studying a wide variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, yet the variability in postmortem interval (PMI)&mdash;the time from death to tissue preservation&mdash;poses significant challenges due to rapid cellular decomposition, protein alterations, and RNA degradation. Furthermore, the postmortem transcriptomic alterations occurring within distinct cell types are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the effect of a 3&nbsp;h postmortem interval on single-nucleus RNA signatures in the brains of wild-type (WT) and PS19 mice, a common model of tauopathy. We observed that basic quality control metrics (such as the number of genes and reads per cell), total nuclei counts, and RNA integrity number (RIN<sup>e</sup>) remained consistent across all samples, regardless of PMI or genotype. However, a 3&nbsp;h PMI diminished the number of genes differentially expressed between PS19 and WT mice, suggesting an impact of delayed processing on the detection of disease-specific transcriptomic signatures. When directly comparing 3&nbsp;h PMI versus freshly harvested 0&nbsp;h mouse brains, we identified genes upregulated in neurons and interneurons involved in DNA repair, immune response, and stress pathways. Furthermore, genes that were altered in non-neuronal cell types at 3 versus 0&nbsp;h PMI were associated with cell&ndash;cell adhesion processes. These findings highlight the effects of PMI on single-nucleus transcriptional changes that may dampen the true changes in cellular states in banked brain tissues.</p>

                <p>Neuroinflammation has been widely recognized as the primary pathophysiological mechanism underlying ischemic white matter lesions (IWML) in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Adenosine A2A receptor (A2aR), an important adenosine receptor, exhibits a dual role in neuroinflammation by modulating both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. This study aimed to investigate the specific functions and mechanisms of A2aR in neuroinflammation. The findings revealed that A2aR initially exerted a proinflammatory role in the CCH model, transitioning to an anti-inflammatory role in later stages by regulating the phenotypic transformation of microglia. Further analyses using coimmunoprecipitation couple with mass spectrometry, in situ proximity ligation assay, AlphaFold protein structure prediction, [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPS binding assay, and NanoBiT technology demonstrated that A2aR formed heteromers with mGluR5 during the early stage of CCH under high glutamate conditions, promoting the polarization of microglia toward a proinflammatory phenotype. In contrast, during later stages characterized by low glutamate levels, A2aR predominantly existed as a monomer, facilitating microglial polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Our findings indicate that elevated glutamate levels drive the formation of A2aR&ndash;mGluR5 heteromers, contributing to neuroinflammation by promoting proinflammatory microglial polarization in CCH white matter. Conversely, under low glutamate conditions, A2aR primarily functions in its monomeric form, favoring an anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype and exerting a protective effect. This study elucidates the mechanism by which A2aR mediates microglial phenotypic transformation and participates in neuroinflammation under CCH. It also identifies A2aR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of IWML.</p>

                Background The global shift in corporate philosophy from wealth maximization to share value creation has propelled sustainable finance into the forefront of research endeavours. Despite its significance, the realm of sustainable finance, especially in the context of mergers and acquisitions, remains relatively underexplored. Objective This research intends to identify the gap by conducting a cutting-edge and expansive systematic review, unravelling the intricate layers of sustainable finance concerning mergers and acquisitions. Data source The data source is Web of Science to start with, yielding 41 publications. A similar search on Scopus yielded 52 articles. Not surprisingly, the 41 publications discovered via the Web of Science search were also found in the Scopus results. Study eligibility criteria Papers on business, management, environmental studies, corporate finance, economics, and ethics are featured. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Employing advanced methodologies including machine learning tools, our research delves into domain specific influential papers, top-contributing journals, noteworthy authors, institutions, and nations. By dissecting the context and methodologies employed in scholarly works, we aim to instil a through overview of the current body of knowledge. our study categorizes the selected scholarly research into four distinct objectives, facilitating a nuanced understanding of the diverse perspectives within the field. Each stratum of papers is meticulously analysed and discussed, offering insights into key themes and patterns. To guide future research initiatives, we present a synthesis of pertinent research questions, exploring avenues such as the incorporation of innovative financial instruments like green bonds and artificial intelligence. Results Since the Sustainable Development Goals were introduced in 2016, sustainable finance has become an increasingly important topic in merger and acquisition research. Research is progressing at a rapid pace in China and Australia, while emerging nations are falling behind. In addition, this study specifies the necessity of conducting a more comprehensive examination of the habits of company representatives regarding sustainable investments. This aspect has been neglected in earlier research. Additionally, because global M&As are becoming more common, research on cross-border M&As must take precedence over domestic ones. Finally, there is a gap in the current body of knowledge about greenwashing, green audits, and the use of AI in sustainable finance. Conclusions and implications of key findings Machine learning and big data analytics may help scholars get a more thorough grasp of the historical and present significance of sustainability in M&A. New era researchers may advance the potential yet unexplored topics.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. This study’s aim was to compare the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20–40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between the number of periodontopathogens and the amount of nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected, DNA was isolated, the entire 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, and sample libraries were prepared in accordance to the Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology procedure. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity in saliva samples that were pooled according to three groups; T2DM patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3), was measured using bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the relationships between the periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium spp.) and denitrifying community (Haemophilus, Neisseria, Rothia, and Veillonella) were assessed. Results Alpha-diversity analysis revealed, the G1 group had significantly lower bacterial diversity and abundance than groups G2 and G3 (p< 0.0001). However, the microbiota profiles of diabetic patient groups with periodontitis and gingivitis were comparable. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, potential biomarkers for differentiating between gingivitis and periodontitis were discovered. Areas under the curve (AUC) between Fusobacterium spp. and Neisseria were found to be 0.94 (p = 0.43), while the AUC between P. gingivalis and Rothia was not significant (0.84, p = 0.08). Conclusion People with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis exhibit different relationships between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in their salivary microbiome. These features might be essential indicators for early identification and treatment of gingivitis in order to prevent periodontitis.

                Background Posthepatectomy liver dysfunction can lead to fatal outcomes, making it a highly undesirable complication. Numerous studies have attempted to mitigate liver dysfunction after hepatectomy. However, in the context of hepatectomy, Royal Jelly, previously known for its various benefits to liver health, has not been studied. Methods In this study, thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups. Just before undergoing 80% hepatectomy, 16 rats received intravenous Royal Jelly (RJ group), while the remaining 16 rats were administered intravenous phosphate-buffered saline in a blinded manner (PBS group). Four rats died before the scheduled time for specimen collection, leaving 28 rats for analysis. Forty-eight hours after hepatectomy, liver function (bilirubin and prothrombin time) was evaluated in all rats. Additionally, hepatocyte proliferation was examined using the Ki67 marker, which was obtained from the remaining liver specimens. The difference in bilirubin levels and prothrombin time between the two groups was tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. The difference in Ki-67 percentage between the two groups was analyzed using the t-test. Results The RJ group exhibited a lower median total bilirubin level compared to the PBS group (p<0.001). Additionally, the prothrombin time in the RJ group was lower than that of the PBS group (p<0.05). The Ki-67 percentage in the RJ group was also lower than in the PBS group (p<0.05). These findings suggest that the rats administered Royal Jelly demonstrated better liver function compared to the other group. Conclusions Administer intravenous Royal Jelly to rats undergoing 80% hepatectomy helps to protect liver function. This study indicates the potential for further research on Royal Jelly as a possible alternative for reducing liver dysfunction following surgery or other medical conditions.

                Background: Early studies found that the mental health problems rate was relatively high in university students. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental problems and associated factors in university students. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study at Supara mental health service in the Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital between February 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The secondary assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 8 items from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess suicidal risk (8Q), , and the Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-15). The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. In addition, multivariable regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results: A total of 184 participants (62% female; mean age = 22.49 years (SD 3.93) were recruited. The depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and anxiety disorders rates were 57.1%, 15.2% and 13.6%, respectively. Grade point averages (GPAs) below 3.0 (OR=3.09, 95%CI: 1.17-8.14) and a family history of mental disorder (OR=3.40, 95%CI: 1.10-10.48) were significant associated factors of moderate to severe mental health problems. Detecting and screening these factors may help the university to provide early detection and treatment for students. Conclusions: Depressive disorders were the most common mental health disorders. Females, low GPAs and a family history of mental disorder were predictors of moderate to severe mental health problems.

                Background There is evidence that patients with COVID-19 have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than the normal population. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems and their associated factors in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospitel in Thailand. Methods Mental health problems were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 items, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. McNemar's test was used to compare the prevalence of mental health problems between day 1 and day 7. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results A total of 186 participants (68.3% female; mean age = 37.21 years (SD 13.66) were recruited. The depression, anxiety, and stress rate on day 1 of admission was 26.9%, 32.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Having mild COVID-19 symptoms was a significantly associated factor with anxiety (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.05-6.89) and stress (OR=4.53, 95%CI: 1.32-15.55). Conclusions There was a high rate of mental health problems in COVID-19 patients. Detecting and managing mental health problems should be considered standard care for COVID-19 patients.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal was to examine the effect of sociodemographic variables, Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical stages and pathology on brain metabolism in Down syndrome (DS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD. Hypometabolism is more tightly related to CSF NfL levels than to core AD biomarkers. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The Earth continues to suffer from the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak even now, particularly due to the absence of appropriate theoretical frameworks for related emergency responses. In this study, we provided a simplified model for the emergency response to the coronavirus infection. We employed a qualitative content analysis, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist and flow diagram. Specifically, we examined eight underlying factors (leaders’ inability, focus on economic recovery, controversies regarding the usage of face masks, unprecedented reliance on herd immunity, hasty research and development, late decision-making, coordination failure, and occurrence of natural hazards) and eight selected overarching factors (global leadership, national policies, individual strategies, culture, research and development, timing, communication, and contingency). Considering these factors, we proposed the “Earth as a comprehensive system” approach, under which elements of the pandemic response are comprehensively included to facilitate problem-solving, social support, strategic use, assistance from various professionals, and education. The operational mechanism of this approach clearly emphasizes unified efforts for responding to a pandemic by systematically including various interdependent components of the Earth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-294/v1?src=rss">Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Case series of extensive resections and reconstructions with literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. Head and neck involvement accounts for only 10–15% of cases. Achieving clear margins in this region is challenging owing to anatomical constraints. Such cases often require extensive resection and complex reconstructions. This study presents a case series of extensive dermatofibrosarcoma resections in the head and neck, focusing on the surgical margins, reconstruction strategies, recurrence rates, and adjuvant therapy. We report four cases of head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma involving the cheek and scalp. Surgery included wide local excision with margins of 3–5 cm, which was confirmed intraoperatively by frozen section analysis. Reconstruction involved free flaps, local flaps, and healing with secondary intention. The choice depends on the defect size and location. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to selected cases. All patients achieved negative margins. One patient developed flap necrosis that required revision surgery. No local recurrence was observed during the follow-up (1–7 years). Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma justifies aggressive surgical resection to achieve clear margins, which is the key to reducing the risk of recurrence. Free flaps and local reconstruction techniques ensure good functional and aesthetic outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated in patients with close margins or deep invasion. Long-term follow-up is essential owing to its high recurrence potential.

                The enteric nervous system (ENS), an elaborate network of neurons and glia woven through the gastrointestinal tract, is integral for digestive physiology and broader human health. Commensurate with its importance, ENS dysfunction is linked to a range of debilitating gastrointestinal disorders. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), with their pleiotropic roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, serve as key developmental effectors within the ENS. Herein, we review the regulatory dynamics of miRNAs in ENS ontogeny, showcasing specific miRNAs implicated in both congenital and acquired enteric neuropathies, such as Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR), achalasia, intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND), chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), and slow transit constipation (STC). By delineating miRNA-mediated mechanisms in these diseases, we underscore their importance for ENS homeostasis and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets.

                Ali et al. investigate proteomic changes in cerebrospinal fluid across multiple Alzheimer’s disease cohorts. They identify 2,029 dysregulated proteins that cluster into four groups, enriched in different biological processes compromised during different stages of AD continuum. They create and validate robust models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status.

                Whether tissue stem cells balance self-renewal with multipotent differentiation through successive binary steps or a multiple-option choice is unclear. Puig-Barbe and colleagues find a dimerization network of bHLH factors in the Drosophila intestine that provides unified regulation to the choice between stem, absorptive, and secretory fates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93063">Microprism-based two-photon imaging of the mouse inferior colliculus reveals novel organizational principles of the auditory midbrain</a></h4>

              
                To navigate real-world listening conditions, the auditory system relies on the integration of multiple sources of information. However, to avoid inappropriate cross-talk between inputs, highly connected neural systems need to strike a balance between integration and segregation. Here, we develop a novel approach to examine how repeated neurochemical modules in the mouse inferior colliculus lateral cortex (LC) allow controlled integration of its multimodal inputs. The LC had been impossible to study via imaging because it is buried in a sulcus. Therefore, we coupled two-photon microscopy with the use of a microprism to reveal the first-ever sagittal views of the LC to examine neuronal responses with respect to its neurochemical motifs under anesthetized and awake conditions. This approach revealed marked differences in the acoustic response properties of LC and neighboring non-lemniscal portions of the inferior colliculus. In addition, we observed that the module and matrix cellular motifs of the LC displayed distinct somatosensory and auditory responses. Specifically, neurons in modules demonstrated primarily offset responses to acoustic stimuli with enhancement in responses to bimodal stimuli, whereas matrix neurons showed onset response to acoustic stimuli and suppressed responses to bimodal stimulation. Thus, this new approach revealed that the repeated structural motifs of the LC permit functional integration of multimodal inputs while retaining distinct response properties.

                Juvenile hormone (JH) is important to maintain insect larval status; however, its cell membrane receptor has not been identified. Using the lepidopteran insect <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> (cotton bollworm), a serious agricultural pest, as a model, we determined that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) cadherin 96ca (CAD96CA) and fibroblast growth factor receptor homologue (FGFR1) function as JH cell membrane receptors by their roles in JH-regulated gene expression, larval status maintaining, rapid intracellular calcium increase, phosphorylation of JH intracellular receptor MET1 and cofactor Taiman, and high affinity to JH III. Gene knockout of <i>Cad96ca</i> and <i>Fgfr1</i> by CRISPR/Cas9 in embryo and knockdown in various insect cells, and overexpression of CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mammalian HEK-293T cells all supported CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmitting JH signal as JH cell membrane receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101851">Dual role of FOXG1 in regulating gliogenesis in the developing neocortex via the FGF signalling pathway</a></h4>

              
                In the developing vertebrate central nervous system, neurons and glia typically arise sequentially from common progenitors. Here, we report that the transcription factor Forkhead Box G1 (<i>Foxg1</i>) regulates gliogenesis in the mouse neocortex via distinct cell-autonomous roles in progenitors and postmitotic neurons that regulate different aspects of the gliogenic FGF signalling pathway. We demonstrate that loss of <i>Foxg1</i> in cortical progenitors at neurogenic stages causes premature astrogliogenesis. We identify a novel FOXG1 target, the pro-gliogenic FGF pathway component <i>Fgfr3</i>, which is suppressed by FOXG1 cell-autonomously to maintain neurogenesis. Furthermore, FOXG1 can also suppress premature astrogliogenesis triggered by the augmentation of FGF signalling. We identify a second novel function of FOXG1 in regulating the expression of gliogenic cues in newborn neocortical upper-layer neurons. Loss of FOXG1 in postmitotic neurons non-autonomously enhances gliogenesis in the progenitors via FGF signalling. These results fit well with the model that newborn neurons secrete cues that trigger progenitors to produce the next wave of cell types, astrocytes. If FGF signalling is attenuated in <i>Foxg1</i> null progenitors, they progress to oligodendrocyte production. Therefore, loss of FOXG1 transitions the progenitor to a gliogenic state, producing either astrocytes or oligodendrocytes depending on FGF signalling levels. Our results uncover how FOXG1 integrates extrinsic signalling via the FGF pathway to regulate the sequential generation of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the cerebral cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104826">Gaskell, Langley, and the "para-sympathetic" idea</a></h4>

              
                Historically, the creation of the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system of the vertebrates is inextricably linked to the unification of the cranial and sacral autonomic outflows. There is an intriguing disproportion between the entrenchment of the notion of a ‘cranio-sacral’ pathway, which informs every textbook schematic of the autonomic nervous system since the early XX<sup>th</sup> century, and the wobbliness of its two roots: an anatomical detail overinterpreted by Walter Holbrook Gaskell (the ‘gap’ between the lumbar and sacral outflows), on which John Newport Langley grafted a piece of physiology (a supposed antagonism of these two outflows on external genitals), repeatedly questioned since, to little avail. I retrace the birth of a flawed scientific concept (the cranio-sacral outflow) and the way in which it ossified instead of dissipated. Then, I suggest that the critique of the ‘cranio-sacral outflow’ invites, in turn, a radical deconstruction of the very notion of a ‘parasympathetic’ outflow, and a more realistic description of the autonomic nervous system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96519">A microglia clonal inflammatory disorder in Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Somatic genetic heterogeneity resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations is widespread in human tissues and can cause diseases, however, few studies have investigated its role in neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients. Although the natural history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in humans, microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100218">Expression of a single inhibitory member of the Ly49 receptor family is sufficient to license NK cells for effector functions</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells recognize target cells through germline-encoded activation and inhibitory receptors enabling effective immunity against viruses and cancer. The Ly49 receptor family in the mouse and killer immunoglobin-like receptor family in humans play a central role in NK cell immunity through recognition of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and related molecules. Functionally, these receptor families are involved in the licensing and rejection of MHC-I-deficient cells through missing-self. The Ly49 family is highly polymorphic, making it challenging to detail the contributions of individual Ly49 receptors to NK cell function. Herein, we showed mice lacking expression of all Ly49s were unable to reject missing-self target cells in vivo, were defective in NK cell licensing, and displayed lower KLRG1 on the surface of NK cells. Expression of Ly49A alone on an H-2D<sup>d</sup> background restored missing-self target cell rejection, NK cell licensing, and NK cell KLRG1 expression. Thus, a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is sufficient to license NK cells and mediate missing-self in vivo.

">Distinct Alpha Networks Modulate Different Aspects of Perceptual Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                Why do we sometimes perceive a faint stimulus but miss it at other times? One explanation is that conscious perception fluctuates with the brains internal state, influencing how external stimuli are processed. Ongoing brain oscillations in the alpha band (8 to 13 Hz), thought to reflect neuronal excitability levels and play a role in functional inhibition, have been shown as a key contributor to such perceptual variability. Under high alpha conditions, faint stimuli are more likely to be missed. Some studies suggested alpha oscillations modulate perceptual criterion, shifting the threshold for interpreting sensory information; while others (including our prior work) suggested alpha modulates sensitivity, changing the precision of sensory encoding. Few studies observed modulations in both metrics, making these results appear mutually exclusive. Most studies have focused solely on overall alpha activity, whether within a region of interest or across the whole brain, and overlooked the coexistence of multiple distinct alpha networks, which fluctuate in terms of predominance and adapt to behavioural demands. Hence, it remained unclear whether different networks contributions to perception vary with their momentary state. Here, aiming to characterize how different alpha networks influence perceptual decision-making, we analyzed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded while participants performed a visual detection task with threshold-level stimuli. We found that while the visual alpha network modulates perceptual sensitivity, the sensorimotor alpha network modulates criterion in perceptual decision-making. These findings reconcile previous conflicting results and highlight the functional diversity of alpha networks in shaping perception.

">Intranasal administration of isradipine preferentially targets the brain</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Despite a concerted effort on the part of the scientific community, there is no proven strategy for slowing PD progression. Nevertheless, there are several potential drug targets that if functionally modified could alter disease course. Preclinical, epidemiological and clinical trial data suggest that Cav1 Ca2+ channels are one such target. Dihydropyridines (DHPs) are voltage-dependent, negative allosteric modulators of Cav1 Ca2+ channels that are approved for human use. However, the brain concentration of DHPs that can be safely achieved in humans with oral dosing is limited because of the widespread distribution of these channels, particularly in the vasculature. Intranasal administration of DHPs is a potential alternative delivery strategy that has been used with compounds that have similar limitations. To test the viability of this drug administration strategy, mice were intranasally or orally administered the DHP isradipine mixed in one of three vehicles. Plasma and brain concentrations of isradipine were then determined using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy at subsequent times. These studies demonstrated that intranasal administration of isradipine was able to achieve higher brain concentrations than those in the plasma, and these differences persisted for hours. Thus, intranasal administration of DHPs could be used to achieve high levels of Cav1 Ca2+ channel inhibition in the brain without producing unwanted peripheral side-effects.

">A Bitopic mTORC Inhibitor Reverses Neural Phenotypes in a Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Murine Model of SEGA-like Hamartomas</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cells (NSCs) of the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) generate diverse cell types including striatal glia during the neonatal period. NSC progeny uncouple stem cell-related mRNA transcripts from being translated during differentiation. We previously demonstrated that Tsc2 inactivation, which occurs in the neurodevelopmental disorder Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), prevents this from happening. Loss of Tsc2 causes hyperactivation of the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), altered translation, retention of stemness in striatal glia, and the production of misplaced cytomegalic neurons having hypertrophic dendrite arbors. These phenotypes model characteristics of TSC hamartomas called subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). mTORC1 inhibitors called rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are currently used to treat TSC and to assess the role of mTORC1 in regulating TSC-related phenotypes. Rapalogs are useful for treating SEGAs. However, they require lifelong application, have untoward side effects, and resistance may occur. They also incompletely inhibit mTORC1 and have limited efficacy. Rapalink-1 is a bitopic inhibitor developed to overcome the limitations of rapalogs by linking rapamycin to a second-generation mTOR ATP competitive inhibitor, MLN0128. Here we explored the effect of Rapalink-1 on a TSC hamartoma model. The model is created by neonatal electroporation of mice having conditional Tsc2 genes. Prolonged Rapalink-1 treatment could be achieved with 1.5 or 3.0 mg/Kg injected intraperitoneally every five days. Rapalink-1 inhibited the mTORC1 pathway, decreased cell size, reduced neuron dendrite arbors, and reduced hamartoma size. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that cellular phenotypes in a TSC SEGA model are reversed by Rapalink-1 which may be useful to resolve TSC brain hamartomas.

">Long-term neuron tracking reveals balance of stability and plasticity in functional properties</a></h4>

              
                Neural stability is essential for executing learned motor behaviors while plasticity provides the flexibility needed to adapt to new tasks and environments. Although low-dimensional neural population dynamics exhibit long-term stability, the extent to which individual neurons retain their functional properties over time and balance the need for both stability and plasticity remains an open question. Tracking individual neurons across multiple recording sessions is crucial to addressing this question, yet conventional methods face challenges such as electrode drift, waveform variability, and large inter-electrode distances that limit the number of channels a neuron is observed on. Here, we introduce a waveform-based neuron tracking method optimized for standard microelectrode arrays, enabling the identification of the same neurons across sessions without relying on spatial overlap, a strategy commonly leveraged with high-density electrode arrays. We apply this method to assess the longitudinal stability of multiple neural properties, including firing rates, inter-spike intervals, tuning properties, and spike-field interactions. Our findings reveal that while spike waveform properties remain stable, certain functional properties such as ISI and tuning can exhibit gradual shifts, suggesting a balance between neural stability and plasticity. Understanding the persistence of individual neural signals provides insight into learning and adaptation while advancing the study of neural stability and plasticity over extended timescales. Beyond basic neuroscience, this framework has potential to enhance the long-term reliability of brain-machine interfaces and closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems that rely on chronic neural sensing.

">Validating FOXO4 as a therapeutic target for protecting against ischemia-reperfusion-caused neuronal injury</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous data suggest that in the conditions of I/R in mice and the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in cell cultures, FOXO4 facilitates inflammation and oxidative stress in non-brain tissues, indicating that downregulation of FOXO4 may be neuroprotective in I/R-induced injury in the brain. However, this possibility has not been tested in the cerebral I/R condition. Method: FOXO4 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) primary neuronal cultures were treated with an oxidative stress inducer, menadione (MD), or OGD, and then cell viability was assessed via ATP and MTT assays. The KO and WT mice at 2-3 months were subjected to one-hour (h) transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Mice were sacrificed after 24 h for TTC staining or after 48 h for immunohistochemical staining. Alternatively, animals were allowed to survive for 1-10 days after tMCAO to test their functional recovery. Furthermore, using a structure-based approach combined with cell-based assays, we screened FOXO4 inhibitors and identified actinomycin D (ActD) as a potent FOXO4 inhibitor. We also tested the therapeutic role of ActD in both in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke. Result: KO of FOXO4 reduced the infarct volume, improved animal survival, decreased neurological deficits, and enhanced functional recovery compared to WT mice. Immunohistochemical staining of astrocytes and microglia revealed that KO brains showed a reduced number of astrocytes and microglia in the peri-infarcted area two days after I/R. Western blot analysis of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1?, IL-6, and TNF-?, indicated decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines two days following I/R. The identified FOXO4 inhibitor, ActD, attenuated oxidative stress and OGD-induced neuronal death. ActD also reduced neuronal injury of the brain and enhanced functional recovery in WT mice following tMCAO. Conclusion: We conclude that disrupting FOXO4 is neuroprotective and the identified inhibitor, ActD, may be a therapeutic agent for treating ischemic stroke induced brain injury.

">An In Vivo Model of Alpha-Synuclein Spread from Gut to Brain</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of pathological aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. There is evidence that misfolding and propagation of alpha-synuclein aggregates through networks of interconnected neurons is responsible for the pathological spread and progress neuron loss. However, in vivo models demonstrating such pathological progression remain elusive. Results: This study utilizes a zebrafish model in order to interrogate the mechanisms of alpha- synuclein toxicity and spread. We describe the development of a zebrafish model of endogenous neuronal human alpha-synuclein expression that causes, in young fish, behavioral and neuronal changes as well as microglia activation. In aged fish, alpha-synuclein expression induces a slow but progressive pathological phenotype manifesting in neuron loss within the gut and the CNS. This model is further utilized to seed gut pathology by incorporating a novel method of feeding human alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils in order to initiate protein misfolding at an early age. The combination of endogenous neuronal expression of alpha-synuclein and the exogenous addition of misfolded protein facilitates the development of brain pathology and subsequent neuron loss in the CNS. In addition to the pathological alterations induced with the fibril feeding model, genetic changes were identified by single cell RNA sequencing. These gene changes resulted in pathway alteration that implicate neurodegenerative disease processes. Conclusion: This model of alpha-synuclein pathology is useful for understanding mechanisms underlying disease initiation and can replicate the progressive development of pathological synuclein accumulation. It has the potential to induce neuron to neuron spread and also offers a way to explore what interventions may prevent such pathological progression.

">The Pesticide Chlorpyrifos Increases the Risk of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose: Pesticides have been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is unclear which specific pesticides contribute to this association and whether it is causal. Since chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure has been implicated as a risk factor for PD, we investigated its association to incident PD and if this association is biologically plausible using human, rodent, and zebrafish (ZF) studies. Methods: The association of CPF with PD was assessed using the UCLA PEG study (829 PD and 824 control subjects), and proximity-based exposure estimates from living or working near agricultural CPF use. For the mammalian studies, 6 months old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups, CPF and controls, for open field, rotarod, and wire hang behavioral testing. Mice were then exposed to CPF in an inhalation chamber (0.65-2.9 mg/m3/day) for 6 hrs./day 5 days/wk., whereas control mice were exposed to vehicle alone. Behavioral tests were performed before and 2.5 months after CPF exposure following a 3-day washout. Mice were then perfused for immunohistochemical analysis. For the mechanistic studies, ZF embryos were treated with CPF (250 nM) 24 hours post fertilization for 5-7 days. Behavioral testing was performed using the Viewpoint Imaging System. Neuronal loss and microglial activation were determined using immunohistochemistry. Neuronal autophagic flux was determined using autophagy modulators in GFP-LC3 transgenic ZF and Western blots. Results: Long-term residential CPF exposure was linked to an increased risk of developing PD with an odds ratio of 2.68 (CI 1.58-4.55). Mice exposed to aerosolized CPF developed motor impairment and a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and activation of microglia. TH positive neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) had significantly higher levels of phosphoserine 129 (pS129) alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), a marker for pathological phosphorylated alpha-syn, and ubiquitin. In contrast, neither pS129 &alpha-syn or ubiquitin accumulated in TH neurons in the VTA after CPF exposure. Consistent with the mice data, CPF exposure resulted in impairment of locomotor activity and selective loss of aminergic neurons in ZF. We also found an increase in neuronal apoptosis and microglial activation. Importantly, dopamine neuron loss was found to be at least partially dependent on gamma1-synuclein (closest functional homologue to human alpha-syn) as neuronal loss did not occur in gamma1-synuclein knockout ZF. Using an in vivo ZF assay, we found impaired autophagic flux and an increase in lysosomal labelling within the zebrafish brain. CPF exposure also led to elevated gamma1-synuclein and p62 (autophagic cargo protein) levels consistent with impaired degradation. Furthermore, induction of autophagy was protective, supporting the hypothesis that impaired autophagic flux is at least partially responsible for neuron loss following CPF exposure. Conclusions: CPF exposure is associated with an increased risk of developing PD and this association is likely causal since PD-like pathology was recapitulated in animal models. Furthermore, impaired autophagic flux appears to underly this toxicity, a pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of PD.

">Crossmodal Interaction of Flashes and Beeps Across Time and Number Follows Bayesian Causal Inference</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory perception requires the brain to dynamically infer causal relationships between sensory inputs across various dimensions, such as temporal and spatial attributes. Traditionally, Bayesian Causal Inference (BCI) models have generally provided a robust framework for understanding sensory processing in unidimensional settings where stimuli across sensory modalities vary along one dimension such as spatial location, or numerosity (Samad et al., 2015). However, real-world sensory processing involves multidimensional cues, where the alignment of information across multiple dimensions influences whether the brain perceives a unified or segregated source. In an effort to investigate sensory processing in more realistic conditions, this study introduces an expanded BCI model that incorporates multidimensional information, specifically numerosity and temporal discrepancies. Using a modified sound-induced flash illusion (SiFI) paradigm with manipulated audiovisual disparities, we tested the performance of the enhanced BCI model. Results showed that integration probability decreased with increasing temporal discrepancies, and our proposed multidimensional BCI model accurately predicts multisensory perception outcomes under the entire range of stimulus conditions. This multidimensional framework extends the BCI models applicability, providing deeper insights into the computational mechanisms underlying multisensory processing and offering a foundation for future quantitative studies on naturalistic sensory processing.

">Processing Ergativity in Compound Light Verb Constructions: Electrophysiological Evidence from Hindi</a></h4>

              
                Ergativity marks subject arguments as agents of a transitive event and thereby signals verbal transitivity and influences language comprehension. We report here on an event-related brain potentials (ERP) study in Hindi, in which we investigated this interconnection to ascertain whether the ergative case as a processing cue and its ERP correlates can be generalized across and within ergative languages. The case marking on the subject argument (ergative or nominative case) in our study either matched or mismatched with the transitivity of the light verb (transitive or intransitive) in compound light verb constructions. Ergative case violations due to an intransitive light verb evoked an N400 effect, whereas nominative case violations due to a transitive light verb elicited a P600 effect. The results reveal neurophysiological differences in the processing of ergative and nominative case alignment modulated by the transitivity of the light verbs. The findings highlight the need for cross-linguistic research to aim beyond universality and elucidate the mechanism underlying the processing of language-specific structural variations.

">The entorhinal spatial map integrates visual identity information of landmarks</a></h4>

              
                The location and identity of landmarks provide spatial and nonspatial information of an environment, respectively, to guide spatial navigation. While the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is essential for representing spatial information, it is unclear whether it also encodes landmark identity. Here, we conducted two-photon calcium imaging of the MEC when mice navigated in multiple virtual environments, and discovered a general ability of the MEC to encode landmark identity through cue cells, which responded to individual landmarks during virtual navigation. Cue cells represented landmark identity by exhibiting more distinct activity patterns between visually disparate landmarks than identical ones. The representation was modulated by the spatial shift of cue cell activity relative to landmark location. Moreover, the identity encoding by the same cue cell population changed between different environments but was maintained within the same environment despite increased experience. In contrast, landmark location encoding by cue cells was regulated by experience, suggesting different mechanisms underlying the encodings of landmark identity and location. Finally, compared to cue cells, grid cells weakly encoded landmark identity but more robustly encoded landmark location. Thus, the MEC integrates both spatial and nonspatial information during navigation, but potentially through different circuit mechanisms.

">Glial Contribution to the Pathogenesis of Post-Operative Delirium Revealed by Multi-omic Analysis of Brain Tissue from Neurosurgery Patients</a></h4>

              
                Post-operative delirium (POD) is a common complication after surgery especially in elderly patients, characterized by acute disturbances in consciousness and cognition, which negatively impacts long-term outcomes. Effective treatments remain elusive due to the unclear pathophysiology of POD. To address the knowledge gap, we investigated DNA methylation profiles and gene expression changes in brain cells from POD and non-POD patients who underwent brain resection surgery for medication refractory epilepsy. DNA methylation analysis revealed alteration in epigenetic status of immune and inflammation-related genes. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) identified POD-specific glial cell alterations, particularly in microglia, where neuroinflammation was strongly enhanced, consistent with epigenetic findings. Astrocytes exhibited changes in synapse-related functions and migration. Furthermore, downstream analysis indicated similarities between POD-associated glial cell states and pathologies such as encephalitis and dementia. Overall, this study-the first multi-omics analysis of brain tissue from POD patients-provides direct evidence of glial cell contributions to POD pathogenesis, and highlights potential therapeutic targets.

">Co-release of opposing signaling molecules from cortical neurons controls the escalation and release of aggression</a></h4>

              
                Prolonged social isolation induces a distinct state characterized by numerous impacts on behavior, including increased aggression and altered social behaviors, but the contributions of cortical circuits to these behaviors are poorly understood. Here, we find that social isolation promotes aggression and increases investigatory behaviors leading up to aggression in both males and female mice. Genetic characterization of the neuropeptidergic population of Tachykinin-2 expressing (Tac2+) neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) reveals a population of predominately early-layer GABAergic neurons that are activated by aggressive encounters in isolated mice. Cells expressing the Neurokinin 3 receptor, which binds the peptide product of Tac2, are similarly activated by aggressive interactions in isolated mice. Loss of function perturbations targeting the co-release of Neurokinin B (NkB), the stimulatory peptide encoded by the gene Tac2, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from mPFC Tac2+ neurons, reveals dissociable functions for each signaling molecule in the distinct behaviors that tile an aggressive encounter. GABA transmission form Tac2+ neurons controls the release of aggression, whereas Tac2/NkB signaling controls the investigatory behaviors escalating to aggression. These findings reveal dissociable roles for opposing signaling molecules released from the same neuron in the control over aggression, suggesting a neurochemical mechanism by which internal states may exert coordinated, sequential effects on a broad array of behaviors.

">Episodic memory facilitates flexible decision making via access to detailed events</a></h4>

              
                Our experiences contain countless details that may be important in the future, yet we rarely know which will matter and which won't. This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet whether and how this ability supports adaptive behavior is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory system's ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision making task where participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across four experiments (total n = 472), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments, and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision making under uncertainty.

">Similar but different: ERP evidence on the processing of mental and physical experiencer verbs in Malayalam.</a></h4>

              
                The study reported here was conducted to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of processing two types of subject experiencer verbs, namely mental experiencer verbs and physical experiencer verbs in Malayalam, a South Dravidian language. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded as twenty-eight first-language speakers of Malayalam read intransitive sentences with the two types of experiencer verbs. Critical stimuli were either fully acceptable, whereby the subject case matched the requirements of the verb, or unacceptable, whereby the subject case violated the requirements of the verb. A linear mixed-models analysis confirmed negativity effects in the time window 400-800 ms for mental and physical experiencer verbs. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the negativity peaked relatively early for mental experiencer verbs, whereas relatively late for physical experiencer verbs. Further, the sentence-final acceptability of trials modulated the ERPs in non-anomalous conditions but not in violation conditions, and this modulation qualitatively differed between mental and physical experiencer verbs. These results suggest that, whilst a qualitatively similar mechanism is involved in the processing of both kinds of experiencer verbs, subtle but robust differences are inherent in processing mental versus physical experiencer verbs in Malayalam.

Specifically, a multilayer time-varying brain network with six time-windows equally divided by each epoch was constructed to investigate the segregation and integration of brain functional connectivity. The results showed that the inter-layer connectivity strength was consistently lower than the intra-layer connectivity strength for various separation degrees and SNR levels. Moreover, the connectivity strength of the multilayer time-varying brain network increased with decreasing separation degrees and initially increased and subsequently decreased with decreasing SNR levels. The second time-window of the network showed the most significant variation under some conditions and was determined as the core layer. The topology within the core layer was mainly reflected in the connectivity between the frontal and parietal-occipital cortices.

	<p>Background and Objective: The discovery of novel molecular biomarkers via next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized how glioblastomas (GBMs) are classified nowadays. This has resulted in more precise diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches to address this malignancy. The present work examines the applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in GBM, focusing on its potential to address tumor complexity and therapeutic resistance and improve patient outcomes. Methods: A scoping review of original studies published between 2009 and 2024 was conducted using the PUBMED and EMBASE databases. Studies in English or Spanish related to single-cell analysis and GBM were included. Key Findings: The database search yielded 453 publications. Themes related to scRNA-seq applied for the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and understanding of the cancer biology of GBM were used as criteria for article selection. Of the 24 studies that were included in the review, 11 focused on the tumor microenvironment and cell subpopulations in GBM samples, 5 investigated the use of sequencing to elucidate the GBM cancer biology, 3 examined disease prognosis using sequencing models, 3 applied translational research through scRNA-seq, and 2 addressed treatment-related problems in GBM elucidated by scRNA-seq. Conclusions: This scoping review explored the various clinical applications of scRNA-seq technologies in approaching GBM. The findings highlight the utility of this technology in unraveling the complex cellular and immune landscapes of GBM, paving the way for improved diagnosis and personalized treatments. This cutting-edge approach might strengthen treatment strategies against tumor progression and recurrence, setting the stage for multi-targeted interventions that could significantly improve outcomes for patients with aggressive, treatment-resistant GBMs.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Pain memory refers to the ability to encode, store, and recall information related to a specific pain event. Reviewing its common features is crucial, as it provides researchers with a foundational guide for designing studies that assess pain memory in individuals with chronic pain. The primary objective of this study was to examine the common characteristics&amp;amp;mdash;particularly the methodological approaches&amp;amp;mdash;of existing research on pain memory in adults with chronic pain. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using PubMed and Embase as search databases. Studies were included if they met the following criteria. (a) It involved only adults with chronic pain and (b) assessed at least one of the following parameters: pain intensity or pain unpleasantness. The exclusion criteria were the following: (a) not having pain memory assessment as a primary objective, (b) including participants under 18 years of age, (c) involving individuals without chronic pain (e.g., those with acute pain or healthy participants), (d) lacking essential information, or (e) unavailability of the full text. Results: From an initial pool of 4585 papers, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies exclusively involved adults with chronic pain, and all reported pain intensity, while only 27% assessed pain unpleasantness. Additionally, psychosocial variables were the most frequently reported non-pain-related outcomes. Regarding study protocols, most relied on daily data collection, with the most common recall period being within the first 48 h. Conclusions: The methodological characteristics identified in this review&amp;amp;mdash;particularly those with a high frequency of occurrence&amp;amp;mdash;should serve as fundamental guidelines for future research on pain memory in adults with chronic pain, and should be carefully considered by investigators in this field.</p>

	<p>Background: The beat-by-beat fluctuation of heart rate (HR) in its temporal sequence (HR dynamics) provides information on HR regulation by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and its dysregulation in pathological states. Commonly, linear analyses of HR and its variability (HRV) are used to draw conclusions about pathological states despite clear statistical and translational limitations. Objective: The main aim of this study was to compare linear and nonlinear HR measures, including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), based on ECG recordings by radiotelemetry in C57BL/6N mice to identify pathological HR dynamics. Methods: We investigated different behavioral and a wide range of pharmacological interventions which alter ANS regulation through various peripheral and/or central mechanisms including receptors implicated in psychiatric disorders. This spectrum of interventions served as a reference system for comparison of linear and nonlinear HR measures to identify pathological states. Results: Physiological HR dynamics constitute a self-similar, scale-invariant, fractal process with persistent intrinsic long-range correlations resulting in physiological DFA scaling coefficients of &amp;amp;alpha;~1. Strongly altered DFA scaling coefficients (&amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;ne; 1) indicate pathological states of HR dynamics as elicited by (1) parasympathetic blockade, (2) parasympathetic overactivation and (3) sympathetic overactivation but not inhibition. The DFA scaling coefficients are identical in mice and humans under physiological conditions with identical pathological states by defined pharmacological interventions. Conclusions: Here, we show the importance of tonic vagal function for physiological HR dynamics in mice, as reported in humans. Unlike linear measures, DFA provides an important translational measure that reliably identifies pathological HR dynamics based on altered ANS control by pharmacological interventions. Central ANS dysregulation represents a likely mechanism of increased cardiac mortality in psychiatric disorders.</p>

	<p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a group of conditions that arise early in development and are characterized by deficits in personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning. These disorders frequently co-occur and include conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Mood disorders (MDs), such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, also pose significant global health challenges due to their high prevalence and substantial impact on quality of life. Emerging evidence highlights overlapping neurobiological mechanisms between NDDs and MDs, including shared genetic susceptibilities, neurotransmitter dysregulation (e.g., dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways), neuroinflammation, and hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. Environmental factors such as early-life adversity further exacerbate these vulnerabilities, contributing to the complexity of their clinical presentation and comorbidity. Functional neuroimaging studies reveal altered connectivity in brain regions critical for emotional regulation and executive function, such as the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, across these disorders. Despite these advances, integrative diagnostic frameworks and targeted therapeutic strategies remain underexplored, limiting effective intervention. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the shared neurobiological underpinnings of NDDs and MDs, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary research, including genetic, pharmacological, and psychological approaches, for unified diagnosis and treatment. Addressing these intersections can improve clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by these disorders.</p>

                Pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, often associated with metastatic spread at diagnosis. We report the case of a 61-year-old male with a history of renal stones who presented with a four-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and declining visual acuity in the right eye. Imaging revealed a left hilar tumor with carcinomatous consolidation, bilateral parenchymal nodules, and left pleural effusion. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed choroidal lesions in the right eye, confirmed by orbital MRI as a subretinal intraocular lesion. Biopsies confirmed pulmonary SCC. The patient received six cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy alongside choroidal radiotherapy. After four cycles, choroidal metastases regressed, and visual acuity improved. Post-treatment imaging showed complete resolution of the intraocular lesion and a 34% reduction in tumor burden per RECIST 1.1. This case underscores the efficacy of combined systemic and localized therapies in managing advanced metastatic pulmonary SCC.

The validity of this dataset and its generation method was confirmed. However, its reliability was unclear. Not only validity but also reliability should be confirmed. Therefore, the present article investigated the reliability of the data and its method. Methods I performed a series of searches again and provided a new dataset on the number of articles in the three national newspapers. I followed the same procedure one year after the prior search. Results I found very strong correlations in article counts between the previous and current datasets, confirming their high reliability. Although there were some years when the number of articles differed between the two datasets, their differences were small. Conclusions Therefore, their reliability was confirmed to be high. Taken together, both the validity and reliability of the data and its generation method were confirmed.

                <p>Epilepsy, affecting millions globally, often leads to significant cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities, particularly in children. Anxiety and depression are particularly prevalent, with roughly a quarter of pediatric epilepsy patients having a comorbid diagnosis. Current treatments inadequately address these issues. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a melanocortin peptide, has shown promise in mitigating deficits after early-life seizures (ELS), potentially through mechanisms beyond its canonical action on the melanocortin 2 receptor. This study explores the hypothesis that recurrent ELS is associated with long-term anxiety and that treatment with ACTH can prevent this anxiety through a mechanism that involves the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the brain. Our findings reveal that ACTH ameliorates anxiety-like behavior associated with ELS, without altering seizure parameters, in wild-type but not in male and female MC4R knock-out mice. Our findings also show that knocking-in MC4R in either neurons or astrocytes was able to rescue the anxiety-like behavior after ACTH treatment. Furthermore, our results show that ACTH normalizes important astrocytic proteins like glial fibrillary acidic protein and aquaporin-4 after ELS. This suggests that ACTH's beneficial effects on anxiety are mediated through MC4R activation in both neuronal and astrocytic populations. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting MC4R as a treatment, highlighting its role in mitigating anxiety-like behaviors associated with ELS.</p>

                Background This study reviewed the environmental and economic impacts of urban development in mountainous areas, with special attention to the impacts on the livelihoods of people and biodiversity in Ghana. Forests in mountainous areas provide essential economic and ecosystem services ranging from food, medicinal plants, wood (for wood, construction, furniture, fuel for cooking and heating) and clean water. Economic benefits in the form of tourism are also important. The situation in Ghana is compared to global situations and trends. While few studies are conducted globally to protect mountain resources, in Ghana there is dearth of literature for this kind of study. Ironically, building on mountains is gradually becoming an acceptable practice in Ghana. Methods A descriptive design was adopted in this study which comprises monitoring and observing the rate of decline of forest resources within a specified period of time. The study also made use of mixed method approach which combined numerical data and textual information. Literature on the impacts of urban development on the livelihoods of mountain people and environment were reviewed. The general economy and environmental impact of mountainous infrastructure on mountain people were also reviewed. Results The study showed that fast urban development in mountainous areas has negative consequences for the livelihoods of forest dwellers, ecosystem services, and forest resources. Policies related to land use in mountainous areas were also reviewed, as well as the challenges faced by municipal assemblies’ planning departments. It was found that the work of municipal planning officials is influenced by political elites at the national level. Conclusions In order to discourage urban development on mountains, the planning department of municipal assemblies should be seen as autonomous, where independence should be given to the professionals involved.

                Background Radon gas, a decay product of radium, is a significant environmental health risk due to its radioactive properties. Understanding the radium content and radon exhalation rates in soil is crucial for evaluating potential radiological hazards and ensuring environmental safety. Methods Soil samples were collected from twelve different locations in Wukro, Tigray, representing various soil types. The sealed can technique, using LR-115 Type-II plastic track detectors, was employed to measure radium concentrations and radon exhalation rates over a four-month exposure period. Radon mass exhalation rates, surface exhalation rates, and radium concentrations were calculated, and the Alpha Index was also determined to assess radiological risk. Results and Discussion The radon mass exhalation rates ranged from 0.18 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1 to 0.82 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1, with a mean of 0.48 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1. Surface exhalation rates varied from 0.38 × 10−6Bq.m−2.d−1 to 1.72 × 10−6 Bq.m−2.d−1, averaging 1.02 × 10−6 Bq.m−2.d−1. Radium concentrations ranged from 0.33 to 1.47 Bq.kg−1, with an average of 0.87 Bq.kg−1. A significant positive correlation between radium content and radon exhalation rates was observed, indicating a direct relationship between these variables. Clay soils exhibited the highest radium concentrations, while sandy soils had the lowest. All measured values were below the safety limit of 370 Bq.kg−1 recommended by OECD and UNSCEAR, suggesting no significant radiological risk in the study area. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of monitoring natural radiation levels for environmental safety. The findings provide a baseline for future studies and emphasize the need for continuous assessment to detect any long-term changes in soil radioactivity.

                The article introduces the concept of ‘intellectual neighbourhood,’ a historical-philosophical framework emphasising the collaborative nature of knowledge production across time in Eurasia, where respect for diverse ideas flourished. The study traces the contributions of Ali Qushji and his followers, illustrating how their works emerged from this interconnected intellectual milieu. The analysis further highlights how cosmopolitan cities like Samarkand and Istanbul functioned as conduits for knowledge exchange and acknowledges the influence of key Islamic scholars such as Nasir al-Din Tusi. Ultimately, the article advocates for a deeper appreciation of historical contexts to inform the reconstruction of contemporary intellectual neighbourhoods. It underscores the critical importance of trust and collaboration in navigating today’s complex global landscape.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-692/v3?src=rss">Association of Leptin and Leptin receptor Gene polymorphisms with Insulin resistance in pregnant women: A cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Leptin, along with its receptor, are linked with mechanisms affecting a diverse array of pregnancy-specific pathologies that include gestational diabetes and intrauterine growth restriction. The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance. Methods 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62±29.23 and 59.88±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, ‘AA’ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00034-7?rss=yes">The curious interpretation of novel object recognition tests</a></h4>

              
                Novel object recognition tasks are commonly used to assess memory in rodents. These tests rely on an innate preference for exploring objects that are new or have been moved or changed. However, this preference, while normally seen in control conditions, is not immutable. Stressful experiences as well as lesions and genetic mutations can lead mice and rats to show clear preferences for exploring familiar objects and familiar locations. This opinion article discusses the evidence for changes in novelty preference, implications of this lability for assessing memory, and the significance of shifts in novelty preference as a readout of changes in curiosity with implications in approach–avoidance behavior and explore–exploit decision-making. Finally, we provide some recommendations for reporting and interpreting novelty preference task findings moving forward.

                Cheung et al. discovered hypothalamic subsets that encode threat, safety, predator imminence, anxiety, and arousal in freely behaving mice. These neural dynamics correlate with individual variations in defensiveness, providing insights into how innate fear is represented and scaled in the brain to guide survival responses.

                Cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells are known to interact within the tumor microenvironment and influence each other to impact on tumor progression. Here, Kay et al. discuss how they can also potentially metabolically interact with each other to alter the overall phenotype of the tumor and influence response to therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97330">Exploring the repository of de novo-designed bifunctional antimicrobial peptides through deep learning</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attractive candidates to combat antibiotic resistance for their capability to target biomembranes and restrict a wide range of pathogens. It is a daunting challenge to discover novel AMPs due to their sparse distributions in a vast peptide universe, especially for peptides that demonstrate potencies for both bacterial membranes and viral envelopes. Here, we establish a de novo AMP design framework by bridging a deep generative module and a graph-encoding activity regressor. The generative module learns hidden ‘grammars’ of AMP features and produces candidates sequentially pass antimicrobial predictor and antiviral classifiers. We discovered 16 bifunctional AMPs and experimentally validated their abilities to inhibit a spectrum of pathogens in vitro and in animal models. Notably, P076 is a highly potent bactericide with the minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.21 μM against multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, while P002 broadly inhibits five enveloped viruses. Our study provides feasible means to uncover the sequences that simultaneously encode antimicrobial and antiviral activities, thus bolstering the function spectra of AMPs to combat a wide range of drug-resistant infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102226">Nuclear Argonaute protein NRDE-3 switches small RNA partners during embryogenesis to mediate temporal-specific gene regulatory activity</a></h4>

              
                RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved pathway that utilizes Argonaute proteins and their associated small RNAs to exert gene regulatory function on complementary transcripts. While the majority of germline-expressed RNAi proteins reside in perinuclear germ granules, it is unknown whether and how RNAi pathways are spatially organized in other cell types. Here, we find that the small RNA biogenesis machinery is spatially and temporally organized during <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> embryogenesis. Specifically, the RNAi factor, SIMR-1, forms visible concentrates during mid-embryogenesis that contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a poly-UG polymerase, and the unloaded nuclear Argonaute protein, NRDE-3. Curiously, coincident with the appearance of the SIMR granules, the small RNAs bound to NRDE-3 switch from predominantly CSR-class 22G-RNAs to ERGO-dependent 22G-RNAs. NRDE-3 binds ERGO-dependent 22G-RNAs in the somatic cells of larvae and adults to silence ERGO-target genes; here we further demonstrate that NRDE-3-bound, CSR-class 22G-RNAs repress transcription in oocytes. Thus, our study defines two separable roles for NRDE-3, targeting germline-expressed genes during oogenesis to promote global transcriptional repression, and switching during embryogenesis to repress recently duplicated genes and retrotransposons in somatic cells, highlighting the plasticity of Argonaute proteins and the need for more precise temporal characterization of Argonaute-small RNA interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100611">Protein absorption in the zebrafish gut is regulated by interactions between lysosome rich enterocytes and the microbiome</a></h4>

              
                Dietary protein absorption in neonatal mammals and fishes relies on the function of a specialized and conserved population of highly absorptive lysosome-rich enterocytes (LREs). The gut microbiome has been shown to enhance absorption of nutrients, such as lipids, by intestinal epithelial cells. However, whether protein absorption is also affected by the gut microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we investigate connections between protein absorption and microbes in the zebrafish gut. Using live microscopy-based quantitative assays, we find that microbes slow the pace of protein uptake and degradation in LREs. While microbes do not affect the number of absorbing LRE cells, microbes lower the expression of endocytic and protein digestion machinery in LREs. Using transgene-assisted cell isolation and single cell RNA-sequencing, we characterize all intestinal cells that take up dietary protein. We find that microbes affect expression of bacteria-sensing and metabolic pathways in LREs, and that some secretory cell types also take up protein and share components of protein uptake and digestion machinery with LREs. Using custom-formulated diets, we investigated the influence of diet and LRE activity on the gut microbiome. Impaired protein uptake activity in LREs, along with a protein-deficient diet, alters the microbial community and leads to an increased abundance of bacterial genera that have the capacity to reduce protein uptake in LREs. Together, these results reveal that diet-dependent reciprocal interactions between LREs and the gut microbiome regulate protein absorption.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102980">Impaired fatty acid import or catabolism in macrophages restricts intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) infection of macrophages reprograms cellular metabolism to promote lipid retention. While it is clearly known that intracellular <i>Mtb</i> utilize host-derived lipids to maintain infection, the role of macrophage lipid processing on the bacteria’s ability to access the intracellular lipid pool remains undefined. We utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic approach to assess the impact of sequential steps in fatty acid metabolism on the growth of intracellular <i>Mtb</i>. Our analyses demonstrate that macrophages that cannot either import, store, or catabolize fatty acids restrict <i>Mtb</i> growth by both common and divergent antimicrobial mechanisms, including increased glycolysis, increased oxidative stress, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced autophagy, and nutrient limitation. We also show that impaired macrophage lipid droplet biogenesis is restrictive to <i>Mtb</i> replication, but increased induction of the same fails to rescue <i>Mtb</i> growth. Our work expands our understanding of how host fatty acid homeostasis impacts <i>Mtb</i> growth in the macrophage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101136">HIV-1 Vif disrupts phosphatase feedback regulation at the kinetochore, leading to a pronounced pseudo-metaphase arrest</a></h4>

              
                Virion Infectivity Factor (Vif) of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) targets and degrades cellular APOBEC3 proteins, key regulators of intrinsic and innate antiretroviral immune responses, thereby facilitating HIV-1 infection. While Vif’s role in degrading APOBEC3G is well-studied, Vif is also known to cause cell cycle arrest, but the detailed nature of Vif’s effects on the cell cycle has yet to be delineated. In this study, we employed high-temporal resolution single-cell live imaging and super-resolution microscopy to monitor individual cells during Vif-induced cell cycle arrest. Our findings reveal that Vif does not affect the G2/M boundary as previously thought. Instead, Vif triggers a unique and robust pseudo-metaphase arrest, distinct from the mild prometaphase arrest induced by Vpr. During this arrest, chromosomes align properly and form the metaphase plate, but later lose alignment, resulting in polar chromosomes. Notably, Vif, unlike Vpr, significantly reduces the levels of both Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) and 2 A (PP2A) at kinetochores, which regulate chromosome-microtubule interactions. These results unveil a novel role for Vif in kinetochore regulation that governs the spatial organization of chromosomes during mitosis.

                Haploinsufficiency for <i>GATA6</i> is associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) with variable comorbidity of pancreatic or diaphragm defects, although the etiology of disease is not well understood. Here, we used cardiac directed differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a platform to study GATA6 function during early cardiogenesis. GATA6 loss-of-function hESCs had a profound impairment in cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) specification and cardiomyocyte (CM) generation due to early defects during the mesendoderm and lateral mesoderm patterning stages. Profiling by RNA-seq and CUT&amp;RUN identified genes of the WNT and BMP programs regulated by GATA6 during early mesoderm patterning. Furthermore, interactome analysis detected GATA6 binding with developmental transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, suggesting cooperative regulation of cardiac lineage gene accessibility. We show that modulating WNT and BMP inputs during the first 48 hr of cardiac differentiation is sufficient to partially rescue CPC and CM defects in <i>GATA6</i> heterozygous and homozygous mutant hESCs. This study provides evidence of the regulatory functions for GATA6 directing human precardiac mesoderm patterning during the earliest stages of cardiogenesis to further our understanding of haploinsufficiency causing CHD and the co-occurrence of cardiac and other organ defects caused by human <i>GATA6</i> mutations.

">The Endo-GeneScreen Platform Identifies Drug-Like Probes that Regulate Endogenous Protein Levels within Physiological Contexts</a></h4>

              
                Traditional phenotypic drug discovery platforms have suffered from poor scalability and a lack of mechanistic understanding of newly discovered phenotypic probes. To address this, we created Endo-GeneScreen (EGS), a high-throughput enabled screening platform that identifies bioactive small molecules capable of regulating endogenous protein expression encoded by any preselected target gene within a biologically appropriate context. As a proof-of-concept, EGS successfully identified drug candidates that up-regulate endogenous expression of neuronal Syngap1, a gene that causes a neurodevelopmental disorder when haploinsufficient. For example, SR-1815, a previously unknown and undescribed kinase inhibitor, alleviated major cellular consequences of Syngap1 loss-of-function by restoring normal SynGAP protein levels and dampening neuronal hyperactivity within haploinsufficient neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that EGS assays accelerate preclinical development of identified drug candidates and facilitate mode-of-action deconvolution studies. Thus, EGS identifies first-in-class bioactive small molecule probes that promote biological discovery and precision therapeutic development.
