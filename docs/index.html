              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of anterior temporal lobe reduces distortions in memory from category knowledge</a></h4>

              
                Memory retrieval does not provide a perfect recapitulation of past events, but instead an imperfect reconstruction of event-specific details and general knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether this reconstruction relies on mixtures of signals from different memory systems, including one supporting general knowledge. Here, we investigate whether the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) distorts new memories due to prior category knowledge. In this experiment (N=36), participants encoded and retrieved image-location associations. Most images' locations were clustered according to their category, but some were in random locations. With this protocol, we previously demonstrated that randomly located images were retrieved closer to their category cluster relative to their encoded locations, suggesting an influence of category knowledge. We combined this procedure with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to the left ATL before retrieval. We separately examined event-specific details (error) and category knowledge (bias) to identify distinct signals attributable to different memory systems. We found that TMS to ATL attenuated bias in location memory, but only for atypical category members. The magnitude of error was not impacted, suggesting that a memory's fidelity can be decoupled from its distortion by category knowledge. This raises the intriguing possibility that retrieval is jointly supported by separable memory systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor outcomes congruent with intentions may sharpen metacognitive representations</a></h4>

              
                We can monitor our intentional movements, in order to describe how we move our bodies. But it is unclear which information this metacognitive monitoring relies on. For example, when throwing a ball to hit a target, we might use the visual information about how the ball flew to metacognitively assess our performance. Alternatively, we might disregard the ball trajectory - given that it is not directly relevant to our goal - and metacognitively assess our performance based solely on whether we reached the goal of hitting the target. In two experiments we aimed to distinguish between these two alternatives and asked whether the distal outcome of a goal-directed action (hitting or missing a target) informs the metacognitive representations of our own movements. Participants performed a semi-virtual task where they moved their arm to throw a virtual ball at a target. After each throw, participants discriminated which of two ball trajectories displayed on the screen corresponded to the flight path of their throw and then rated their confidence in this decision. The task included two conditions that differed on whether the distal outcome of the two trajectories shown matched (congruent) or differed (incongruent). Participants were significantly more accurate in discriminating between the two trajectories, and responded faster in the incongruent condition and, accordingly, were significantly more confident on these trials. Crucially, we found significant differences in metacognitive performance (measured as meta-d'/d') between the two conditions only on successful trials, where the virtual ball had hit the target. These results indicate that participants successfully incorporated information about the outcome of the movement into both their discrimination and confidence responses. However, information about the outcome selectively sharpened the precision of confidence ratings only when the outcome of their throw matched their intention. We argue that these findings underline the separation between the different levels of information that may contribute to body monitoring, and we provide evidence that intentions might play a central role in metacognitive motor representations.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Context-Specificity of Locomotor Learning Is Developed during Childhood</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Humans can perform complex movements with speed and agility in the face of constantly changing task demands. To accomplish this, motor plans are adapted to account for errors in our movements because of changes in our body (e.g., growth or injury) or in the environment (e.g., walking on sand vs ice). It has been suggested that adaptation that occurs in response to changes in the state of our body will generalize across different movement contexts and environments, whereas adaptation that occurs with alterations in the external environment will be context-specific. Here, we asked whether the ability to form generalizable versus context-specific motor memories develops during childhood. We performed a cross-sectional study of context-specific locomotor adaptation in 35 children (3&ndash;18 years old) and 7 adults (19&ndash;31 years old). Subjects first adapted their gait and learned a new walking pattern on a split-belt treadmill, which has two belts that move each leg at a different speed. Then, subjects walked overground to assess the generalization of the adapted walking pattern across different environments. Our results show that the generalization of treadmill after-effects to overground walking decreases as subjects&rsquo; age increases, indicating that age and experience are critical factors regulating the specificity of motor learning. Our results suggest that although basic locomotor patterns are established by two years of age, brain networks required for context-specific locomotor learning are still being developed throughout youth.</p>

New additions of vertebrate specimens to natural history collections are declining in the midst of widespread and accelerating environmental change. Reversing these trends in collecting efforts is essential for addressing future unforeseen ecological issues.

The growth of natural history collections is declining. We need to reverse this decline to effectively facilitate the discovery of new knowledge and inform future societies about their past.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Longitudinal deep sequencing informs vector selection and future deployment strategies for transmissible vaccines</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Megan E. Griffiths, Alice Broos, Laura M. Bergner, Diana K. Meza, Nicolas M. Suarez, Ana da Silva Filipe, Carlos Tello, Daniel J. Becker, Daniel G. Streicker</p>

Vaccination is a powerful tool in combating infectious diseases of humans and companion animals. In most wildlife, including reservoirs of emerging human diseases, achieving sufficient vaccine coverage to mitigate disease burdens remains logistically unattainable. Virally vectored “transmissible” vaccines that deliberately spread among hosts are a potentially transformative, but still theoretical, solution to the challenge of immunising inaccessible wildlife. Progress towards real-world application is frustrated by the absence of frameworks to guide vector selection and vaccine deployment prior to major in vitro and in vivo investments in vaccine engineering and testing. Here, we performed deep sequencing on field-collected samples of <i>Desmodus rotundus</i> betaherpesvirus (DrBHV), a candidate vector for a transmissible vaccine targeting vampire bat–transmitted rabies. We discovered 11 strains of DrBHV that varied in prevalence and geographic distribution across Peru. The phylogeographic structure of DrBHV strains was predictable from both host genetics and landscape topology, informing long-term DrBHV-vectored vaccine deployment strategies and identifying geographic areas for field trials where vaccine spread would be naturally contained. Multistrain infections were observed in 79% of infected bats. Resampling of marked individuals over 4 years showed within-host persistence kinetics characteristic of latency and reactivation, properties that might boost individual immunity and lead to sporadic vaccine transmission over the lifetime of the host. Further, strain acquisitions by already infected individuals implied that preexisting immunity and strain competition are unlikely to inhibit vaccine spread. Our results support the development of a transmissible vaccine targeting a major source of human and animal rabies in Latin America and show how genomics can enlighten vector selection and deployment strategies for transmissible vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">DNA replication is highly resilient and persistent under the challenge of mild replication stress</a></h4>

              
                Contrary to the MiDAS model, in which stressed replication forks fail to proceed in late interphase unless mitosis is initiated, Mocanu et al. reveal that cells maintain continued DNA synthesis from S-phase to early mitosis to minimize genome under-replication. This response is also essential to lessen persistent ATR-mediated G2/M checkpoint activation.

                Cell-autonomous Cry and Per transcriptional oscillation is considered the core circadian rhythm generator in mammals. To validate this, Matsumura et al. arrest Cry oscillation and find that the circadian clock remains functional independent of cell-autonomous Cry and Per oscillation, probably because of cell-autonomous circadian rhythms in the half-life of Per2.

                Sênos Demarco et al. show that the transcription factor Escargot controls somatic stem cell fate in the Drosophila testis. Mechanistically, Escargot suppresses insulin receptor (InR) signaling in stem cells to prevent differentiation. InR signaling suppression by Escargot is required for the preservation of stem cells during homeostasis and starvation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Human IL-10-producing B cells have diverse states that are induced from multiple B cell subsets</a></h4>

              
                Through multiplexed screening of activating conditions and time points, Glass et al. find that human IL-10+ B cells lack a unifying cellular phenotype and frequently co-express pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mass-cytometry analyses reveal the breadth of phenotypic and polyfunctional profiles of IL-10+ B cells and their associations with liver-allograft operational tolerance.

                Xu. et al. demonstrate widespread caspase activation in a Drosophila tumor model with human cancer relevance. Such caspase activation regulates the signaling profile of tumor cells and the immunological tumor microenvironment independently of apoptosis. Furthermore, these non-apoptotic caspase functions limit tumor growth and malignant transformation.

                Aberrant activation of RTKs plays critical roles in cancer progression. Shao et al. find the importance of cholesterol as a signal to switch GOLM1-RTK degradation to its recycling. Cholesterol suppresses GOLM1-dependent selective autophagy of RTKs via mTORC1 pathway. Lowering cholesterol by statins improves the efficacy of multiple TKIs in HCC by inducing RTK autophagy.

                The amount of neurotransmitters released in response to an action potential can be tuned by altering the number of release sites. Müller et al. show that the kinase SRPK2 is involved in regulating this process via the presynaptic active-zone protein RIM.

                γ-synchrony is suggested to enhance neuronal information transmission. Dalal and Haddad report that increasing mitral\tufted cells (MTCs) γ-synchronization by photoactivating the olfactory bulb granule cells (GCs), enhances the odor-evoked firing rates and ensemble representation of piriform cortex (PC) neurons, despite a reduction in MTC spiking. Reducing MTC γ-synchrony degrades PC odor responses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Air pollution particles hijack peroxidasin to disrupt immunosurveillance and promote lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                Although fine particulate matter (FPM) in air pollutants and tobacco smoke is recognized as a strong carcinogen and global threat to public health, its biological mechanism for inducing lung cancer remains unclear. Here, by investigating FPM's bioactivities in lung carcinoma mice models, we discover that these particles promote lung tumor progression by inducing aberrant thickening of tissue matrix and hampering migration of anti-tumor immunocytes. Upon inhalation into lung tissue, these FPM particles abundantly adsorb peroxidasin (PXDN) - an enzyme mediating type IV collagen (Col IV) crosslinking - onto their surface. The adsorbed PXDN exerts abnormally high activity to crosslink Col IV via increasing the formation of sulfilimine bonds at the NC1 domain, leading to an overly dense matrix in the lung tissue. This disordered structure decreases the mobility of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes into the lung and consequently impairs the local immune surveillance, enabling the flourishing of nascent tumor cells. Meanwhile, inhibiting the activity of PXDN abolishes the tumor-promoting effect of FPM, indicating the key impact of aberrant PXDN activity on the tumorigenic process. In summary, our finding elucidates a new mechanism for FPM-induced lung tumorigenesis and identifies PXDN as a potential target for treatment or prevention of the FPM-relevant biological risks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multi-omics insights into host-viral response and pathogenesis in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses for novel therapeutic target</a></h4>

              
                The pathogenesis and host-viral interactions of the Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) are convoluted and not well evaluated. Application of the multi-omics system biology approaches, including biological network analysis in elucidating the complex host-viral response, interrogates the viral pathogenesis. The present study aimed to fingerprint the system-level alterations during acute CCHFV-infection and the cellular immune responses during productive CCHFV-replication in vitro. We used system-wide network-based system biology analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a longitudinal cohort of CCHF patients during the acute phase of infection and after one year of recovery (convalescent phase) followed by untargeted quantitative proteomics analysis of the most permissive CCHFV-infected Huh7 and SW13 cells. In the RNAseq analysis of the PBMCs, comparing the acute and convalescent-phase, we observed system-level host’s metabolic reprogramming towards central carbon and energy metabolism (CCEM) with distinct upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during CCHFV-infection. Upon application of network-based system biology methods, negative coordination of the biological signaling systems like FOXO/Notch axis and Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 signaling with metabolic pathways during CCHFV-infection were observed. The temporal quantitative proteomics in Huh7 showed a dynamic change in the CCEM over time and concordant with the cross-sectional proteomics in SW13 cells. By blocking the two key CCEM pathways, glycolysis and glutaminolysis, viral replication was inhibited in vitro. Activation of key interferon stimulating genes during infection suggested the role of type I and II interferon-mediated antiviral mechanisms both at the system level and during progressive replication.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selective inhibition reveals the regulatory function of DYRK2 in protein synthesis and calcium entry</a></h4>

              
                The dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase DYRK2 has emerged as a critical regulator of cellular processes. We took a chemical biology approach to gain further insights into its function. We developed C17, a potent small-molecule DYRK2 inhibitor, through multiple rounds of structure-based optimization guided by several cocrystallized structures. C17 displayed an effect on DYRK2 at a single-digit nanomolar IC50 and showed outstanding selectivity for the human kinome containing 467 other human kinases. Using C17 as a chemical probe, we further performed quantitative phosphoproteomic assays and identified several novel DYRK2 targets, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). DYRK2 phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, and the combined treatment of C17 with AKT and MEK inhibitors showed synergistic 4E-BP1 phosphorylation suppression. The phosphorylation of STIM1 by DYRK2 substantially increased the interaction of STIM1 with the ORAI1 channel, and C17 impeded the store-operated calcium entry process. These studies collectively further expand our understanding of DYRK2 and provide a valuable tool to pinpoint its biological function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intracellular glycosyl hydrolase PslG shapes bacterial cell fate, signaling, and the biofilm development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></h4>

              
                Biofilm formation is one of most important causes leading to persistent infections. Exopolysaccharides are usually a main component of biofilm matrix. Genes encoding glycosyl hydrolases are often found in gene clusters that are involved in the exopolysaccharide synthesis. It remains elusive about the functions of intracellular glycosyl hydrolase and why a polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster requires a glycosyl hydrolase-encoding gene. Here we systematically studied the physiologically relevant role of intracellular PslG, a glycosyl hydrolase whose encoding gene is co-transcribed with 15 <i>psl</i> genes, which is responsible for the synthesis of exopolysaccharide PSL, a key biofilm matrix polysaccharide in opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. We showed that lack of PslG or its hydrolytic activity in this opportunistic pathogen enhances the signaling function of PSL, changes the relative level of cyclic-di-GMP within daughter cells during cell division and shapes the localization of PSL on bacterial periphery, thus results in long chains of bacterial cells, fast-forming biofilm microcolonies. Our results reveal the important roles of intracellular PslG on the cell fate and biofilm development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High and stable ATP levels prevent aberrant intracellular protein aggregation in yeast</a></h4>

              
                Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at millimolar levels has recently been implicated in the solubilization of cellular proteins. However, the significance of this high ATP level under physiological conditions and the mechanisms that maintain ATP remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adenylate kinase (ADK) cooperated to maintain cellular ATP levels regardless of glucose levels. Single-cell imaging of ATP-reduced yeast mutants revealed that ATP levels in these mutants underwent stochastic and transient depletion, which promoted the cytotoxic aggregation of endogenous proteins and pathogenic proteins, such as huntingtin and α-synuclein. Moreover, pharmacological elevations in ATP levels in an ATP-reduced mutant prevented the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates and its cytotoxicity. The present study demonstrates that cellular ATP homeostasis ensures proteostasis and revealed that suppressing the high volatility of cellular ATP levels prevented cytotoxic protein aggregation, implying that AMPK and ADK are important factors that prevent proteinopathies, such as neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Notch controls the cell cycle to define leader versus follower identities during collective cell migration</a></h4>

              
                Coordination of cell proliferation and migration is fundamental for life, and its dysregulation has catastrophic consequences, such as cancer. How cell cycle progression affects migration, and vice-versa, remains largely unknown. We address these questions by combining in-silico modelling and in vivo experimentation in the zebrafish Trunk Neural Crest (TNC). TNC migrate collectively, forming chains with a leader cell directing the movement of trailing followers. We show that the acquisition of migratory identity is autonomously controlled by Notch signalling in TNC. High Notch activity defines leaders, while low Notch determines followers. Moreover, cell cycle progression is required for TNC migration and is regulated by Notch. Cells with low Notch activity stay longer in G<sub>1</sub> and become followers, while leaders with high Notch activity quickly undergo G<sub>1</sub>/S transition and remain in S-phase longer. In conclusion, TNC migratory identities are defined through the interaction of Notch signalling and cell cycle progression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MCMBP promotes the assembly of the MCM2–7 hetero-hexamer to ensure robust DNA replication in human cells</a></h4>

              
                The MCM2–7 hetero-hexamer is the replicative DNA helicase that plays a central role in eukaryotic DNA replication. In proliferating cells, the expression level of the MCM2–7 hexamer is kept high, which safeguards the integrity of the genome. However, how the MCM2–7 hexamer is assembled in living cells remains unknown. Here, we revealed that the MCM-binding protein (MCMBP) plays a critical role in the assembly of this hexamer in human cells. MCMBP associates with MCM3 which is essential for maintaining the level of the MCM2–7 hexamer. Acute depletion of MCMBP demonstrated that it contributes to MCM2–7 assembly using nascent MCM3. Cells depleted of MCMBP gradually ceased to proliferate because of reduced replication licensing. Under this condition, p53-positive cells exhibited arrest in the G1 phase, whereas p53-null cells entered the S phase and lost their viability because of the accumulation of DNA damage, suggesting that MCMBP is a potential target for killing p53-deficient cancers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural excursions from manifold structure explain patterns of learning during human sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Humans vary greatly in their motor learning abilities, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie this variability. Recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that large-scale neural dynamics inhabit a low-dimensional subspace or manifold, and that learning is constrained by this intrinsic manifold architecture. Here, we asked, using functional MRI, whether subject-level differences in neural excursion from manifold structure can explain differences in learning across participants. We had subjects perform a sensorimotor adaptation task in the MRI scanner on 2 consecutive days, allowing us to assess their learning performance across days, as well as continuously measure brain activity. We find that the overall neural excursion from manifold activity in both cognitive and sensorimotor brain networks is associated with differences in subjects’ patterns of learning and relearning across days. These findings suggest that off-manifold activity provides an index of the relative engagement of different neural systems during learning, and that subject differences in patterns of learning and relearning are related to reconfiguration processes occurring in cognitive and sensorimotor networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dithiothreitol causes toxicity in C. elegans by modulating the methionine-homocysteine cycle</a></h4>

              
                The redox reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) causes stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by disrupting its oxidative protein folding environment, which results in the accumulation and misfolding of the newly synthesized proteins. DTT may potentially impact cellular physiology by ER-independent mechanisms; however, such mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Using the nematode model <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, here we show that DTT toxicity is modulated by the bacterial diet. Specifically, the dietary component vitamin B12 alleviates DTT toxicity in a methionine synthase-dependent manner. Using a forward genetic screen, we discover that loss-of-function of R08E5.3, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, confers DTT resistance. DTT upregulates R08E5.3 expression and modulates the activity of the methionine-homocysteine cycle. Employing genetic and biochemical studies, we establish that DTT toxicity is a result of the depletion of SAM. Finally, we show that a functional IRE-1/XBP-1 unfolded protein response pathway is required to counteract toxicity at high, but not low, DTT concentrations.

                The default mode network (DMN) plays an outstanding role in psychiatric disorders. Still, gene expressional changes in its major component, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), have not been characterized. We used RNA-sequencing in postmortem DMPFC samples to investigate suicide victims compared to control subjects. Most of the data variance (79%) was associated with expression changes between suicide and control samples. 1400 genes differed using log2FC > +/- 1 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 criteria between groups. Genes associated with depressive disorder, schizophrenia and impaired cognition were strongly overexpressed in top differentially expressed genes. Gene set enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that pathways related to cytokine receptor signaling were enriched in downregulated while glutamatergic synaptic signaling in upregulated genes in suicide individuals. A validated differentially expressed gene, which is known to be associated with mGluR5, was the N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding proteins 2 (NECAB2). In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry proved that NECAB2 is expressed in 2 different types of inhibitory neurons located in layers II-IV and VI, respectively. Our results imply extensive gene expressional alterations in the DMPFC related to suicidal behavior. Some of these genes may contribute to the altered mental state and behavior of suicide victims.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Histone methyltransferase Ezh2 coordinates mammalian axon regeneration via epigenetic regulation of key regenerative pathways</a></h4>

              
                Current clinical treatment for neurodegenerative diseases and neural injuries falls short of success, and one primary reason is that neurons in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) lose their regeneration ability as they mature. Previous studies indicated that the regeneration ability of neurons is governed by complex signaling networks involving many genes. Therefore, here we investigated the roles of Ezh2, a histone methyltransferase, in regulation of mammalian axon regeneration at the epigenetic level. We found that Ezh2 level was gradually downregulated in the mouse nervous system during maturation but significantly upregulated in mature sensory neurons during spontaneous axon regeneration in the peripheral nerve system (PNS), suggesting its role in supporting axon regeneration. Indeed, Ezh2 loss-of-function in sensory neurons impaired PNS axon regeneration in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of Ezh2 in retinal ganglion cells in the CNS induced optic nerve regeneration after optic nerve injury in both methyltransferase-dependent and -independent manners. Mechanistic exploration with multiomics sequencing, together with functional analyses, revealed that Ezh2 supported axon regeneration by systematically silencing the transcription of genes regulating synaptic function and axon regeneration inhibitory signaling, while broadly activating factors promoting axon regeneration. Our study not only reveals that Ezh2 coordinates axon regeneration via epigenetically regulating multiple key regenerative pathways, but also suggests that modulating chromatin accessibility is a promising strategy to promote CNS axon regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An approximate line attractor in the hypothalamus that encodes an aggressive internal state</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamus plays a key role in regulating innate behaviors. It is widely believed to function as a system of "labeled lines", containing behavior-specific neurons with characteristic transcriptomic and connectomic profiles. This view however fails to explain why, although activation of estrogen receptor-1 (Esr1) expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) promotes aggression, few VMHvl neurons are tuned to attack. To address this paradox, we adopted an unsupervised dynamical systems framework to analyze population activity among VMHvlEsr1 neurons during aggression. We discovered that this activity contains an "integration" dimension exhibiting slow-ramping dynamics and persistent activity that correlates with escalating aggressiveness. These dynamics are implemented as an approximate line attractor in state space. Our analysis suggests a function for VMHvl to encode the intensity of behavior-relevant motive states using line attractors. This view reconciles observational and perturbational studies of VMHvl, and reveals a new mode of neural computation in the hypothalamus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-modal alterations of Alpha Activity do not reflect inhibition of early sensory processing: A frequency tagging study</a></h4>

              
                Selective attention refers to the prioritization of relevant and suppression of irrelevant sensory input. Oscillatory alpha-band activity (~10 Hz) has been suggested to facilitate this process by functional inhibition of early sensory regions. The objective of the current EEG study was to compare this theory to a gating function at later stages of the processing stream. Visual cues indicated whether an upcoming target required visual orientation or more demanding auditory pitch discrimination. To gauge inhibition, we probed the visual and auditory systems with frequency-tagging during the cue-to-target interval, flickering the fixation cross at 36 Hz and simultaneously playing amplitude-modulated white noise at 40 Hz. In line with previous work, we observed a post-cue increase in posterior alpha activity when anticipating auditory targets. Surprisingly, the amplitude of visual and auditory responses increased in anticipation of auditory targets, correlated with alpha activity. This indicates that responsiveness of the visual stream was not inhibited when attention was directed to auditory processing. Furthermore, anticipation of demanding auditory targets heightened the vigilance of the sensory system, independent of sensory modality. Our findings suggest that alpha modulation does not reflect gain control in early sensory areas, but rather exhibits its inhibitory effects at later stages.

                Background and purpose: Kynurenines have immunomodulatory and neuroactive properties and can influence the central nervous system. Previous studies showed the involvement of the kynurenines in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disease. In neurodegenerative disorders, including tauopathies, the tryptophan metabolism is shifted toward neurotoxic agents and the reduction of neuroprotectant products. Astrocyte-derived kynurenic acid serves as a neuroprotectant. However, systemic administration of kynurenic acid is not effective because of low permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Experimental Approach: We used a kynurenic acid analog with similar biological activity but higher brain permeability to overcome BBB limitations. In the present study, we used amide derivate of kynurenic acid N-(2-N, N-dimethylaminoethyl)-4-oxo-1H-quinoline-2-carboxamid (KYNA-1). We administered KYNA-1 for three months to tau transgenic rats SHR-24 and analyzed the effect on tau pathology and activation of glial cells. Primary glial cell cultures were applied to identify the mechanism of the KYNA-1 effect. Key results: KYNA-1 was not toxic to rats after chronic three-month administration. When chronically administered, KYNA-1 reduced hyperphosphorylation of insoluble tau in the brain of transgenic rats. Noteworthily, the plasma total tau was also reduced. We determined that the effect of KYNA-1 on tau pathology was induced through the modulation of glial activation. KYNA-1 inhibited LPS induced activation of astrocytes and induced transformation of microglia to M2 phenotype. Conclusion and Implications: We identified that the administration of KYNA-1 reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. KYNA-1 may serve as a promising treatment for tauopathies.

                Striatal dopamine (DA) encodes reward, with recent work showing that DA release occurs in spatiotemporal waves. However, the mechanism of DA waves is unknown. Here we report that the striatal cholinergic neuropil also exhibits wave-like activity, and that the spatial scale of striatal DA release is extended by nicotinic receptors. Based on these findings we hypothesized that the local reciprocal interaction between cholinergic interneurons (CIN) and DA axons suffices to drive endogenous traveling waves. We show that the morphological and physiological properties of the CIN-DA interaction can be modeled as a reaction-diffusion system that gives rise to traveling waves. Analytically-tractable versions of the model show that the structure and the nature of propagation of CIN and DA traveling waves depend on their coupling, and that traveling waves can give rise to empirically observed correlations between these signals. Our model provides a biophysical mechanism for wave formation and predicts that the observed DA and CIN waves are strongly coupled phenomena.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peer presence elicits task-independent changes within and beyond the mentalizing network across children and adults</a></h4>

              
                There is ample behavioral evidence that others' mere presence can affect any behavior in human and non-human animals, generally facilitating the expression of mastered responses while impairing the acquisition of novel ones. Much less is known about i) how the brain orchestrates the modulation of such a wide array of behaviors by others' presence and ii) when these neural underpinnings mature during development. To address these issues, fMRI data were collected in children and adults alternately observed and unobserved by a familiar peer. Subjects performed two tasks. One, numerosity comparison, depends on number-processing brain areas, the other, phonological comparison, on language-processing areas. Consistently with previous behavioral findings, peer observation facilitated both tasks, and children's improvement was comparable to adults'. Regarding brain activation, we found virtually no evidence of observation-driven changes within the number- or language-related areas specific to each task. Rather, we observed the same task-independent changes for both numerosity and phonological comparisons. This unique neural signature encompassed a large brain network of domain-general areas involved in social cognition, especially mentalizing, attention, and reward. It was also largely shared by children and adults. The one exception was children's right temporoparietal junction, which failed to show the observation-driven lesser deactivation seen in adults. These findings indicate that social facilitation of some human education-related skills is i) primarily orchestrated by domain-general brain networks, rather than by task-selective substrates, and ii) relatively mature early in the course of education, thus having a protracted impact on academic achievements that may have heretofore been underestimated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional Recovery from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Dopamine Neuron Grafts is Dependent on Neurite Outgrowth</a></h4>

              
                Transplantation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic (DA) neurons is an emerging therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time, that that functional recovery after DA neuron transplant is critically dependent on graft-host integration, and not dependent on graft size or DA neuron content. Specifically, in anticipation of an autologous DA neuron transplant strategy, we studied two human induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from people with idiopathic PD. We confirmed the cells' ability to differentiate into mature DA neurons in vitro by assessing electrophysiology and depolarization-induced neurotransmitter release. To evaluate efficacy, we transplanted DA neuron precursors into a hemiparkinsonian rat model. We differentiated the cell lines for either 18 (d18) or 25 days (d25) to investigate the effect of cell maturity on efficacy. We found comparable graft survival in d18 and d25 groups from both cell lines, but behavioral analysis revealed that only d18 preparations, from both cell lines, resulted in recovery of motor impairments. Immunohistochemical analysis did not reveal any DA neuron-associated markers that correlated with efficacy. However, we found striking and consistent differences in graft neurite outgrowth between the two culture timepoints. The functional grafts from d18 cells had more outgrowth than non-functional d25 grafts. A time course of gene expression during differentiation of the cell lines revealed differences in genes associated with DA neuron development and neurite plasticity. These results are the first to demonstrate that graft-host integration, and not DA neuron content, is key to graft-induced functional recovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptotagmin 9 modulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release in striatal neurons by regulating substance P secretion</a></h4>

              
                Synaptotagmin 9 (SYT9) is a tandem C2-domain Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells; its function in neurons remains unclear. Here, we show that SYT9 does not trigger rapid synaptic vesicle exocytosis in cultured cortical, hippocampal, or striatal neurons; rather, synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) fulfills this function. SYT9 can regulate evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis, but only when massively over-expressed. In striatal neurons, loss of SYT9 reduced the rate of spontaneous miniature neurotransmitter release events (minis). To delve into the underlying mechanism, we localized SYT9 in striatal neurons and found that it was targeted to dense core vesicles, where it regulated the release of substance P (SP), a neuropeptide known to modulate mini frequency. Exogenous SP, but not other striatal peptide hormones, completely rescued the Syt9 KO mini phenotype. Biochemical experiments revealed that Ca2+-binding to the C2A domain of SYT9 serves to regulate membrane fusion in vitro, and mutations that disrupt this activity abolished the ability of SYT9 to regulate minis in striatal neurons. We conclude that SYT9 indirectly regulates synaptic transmission in striatal neurons by controlling SP release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative modeling demonstrates format-invariant representations of mathematical problems in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Mathematical thoughts can be described in either symbolic form or natural language. Previous studies have reported that activation overlaps exist for these two types of mathematical problems, but it is unclear whether they are based on similar brain representations. Furthermore, quantitative modeling of mathematical problem solving has yet to be attempted. In the present study, eight subjects were subjected to 3 h of functional magnetic resonance experiments involving math word and math expression problems, and a read word condition without any calculations was used as a control. To evaluate the brain representations of mathematical problems quantitatively, we constructed voxel-wise encoding models. Both intra- and cross-format encoding modeling significantly predicted brain activity in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), even after subtraction of the control condition. Representational similarity analysis and principal component analysis revealed that mathematical problems with different formats had similar cortical organization in the bilateral IPS. These findings support the idea that our mathematical thoughts are represented in the brain in a format-invariant manner.

	<p>Background. Loss of olfaction is a well-established early feature of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Although olfactory dysfunction has been widely described as a prodromal feature of PD in the literature, whether it can be considered a biomarker of PD progression is still a matter of debate. Objective. The aim of this work is to define the possible relationship between the progression of olfactory dysfunction and other putative clinical hallmarks of PD over time, through a systematic review of the current literature. Methods. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on PubMed from inception to March 2022. We included only longitudinal studies conducted on patients with diagnosis of idiopathic PD who underwent olfactory function testing at baseline and repeated it at least once during follow-up. Results. Among 5740 records identified through database searching, nine longitudinal studies met full criteria and underwent data extraction. Conclusions. Olfaction seemed to decrease over time, albeit with a degree of fluctuation. Moreover, smell detection ability seems to deteriorate more rapidly in the early phase of disease, indicating a possible association with disease progression. More studies are needed to better understand the role of olfaction as a biomarker of PD progression over time.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Antiseizure medications (ASMs) control 70&amp;amp;ndash;75% of seizures. Accepting stress as a trigger for seizures, intervention, at the time of predictable stress, should offer a therapeutic option. Mode of intervention: Intervention requires the maintenance of an accurate seizure diary to identify a recurring pattern. With a questioning approach to that diary, the clinician may intervene when stressful provocateurs occur. Benzodiazepines, such as clobazam, initiated prior to the predictable stress, and continued until after it has passed, should be short lived, making serious adverse effects unlikely. Benzodiazepines have a dual benefit, being both anxietolytic and raising the seizure threshold in patients with epilepsy. Discussion: Many patients claim stress provokes their seizures and may not be aware the stress was the provocateur, until after a seizure occurred, leading to a retrospective claim of the relationship. To confirm the relationship, permitting preventative measures, before exposure to provocative factors, often unable to be avoided, requires maintenance and review of a detailed diary. Interval temporary use of benzodiazepines, such as clobazam, or alternatively clonazepam, diazepam or nitrazepam, offers a reasonable response to obviate subsequent seizures, and should be continued, for a brief period, after the risk has abated. Subsequent review of the diary, over a period of repeated exposures to the identified stress, will confirm or refute the therapeutic effect. Conclusion: Judicious use of interval therapy, with one of the benzodiazepines, covering the period of stressful provocation, offers adjunctive treatment of possible refractory epilepsy, based upon the review of the strictly maintained epilepsy/seizure diary.</p>

	<p>PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by PLA2G6 mutations. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and mutation spectrum of PLAN and to investigate the founder effects in Chinese PLAN patients. Six Chinese PLAN families were clinically examined in detail and whole-exome sequencing was performed in the probands. Haplotype analysis was performed in five families with the PLA2G6 c.991G &amp;amp;gt; T mutation using 23 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Furthermore, all previously reported PLA2G6 mutations and patients in China were reviewed to summarize the genetic and clinical features of PLAN. Interestingly, we found that one patient had hereditary spastic paraplegia and showed various atypical clinical characteristics of PLAN, and five patients had a phenotype of parkinsonism. All probands were compound heterozygotes for PLA2G6 variants, including four novel pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations (c.967G &amp;amp;gt; A, c.1450G &amp;amp;gt; T, c.1631T &amp;amp;gt; C, and c.1915delG) and five known pathogenic mutations. Haplotype analyses revealed that patients carrying PLA2G6 c.991G &amp;amp;gt; T mutations shared a haplotype of 717 kb. The frequencies of psychiatric features, cognitive decline, and myoclonus in Chinese patients with PLA2G6-related parkinsonism were significantly different from those in European patients. Thus, our study expands the clinical and genetic spectrum of PLAN and provides an insightful view of the founder effect to better diagnose and understand the disease.</p>

	<p>Temporal dynamics of behavior, particularly facial expressions, are fundamental for communication between individuals from very early in development. Facial expression processing has been widely demonstrated to involve embodied simulative processes mediated by the motor system. Such processes may be impaired in patients with congenital facial palsy, including those affected by Moebius syndrome (MBS). The aims of this study were to investigate (a) the role of motor mechanisms in the processing of dynamic facial expression timing by testing patients affected by congenital facial palsy and (b) age-dependent effects on such processing. Accordingly, we recruited 38 typically developing individuals and 15 individuals with MBS, ranging in age from childhood to adulthood. We used a time comparison task where participants were asked to identify which one of two dynamic facial expressions was faster. Results showed that MBS individuals performed worse than controls in correctly estimating the duration of facial expressions. Interestingly, we did not find any performance differences in relation to age. These findings provide further evidence for the involvement of the motor system in processing facial expression duration and suggest that a sensorimotor matching mechanism may contribute to such timing perception from childhood.</p>

	<p>Allele 4 of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4) and hypertension are considered risk factors for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD). The detection of differences in cognitive function and brain networks between hypertensive patients who are APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 carriers and non-carriers may help in understanding how hypertension and risk genes cumulatively impair brain function, which could provide critical insights into the genetic mechanism by which hypertension serves as a potential risk factor for cognitive decline and even AD. Using behavioral data from 233 elderly hypertensive patients and neuroimaging data from 38 of them from Beijing, China; the study aimed to assess the effects of APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 on cognition and to explore related changes in functional connectivity. Cognitively, the patients with APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 showed decreased executive function, memory and language. In the MRI sub-cohort, the frontoparietal networks in the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 carrier group exhibited an altered pattern, mainly in the left precentral regions, inferior frontal lobe and angular gyrus. More importantly, the decline of cognitive function was correlated with abnormal FC in the left precentral regions in APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 carriers. APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 aggravated the dysfunction in frontal and parietal regions in hypertensive patients. This highlights the importance of brain protection in hypertensive patients, especially those with a genetic risk of AD.</p>

	<p>Few data are available regarding the incidence and the evolution of neuropsychiatric manifestations in children with a history of COVID-19. We herein report five consequent cases of pediatric patients with psychiatric and neurological symptoms of long COVID-19. All patients, mainly males, reported asymptomatic-to-mild COVID-19 and underwent home self-isolation. Abnormal movements, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation were the most recurrent symptoms observed from a few weeks to months after the resolution of the acute infection. A later onset was observed in younger patients. Blood tests and brain imaging resulted in negative results in all subjects; pharmacological and cognitive behavioral therapy was set. A multifactorial etiology could be hypothesized in these cases, as a result of a complex interplay between systemic and brain inflammation and environmental stress in vulnerable individuals. Longer follow-up is required to observe the evolution of neuropsychiatric manifestation in the present cohort and other young patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<i>Cryptosporidium</i> is a leading infectious cause of diarrhea around the world associated with waterborne outbreaks, community spread, or zoonotic transmission. The parasite has significant impact on early childhood mortality, and infection is both a consequence and cause of malnutrition and stunting. There is currently no vaccine, and treatment options are very limited. <i>Cryptosporidium</i> is a member of the Apicomplexa, and, as typical for this, protist phylum relies on asexual and sexual reproduction. In contrast to other Apicomplexa, including the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium</i>, the entire <i>Cryptosporidium</i> life cycle unfolds in a single host in less than 3 days. Here, we establish a model to image life cycle progression in living cells and observe, track, and compare nuclear division of asexual and sexual stage parasites. We establish the length and sequence of the cell cycles of all stages and map the developmental fate of parasites across multiple rounds of invasion and egress. We propose that the parasite executes an intrinsic program of 3 generations of asexual replication, followed by a single generation of sexual stages that is independent of environmental stimuli. We find no evidence for a morphologically distinct intermediate stage (the tetraploid type II meront) but demonstrate direct development of gametes from 8N type I meronts. The progeny of each meront is collectively committed to either asexual or sexual fate, but, importantly, meronts committed to sexual fate give rise to both males and females. We define a <i>Cryptosporidium</i> life cycle matching Tyzzer’s original description and inconsistent with the coccidian life cycle now shown in many textbooks.

<p>The African spiny mouse, <i>Acomys cahirinus</i>, is a rodent with a unique regenerative capability among mammals. Studies on <i>A. cahirinus</i> brain are limited due to the lack of knowledge of its neuroanatomy. The brain of <i>A. cahirinus</i> was mapped in a coronal atlas in stereotaxic coordinates using cresyl violet staining. This atlas of the <i>A. cahirinus</i> represents a new tool for neuroscience studies in a new model for brain repair.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The African spiny mouse (<i>Acomys cahirinus</i>) is an emerging model of mammalian epimorphic regeneration that has aroused the interest of the scientific community in the last decade. To date, studies on brain repair have been hindered by the lack of knowledge on the neuroanatomy of this species. Here, we present a coronal brain atlas in stereotaxic coordinates, which allows for three-dimensional identification and localization of the brain structures of this species. The brain of 12-week-old spiny mice was mapped in stereotaxic coordinates using cresyl violet-stained brain sections obtained from coronal cryosectioning of the brain after transcardial perfusion with fixative. The atlas is presented in 42 plates representing sections spaced 240 μm apart. Stereotaxic coordinates were validated using both a model of Parkinsonian lesion of the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine and labeling of the corticospinal tract in the spiny mouse spinal cord using AAV1/2-GFP intracortical injections. This work presents a new tool in <i>A. cahirinus</i> neurobiology and opens new avenues of research for the investigation of the regenerative ability of <i>A. cahirinus</i> in models of brain disorders.</p>

     alt="Lifespan of mature olfactory sensory neurons varies with location in the mouse olfactory epithelium and age of the animal"/>
<p>A genetic model based on the expression of an OMP-tTA transgene has been used for assessing survival of mature olfactory sensory neurons as a function of age of the animal and region of the olfactory epithelium (OE). A near-majority and a majority of mature neurons at 2 months and 4.5 months of age, respectively, live for more than 6 months demonstrating substantial stability of this sensory epithelium. However, the lifespan differs between dorsal and ventral epithelium. The diagram summarizes the relationship between mature neuron survival and rate of basal cell proliferation in dorsal vs. ventral OE.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory epithelium (OE) exhibit a remarkable regenerative capability, which protects the population against environmental insult and enables adjustment to new odors. The lifespan of OSNs is still open to question, with estimates ranging from 1 month to at least 1 year. However, the estimates come with some caveats, including low labeling efficiency and a focus solely on newborn neurons. We revisited the issue via the use of OMP-tTA; TetO-Cre; Rosa26-fl(stop)-Tdtomato (OMP-tTA;TdT) mice, which allowed us to selectively label ∼95% of the OMP(+) OSN population that reach maturity by a given time and, by switching to doxycycline chow, to “chase” this preexisting OSN population. Two loading protocols were used: conception to 2 months old and conception to 4.5 months old. Surviving OSNs were common up to 6 months chase time in both groups, but more neurons survived when loading for 4.5 months as compared with 2 months. A spatial difference was evident: higher percentages of OSNs survived in the dorsomedial OE as compared with ventrolateral and in posterior versus anterior OE regions. Finally, proliferation rates anticorrelated with the spatial differences in OSN survival; higher proliferation rates were observed ventrally. Together, these results demonstrate spatial and temporal differences in OSN survival, highlighting it as a dynamic system that can be studied for factors affecting neuronal survival.</p>

<p>These results provide the first characterization of “body barrelettes,” or barrelette-like structures found in the dorsal column nuclei. The clusters of the cuneate and gracile nuclei likely represent the extensive array of postfacial body vibrissae found in manatees and rock hyraxes.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Florida manatees (<i>Trichechus manatus latirostris</i>) and rock hyraxes (<i>Procavia capensis</i>) exhibit expanded tactile arrays of vibrissae that are distributed not only on the face but also on the entire postfacial body. In contrast, the vibrissae of most mammals are principally restricted to the face. These facial vibrissae may be associated with central nervous system representations known as barrels in the cerebral cortex, barreloids in the thalamus, and barrelettes in the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem. To date, vibrissae representations found within the brainstem have been principally limited to facial vibrissae representations in the trigeminal nuclei. We hypothesized that the tactile specializations of the manatee and rock hyrax would produce a unique modification of typical mammalian central nervous system organization, with postfacial vibrissae representations appearing in the cuneate and gracile nuclei as “body barrelettes.” Using histological and histochemical methods, including cresyl violet, myelin, and cytochrome oxidase processing, we first delineated the rostral, middle, and caudal zones of the cuneate and gracile nuclei. Within the middle zone, divisions were present, including extensive parcellation in the cluster region, particularly in manatees. These clusters were particularly densely distributed and distinguishable in the presumptive postfacial body representations in the cuneate and gracile nuclei but otherwise shared many attributes with the barrelettes found in the trigeminal nuclei of other species. This study represents the first characterization of postfacial body vibrissae representations, or “body barrelettes,” in the brainstem of any species. Previous studies have predominantly focused on facial vibrissae representations, which have served for decades as a model for sensory organization and plasticity. Our results extend what is known about vibrissae representations in the central nervous system to include expansions related to peripheral specializations of the postfacial body. Unusual somatosensory adaptations in the manatee and rock hyrax are highly informative regarding how mammalian brain organization responds to evolutionary pressures on sensory systems.</p>

<p>Childhood abuse was associated with increased ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and income. Overall childhood trauma and childhood neglect were not associated with significant activation changes in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation or the orbitofrontal cortex during reward outcome.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The association between childhood trauma exposure and risk of developing psychopathology may in part be mediated by the effects of chronic stress on dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, little is known about the differential effects of distinct trauma types on reward processing, particularly in adults without concurrent medical or psychiatric disorders. We examined the association of childhood trauma exposure, including the differential effects of abuse and neglect, with reward processing in healthy adults (<i>n</i> = 114). Functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task was used to assess neural activity in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in relation to reward anticipation and reward outcome, respectively. Exposure to childhood trauma, including abuse and neglect, was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form. We found a significant effect for abuse on ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and household monthly income. There were no effects for abuse or neglect, independently or combined, on orbitofrontal cortex activation during reward outcome. Our findings suggest differential effects of childhood abuse on ventral striatum activation during reward anticipation in healthy adults.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible control of representational dynamics in a disinhibition-based model of decision making</a></h4>

              
                Current models utilize two primary circuit motifs to replicate neurobiological decision making. Recurrent gain control implements normalization-driven relative value coding, while recurrent excitation and competitive inhibition together implement winner-take-all (WTA) dynamics. Despite evidence for concurrent valuation and selection computations in individual brain regions, existing models focus selectively on either normalization or WTA dynamics and how both arise in a single circuit architecture is unknown. Here we show that a novel hybrid motif unifies both normalized representation and WTA competition, with dynamic control of circuit state governed by local disinhibition. In addition to capturing empirical psychometric and chronometric data, the model produces persistent activity consistent with working memory. Furthermore, disinhibition provides a simple mechanism for flexible top-down control of network states, enabling the circuit to capture diverse task-dependent neural dynamics. These results suggest a new biologically plausible mechanism for decision making and emphasize the importance of local disinhibition in neural processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural instructive signals for associative cerebellar learning</a></h4>

              
                Supervised learning depends on instructive signals that shape the output of neural circuits to support learned changes in behavior. Climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellar cortex represent one of the strongest candidates in the vertebrate brain for conveying neural instructive signals. However, recent studies have shown that Purkinje cell stimulation can also drive cerebellar learning, and the relative importance of these two neuron types in providing instructive signals for cerebellum-dependent behaviors remains unresolved. Here we used cell-type specific perturbations of climbing fibers, Purkinje cells, and other cerebellar circuit elements to systematically evaluate their contributions to delay eyeblink conditioning. Our findings reveal that while optogenetic stimulation of either climbing fibers or Purkinje cells can substitute for a sensory unconditioned stimulus, subtle reductions in climbing fiber signaling prevent learning entirely. We conclude that climbing fibers and corresponding Purkinje cell complex-spike events provide essential instructive signals for associative cerebellar learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fleeting Effects of Incentives: Adult Age Differences in ERP Measures of Motivated Attention</a></h4>

              
                Reward-based motivation is associated with transient and sustained dopaminergic activity and with modulatory effects on attention and cognitive control. Age-related changes in the dopamine system are well documented, but little is known about age differences in the temporal dynamics of motivational influences on cognitive functions. The current study examined the effects of financial incentives on visual attention using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants (26 younger, aged 18-33; 24 older, aged 65-95) completed an incentivized flanker task in which trial-level incentive cues signaled the availability of performance-contingent reward, and subsequent alerting cues signaled the onset of the flanker target. ERP components of interest included incentive-cue P2 and CNV, alerting-cue N1, target N1, and target P3. Transient effects of incentives were assessed by comparing ERP amplitudes across incentive and non-incentive trials from mixed-incentive blocks. Younger adults showed transient effects of incentives on all components, whereas older adults showed effects for incentive-cue P2 and alerting-cue N1 only. Sustained effects of incentives were assessed by comparing ERP amplitudes across non-incentive trials from mixed-incentive blocks and non-incentive trials from pure non-incentive blocks. Both age groups showed sustained effects of incentives on cue-locked ERPs, but only younger adults showed sustained effects on target-locked ERPs. Reaction-time patterns mirrored the ERP findings, in that younger adults showed greater incentive-based modulation than older adults. Overall, these findings suggest that both transient and sustained effects of incentives on visual attention are more fleeting for older than younger adults, consistent with widespread alterations in dopaminergic neuromodulation in aging.

                Introduction: Tau phosphorylation at T217 is a promising AD biomarker, but its functional consequences were unknown. Methods: Human brain and cultured mouse neurons were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for total tau, taupT217, taupT181, taupT231 and taupS396/pS404. dSTORM super resolution microscopy was used to localize taupT217 in cultured neurons. EGFP-tau was expressed in fibroblasts as wild type and T217E pseudo-phosphorylated tau, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) reported tau turnover rates on microtubules. Results: In brain, taupT217 appears in neurons at Braak stages I-II, becomes more prevalent later and co-localizes partially with other phospho-tau epitopes. In cultured neurons taupT217, is increased by extracellular tau oligomers (xcTauOs), and is associated with developing post-synaptic sites. FRAP recovery was fastest for EGFP-tauT217E. Conclusion: TaupT217 increases in brain as AD progresses and is induced by xcTauOs. Post-synaptic taupT217 suggests a role for T217 phosphorylation in synapse impairment. T217 phosphorylation reduces tau's affinity for microtubules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Persistent post-COVID-19 smell loss is associated with inflammatory infiltration and altered olfactory epithelial gene expression</a></h4>

              
                Most human subjects infected by SARS-CoV-2 report an acute alteration in their sense of smell, and more than 25% of COVID patients report lasting olfactory dysfunction. While animal studies and human autopsy tissues have suggested mechanisms underlying acute loss of smell, the pathophysiology that underlies persistent smell loss remains unclear. Here we combine objective measurements of smell loss in patients suffering from post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) with single cell sequencing and histology of the olfactory epithelium (OE). This approach reveals that the OE of patients with persistent smell loss harbors a diffuse infiltrate of T cells expressing interferon-gamma; gene expression in sustentacular cells appears to reflect a response to inflammatory signaling, which is accompanied by a reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons relative to support cells. These data identify a persistent epithelial inflammatory process associated with PASC, and suggests mechanisms through which this T cell-mediated inflammation alters the sense of smell.

	<p>Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a common symptom in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Moreover, many neurological manifestations have been reported in these patients, suggesting central nervous system involvement. The default mode network (DMN) is closely associated with olfactory processing. In this study, we investigated the internetwork and intranetwork connectivity of the DMN and the olfactory network (ON) in 13 healthy controls and 22 patients presenting with COVID-19-related OD using independent component analysis and region of interest functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. There was a significant correlation between the butanol threshold test (BTT) and the intranetwork connectivity in ON. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 patients with OD showed significantly higher intranetwork connectivity in the DMN, as well as higher internetwork connectivity between ON and DMN. However, no significant difference was found between groups in the intranetwork connectivity within ON. We postulate that higher intranetwork functional connectivities compensate for the deficits in olfactory processing and general well-being in COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, the compensation process in the ON may not be obvious at this stage. Our results suggest that resting-state fMRI is a potentially valuable tool to evaluate neurosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To investigate the efficacy and safety of an improved ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and nerve block (NB) for patients with pudendal neuralgia (PN). Methods: This retrospective analysis included 88 adults with PN treated in the Pain Department of Southwest Hospital from November 2011 to June 2021, with treatment including NB (n = 40) and PRF (n = 48). The primary outcome variable was pain severity, measured by a standardized visual analog scale (VAS). VAS values were collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days and 1 and 3 months after patients were treated with NB or PRF. Results: Compared with patients treated with NB (n = 40) and those treated with PRF (n = 48), no significant difference in pain reduction was observed in the short term (p = 0.739 and 0.981, at 1 and 3 days, respectively); however, in the medium and long term (1 to 3 months), there were statistically significant improvements in the PRF group over the NB group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, it was noted that the average pain severity of primary PN and PN due to sacral perineurial cyst was significantly reduced with PRF therapy in the medium and long term when compared to other secondary PNs, including surgery, trauma, and diabetes. Discussion: The ultrasound-guided, improved, and innovative PRF/NB puncture path technique allows for gentler stimulation and faster identification of the pudendal nerve. The PRF technique may provide better treatments for primary PN and sacral perineurial cyst causing secondary PN in the medium and long term.</p>

<p>The diversity of retinal ganglion cell subtypes spans further than protein markers, morphology, and physiology.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies several forms of retinal disease including glaucomatous optic neuropathy, a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Several rare genetic disorders associated with cilia dysfunction have retinal degeneration as a clinical hallmark. Much of the focus of ciliopathy associated blindness is on the connecting cilium of photoreceptors; however, RGCs also possess primary cilia. It is unclear what roles RGC cilia play, what proteins and signaling machinery localize to RGC cilia, or how RGC cilia are differentiated across the subtypes of RGCs. To better understand these questions, we assessed the presence or absence of a prototypical cilia marker Arl13b and a widely distributed neuronal cilia marker AC3 in different subtypes of mouse RGCs. Interestingly, not all RGC subtype cilia are the same and there are significant differences even among these standard cilia markers. Alpha-RGCs positive for osteopontin, calretinin, and SMI32 primarily possess AC3-positive cilia. Directionally selective RGCs that are CART positive or Trhr positive localize either Arl13b or AC3, respectively, in cilia. Intrinsically photosensitive RGCs differentially localize Arl13b and AC3 based on melanopsin expression. Taken together, we characterized the localization of gold standard cilia markers in different subtypes of RGCs and conclude that cilia within RGC subtypes may be differentially organized. Future studies aimed at understanding RGC cilia function will require a fundamental ability to observe the cilia across subtypes as their signaling protein composition is elucidated. A comprehensive understanding of RGC cilia may reveal opportunities to understanding how their dysfunction leads to retinal degeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peptidergic signaling controls the dynamics of sickness behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic infection elicits sickness behaviors that promote recovery and survival of the host. For example, following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans modifies its sensory preferences to avoid the pathogen. Here we identify antagonistic neuromodulatory circuits that shape this sickness behavior. Using an unbiased cell-directed neuropeptide screen, we show that AVK neurons upregulate and release FMRFamide-like FLP-1 neuropeptides during infection to drive pathogen avoidance. Manipulations that increase or decrease AVK signaling accelerate or delay pathogen avoidance, respectively, implicating AVK in the dynamics of sickness behavior. FLP-1 neuropeptides act via the G-protein-coupled receptor DMSR-7 in RIM/RIC neurons to reduce tyraminergic/octopaminergic signaling that opposes pathogen avoidance. RIM/RIC neurons relay parallel signals from neuropeptides and the cytokine TGF-{beta} that represent internal and external regulators of pathogen avoidance. Our results demonstrate that antagonism between neuromodulatory systems results in slow, graded transitions between alternative behavioral states.

Our lab has shown involvement of Group II metabotropic receptors (mGlu2/3) in the expression of alcohol interoceptive effects using a nonspecific mGlu2/3 agonist and antagonist. Furthermore, the anterior insular cortex (aIC) is a hub for interoceptive processing, including the interoceptive effects of alcohol. Therefore, the goal of the present work was to assess the independent functional contribution of mGlu2 and mGlu3, and the role of mGlu3 in the aIC, in the interoceptive effects of alcohol. As such, male, Long-Evans rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus effects of alcohol (2 g/kg, i.g.) from water (i.g.) using an operant, 2-lever drug discrimination procedure. To assess involvement of mGlu2 and mGlu3 in the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol, rats were administered the mGlu2 negative allosteric modulator (NAM, VU6001966; 0, 3, 6 mg/kg, i.p.) and the mGlu3-NAM (VU6010572; 0, 3, 6, 12 mg/kg, i.p.) before alcohol (2 g/kg, i.g.). mGlu2-NAM (6 mg/kg) and mGlu3-NAM (12 mg/kg) decreased alcohol-appropriate lever responses without affecting response rate, reflecting diminished interoceptive alcohol sensitivity. mGlu3-NAM microinjection (3 g) into the aIC before alcohol decreased response rate to such an extent that alcohol-appropriate lever responding could not be determined. As such, mGlu3-NAM was tested in the aIC before water administration to determine if VU6010572 substitutes for alcohol. mGlu3-NAM VU6010572 (3 g) in the aIC produced partial alcohol-like stimulus effects without affecting response rate. These data indicate that the newly developed mGlu2 and mGlu3 NAMs can modulate interoceptive effects of alcohol. The opposing effects of systemic vs. microinjected (aIC) mGlu3-NAM on alcohol interoceptive effects may reflect differences in receptor binding, a functionally relevant metabolite, and/or brain region differences in receptor function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric activation of microglia in the hippocampus drives anxiodepressive consequences of trigeminal neuralgia</a></h4>

              
                Patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are often accompanied by anxiety and depression. Whether and how microglia are involved in TN-induced anxiodepressive remains unclear. Here, we unconventionally report that TN activates ipsilateral but not contralateral hippocampal microglia, upregulates ipsilateral hippocampal ATP and interleukin1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) levels, impairs ipsilateral hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), and induces anxiodepressive-like behaviors in a time-dependent manner in rodents. Specifically, activation of ipsilateral hippocampal microglia is necessary for TN-induced anxiodepressive-like behaviors; and unilateral activating hippocampal microglia is sufficient to elicit an anxiodepressive state and impair LTP. Knockdown of ipsilateral hippocampal P2X7 receptor prevented TN-induced microglial activation and anxiodepressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microglia-derived IL-1{beta} mediates microglial activation-induced anxiodepressive-like behaviors and LTP impairment. Together, these findings suggest that priming of microglia with ATP/P2X7R in the ipsilateral hippocampus drives pain-related anxiodepressive-like behaviors via IL-1{beta}. Our results also reveal an asymmetric role of the bilateral hippocampus in TN-induced anxiety and depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual orexin antagonist DORA-22 suppressed posttraumatic seizures and enhances GABAergic inhibition in dentate granule cells</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundTraumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) and sleep disturbances. We hypothesized that treatment with sleep aids after TBI can ameliorate PTE.

MethodsCD-1 mice underwent controlled cortical impact (CCI), sham craniotomy or no craniotomy. Sham and CCI groups underwent a month-long treatment with sleep aids including a dual orexin antagonist (DORA-22) or THIP (gaboxadol). We performed week-long EEG recordings during week-1 of treatment and again at months 1, 2 and 3. Seizure analysis occurred at all-time points and sleep analysis occurred in week-1 and month-1 recordings in all groups. Subsets of animals in sleep aid-treated and untreated CCI, and sham groups were subjected to voltage clamp experiments.

ResultsDORA-22 treated group had seizures at week-1 but none at months 1-3. TBI reduced amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in dentate granule cells and these changes were rescued by DORA-22 treatment. Sleep analysis showed that DORA-22 increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) in the first 4hours of lights-off whereas THIP increased REM sleep in the first 4-hours of lights-on in week-1, At month-1 both treatments reduced time in NREM during lights-off. TBI increased NREM delta power (N{Delta}) along with loss of the homeostatic overnight decline of N{Delta} in week-1 regardless of treatment. DORA-22 and THIP treatment restored N{Delta} to levels similar to no craniotomy animals at month-1.

ConclusionsDORA-22 treatment suppressed posttraumatic seizures possibly due to enhanced GABAergic inhibition in dentate granule cells. DORA-22 may have therapeutic potential in suppressing PTE.

Summary for Social MediaTraumatic brain injury (TBI) can result is posttraumatic epilepsy and sleep disturbances. There are no treatments to prevent these complications. We tested whether treatment with sleep aids after TBI can mitigate seizures and sleep disturbances. We found that a sleep aid DORA-22 but not THIP suppressed post traumatic seizures possibly be enhancing GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus. Sleep analysis showed that TBI disrupts the sleep homeostatic drive and DORA treatment restored it. Findings may lead to potential disease modifying therapy for posttraumatic epilepsy.

	<p>It is increasingly being understood that perceptual learning involves different types of plasticity. Thus, whereas the practice-based improvement in the ability to perform specific tasks is believed to rely on top-down plasticity, the capacity of sensory systems to passively adapt to the stimuli they are exposed to is believed to rely on bottom-up plasticity. However, top-down and bottom-up plasticity have never been investigated concurrently, and hence their relationship is not well understood. To examine whether passive exposure influences perceptual performance, we asked subjects to test their orientation discrimination performance around and orthogonal to the exposed orientation axes, at an exposed and an unexposed location while oriented sine-wave gratings were presented in a fixed position. Here we report that repetitive passive exposure to oriented sequences that are not linked to a specific task induces a persistent, bottom-up form of learning that is stronger than top-down practice learning and generalizes across complex stimulus dimensions. Importantly, orientation-specific exposure learning led to a robust improvement in the discrimination of complex stimuli (shapes and natural scenes). Our results indicate that long-term sensory adaptation by passive exposure should be viewed as a form of perceptual learning that is complementary to practice learning in that it reduces constraints on speed and generalization.</p>

	<p>There is a relationship between obesity and cognitive functioning. Our aim was to assess weight loss influence on global cognition and executive functioning (EF) in adults with obesity under a multidisciplinary weight loss program. In this six-month longitudinal study, we assessed 81 adults (age &amp;amp;lt; 50 years) with body mass index (BMI) &amp;amp;ge; 30. EF and global cognitive performance were evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychological Battery of Executive Functions (BANFE-2) and Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B). Median age was 40.0 years (IQR: 31.5&amp;amp;ndash;47, 61% women), and the median BMI was 41.4 (IQR: 36.7&amp;amp;ndash;45.9). At a six-month follow-up, the mean weight loss was 2.67% (29.6% of patients achieved &amp;amp;ge;5% weight loss). There was an improvement in EF evaluated with BANFE (p = 0.0024) and global cognition with MoCA (p = 0.0024). Women experienced more remarkable change, especially in EF. Weight loss did not correlate with cognitive performance, except for TMT-B (r-0.258, p = 0.026). In the regression analysis, only years of education predicted the MoCA score. This study showed that patients improved cognitive performance during the follow-up; nevertheless, the magnitude of weight loss did not correlate with cognitive improvement. Future studies are warranted to demonstrate if patients achieving &amp;amp;ge;5% weight loss can improve cognition, secondary to weight loss.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to obtain individual clinical and neuroimaging data of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor (ET) from 5 different European centers to identify predictors of outcome and to identify an optimal stimulation site.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed retrospectively baseline covariates, pre- and postoperative clinical tremor scores (for 12 months) as well as individual imaging data from 119 patients to obtain individual electrode positions and stimulation volumes. Individual imaging and clinical data were used to calculate a probabilistic stimulation map in normalized space using voxel-wise statistical analysis. Finally, we used this map to train a classifier to predict tremor improvement.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Probabilistic mapping of stimulation effects yielded a statistically significant cluster that was associated with a tremor improvement &gt;50%. This cluster of optimal stimulation extended from the posterior subthalamic area to the ventralis intermedius nucleus and coincided with a normative structural connectivity-based cerebellothalamic tract (CTT). The combined features “distance between the stimulation volume and the significant cluster” and “CTT activation” were used as a predictor of tremor improvement. This correctly classified a &gt;50% tremor improvement with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 57%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our multicenter ET probabilistic stimulation map identified an area of optimal stimulation along the course of the CTT. The results of this study are mainly descriptive until confirmed in independent datasets, ideally through prospective testing. This target will be made openly available and may be used to guide surgical planning and for computer-assisted programming of DBS in the future. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:602–612</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Deep Brain Stimulation for Arm Tremor: A Randomized Trial Comparing Two Targets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) effectively suppresses arm tremor. Uncontrolled studies suggest the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) may be superior. We compared the intra-individual efficacy of VIM- versus PSA-DBS on tremor suppression and arm function.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial at Oslo University Hospital in patients (18–80 years) with isolated or combined action tremor affecting at least one arm. Four-contact DBS leads were implanted (bi- or unilaterally) with a trajectory to cover the VIM (upper two contacts) and PSA (lower two contacts). Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) post-surgery to: Group 1, VIM-stimulation months 0–3 (period 1), then PSA-stimulation months 4–6 (period 2); Group 2, PSA-stimulation first, then VIM-stimulation. Primary endpoint was the difference in improvement from baseline to the end of the VIM- versus PSA-period in the sum of the dominant arm tremor scores of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), items 5/6 + 10−14.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-five patients were randomized to Group 1 (<i>n</i> = 23) or 2 (<i>n</i> = 22). In the primary endpoint per-protocol analysis (mixed model, n = 40), mean difference in the sum FTMTRS score improvement for the dominant arm was −2.65 points (95% CI −4.33 to −0.97; <i>p</i> = 0.002). The difference in favour of PSA stimulation was highly significant in period 2, but not period 1.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our randomized trial demonstrated that PSA stimulation provided superior tremor suppression compared with VIM stimulation. A period effect reducing tremor for up to three months in both groups was most likely attributed to a post-surgery stun effect. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:585–601</p>

<p>We screened for the CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i> in 1,346 movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in <i>LRP12</i> or <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, whereas 16 patients harbored &gt;40 CGG repeats in <i>GIPC1</i>, with 11 of these patients harboring &gt;60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded <i>GIPC1</i> allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by movement disorders in our population might harbor <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat expansion, with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (&lt;0.001). The clinical phenotypes of the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in patients displaying <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> GGC repeat<i>-</i>positive movement disorders. Additionally, the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter hyperintensities but without typical <i>NOTCH2NLC</i>-related high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed deposition of intranuclear inclusions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The CGG repeat expansion in <i>GIPC1</i> might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:704–715</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Personalizing Deep Brain Stimulation Using Advanced Imaging Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>With a growing appreciation for interindividual anatomical variability and patient-specific brain connectivity, advanced imaging sequences offer the opportunity to directly visualize anatomical targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS). The lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating their clinical utility, however, has hindered their broad implementation in clinical practice.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) sequences, the present study identified a thalamic hypointensity that holds promise as a visual marker in DBS. To validate the clinical utility of the identified hypointensity, we retrospectively analyzed 65 patients (26 female, mean age = 69.1 ± 12.7 years) who underwent DBS in the treatment of essential tremor. We characterized its neuroanatomical substrates and evaluated the hypointensity's ability to predict clinical outcome using stimulation volume modeling and voxelwise mapping. Finally, we determined whether the hypointensity marker could predict symptom improvement on a patient-specific level.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Anatomical characterization suggested that the identified hypointensity constituted the terminal part of the dentatorubrothalamic tract. Overlap between DBS stimulation volumes and the hypointensity in standard space significantly correlated with tremor improvement (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and distance to hotspots previously reported in the literature (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, <i>p</i> = 7.9e-4). In contrast, the amount of variance explained by other anatomical atlas structures was reduced. When accounting for interindividual neuroanatomical variability, the predictive power of the hypointensity increased further (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings introduce and validate a novel imaging-based marker attainable from FGATIR sequences that has the potential to personalize and inform targeting and programming in DBS for essential tremor. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:613–628</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study is to develop a novel method for monitoring the integrity of motor neurons in vivo by quantifying net retrograde axonal transport.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The method uses single photon emission computed tomography to quantify retrograde transport to spinal cord of tetanus toxin fragment C (<sup>125</sup>I-TTC) following intramuscular injection. We characterized the transport profiles in 3 transgenic mouse models carrying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated genes, aging mice, and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice following CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Lastly, we studied the effect of prior immunization of tetanus toxoid on the transport profile of TTC.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This technique defines a quantitative profile of net retrograde axonal transport of TTC in living mice. The profile is distinctly abnormal in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice as young as 65 days (presymptomatic) and worsens with disease progression. Moreover, this method detects a distinct therapeutic benefit of gene editing in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice well before other clinical parameters (eg, grip strength) show improvement. Symptomatic transgenic PFN1<sup>C71G/C71G</sup> ALS mice display gross reductions in net retrograde axonal transport, which is also disturbed in asymptomatic mice harboring a human <i>C9ORF72</i> transgene with an expanded GGGGCC repeat motif. In wild-type mice, net retrograde axonal transport declines with aging. Lastly, prior immunization with tetanus toxoid does not preclude use of this assay.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This assay of net retrograde axonal transport has broad potential clinical applications and should be particularly valuable as a physiological biomarker that permits early detection of benefit from potential therapies for motor neuron diseases. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:716–729</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke etiology remains undetermined in 30% of cases. We explored the genetic architecture of stroke classified as undetermined to test if mechanisms and risk factors underlying large-artery atherosclerotic (LAAS), cardioembolic (CES), and small-vessel stroke (SVS) contribute to its pathogenesis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed genome-wide data from 16,851 ischemic stroke cases and 32,473 controls. Using polygenic risk scores for LAAS, CES, and SVS, we assessed the genetic overlap with stroke of undetermined source and used pairwise genomewide association study (GWAS-PW) to search for shared loci. We then applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify potentially causal risk factors of stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetic risk for LAS, CES, and SVS was associated with stroke of undetermined source pointing to overlap in their genetic architecture. Pairwise analyses revealed 19 shared loci with LAAS, 2 with CES, and 5 with SVS that have been implicated in atherosclerosis-related phenotypes. Genetic liability to both carotid atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation was associated with stroke of undetermined source, but the association with atrial fibrillation was attenuated after excluding cases with incomplete diagnostic workup. MR analyses showed effects of genetically determinants of blood pressure, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory pathways (IL-6 signaling, MCP-1/CCL2 levels), and factor XI levels on stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Stroke of undetermined source shares genetic and vascular risk factors with other stroke subtypes, especially LAAS, thus highlighting the diagnostic limitations of current subtyping approaches. The potentially causal associations with carotid atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic risk factors might have implications for prevention strategies targeting these mechanisms.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate functional and safety outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus medical management (MM) in patients with M2 occlusion and examine their association with perfusion imaging mismatch and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a pooled, patient-level analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA, EXTEND-and IA-TNK parts 1 and 2) and 2 prospective nonrandomized studies (INSPIRE and SELECT), we evaluated EVT association with 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–2) in isolated M2 occlusions as compared to medical management overall and in subgroups by mismatch profile status and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 517 patients (EVT = 195 and MM = 322), baseline median (interquartile range [IQR]) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 13 (8–19) in EVT versus 10 (6–15) in MM, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. Pretreatment ischemic core did not differ (EVT = 10 [0–24] ml vs MM = 9 [3–21] ml, <i>p</i> = 0.59). Compared to MM, EVT was more frequently associated with functional independence (68.3 vs 61.6%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.25–4.67, <i>p</i> = 0.008, inverse probability of treatment weights [IPTW]-OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.00–3.75, <i>p</i> = 0.05) with a shift toward better mRS outcomes (adjusted cOR = 2.02, 95% CI:1.23–3.29, <i>p</i> = 0.005), and lower mortality (5 vs 10%, aOR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12–0.87, <i>p</i> = 0.025). EVT was associated with higher functional independence in patients with a perfusion mismatch profile (EVT = 70.7% vs MM = 61.3%, aOR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.09–4.79, <i>p</i> = 0.029, IPTW-OR = 2.02, 1.08–3.78, <i>p</i> = 0.029), whereas no difference was found in those without mismatch (EVT = 43.8% vs MM = 62.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.17, IPTW-OR: 0.71, 95% CI = 0.18–2.78, <i>p</i> = 0.62). Functional independence was more frequent with EVT in patients with moderate or severe strokes, as defined by baseline NIHSS above any thresholds from 6 to 10, whereas there was no difference between groups with milder strokes below these thresholds.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with M2 occlusion, EVT was associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared to MM. This association was primarily observed in patients with a mismatch profile and those with higher stroke severity. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:629–639</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bilateral synchronous cortical activity occurs during sleep, attention, and seizures. Canonical models place the thalamus at the center of bilateral cortical synchronization because it generates bilateral sleep spindle oscillations and primarily generalized absence seizures. However, classical studies suggest that the corpus callosum mediates bilateral cortical synchronization.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We mapped the spread of right frontal lobe-onset, focal to bilateral seizures in mice and modified it using chemo and optogenetic suppression of motor thalamic nucleus and corpus callosotomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seizures from the right cortex spread faster to the left cortex than to the left thalamus. The 2 thalami have minimal monosynaptic commissural connections compared to the massive commissure corpus callosum. Chemogenetic and closed-loop optogenetic inhibition of the right ventrolateral thalamic nucleus did not alter inter-hemispheric seizure spread. However, anterior callosotomy delayed bilateral seizure oscillations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thalamocortical oscillations amplify focal onset motor seizures, and corpus callosum spreads them bilaterally. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:682–696</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MS‐Driven Metabolic Alterations Are Recapitulated in iPSC‐Derived Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes play a significant role in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, for ethical reasons, most studies in these cells were performed using the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis model. As there are significant differences between human and mouse cells, we aimed here to better characterize astrocytes from patients with MS (PwMS), focusing mainly on mitochondrial function and cell metabolism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We obtained and characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes from three PwMS and three unaffected controls, and performed electron microscopy, flow cytometry, cytokine and glutamate measurements, gene expression, in situ respiration, and metabolomics. We validated our findings using a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We detected several differences in MS astrocytes including: (i) enrichment of genes associated with neurodegeneration, (ii) increased mitochondrial fission, (iii) increased production of superoxide and MS-related proinflammatory chemokines, (iv) impaired uptake and enhanced release of glutamate, (v) increased electron transport capacity and proton leak, in line with the increased oxidative stress, and (vi) a distinct metabolic profile, with a deficiency in amino acid catabolism and increased sphingolipid metabolism, which have already been linked to MS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here we describe the metabolic profile of iPSC-derived astrocytes from PwMS and validate this model as a very powerful tool to study disease mechanisms and to perform non-invasive drug targeting assays in vitro. Our findings recapitulate several disease features described in patients and provide new mechanistic insights into the metabolic rewiring of astrocytes in MS, which could be targeted in future therapeutic studies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A Secretory Vesicle Failure in Parkinson's Disease Occurs in Human Platelets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The presence of elevated dopamine (DA) and its major metabolites in the cytosol of neurons has been associated with their vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Over 99% of the cell's amines are confined to secretory vesicles (SVs), making these structures fundamental in the regulation of cytosolic DA levels. SVs of platelets use similar, if not the same mechanisms to accumulate serotonin in SVs as dopaminergic neurons do to store DA. Hence, any functional defects in platelets probably mirrors events in DA neurons.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We have isolated fresh platelets from the blood of 75 PD patients, 116 matched controls and 24 patients with Parkinsonism, assaying serotonin handling (basal content, accumulation, secretion and spontaneous leakage).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a dramatic decrease in the serotonin content and uptake by SVs, as well as decreased thrombin-induced release by platelets from PD patients but not in those from most Parkinsonism cases. Platelets from PD patients also failed to retain serotonin in SVs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings indicate a functional impairment in the handling of amines by SVs in PD patients. This defect may serve as a biomarker of PD, and the approach described here may be potentially used for the subclinical detection of PD and to establish a platform to assay disease modifying drugs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) transcription factors have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature nervous system. To date, a neurological disease association has been conclusively established for only the <i>Early B-cell Factor-3</i> (<i>EBF3</i>) COE family member through the identification of heterozygous loss-of-function variants in individuals with autism spectrum/neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Here, we identify a symptom severity risk association with missense variants primarily disrupting the zinc finger domain (ZNF) in <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A phenotypic assessment of 41 individuals was combined with a literature meta-analysis for a total of 83 individuals diagnosed with <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD. Quantitative diagnostic phenotypic and symptom severity scales were developed to compare <i>EBF3</i> variant type and location to identify genotype–phenotype correlations. To stratify the effects of <i>EBF3</i> variants disrupting either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or the ZNF, we used <i>in vivo</i> fruit fly UAS-GAL4 expression and <i>in vitro</i> luciferase assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that patient symptom severity correlates with <i>EBF3</i> missense variants perturbing the ZNF, which is a key protein domain required for stabilizing the interaction between EBF3 and the target DNA sequence. We found that ZNF-associated variants failed to restore viability in the fruit fly and impaired transcriptional activation. However, the recurrent variant EBF3 p.Arg209Trp in the DBD is capable of partially rescuing viability in the fly and preserved transcriptional activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We describe a symptom severity risk association with ZNF perturbations and EBF3 loss-of-function in the largest reported cohort to date of EBF3-related NDD patients. This analysis should have potential predictive clinical va <i>EBF3</i>-related NDD patients. This analysis should have potential predictive clinical value for newly identified patients with <i>EBF3</i> gene variants. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The optimal target and connectivity for DBS in Lennox‐Gastaut syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can reduce seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). However, little is known about the optimal target and whether efficacy depends on connectivity of the stimulation site. Using outcome data from the ESTEL trial, we aimed to determine the optimal target and connectivity for DBS in LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>20 patients underwent bilateral DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus (CM). Outcome was % seizure reduction from baseline after three months of DBS, defined using three measures (monthly seizure diaries, 24-hour EEG, and a novel diary-EEG composite). Probabilistic stimulation mapping identified thalamic locations associated with higher/lower efficacy. Two substitute diffusion MRI datasets (a normative dataset from healthy subjects and a “disease-matched” dataset from a separate group of LGS patients) were used to calculate structural connectivity between DBS sites and a map of areas known to express epileptic activity in LGS, derived from our previous EEG-fMRI research.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Results were similar across the three outcome measures. Stimulation was most efficacious in the anterior and inferolateral “parvocellular” CM border, extending into the ventral lateral nucleus (posterior subdivision). There was a positive association between diary-EEG composite seizure reduction and connectivity to areas of <i>a priori</i> EEG-fMRI activation, including premotor and prefrontal cortex, putamen, and pontine brainstem. In contrast, outcomes were not associated with baseline clinical variables.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Efficacious CM-DBS for LGS is linked to stimulation of the parvocellular CM and the adjacent ventral lateral nucleus, and is associated with connectivity to, and thus likely modulation of, the “secondary epileptic network” underlying the shared electroclinical manifestations of LGS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Early predictors of clinical and MRI outcomes using LASSO in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify predictors in common between different clinical and MRI outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing predictive models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 704 patients from our center seen at MS onset, measuring 37 baseline demographic, clinical, treatment, and MRI predictors, and 10-year outcomes. Our primary aim was identifying predictors in common between clinical outcomes: aggressive MS, benign MS, and secondary-progressive (SP)MS. We also investigated MRI outcomes: T2 lesion volume (T2LV) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The performance of the full 37-predictor model was compared with a LASSO-selected model of predictors in common between each outcome by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full 37-predictor model was highly predictive of clinical outcomes: in-sample AUC was 0.91 for aggressive MS, 0.81 for benign MS, and 0.81 for SPMS. After variable selection, 10 LASSO-selected predictors were in common between each clinical outcome: age, Expanded Disability Status Scale, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory and bowel/bladder signs, timed 25-foot walk ≥6s, poor attack recovery, no sensory attacks, and time-to-treatment. This reduced model had comparable cross-validation AUC as the full 37-predictor model: 0.84 vs. 0.81 for aggressive MS, 0.75 vs. 0.73 for benign MS, and 0.76 vs. 0.75 for SPMS, respectively. In contrast, 10-year MRI outcomes were more strongly influenced by initial T2LV and BPF than clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Early prognostication of MS is possible using LASSO modeling to identify a limited set of accessible clinical features. These predictive models can be clinically useable in treatment decision-making once implemented into web-based calculators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Motor progression and nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The motor severity in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is believed to parallel with dopaminergic terminal degeneration in the striatum although the terminal was reported to be virtually absent by 4 years post-diagnosis. Meanwhile, neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SN) elucidated a variability at early stages and gradual loss with less variability 10 years post-diagnosis. Here, we aimed to clarify the correlation between motor impairments and striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration and nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss at early to advanced stages of PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety-three PD patients were divided into early and advanced subgroups based on motor symptom duration and whether motor fluctuation was present. Striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration was evaluated using a presynaptic dopamine transporter tracer, <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT. Nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron density was assessed by neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In patients with early-stage (motor symptoms for ≤8 or 10 years), motor dysfunction during the drug-off state was paralleled by a decline in <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum despite the absence of a correlation with reductions in NM-MRI signals in SN. Meanwhile, in patients with advanced-stage (motor symptoms for &gt;8 or 10 years and with fluctuation), the degree of motor deficits during the drug-off state was not correlated with <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum, despite its significant negative correlation with NM-MRI signals in SN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose striatal dopaminergic terminal loss measured using <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT and nigral dopamine neuron loss assessed with NM-MRI as early-stage and advanced-stage motor impairments biomarkers, respectively.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluation of Nav1.8 as a therapeutic target for Pitt Hopkins Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Pitt Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) is a rare syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) gene. TCF4 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is critical for neurodevelopment and brain function through its binding to cis-regulatory elements of target genes. One potential therapeutic strategy for PTHS is to identify dysregulated target genes and normalize their dysfunction. Here, we propose that SCN10A is an important target gene of TCF4 that is an applicable therapeutic approach for PTHS. Scn10a encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.8 and is consistently shown to be upregulated in PTHS mouse models. In this perspective, we review prior literature and present novel data that suggests inhibiting Nav1.8 in PTHS mouse models is effective at normalizing neuron function, brain circuit activity and behavioral abnormalities and posit this therapeutic approach as a treatment for PTHS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estimation of cochlear frequency selectivity using a convolution model of forward-masked compound action potentials</a></h4>

              
                Frequency selectivity is a fundamental property of the peripheral auditory system; however, the invasiveness of auditory nerve (AN) experiments limits its study in the human ear. Compound action potentials (CAPs) associated with forward-masking have been suggested as an alternative means to assess cochlear frequency selectivity. Previous methods relied on an empirical comparison of AN and CAP tuning curves in animal models, arguably not taking full advantage of the information contained in forward-masked CAPs. In this work, we seek to provide a direct estimate of the quality factor characterizing AN frequency tuning using many forward-masked CAP responses. The method is based on a convolution model of the CAP that takes into account the masking of AN populations induced by notched-noise maskers with various notch widths and attenuations. The model produces masking patterns that, once convolved by a unitary response, predict forward-masked CAP waveforms. Model parameters, including those characterizing frequency selectivity, are fine-tuned by minimizing waveform prediction errors across the different masking conditions, yielding robust estimates. The method was applied to click-evoked CAPs at the round window of anesthetized chinchillas. The estimated quality factor Q10 as a function of center frequency is shown to closely match the average quality factor obtained from AN-fiber tuning curves, without the need for an empirical correction factor. Beyond the estimation of frequency selectivity, the proposed model proves to be accurate in predicting forward-masked CAP responses, and therefore could be extended to study more complex aspects of cochlear signal processing using a similar experimental approach.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humoral signaling-mediated effects of unilateral brain injury: differences in the left-right sided afferent responses</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of neural tracts descending from the brain to the spinal cord after brain trauma and stroke causes postural and sensorimotor deficits. We previously showed that unilateral lesion to the sensorimotor cortex in rats with completely transected thoracic spinal cord produced asymmetry in hindlimb posture and withdrawal reflexes. Supraspinal signals to hindlimb muscles may be transmitted through the paravertebral chain of sympathetic ganglia that remain intact after the transection. We here demonstrated that prior transection of the spinal cord at the cervical level that was rostrally to segments with preganglionic sympathetic neurons, did not abolish formation of asymmetry in hindlimb posture and musculo-articular resistance to stretch after unilateral brain injury. Thus not the sympathetic system but humoral signals may mediate the effects of brain injury on the lumbar spinal circuits. The asymmetric responses in rats with transected spinal cords were eliminated by bilateral lumbar dorsal rhizotomy after the left-side brain injury, but resistant to deafferentation after the right-side brain lesion. Two mechanisms, one dependent on and one independent of afferent input may account for asymmetric hindlimb motor responses. Resistance to deafferentation may be due to sustained stretch- and effort-unrelated muscle contractions that is often observed in patients with central lesions. Left-right asymmetry is unusual feature of these mechanisms that both are activated by humoral signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immediate neural network impact after the loss of a semantic hub</a></h4>

              
                The human brain extracts meaning from the world using an extensive neural system for semantic knowledge. Whether such broadly distributed systems1-3 crucially depend on or can compensate for the loss of one of their highly interconnected hubs4-6 is controversial4. The strongest level of causal evidence for the role of a brain hub is to evaluate its acute network-level impact following disconnection and any rapid functional compensation that ensues. We report rare neurophysiological data from two patients who underwent awake intracranial recordings during a speech prediction task immediately before and after neurosurgical treatment that required disconnection of the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), a crucial hub for semantic knowledge4-6. Informed by a predictive coding framework, we tested three sets of hypotheses including diaschisis causing disruption in interconnected sites7 and incomplete or complete compensation by other language-critical and speech processing sites8-10. Immediately after ATL disconnection, we observed highly specific neurophysiological alterations in the recorded fronto-temporal network, including abnormally magnified high gamma responses to the speech sounds in auditory cortex. We also observed evidence for rapid compensation, seen as focal increases in effective connectivity involving language-critical sites in the inferior frontal gyrus and speech processing sites in auditory cortex. However, compensation was incomplete, in part because after ATL disconnection speech prediction signals were depleted in auditory cortex. This study provides direct causal evidence for a semantic hub in the human brain and shows striking neural impact and a rapid attempt at compensation in a neural network after the loss of one of its hubs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A revised calcium-dependent model of theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Calcium dependency is presently an essential assumption in modelling the neuromodulatory effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Among the various neuromodulatory TMS protocols, theta-burst stimulation (TBS) at present is the fastest intervention to generate strong effects. A decade ago, Y.Z. Huang et al. developed a first neuromodulation model to explain the bidirectional effects of TBS based on postsynaptic intracellular calcium concentration elevation. We discover, however, that the published computer code is not consistent with the model formulations in the corresponding paper. Further analysis confirms that the computer model with an index confusion was used for fitting the experimental results, running the simulation, and plotting the corresponding figures in the original publication. This paper intends to fix the computer code and additionally create a non-convex optimisation solution for re-calibrating the model. After re-calibration, the revised model outperforms the initial model in accuracy describing the MEP amplitudes of TBS-induced after-effects under specific situations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural oscillations across olfactory regions encode odorant information in the teleost olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                Field potential oscillations in the olfactory system of vertebrates and invertebrates are prominent and well-studied, but their functions remain nevertheless enigmatic. Spatial networks are thought to play a role in olfactory discrimination in different species, but their analysis is frequently complicated by behavior, learning and respiration (sniffing). Here, we show that in a sniffing-free model (trout), the relevant feature for discriminating odorant identity is the information conveyed by the oscillatory activity in a spatially distributed network, including the olfactory bulb and the telencephalic regions Vv and Dp. Specifically, information-based methods based on spectral decoding, information sharing, and information redundancy distinguished odorant identity across spatially distant regions while classical spectral analyses did not. Our study demonstrates that olfactory oscillations are carriers of spatially distributed odor information across the teleost olfactory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual working memory recruits two functionally distinct alpha rhythms in posterior cortex</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory activity in the human brain is dominated by posterior alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz), which have been shown to be functionally relevant in a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Although posterior alpha oscillations are commonly considered a single oscillator anchored at an individual alpha frequency (IAF; [~]10 Hz), previous work suggests that IAF reflects a spatial mixture of different brain rhythms. In this study, we assess whether Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can disentangle functionally distinct posterior alpha rhythms in the context of visual short-term memory retention. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded in 33 subjects while performing a visual working memory task. Group analysis at sensor level suggested the existence of a single posterior alpha oscillator that increases in power and decreases in frequency during memory retention. Conversely, single-subject analysis of independent components revealed the existence of two dissociable alpha rhythms: one that increases in power during memory retention (Alpha1) and another one that decreases in power (Alpha2). Alpha1 and Alpha2 rhythms were differentially modulated by the presence of visual distractors (Alpha1 increased in power while Alpha2 decreased) and had an opposite relationship with accuracy (positive for Alpha1 and negative for Alpha2). In addition, Alpha1 rhythms showed a lower peak frequency, a narrower peak width, a greater relative peak amplitude and a more central source than Alpha2 rhythms. Together, our results demonstrate that modulations in posterior alpha oscillations during short-term memory retention reflect the dynamics of at least two distinct brain rhythms with different functions and spatiospectral characteristics.

Significance statementAlpha oscillations are the most prominent feature of the human brains electrical activity, and consist of rhythmic neuronal activity in posterior parts of the cortex. Alpha is usually considered a single brain rhythm that changes in power and frequency to support cognitive operations. We here show that posterior alpha entails at least two dissociable rhythms with distinct functions and characteristics. These findings could solve previous inconsistencies in the literature regarding the direction of task-related alpha power/frequency modulations and their relation to cognitive performance. In addition, the existence of two distinct posterior alpha rhythms could have important consequences for the design of neurostimulation protocols aimed at modulating alpha oscillations and subsequently cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A python-based package for long-lasting video acquisition and semi-automated detection of convulsive seizures in rodents</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundEpilepsy is a very invalidating pathology characterized by the unpredictable appearance of abnormal cerebral activity leading to seizures and co-morbidities. The ability to detect and even predict seizures is a major challenge and many research laboratories are using rodents models of epilepsy to unravel possible mechanisms. The gold standard to record and detect seizures is electroencephalography, but it is very invasive. For rodents used in research, video analysis is a very interesting approach but the major disadvantages are that it is time consuming, prone to human error, and not very reproducible. Commercial solutions for detailed phenotyping analysis on humans or rodents exist but they are costly. Some open source software programs are also available, they provide very interesting and precise behavior data, but none of them are made for high throughput analysis of a large number of video files generated by long lasting recordings.

New methodWe developed an open-source python-based package of two software programs that enable automated video acquisition and simple motion analysis associated with a spectral power analysis, which enable a semi-automated identification of convulsive seizures. The method needs cheap webcams and a computer or a server.

ResultsUsing two murine epilepsy models (Nav1.1 mutations), we have compared our motion analysis software to human visual inspection and found an 88.8% accuracy in convulsive seizures detection. We then compare our method to the gold standard electrocorticogram analysis and found a 93.2% accuracy. The motion analysis is also interesting to get a readout of the animal activity without the invasiveness of electromyogram recordings.

ConclusionsThis new method is easy to use, cost-effective and allows: 1) detection of convulsive seizures in a noninvasive way, 2) high speed analysis of a large number of video files with a good accuracy, and 3) automated acquisition and semi-automated analysis of a very large number of files.

                In the comment on the article [Optica 8, 12 (2021)], the authors performed theoretical calculation to show that with a 1.1 NA objective and 140 fs laser pulses with single pulse energy of 2.2 nJ, and 80 MHz repetition rate, the focal point temperature rises 0.3 K and reaches equilibrium after 100 s in water. They suggest that the damage to brain tissue by laser could not be caused by thermal effects but rather by plasma-mediated chemical effects. To quantify the thermal accumulation due to the fs laser illumination in living animals, we used a thermocouple sensor to measure the temperature change in the vicinity of the laser focus at a depth of 300 m in the adult mouse cortex. Our results show that at 930 nm wavelength, 25 m from the laser focus, 19-300 mW laser can all lead to a brain tissue temperature rise of more than 0.3 K at 1 second and the maximum equilibrium temperature rise of more than 28 K. These experimental measurements are significantly higher than theoretically calculated values in the comment. These results suggest that the thermal accumulation effect of focused low-energy pulses from fs laser oscillators could contribute significantly to the collateral damage in the living brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single acoustic closed loop stimulation in mice to modulate hippocampo-thalamo-cortical activity and performance</a></h4>

              
                Neural brain rhythms of sleep reflect neuronal activity underlying sleep-associated memory consolidation. The modulation of brain rhythms, for instance the sleep slow oscillation (SO) is used both to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms as well as to measure the impact on presumed functional correlates. In humans, auditory closed-loop stimulation targeted to the SO Up-state successfully enhanced the slow oscillation rhythm and phase-dependent spindle activity, although effects on memory retention have varied. Here, we aim to disclose relations between stimulation induced hippocampo-thalamo-cortical activity and retention performance on a hippocampus dependent task in mice. Closed-loop acoustic stimuli applied during four SO phases always acutely increased sharp wave ripple (SPWR) activity without disrupting non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Stimulation achieved an above chance preference index for stimuli delivered across a 3 h retention interval of sleep at the SO Up-state and at the Down-to-Up-state, but not at the Down-state nor late Up-state/Up-to Down-state. Results support the use of closed-loop acoustic stimulation in mice to investigate the inter-regional mechanisms underlying memory consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theory of spontaneous persistent activity and inactivity in vivo reveals differential cortico-entorhinal functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Persistent activity is thought to mediate working memory. While such stimulus evoked persistence is well studied, mechanisms of internally generated or spontaneous persistence in vivo are unknown. Further, current theories based on attractor dynamics focus on elevated activity as a memory substrate, while little attention has focused on the role of inactivity attractors. Here, we present a mean field model of functional interaction between large cortical networks that predicts both spontaneous persistent activity (SPA) and inactivity (SPI); the latter has never been seen before in experiments or models. We confirm these predictions using simultaneously recorded neocortical local field potential (LFP) and the membrane potential (Vm) of identified excitatory neurons from several brain areas in vivo during slow oscillations, especially from layer 3 of the medial (MECIII) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LECIII), which show SPA and SPI. By matching model and experimental statistics, we predict the relative strength of internal and external excitation in the LECIII and MECIII networks. Our predictions match anatomical data. Further, the model predicts, and the experiments confirm, that SPA and SPI are quantized by cortical UDS and follow the statistics of a history dependent Bernoulli process. These convergent, theory-experiment results thus reveal the differential nature of cortico-entorhinal functional connectivity, resulting in a unique pattern of persistent activity and persistent inactivity, a novel and energetically efficient memory substrate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bayesian interpolation for power laws in neural data analysis</a></h4>

              
                Power laws arise in a variety of phenomena ranging from matter undergoing phase transition to the distribution of word frequencies in the English language. Usually, their presence is only apparent when data is abundant, and accurately determining their exponents often requires even larger amounts of data. As the scale of recordings in neuroscience becomes larger, an increasing number of studies attempt to characterise potential power-law relationships in neural data. In this paper, we aim to discuss the potential pitfalls that one faces in such efforts and to promote a Bayesian interpolation framework for this purpose. We apply this framework to synthetic data and to data from a recent study of large-scale recordings in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), where the exponent of a power-law scaling in the data played an important role: its value was argued to determine whether the populations stimulus-response relationship is smooth, and experimental data was provided to confirm that this is indeed so. Our analysis shows that with such data types and sizes as we consider here, the best-fit values found for the parameters of the power law and the uncertainty for these estimates are heavily dependent on the noise model assumed for the estimation, the range of the data chosen, and (with all other things being equal) the particular recordings. It is thus challenging to offer a reliable statement about the exponents of the power law. Our analysis, however, shows that this does not affect the conclusions regarding the smoothness of the population response to low-dimensional stimuli but casts doubt on those to natural images. We discuss the implications of this result for the neural code in the V1 and offer the approach discussed here as a framework that future studies, perhaps exploring larger ranges of data, can employ as their starting point to examine power-law scalings in neural data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resilience to anxiety and anhedonia after predator scent stress is accompanied by increased nucleus accumbens mGlu5 in female rats</a></h4>

              
                Despite the higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women, the majority of preclinical neuroscience research has been conducted utilizing male subjects. We have found that male rats exposed to the predator scent 2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT) show heterogenous development of long-term anxiety-like behavior and conditioned fear to the TMT environment. Stress-Resilient males exhibit increased mGlu5 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex. Here we sought to determine whether the same behavioral and genetic responses would be observed in female rats exposed to TMT. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to TMT for ten minutes, while Controls were exposed to an unscented environment. Anxiety and anhedonia were assessed 7-14 days later with elevated plus maze (EPM), acoustic startle response (ASR), light/dark box, and sucrose preference test. TMT-exposed females spent less time in the EPM open arms and exhibited greater startle amplitude, and reduced sucrose intake compared to Controls. Median split analyses conducted on EPM and sucrose intake yielded phenotypes that displayed behavior in the light/dark box consistent with EPM and sucrose testing. Unlike male Susceptible rats, female Susceptible rats showed no freezing when re-exposed to the TMT context, nor did Resilient female rats present elevated BLA mGlu5 mRNA levels. Instead, Susceptible females had greater BLA mGlu5 than Resilient or Control rats. This work indicates that, as in humans, rats exhibit sex-dependent responses to stress. This translational animal model may provide insight into how females are uniquely affected by PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine release at the time of a predicted aversive outcome causally controls the trajectory and expression of conditioned behavior</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundThe inability to predict when aversive stimuli will and will not occur in is a hallmark of anxiety and stress disorders. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is sufficient and necessary for aversive learning and has been linked to both anxiety and stress disorder symptomatology. Thus, understanding how dopamine controls associative learning in response to aversive stimuli is critical to understanding the role of dopamine in behavior in health and disease.

MethodsUsing an optical dopamine sensor combined with in-vivo fiber photometry in the NAc core of male and female C57BL/6J mice (N=38), we recorded dopamine responses to expected and omitted aversive outcomes during learning. We derived predictions from a theory-driven model of associative learning (Kutlu-Calipari-Schmajuk, KCS model) and tested the causality of these predictions using optogenetics.

ResultsDopamine release was evoked by the predicted omission of aversive stimuli in a fashion that cannot be explained by dopamine as a reward-based prediction signal. The magnitude of the dopamine response during omissions scaled with predictions about the probability of their occurrence; however, dopamine did not track the associative value of predictive cues. Finally, we showed that the observed effects are causal to learned behavior and can only be explained by dopamine signaling the perceived saliency of predicted aversive events.

ConclusionsWe elucidate the role of NAc core dopamine signaling in aversive learning in a theory-based and stimulus-specific fashion and offer potential avenues for understanding the neural mechanisms involved in anxiety and stress disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-dependent choice and evaluation in real-world consumer behavior</a></h4>

              
                A body of work spanning neuroscience, economics, and psychology indicates that decisionmaking is context-dependent, which means that the value of an option depends not only on the option in question, but also on the other options in the choice set--or the  context. While context effects have been observed primarily in small-scale laboratory studies with tightly constrained, artificially constructed choice sets, it remains to be determined whether these context effects take hold in real-world choice problems, where choice sets are large and decisions driven by rich histories of direct experience. Here, we investigate whether valuations are context-dependent in real-world choice by analyzing a large restaurant rating dataset (Yelp.com) as well as two independent replication datasets which provide complementary operationalizations of restaurant choice. We find that users make fewer ratings-maximizing choices in choice sets with higher-rated options--a hallmark of context-dependent choice-- and that post-choice restaurant ratings also varied systematically with the ratings of unchosen restaurants. Furthermore, in a follow-up laboratory experiment using hypothetical choice sets matched to the real-world data, we find further support for the idea that subjective valuations of restaurants are scaled in accordance with the choice context, providing corroborating evidence for a general mechanistic-level account of these effects. Taken together, our results provide a potent demonstration of context-dependent choice in real-world choice settings, manifesting both in decisions and subjective valuation of options.

	<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) signifies a serious worldwide concern to public health. Both transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells synergize the progression of infection in host, which may exacerbate symptoms and/or progression of other chronic diseases such as Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Oxidative stress is a well-known cause of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress observed in both SARS-CoV-2 and PD. In the current study, we aimed to explore the influence of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) stress pathway under SARS-CoV-2-mediated infection and in human cell model of PD. Furthermore, we investigated whether they are interconnected and if the ER stress inhibitors could inhibit cell death and provide cellular protection. To achieve this aim, we have incorporated in silico analysis obtained from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a literature review and laboratory data. The neurotoxin, 6-hydroxy dopamine (6OHDA), was used to mimic the biochemical and neuropathological characteristics of PD by inducing oxidative stress in dopamine-containing neurons differentiated from ReNVM cell line (dDCNs). Furthermore, we explored if ER stress influences activation of caspases-2, -4 and -8 in SARS-CoV-2 and in stressed dDCNs. Our laboratory data using Western blot, immunocytochemistry and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analyses indicated that 6OHDA-induced toxicity triggered activation of caspases-2, 4 and -8 in dDCNs. Under SARS-CoV-2 infection of different cell types, GSEA revealed cell-specific sensitivities to oxidative and ER stresses. Cardiomyocytes and type II alveolar epithelial-like cells were more vulnerable to oxidative stress than neural cells. On the other side, only cardiomyocytes activated the unfolded protein response, however, the PERK pathway was operative in both cardiomyocytes and neural cells. In addition, caspase-4 activation by a SARS-CoV-2 was observed via in silico analyses. These results demonstrate that the ER stress pathway under oxidative stress in SARS-CoV-2 and PD are interconnected using diverse pathways. Furthermore, our results using the ER stress inhibitor and caspase specific inhibitors provided cellular protection suggesting that the use of specific inhibitors can provide effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 and PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Alpha blocking and 1/fβ spectral scaling in resting EEG can be accounted for by a sum of damped alpha band oscillatory processes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rick Evertz, Damien G. Hicks, David T. J. Liley</p>

The dynamical and physiological basis of alpha band activity and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise in the EEG are the subject of continued speculation. Here we conjecture, on the basis of empirical data analysis, that both of these features may be economically accounted for through a single process if the resting EEG is conceived of being the sum of multiple stochastically perturbed alpha band damped linear oscillators with a distribution of dampings (relaxation rates). The modulation of alpha-band and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise activity by changes in damping is explored in eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting state EEG. We aim to estimate the distribution of dampings by solving an inverse problem applied to EEG power spectra. The characteristics of the damping distribution are examined across subjects, sensors and recording condition (EC/EO). We find that there are robust changes in the damping distribution between EC and EO recording conditions across participants. The estimated damping distributions are found to be predominantly bimodal, with the number and position of the modes related to the sharpness of the alpha resonance and the scaling (<i>β</i>) of the power spectrum (1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup>). The results suggest that there exists an intimate relationship between resting state alpha activity and 1/<i>f</i><sup>β</sup> noise with changes in both governed by changes to the damping of the underlying alpha oscillatory processes. In particular, alpha-blocking is observed to be the result of the most weakly damped distribution mode becoming more heavily damped. The results suggest a novel way of characterizing resting EEG power spectra and provides new insight into the central role that damped alpha-band activity may play in characterising the spatio-temporal features of resting state EEG.
